Uchuu Senkan Yamato: Kanketsu-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3072/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato__Kanketsu-hen,"['This film was touted as the final instalment in the Yamato saga, a space opera franchise that began in 1974 and had completed ten years. At this point, the Yamato crew had gone through so many adventures in space on the edge of peril that this one comes out as a relatively above-average adventure for them. Bringing back a beloved but long-dead character through some contrived means, only for the said character to give it up for his crew, also sets the story and its drama back in terms of plot.However, the film makes up for its problems by being one big space adventure,...with the epic action and scale it deserves: glorious space vistas, fantastic planets and spacecraft, and fantastic action sequences, all backed up by incredible animation that still looks great today and grand orchestral music that captures the intense atmosphere of the scenes. Even if the plot is rather average, this film provides a wonderful spectacle to see.In the end the film marks a grand finale to the original Yamato show; it would later undergo a remake in 2012. The film does the Yamato saga great credit and honor, and it’s an enjoyable watch for any fan of Yamato or space operas. with the epic action and scale it deserves: glorious space vistas, fantastic planets and spacecraft, and fantastic action sequences, all backed up by incredible animation that still looks great today and grand orchestral music that captures the intense atmosphere of the scenes.

Usavich,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3737/Usavich,"[""Well, I think most people will think there's something wrong with me giving Usavich such a high score. But I really did enjoy it XD It IS a pretty original series. [haha]Evidently, this series REQUIRES suspension of disbelief for one to actually enjoy it. So if one does take the content of the show seriously, it's completely very nonsensical. Basically just don't take anything this show has staidly and you'd enjoy it.Two rabbits, Kirenenko and Putin, are stuck inside a Soviet prison. Basically it's poking fun at the Soviet Union if you know even a small amount of Communist history. Overall most episodes can be...boiled down to this: Putin gets into some harebrained trouble. Kirenenko ignores Putin's problem and reads his sneaker magazine. In some way Putin's trouble pisses Kirenenko off. Kirenenko beats the enemy up. End of story. Now watch how this is reused for the rest of this series! [haha]Cons:The are was nice, but there were a lot of reused motion data. [ E.g. Putin imagines getting his head sliced off parts] D: It gets better in the next seasons though. But it was pretty good overall!The music that plays in the beginning of every episode is beaten to death even in the seasons that follow it. I really hated that; it was catchy before the 10th time it was played.Pros:The story itself was pure genius. Epic funny if you didn't get my rant above the con section. owoIt was really hilarious how they exaggerated the double act. And the pure randomness of the characters is just another epic win! [haha]All in all, I personally thought it was great. Once again, a lot of people take this show too seriously, which isn't the way you're supposed to watch comedies like Usavich. I do highly recommend watching this if you have time to spare or just need something to make you laugh :3 boiled down to this: Putin gets into some harebrained trouble.

There's nothing serious about this series. The ones who will enjoy this are the ones who don't expect too much seriousness from a series.The humor is awesome. I can't stop laughing. Because this series is sooo stupid.It's a great series for you to enjoy with a cup of tea...... well not exactly, except if you want to burst it.The art is so classic, typical ordinary animation, don't...compare it to Disney Pixar's stunning and mindblowing art, please.And the story itself is original.Nothing much to say about the series. But if you want to kill time and kill some stress, go and watch it. compare it to Disney Pixar's stunning and mindblowing art, please.And the story itself is original.Nothing much to say about the series.

I say adequate for there was no question room for improvement. For example the door that got destroyed. For awhile it remained destroyed only to suddenly appear fixed? Why? How? I suppose once again viewer determination is left to fill in the blanks.One positive aspect in regard to the story was the ending portray. Not only was the ending slightly surprising but went along with the idea of season three's cover shot. Kudos for being accurate.One negative aspect was originality. Some moments when...making a show are bad and good. If you are lucky you get a popular positive aspect. Such example in show was a dance routine by one of the main characters. It was kind of catchy and the music that accompanied it made it even more so. However, they wore it into the ground because how much time spent recycling it.Art- still drawn digitally. making a show are bad and good. If you are lucky you get a popular positive aspect.

It is the type of show that you have to go into very open minded and not expecting anything serious. If you even try to take any of the short 1:30 episodes seriously then you will not enjoy the quirkiness of Usavich.--STORY 6/10--There is no real 'story' per say to Usavich, it is just two rabbits in a prison going about they activities throughout each day. There is no offical dialouge but there is no required. The characters appear to be working towards a goal but they themselves care much and neither do the viewers watching it need to...care. It's just fun and so stupidly funny.--ART 5/10--The art is your typical animation style, not anime style but Disney Pixar style. It is not too mind blowing but the colours and small setting make the animation not really take toll.--SOUND 6/10--The sound effects are quite intruging, they are often not actually fitting to the situation occuring which makes it funnier. As I said previously, there is no real dialouge but the small sound effects add enough to scenes.--CHARACTER 7/10--The characters are very interesting. Kirenenko is a rabbit who only cares about sneakers and is very easily aggrevated especially when it is involving Putin, his cell mate who seems to lead quite a simple life day to day in the cell. The simple dynamic of these two opposing characters creates hilarious situations and that is all the series needs.--ENJOYMENT 7/10--Usavich made me laugh a lot and I watched the whole series in one sitting as it is such short and easy to watch episodes. Each one made me laugh at a different stupid thing and it was such an easy watch as it wasn't serious and gave me time to chill whilst having a laugh.--OVERALL 7/10--In general, Usavich is just a fun, stupid non-stressful serious that lets you relax and have a laugh with these two funny characters who create the most senseless situations. care.

Tesagure! Bukatsumono Spin-off Purupurun Sharumu to Asobou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28835/Tesagure_Bukatsumono_Spin-off_Purupurun_Sharumu_to_Asobou,"['Since there were no reviews for this anime, I decided to write it.This is my first time writing a review, and English is my second language, don’t expect much from this.***For people who have not seen “Tesagure Bukatsumono”I’m pretty sure more than 80 percent of the people will look at the title, and think “WTF is this?”This is the spin-off of “Tesagure Bukatsumono” series. Tesagure means “find it by your hands”, and bukatsu is extracurricular activities. The word mono after that is just to make the word bukatsu look cooler, so forget about that. It’s not the disease. This Anime just talks about “What...ifs” for extracurricular activities every episode.Before you guys watch this, there are couple things you should know. First off, this is an anime where the voice actresses fool around, and make you laugh. And was all put into an anime afterwards. Half of what they’re talking about are nonsense girl’s talk, which are adlibs.Since the girls are talking one after another, sometimes they overlap and conflict with other people. Due to that reason, the subtitles doesn’t tell you everything. So if you want to really enjoy this, I would study Japanese and their culture. And what I mean by their culture, the jokes they make sometimes will be things that are popular in Japan right now, and they try to make a parody out of it.The animation style has horrible computer graphics, since the animation is not important.Oh, you should watch Tesagure Bukatsumono first season, since it’s shorter in length with 11 miutes, when this spin-off is 24 minutes long. (Wow I can’t believe the spin-off is longer than the original.) And then, think over if this anime is good enough to take your time.***For people who have seen “Tesagure Bukatsumono”They added 5 more characters of adaption from a nonpopular manga series.And this time, they don’t talk about extracurricular activities, but tries new things. Some are really hilarious like when they play the werewolf game, which is popular in Japan.They added:Mikami, Shiori (Yuruyuri: Akari, Attack on Titan: Krista Lenz)Takamori, Natsumi (Sakurasou:Kamiigusa Misaki, Another:Misaki Mei) wow misakisOokubo, Rumi (Acchi Kocchi:Tsumiki, Yuruyuri:Chinatsu)Uesaka, Sumire (Chuunibyou:Dekomori, The idolmaster Cinderella girls:Anastasia)Komatsu, Mikako (Teenage romance comedy SNAFU: Totsuka, Nisekoi:Tsugumi Seishirou).Its not the same as the series before, but it is still good, that I looked forward to it every week.But just telling you guys, the story in the end of each episode is not good, so you can skip those. ifs” for extracurricular activities every episode.Before you guys watch this, there are couple things you should know.

Tenjou Tenge,https://myanimelist.net/anime/174/Tenjou_Tenge,"[""What a waste of time.  I picked up this anime because I had read most of the manga, and was interested in seeing the characters of the manga brought to life.  However, the anime did NOT  bring the manga to life... it killed it.This anime is best left on the shelf in the store, unless all you want to see is big boobs and panty shots, because, basically, that\\'s what the anime comes down to.  The story and plot are all over the place and does NOT follow the manga at all.  There is no resolution, and you\\'re left at...the end of the series with just a \\&quot;WTF??!!!??\\&quot; type of feeling.The only thing I did like about this anime was the opening song.  Other than that, it\\'s not worth it.  I honestly wish I could have the time back I spent watching this rubble.  Read the manga... avoid the anime.  That is all I can say. the end of the series with just a \\&quot;WTF??!!!??\\&quot; type of feeling.The only thing I did like about this anime was the opening song.

That is all I can say."", ""Tenjou Tenge a typical shounen anime that takes all the concepts that worked well in other shounen anime and puts it into a High School setting. Tenjo Tenge is basically about two delinquent boys; Souichiro and Bob who enter a school hoping to take it over, like their previous schools but problems occur and then the story turns into a quest to become stronger. Even though this plot (to become stronger) is not the least bit original, the story does become very interesting when it reaches the extremely long flashback, revealing a lot about certain characters. However soon after this flashback arc the story finishes,...leaving a lot of questions unanswered and half the story untold.This isn't the only downfall of this anime. The animation quality is okay for the most part although for an anime with plenty of fighting, the quality of the fights is sub-standard. Instead of transforming the intense fights from the manga into fluid animation, all that's produced are static images of impact that just looked like a page straight out from the manga, which is definitely below the level of animation of it's time. If more effort was put into the numerous fight scenes then I would have given it a much better score.The music ranges between really bad and sublime. There are times when the music is so great, with string instrumentals making the average fight seem more intense. Then there are moments when the music is just plain awful, like the deafening ending theme song &quot;Ashite ne moto&quot;.Overall this anime did a great job in adapting the superb manga story however it only told half the story, leaving major plot changes and character developments untold. The way it chose to end was poor, with an extremely stupid finale which followed a sad and exciting episode&hellip; bad idea. If only this anime does the same thing as others like Full Metal Panic, and make a sequel that looks 10x better than the original.

First off, I did not read the manga, so I can't comment on that, but for the most part this anime was really good. The story to me was relatively coherent and intriguing. The authors did a great job in intertwining all the main characters into the main plot giving each character a pretty good background story. The first episode in my opinion is just what I needed to really get me fired up. It was exciting and the fight scenes were well done....The art was exaggerated but who cares they weren&rsquo;t to the point of being hentai and it brought some uniqueness to the series. And I don&rsquo;t think the anime would have worked well without the exaggerated breasts and curvy waist lines it made the fight scenes that much more fun, not because I'm a guy, but because its not the types of character models you see everyday in this particular genre.The intro song was a little corny at first but some how I got really into it after the first couple of episodes and it grew on me. I actually ended up downloading it, it was well worth it. The ending song was quite good also, while the BGM was just okay.There is quite a bit of character development throughout the series while the storyline progresses. Each and every character comes to some sort of epiphany throughout the series whether it be simply finding a reason to fight or to find a way to maintain ones family ties, or accepting ones fate.For this anime's respective length and genre it was very enjoyable. However, one major flaw was the ending it was to open ended while nothing was really resolved. Frustrating enough it had me believing there would be a 2nd season of course there wasn't.Overall, I would rate this anime at least a B because for being an anime that I myself must admit was not to interested in at first, but I was pleasantly surprised. A similar anime series to this was Kenichi which received a higher score but seemed to long to grab my interest. If I ever get around to watching it I'll be sure to write another review.

But the support characters became the main characters and the main characters became the support characters. 90% of this anime revolves around flash backs about Maya and Aya Natsumi's older brother Shin Natsumi. The fight scenes were epic i must say, story wise. No. There is no character development and for around 10+ episodes is straight flash backs which really bothered me because there was NOTHING on Souichirou Nagi and Bob, they kept getting their asses...beat, no character development. And they were barely even involved in this anime. beat, no character development. And they were barely even involved in this anime."", 'The beginning of this series was good up to the point where it showed nothing but constant flash backs. This left no time to further advance the plot thoroughly. Instead after the flash backs they used the remaining 2 - 3 episodes to summarize the plot of the story. If this anime series was around 50 episodes it could have been good.  I honestly would rather drink a bottle of iodine filled with glass shards than watch this crappy ass anime again.P.S.: For those who are interested you should check out the manga. i hear from several people that it was way better than...this pile of crap! this pile of crap!', ""What can I say about Tenjou tenge?Positively, not a lot.Negatively, plenty.I had some high expectations from this anime when I started watching. I was out for a good fighting anime with some class to it.Tenjou unfortunately fell very short of the mark for numerous reasons.The story was very average as were the characters for the following reasons :The reason for revenge is completely biased and stupid and you EVEN find her working together with the person she wants revenge against. WTF right?...The characters apart from Bob & Bunsichi were very plain,boring,egotisticalunrational & drop dead annoying.Sisters fighting over the most trivial thing.The main character was one of those ***hole types, not to mention egotistical & IMO not even interesting. Basically you would be pushing yourself to like him even as a villain.The ending was awful & I was left with the choice of painstakingly watching another 2 ova eps.... I chose not to.There was also one other thing that comes straight to mind & that was the fact that over half of the eps were infact what we all hate the most. Yes, you have it FLASHBACKS.On a more positive note I liked the art to the show. It wasn't top quality but it seemed to suit the anime in general.So my overall score goes like this.Story : 2/10Art : 7/10Sound : 6/10Character : 4Enjoyment: 2And so as a final score I will go with a big,whopping :3 The characters apart from Bob & Bunsichi were very plain,boring,egotisticalunrational & drop dead annoying.Sisters fighting over the most trivial thing.The main character was one of those ***hole types, not to mention egotistical & IMO not even interesting.

From what i read on the synopsis and how the first couple episodes goes, if this anime progressed more fluently it would have easily gotten a 9 or 10 from me. It starts out wit a pretty dang good storyline but it then just about stops everything just to show past events. I mean don't get me wrong a background ep here or there is great but when they take more then half the season for flashback episodes it got really annoying. Then they never really show...the main character progress. It just spurt from one point of power to the next.  It had all the good makings for a superb anime but it fell way short of my expectations at the end the main character progress. It just spurt from one point of power to the next.

Let me start off by saying that I came into this series with exceptionally low expectations, I mean I was expecting turd quality stuff based off of the reviews I read so I thought maybe I don’t need to review this…I WAS SO WRONG! This series can’t even be called turd quality this is the equivalent of a girl going to her high school prom and getting maiimed by a highschool mascot/lion. This series is the epitome of absolute failure in both execution and satisfaction.Story- If this series had stuck with something and went with it...would have been great, had it a logical ending it could’ve been good, and had it focused on the main characters of the story it would’ve been excellent but it didn’t and in place left a stinky pile of dissatisfaction, disappointment, and disarray; everything to make this series good was there the damn writers just couldn’t seem to overcome their handicap of lack of brains and put the damn thing together. For a good analogy lets say your dad buys you a knew car and tells you to get a drivers license so you can go for a ride in it...you get a license to drive a motorcycle rent a boat and row to a middle of a lake where you then proceed to make driving sounds with your mouth as you rock said boat back and forth before lighting it a flame and swimming back to shore. Damnit how did they mess this upArt- The art was good a few minor mistakes here and there but other than that pretty well drawn. The animation was good the only things that really bothered me was 1 the way the legs were drawn and 2 the animation sequences for “special attack” moves.Sound- I can’t really get on them too much about sound I liked the voice acting although occasionally I have to call corny animation sound 3 and 4.Character- OMG this is what pisses me off the most about this freaking series who in the hell develops the character and story for characters that are not the main characters how much of a freaking idiot do you have to be to mess this up. I knew more about characters that were dead or side characters than I ever did about the main characters and you have to admit that’s just sad on many different levels.Enjoyment- The first three episodes got me excited I was expecting something good after it then all of a sudden in a tidal wave of useless waste it was all messed and it became number 2 on my list of most hated animes that I have ever forced myself to sit down and freaking watch to the end.Overall- For the love of whatever you praise avoid this anime series, AVOID IT LIKE THE FREAKING PLAGUE. Read the manga I’ve heard good things about the manga but DON’T WATCH THIS SERIES this applies especially to those of you thinking of watching it after having read the manga JUST DON’T DO IT. Trust me I will have saved you somewhere around ten hours of dissatisfaction and disappointment.

The problems with series stem from the fact that it abruptly ends at the conclusion of the first arc of the manga, which is about the 8th volume. The manga is on it's 21st volume and is still going.This leads to issues such as half the series being a big flashback  (there's a big flashback to explain everything that's going on in the the present, and the anime literally ends RIGHT after the story returns to the present), characters seeming to be bland and one dimensional because...the anime ends before the story gets around to developing them(Bob and Masakata from what I've heard), and the series just ending with a crapton of unanswered questions because Oh! Great didn't right Tenjou Tenge in a way that you can just stop where the anime did.Story: The story isn't super unique, and suffers from an abrupt ending long before the heart of the plot really gets a chance to get going.Art: The fight scenes were entertaining and rather creative in that you couldn't just throw in two random characters and have the fight end up looking largely the same. Characters felt like they had unique skills and attributes that made combat interesting.Character: There aren't any terribly locked in archetypes for any characters, and many do see growth and development. Sadly, this is again limited by the show ending at the first arc.Enjoyment: The most entertainment comes from the fight scenes. Rather creative group of abilities amongst the cast, main characters can never just hammer their to victory, but need to outskill them. That, and the show can be a tad funny at times.Overall: Don't get me, I'm not saying Tenjou Tenge is bad. I know that this isn't the first anime to be made of an incomplete manga, and it won't be the last. It's just that most anime either stop at a point where some sort of resolution has been reached for what is currently going on, or make some up of their own. Tenjou Tenge just stops one day, and... that's it. It starts interesting, got me all interested and stuff, then just up and leaves.

It does give us a clear view on how they come and why, but why do it 18+ episode to cover up on the 26 episode. They could a least shorten the plot, make it easy to understand and further it to the real fight. But Madhouse just have to pick the Past Chapter as the main plot of this anime.

A flashback is one episode MAX! Not a entire arc. The writers could have just started the story in the past and jumped to the future or made the past chapters a movie or ova, but instead two massive flahsbacks, two really two? I felt this show had cool characters and cool fighting, but if that's all a show has then it's a bad show.  The one thing I liked was that the main character got his ass kicked a lot that was amusing. Perhaps that's why I kept watching. So if you like a show that...takes large ventures into the past and doesn't really take feelings or proper motivation into consideration then watch this show, and if you want to watch a show where people run around spouting move names like they didn't punch the other guys ears so hard he can no longer hear anything then then by all means, but I'll stick to a show with a foundation based in a reality not pseudo- reality. Recap: if you're writing a show watch this show so you can learn how not to use a flashback, and make you're main character lose a bit to make things more interesting. I'm not a hard man to please look at my anime list, but when I see something bad I like to warn others. takes large ventures into the past and doesn't really take feelings or proper motivation into consideration then watch this show, and if you want to watch a show where people run around spouting move names like they didn't punch the other guys ears so hard he can no longer hear anything then then by all means, but I'll stick to a show with a foundation based in a reality not pseudo- reality.

Thats my opinion on things, i don't know if it's because i have a sensitive ear but thats my opinion on the matter.Characters: 6/10Oh the characters, this is the part i wanted to emphasize on. First off, the main characters were quite active and well described in the begining of the anime but near the middle until the end its just mostly flashbacks which gets really long and i find takes away all the fun of the anime. There literally stalled there for half of the anime talking about the story of two years ago. It probably wouldn't matter if the anime was longer but for a 24 episode anime you just can't waste half of it on flashbacks.Enjoyment: 6/10I can say that i pretty much enjoyed the anime. Even though i got pretty bored at alot of parts. Wouldn't say its a bad anime thoug.Overall i guess i give this anime a 6/10. If it was longer and had more action then i would probably be more into it but for the length that its at now i just can't say i liked it so much. really into the old styles of animes from the 90's so this anime was quite good for me.

It has the makings of an epic fighting anime, including awesome fighting scenes and tons of blood and some gore. It has insanely powerful characters with a ton of diversity. There is romance, intense hatred, crazy plots and interesting character development for most of the main characters (though a few characters don't have much development and fall into stereotypes.) The problem with the anime is it's story is drawn out. More than half of the anime is flash backs to a different set of characters (though some are common) that leave you wondering who...the main characters are. Also, the last episode was REALLY different from the others and had too much comedy, breaking of meta (mentioning things like the amount of screen time characters got) and lacked a concrete ending. This anime may have left a lot to be desired, but it made me want to read the manga, so I guess mission accomplished for the writers of the anime.Story: 6/10One of the weaker elements. You are introduced to Masataka and think he will be your main character. It turns out, he is actually a very minor character who is rarely taken seriously and becomes the but of several jokes by the end. Maybe this is just me but the fact that he was introduced first made him into the character I liked and sympathized with and the fact that he turned out to be disappointing was a huge turn off.Also, the story is basically insane. There is so much going on, so many characters and flash backs and plots that by the end there were at least 4 or 5 plot points I was confused over. I have heard the manga goes into far more depth and I plan on reading it, but the anime was a bit of a confusing adaptation.Art: 7/10I liked the art design. The animations were bright in some instances and dark and haunting in others. It is nice to see such interesting and vibrant character art (I really liked Bob and how he was a-typical) and I think the art overall was solid.Sound: 8/10This will come across weird but the sound was one of my favorite parts. The OST is solid, and a few pieces of the score (especially the emotional pieces) really enhanced the mood. The general fighting sounds were very realistic and I thought that the sound greatly enhanced the experience and more than once had me directly noticing it and praising it to myself.Character: 7/10This is tricky. Some characters, such as Maya, Shin and several others get great development. Other characters get a fair amount that leaves their motives a bit in question and a handful get almost no development and come across as stereotypical good or bad. There is enough here to really draw you into some of the characters and bring them to life, and those points are done extremely well. On the other hand, when other characters pale in comparison it becomes painful obvious (Bob is one you don't get a lot of detail about which sucks because he is pretty cool).Enjoyment: 6/10From the 3rd or 4th episode on, I could tell my man Masataka wasn't the MC, and I just couldn't get into the story as much as I'd like. The switching back and forth between the past and the present made me a bit frustrated and I got stalled a few times during the past arcs just waiting for the future arc to come back into play. Perhaps if they had done more flashbacks for only an episode at a time instead of 5+ episode flashbacks it would have been better.Overall: 6/10There was a ton of potential here that I feel was wasted. The story and character development had high points but also very low points, and the use of flashbacks was frustrating to say the least. I don't regret watching the anime, and plan to read the manga as a result, but I was just left with a feeling of disappointment that this could have been a 9 or 10/10 anime if it had been handled differently. the main characters are.

But how can I compare the manga to the anime considering I haven’t read the manga and from what I know, the manga was still running at the time after the anime was...finished and the manga was finished printing in August 2010……6 years after the anime adaptation. Let’s just get into the plot summary.Souchirou Nagi and Bob Makihara (also named the Knuckle Bomb) are two delinquents who arrive at Toudou Academy with the objective of ruling over the school with their strength. But on their first day, they encountered the Jyuken Club, a martial arts group of the school. Members of the group, Maya Natsume, her sister Aya, and Masataka Takayanagi easily overpowered Souchirou and Bob. And what\'s more, due to what was assumed to be their ""connections"" with the Jyuken Club, the two were attacked by members of the Enforcement Group, which oversees the martial arts groups of the school. Drawn into the personal conflicts between Jyuken Club and the Enforcement Group, Souchirou and Bob have no choice but to join up with Maya Natsume\'s group and to hone their skills to become even stronger.Before I began to watch this series, I did not know that it had some fan service and ecchi moments on there and believe me, if you drink any time you see panty shots when the ladies are fighting, you will get fucked up. Most of the fights in the anime are not exactly animated well. It is mostly stilted fight stills and throws and sure the animation background looks pretty but still for a fighting anime, the fights are not that exciting. Plus, you notice that every female character on this show has……well, guess?Not that I’m complaining but two things: 1) this is a much exaggerated design on the female characters. Sure, this is to appease the fan service crowd but I think they have a bit of more variety. 2) No love for the booty lovers. We like them, too. Also, I think the plotline about the past of Shin Natsume, Maya & Aya’s brother, should have had more focus in the beginning rather than in the middle where everything would’ve been more organized and not as confusing.For characters, I think the show Bleach has been somewhat of an influence despite Tenjho Tenge (manga - 1999-2010) being released earlier before Bleach (manga – 2001-2012) so that means Tenjho Tenge was the predecessor of everything that the first season of Bleach was before it got too annoying. Also, I think most of the English voice actors in Bleach were in this show or at least two that I recognize.Music wise, the series’ opening theme is m.c.A.T\'s ""Bomb A Head!"" and while it can corny at first, it’s an enjoyable and quotable song, and by quotable I meant the “Bomb A Head” part of the song. The rest of the music is pretty average for a shounen anime and the ending sequence is pretty awkward and weird to watch, especially the background art of the sequence.FINAL VERDICT: While this show has mostly the same flaws as Ikki Tousen, I find this more enjoyable than that. Most of the characters in the show are likable (and some are pretty damn stupid), especially Bob & Chiaki – my favorite characters, and they don’t irritate me too much. This is also what I consider a guilty pleasure for me like how much I enjoy the movie Shoot ‘Em Up. But I think if you wanted more fights and uncensored content, then read the manga and this is coming from a guy who went in completely unknown of the manga. finished and the manga was finished printing in August 2010……6 years after the anime adaptation.

If i should start whith the story it dragged me in some episodes but than it just fell a bit apart for me. I dont know what it was but it was dragged a bit too long and that is ok for me if anime series are being dragged a bit long, but than again it must be interesting and this was not very interesting for me. As i said before i was looking for fighting in this and it got...some ok fighting they was a bit too short for me at times. And i love brutality in this kind of anime and it was not much of that. Not enough blood for my kind and when the fighting did not make up for it and the story did not it got a bit boring after a good time. I thought i could finish this series but i stopped at 19. And now then for some of the good things so i am not getting killed by the fans of this series hehe ;-P I know all i said about it that was negative from my point of view many others love that sort of things. But the voice acting was ok and the story dragged me in for some time and could have matched realy well for me but it did not. The characters was ok and i dont have any problems with the fan service in anime, and that is couse i thik that some fan service splice up the show a bit nothing that damages the anime at all (if it's not too much ofcourse). The art was very nice nothing to say against that for this type of anime. And the last comment from me on this is that i was expecting good fighting, and i did not expect the story to be all good so that was not a big shock, i wanted a bit more blood for the fighting maybe and that's it for me. some ok fighting they was a bit too short for me at times.

It has been broadcast on Japanese television since Apr 2, 2004 to Sep 17, 2004. Its producers are Asashi TV and its studio is Madhouse, which has many other strong titles at the moment. The genres of this anime are Action, Ecchi, Martial Arts, Comedy, Super Power, School, Shounen. Each episode is about 23 minutes long and it is recommended for people over 17 (violence & profanity).STORYThe story contains a lot of comedy, very good fight scenes and somehow not so badly fitting pervert scenes. There are a few things I didn't like. Half of the anime goes into stories...about the past and there is no trace of the main characters Nagi Souichirou and Makihara Bob. This is a minus for me because I got used to them and wanted to see more of their development. Nagi Souichirou's strength was quite overwhelmed. He managed to become so strong in negative time and I didn’t see enough of his progress through training. I think there was a lot more room for this character to develop, but it was wasted. Another thing I couldn't see was Makihara Bob's strength. I see him training, I hear him being told he will get stronger, but we never see him in action for unexplained reasons. In my opinion, they developed the story about the past better than the story for the main characters.ART AND SOUNDAs I mentioned in the information, the anime is from 2004. I've never seen an anime so old and with such good art. The characters and everything is drawn very well. Keep in mind this is my personal opinion.  The sound is perfect like any other anime I've seen. I'm talking about Japanese audio, not English.CHARACTERSI like how motivated Nagi, Souichirou was at the beginning and how much he wanted to get stronger, but in the end he was piled too fast and that repelled me from him. I've already said what I miss about Makihara Bob, so I don't think I'll repeat it. A character who has developed to his full potential is Natsume Maya. I see her past, I see her present. This is how a complete character in an anime should look like. Natsume Aya is a character we understand very well in the present, but we know nothing about her from the past. What she did while her brother was alive, what she did after he died, there is almost no information about her past. Another character I know nothing about from his past is Takayanagi Masataka. What is his relationship with his brother, with his father and in general what he did when he was little? Natsume Shin is a character who is very interesting. Even for the period of the episodes with the story of the past, he manages to be a complete character in a very interesting way. Deep thinking is required to understand Natsume Shin. The last character I want to talk about is Takayanagi Mitsuomi. Something I didn't understand about him was how he became the main villain, and also how his relationship with Maya ended.OVERALL ENOJYMENTIn general, I liked the anime very much, until the moment when the story of the past began, then it got a little bit boring and in the end things were too crowded without seeing a real ending. Overall i will give it a 7/10. about the past and there is no trace of the main characters Nagi Souichirou and Makihara Bob.

Worst part of it was the mid-episode pauses and the intro / outro cinematics showing all the main characters... THAT I WASN\'T WATCHING THEM ANYMORE. The main character became the brother of the two sisters and his saga. And it wasn\'t just one episode. It dragged all the way to the end, to the point where I was like ""So why did they made the anime with two girls and two guys? Why couldn\'t they have made an anime with this guy, sadistically killing people"".

It dragged all the way to the end, to the point where I was like ""So why did they made the anime with two girls and two guys?

I bought the first two disks episodes one through seven and still loved it. But I never got around to finishing the series until now. And it feels like a total utter let down after all these years. Don\'t get me wrong the cast of Maya, Aya, Masataka, Bob & Souichiro are interesting and unique and are what make this series fun and sexy and action packed virtually everything one...can desire in an anime (unless one is vehemently demands anime be devoid of misogyny; then let me say this, ""is not the anime for you!""). It tell a coherent story and introduces a diverse cast of villains. The let down part comes with the amount of screen time the cast I fell in love with gets in the second act. The second act tells the story of the beef between Maya & Mitsuomi. Nothing wrong with the story or art it\'s just I\'ve had my fill of anime introducing cool and interesting characters and then spending half the series ignoring them.   <cough>CLAYMORE<cough>. And in this series there\'s no need for this non linear storytelling. Frell, the flashback takes so long I forgot Aya was a character in the series.It seems I\'m ranting about this sole complaint, but it\'s because I\'m tired of this in anime!Other than that and what some (but not me) would call misogyny; this series is good.

A four out of five.', ""I have not read the manga, but I must say that this anime was very disappointing.It starts off very well with likeable characters and some very interesting fights, but it starts going downhill quickly when it reaches the flashbacks. The story instantly stagnates and becomes less coherent. I couldn't even finish the series because it became unbearably unintersting.There are tons of much, much better anime out there and I've heard that the manga is a looooot better, so don't waste your time with this poorly put-together series.On a side note, the opening is pretty freakin awesome. "", 'Tenjou Tenge is an anime with teenage girls with enormous breasts and teenage guys with over developed muscles for their age doing gravity defying martial arts.The anime really comes in two parts. The first is actually quite entertaining. Souichiro and Bob,two tough guys, enter Toudou Academy with the intention of ruling the school and promptly get their arses kicked by the members of the Jouken Club (Maya, Aya and Masataka). Their conversation during their fight with the Jouken Club in the first episode is a classic:Maya tells Souchiro and Bob to stop in her chi / ki selfSouchiro: ""Bob there a weird little girl talking...all grown up what do you think should I do about this?"" and continues to beat someone upBob: ""I don\'t know!"" not paying attention whilst beating someoneMaya changes into her hot normal selfSouichiro: ""Bob if that weird little girl suddenly turns into a well stacked voluptuous chick you would normally see working in a sketchy night club, would should I do?"" looking shockedBob: ""Don\'t know"" still fighting and not paying attention.From then lots of martial arts, training and fighting, weird talk about chi / ki and reminiscing about the events which happened of all of 2 years ago.The second half enters the world of implausibility taking the first half into account this is quite something. It is one enormous flashback telling the story of what happened to Maya and Aya\'s brother Shin 2 years ago, how the Jouken Club was formed and the search of the one true martial artist. Despite the implausibility the main problem with the second half of Tenjou Tenge is that everything is explained in the first half the series so you know what happens.The animation isn\'t the best though Tenjou Tenge has a fun opening sequence and song with Maya, Aya, Masataka, Souichiro and Bob dancing to the music.Lastly pay close attention to episode 22 which has the Anti Jouken Club which includes a young Bruce Lee and a young Disco Stu from the Simpson\'s, yes you read right Disco Stu,DISCO STU KNOWS KUNG FU!!!!! all grown up what do you think should I do about this?"" and continues to beat someone upBob: ""I don\'t know!"" not paying attention whilst beating someoneMaya changes into her hot normal selfSouichiro: ""Bob if that weird little girl suddenly turns into a well stacked voluptuous chick you would normally see working in a sketchy night club, would should I do?"" looking shockedBob: ""Don\'t know"" still fighting and not paying attention.From then lots of martial arts, training and fighting, weird talk about chi / ki and reminiscing about the events which happened of all of 2 years ago.The second half enters the world of implausibility taking the first half into account this is quite something.

The art wasn't amazing and the characters weren't incredibly unique. Also, the fights sometimes left something to be desired. The flaunting of fan service was not appreciated on my part either. However, the bluntness of the plot was somewhat enjoyable. While a pair of guys that just go around picking fights, seems stupid. It brings a new type of story to the table. It may just be a lack of plot, but I found it refreshing.While Tenjou Tenge was nothing special it was still a pretty descent show in my eyes. It is...simply a beat 'em up anime. There was something about the show that kept my interest. I watched twenty episodes in one night and was never bored. I think the simple plot and tough guy attitudes just held and entertained me.There was one major problem I found with the show. It was that the characters in the flash back were much better than the actual ones. The show ended abruptly, but it was more like it ended with the telling of the back story. Since I liked those characters better, I thought it was fitting.It was just a shame that the entire show wasn't modified from the manga and made just about that group of people instead. simply a beat 'em up anime.

The show\'s vivid cast of characters were bright and nearly popped through the television screen, with their vivacity! It had cool fight scenes, pretty girls, unrequited love, dramatic backstories, etc. But, let\'s be real, I think I was mostly into it because I thought Maya Natsume was a total babe! While Tenjō Tenge\'s target demographic will most-likely be a teenage audience, who plays rounds of beat \'em up games with their siblings, ""Tenjō Tenge"" sets itself apart—with a cacophony of interesting narrative choices and entertaining character antics!⚠️ This review is spoiler-free ⚠️—Story/CharactersThis series starts...a basic high school, battle story—the first episode introduces a variety of very colorful characters, both figuratively and literally! It starts out with the protagonist, Sōichiro Nagi, and his friend, Bob Makihara, beating up several schools full of martial arts students—to forcefully climb their way to the top of the power-based hierarchy. But alas, they are met with two pretty sisters (Maya and Aya Natsume) and a demure brown-haired Japanese guy (Masataka Takayanagi); all of them are able to kick these tough guys\' butts, with ease! The younger sister, Aya, immediately falls in love with Sōichiro because he sees her naked, and proclaims that they\'re engaged.Obsessed with power because of being intensely bullied as a child, Sōichiro begs the older sister, Maya, to accept him as her disciple. She accepts, I guess because of the same reason that Aya dotes over him... main character privilege? The series picks up steam, with the increasingly intense opponents. And, indisputably, the most interesting part of the story is when Maya comes face-to-face with her ex-boyfriend, Mitsuomi Takayanagi—and their captivating origin story completely alters the tone of the show! I won\'t reveal what happens during the climax, that makes it so great, but a) there are far more interesting characters, who take center stage b) a tale of love, jealousy, and tragedy (of Shakespearean proportions) occurs, c) characters that are objectively good, are corrupted by spiritual possession and split between two warring factions; these nemeses will stop at nothing to prevail in the race of dominance, corruption, and mobster murders!Other than the captivating origin story, ""Tenjō Tenge"" can fall into some very generic tropes: girls wearing next-to-nothing and duking it out, motivated main character that wants to be the strongest, girls fawning over and giving special privileges to the main character for no reason, everything in the series (aside from the aforementioned side plot) can be seen in every other shōnen, action series! Characters that have an interesting aura like ※Bunshichi Tawara, Emi Isuzu, and Sōichiro\'s mother, Makiko Nagi, are given a backseat—in lieu of a less interesting cast. Maya Natsume is a complex character, too, but her best moments are when she\'s interacting with the people who knew Shin! Aya Natsume developing the accursed Dragon\'s Eye ability kept me on the edge of my seat, but the anime concluded before there was a chance to explore the developments that happened, later in that arc! I enjoyed ""Tenjō Tenge"" anime more than the ""Air Gear"" adaptation, but I think the plot in the former story had stronger female characters... whereas, I never felt an attachment to Ringo or Simca.※Best boy, along with Shin Natsune, who he has a bromance with!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Toshifumi Kawase (director, storyboard), notable works:* Bakuten Shoot Beyblade ✅* Bakuten Shoot Beyblade G Revolution* Chōja Raideen* Dead Heat* Dragon Drive* Eat-Man \'98* Genki Bakuhatsu Ganbaruger* Giant Killing* Ginga Hyōryū Vifam 13* Haō Taikei Ryū Knight* Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kaku: Outbreak ✅* Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei ✅* Nekketsu Saikyō Go-Saurer* Next Senki Ehrgeiz* Pita Ten* Shion no Ō* Ueki no Hōsoku* Zettai Muteki Raijin-Ō* Zettai Muteki Raijin-Ō (1992)Commentary: Mr. Kawase\'s aesthetic and style is filled with an abundance of cartoonish shots and wildly colorful colors; while I did enjoy his takes on the ""Higurashi no Naku Koro ni"" franchise, his approach was more campy, than actually creepy!Oh!

His highly-stylized characters stand apart from every other fighting or competition-based manga series, and thus, Mr. Ōgure is truly a very talented artist!I have watched Tenjō Tenge to completion twice. The first time was when I was a sophomore in high school and the second instance was a couple of years ago. The first time I watched it all with the English dub and the most recent time was with the Japanese dub.

Ms. Hisakawa has a sultry, older woman voice and can create an air of mystique around any character that she\'s assigned to, see Yuki Sōma in ""Fruits Basket"" as an example of this! She is an S-tier seiyū talent, incredible work on the character of Maya!Other notable seiyū talents: Shin\'ichirō Miki (Kaiki Deishū in the ""Monogatari"" series and Kojirō, or ""James"" from ""Pokémon""), Tomokazu Seki (Gilgamesh in ""Fate/stay night"" and Tōya Kinomoto, or ""Tory"" from ""Cardcaptor Sakura""), and Yuri Amano (Kiyone Makiba in ""Tenchi Muyō!"").Conclusively, ""Tenjō Tenge"" isn\'t the best series ever, but I would give it a try, if you enjoyed the dueling dynamics in Ranma ½, and you want that slice of pie with a side of ""ecchi"" and a subplot that is largely more seinen than the shōnen battle antics, at the beginning! If you\'re a fan of great sakuga scenes, there\'s a segment, at the end of Episode 12: Darkness, that is both hilarious and a treat for the eyes!

Ms. Hisakawa has a sultry, older woman voice and can create an air of mystique around any character that she\'s assigned to, see Yuki Sōma in ""Fruits Basket"" as an example of this! She is an S-tier seiyū talent, incredible work on the character of Maya!Other notable seiyū talents: Shin\'ichirō Miki (Kaiki Deishū in the ""Monogatari"" series and Kojirō, or ""James"" from ""Pokémon""), Tomokazu Seki (Gilgamesh in ""Fate/stay night"" and Tōya Kinomoto, or ""Tory"" from ""Cardcaptor Sakura""), and Yuri Amano (Kiyone Makiba in ""Tenchi Muyō!"").Conclusively, ""Tenjō Tenge"" isn\'t the best series ever, but I would give it a try, if you enjoyed the dueling dynamics in Ranma ½, and you want that slice of pie with a side of ""ecchi"" and a subplot that is largely more seinen than the shōnen battle antics, at the beginning! If you\'re a fan of great sakuga scenes, there\'s a segment, at the end of Episode 12: Darkness, that is both hilarious and a treat for the eyes! I give Tenjō Tenge and the ""Ultimate Fight"" OVA a 5/10!Rankings:Tenjō Tenge (TV) ★★☆☆☆Tenjō Tenge: The Ultimate Fight (OVA) ★★★☆☆', 'Tenjou Tenge is one of the BEST anime I\'ve seen. To start this off, souichiro is a street fighter who has come to a martial arts academy to kick everybody\'s ass. However, in their first fight  souichiro got beaten up by a ""kid"" who transformed into a really attractive lady and was then later  randomly engaged with the ""kid""\'s little sister. However, souichiro loves maya (kid) while maya\'s little sister aya loves souichiro. Aya presues souichiro throughout the series while souichiro fights the reinforcers (people who keep the martial arts academy in control, the leader of the reinforcers is maya\'s ex-boyfriend). Then the...story sorta splits into two, where one story follows maya and her past while the other about the present.The story was very well done. It was somewhat confusing in the middle, and there was like an ""almost"" new cast in the story; which took up about half of the anime series (24 episodes + 2 OVA +1 movie). But I actually like the past story better than the present, it seemed more interesting. But in this anime there is quite a bit of ecchiness which I thought was sort of disturbing and there were quite alot of beat up/ bloody scenes. It turned out that I gave the story an 8/10The art was quite detailed, the art was so well done that in one of the depressing scenes, i cried my eyes out, and yes it was very SAD! The art is totally worth a 10/10The sound was quite suitable for the anime so that left it with a 9/10I really have nothing to say about character, it was absolutely AMAZING!! A true 10/10I enjoyed it quite alot, there were many joyful and funny scenes and there were many serious and sad scenes. I\'d recommend it to almost anybody over 15 (due to some inappropiate scenes) and shounen fans!Hope my review helped! ^.^ story sorta splits into two, where one story follows maya and her past while the other about the present.The story was very well done.

After a closer look, one could think that this is the show about fights and busty characters – however, it is far from such understanding. The story is about Souichiro and Bob, two delinquents who initiate a brawl in school and are defeated by Maya who has great fighting prowess.The series has a great number of characters; for instance, the Enforcers are its antagonists who have killed Maya’s brother Shin. The narrative is non-linear because we learn about the characters’ past which defines present events. There are bloodshed and fighting scenes all through the first episode but may...be appealing those who like action. However, the story’s progress slows down a bit during the flashback arc taking up much of the series.

The events of this film take place thirty years after the main Yokai Watch series with new human characters and different art style. (Well, everyone gets an updated art-style expect Enma, Nurarihyon, and Kaira. They kept the old look.)While the main series is a comedy-fantasy, this film ditches the comedy (there are still a few funny moments) and goes straight fantasy. I'd actually go so far as calling this film a dark fantasy. There are really only two things that connect Shadow Side to the main series: 1. The main...characters use a watch to summon yokai. 2. Some of the yokai from the main series play major roles in this film. Seriously, if an entire new case of yokai were introduced, and the humans used something other then a watch for summoning and exorcisms (one of them does), there would be no reason to call this a Yokai Watch film. Not to say that's bad thing. Yokai Watch Shadow Side Rise of the Oni King is a great film, and Yokai Watch is a great series. I'm just saying Shadow Side isn't really a sequel.Oh, and one more thing, I wasn't expecting Kitaro to appear in this film. That was a pleasant surprise. This film is technically a crossover between Yokai Watch and Gegege no Kitaro. (Was there a demand for one???) characters use a watch to summon yokai. 2.

Spriggan (ONA),https://myanimelist.net/anime/39489/Spriggan_ONA,"['There have been a few modern adaptations of old manga that were successful even in our modern era like Dororo, Ping Pong and Parasyte. Following this trend, Netflix made Spriggan (though they did Devilman Crybaby too) that was animated by \'David Production\' (studio behind JoJos & Fire Force) and after that teaser and trailer I was quite hyped (like many) to see this action-packed old-civilization story but it had... a lot of problems.This anime is pretty much the same as a certain full CGI Anime that aired last year; ""Night Head 2041"" which is also a spin-off for the manga ""Night Head"". They both are...pretty terrible in many ways with only one selling point. For Night Head 2041, it\'s the Backgrounds and for Spriggan, its the decent fights (Yes. Not even good, just decent). Though one main difference is that Spriggan is an episodic story while Night Head had an overarching plot (a terrible one).Each episode of Spriggan is different and follows ""Yuu Ominae"", a Spriggan equipped with ""Armored Muscle Suit"", a high-tech body armor/enhancer working under a organization called ARCAM, whose aim is to find out all the old civilization technology before baddies use it for...you know, world destruction/domination.One of the main problems with Spriggan is that, it\'s old school in a very terrible way. Badass 16-year old protagonist with a lot of plot armor (no Pun intended)? Check.A high-level secret society com organization plot? Check.Bland villains with non-existent/stupid motives? Check.Characters with very less relevance? Check.Unsurprising/straight-up stupid reveals? Check.Maybe Netflix believed in the ""Old is Gold"" motto a bit too much, because this Anime is pretty terrible. I\'m not saying all these ""modern adaptations of old manga"" are terrible.Crybaby, even though I don\'t like it that much is actually one of the most successful Anime on Netflix; Dororo which is like 50 year old still has some of the most emotional & dark moments; Parasyte falls into the same category and you should know about Ping Pong\'s legendary status even if you haven\'t watched it, then why is that Spriggan failed while others succeeded? Because Spriggan is;1. Outdated: With HS romcoms, isekais and hyped battle shounens taking the spotlight, stories like Spriggan lost their charm. Many are willing to watch trashy power fantasies, self-insertable isekais, high-school romcoms or the next hyped battle shounens than treasure-hunt stories which became very outdated. (Cries in Golden Kauny)2. Horrible story/characters: I haven\'t read the manga but I\'m definitely not willing to read it because this show is that terrible, like just watch episode 1 and see how the \'reveal\' works. I can\'t say how bad it is without using words like bad/terrible/horrible like a 20 times (though I probably did). Not to mention the story is actually incomplete, we still don\'t know what those red eyes the MC have or his \'dark\' past, but I don\'t even care at this point. The scale is ridiculously huge too; one episode sets in America, the next in Germany, India, Russia and we aren\'t even talking about the amount of historical/religious references it makes. If it was atleast a bit well-written or atleast had decent characters, it actually would\'ve been an decent ride. But it couldn\'t. It gets so bad that I couldn\'t even enjoy the fights anymore.(Review for this Anime ends here. Skip to the last part for conclusion. But if you wanna see me talk about ""old manga with new adaptations"" I like...)Some Anime like I mentioned above were able to entertain modern viewers despite the source material being old because they were pretty relevant. Crybaby took a storm on the community with those rap songs, uncensored angsty gore/nudity and that soundtrack, all of these elements made it look like a true modern anime and not just as ""adaptation of an old manga"". But the main thing that made them good is because they also had a solid story or good writing. Even though the gore put off in Crybaby, some of the drama in it is pretty amazing and it\'s ending actually made me like it when I initially hated it. Dororo & Parasyte, even though they took somewhat of a boring route they\'re still compelling shows due to either their plot or characters (they also had good soundtracks).Spriggan is a terrible anime that had no reason to get a modern adaptation.

There is neither an origin story or a proper finale, but instead each episode is a different case that needs to be tackled. In fact, each episode ends by showing the last frame as a picture, which adds to the effect that each episode is just another chapter in Ominae Yu's Life. Generally speaking, each episode is pretty similar as well....Basically, there is an ancient relic that needs to be captured and only Yu can do it. There are additional supporting characters that do help him, but these characters are usually confined to the episode they appear in. Speaking of…Character: 6/10 FineSimply put, each character fulfills their purpose, while also not having much of a backstory. They exist for the episode they exist in and don’t offer much else. Excluding the side characters at Yu’s school, the only other character that shows up for more than one episode is Yoshino, a young girl who is after the relics for their monetary value. Yu himself is also pretty enjoyable, and he’s the only one who really gets any character development.Art and Sound: 6.5/10 Good EnoughWhat I liked most from Spriggan were the different locations. Each episode took place in their own contained setting that gave it a unique feel, my personal favorite being the bunker in episode 4. How the characters blended into the set is a different story. While most characters are in 2D, which is fine, people who are in armor get animated in 3D, which creates a really weird effect where 2D and 3D characters interact with each other and neither feels like they belong. After a while I got used to it, but your mileage may vary.I don’t really have much to write about for the sound though, which is why I'm lumping it with the art. There aren’t any memorable OSTs and even though I’m writing this just after I finished it, I can’t even remember the OP or ED. At least the sound effects were handled well and never felt distracting.Enjoyment: 7/10 GoodPersonally, I liked Spriggan. It’s not trying to accomplish any grand overarching story, but instead having each episode be a self contained story. I think that each episode was handled well and there isn’t an episode that I can point to and say it’s the worst, though I do have a personal favorite episode.Overall: 7/10 GoodOverall, I think that Spriggan is watchable, and if you're looking for something fun and bloody to watch that doesn’t need a lot of commitment than you should give it a try.

I never read the manga, so I jumped in blind.I was pleasantly surprised with this show, I liked the action as it kept me fairly entertained (kinda wish there was more though, but it holds up pretty well). It switches in-between 3d & 2d animation for the characters. It can be a bit jarring but sometimes the 3d is really good where it is hard to tell what is 2d and what isn't. While something like episode 4...is very noticeable.I liked the slight continuity of the story carrying through...each episode, you can technically jump in randomly from episode to episode but honestly I would personally prefer you watch all of them. Each one wraps up there story within 45 minutes making it a good binge to see if you like it.

All I am just saying is, it isn't as terrible as some other projects I have seen.

Despite only having 6 Episodes produced, there's a post credit scene at the End of Episode 6 that suggests more Episodes may be produced in the near future.Story: Each episode is a standalone mission where protagonist Yu Ominae gets sent out to stop some over the top anime villain from trying get their hands on the Ancient Relic of the Episode. Yu usually has someone helping him out, such as a French Bishonen Werewolf or a Greedy...Treasure Thief, but most of them only show up in only one episode so far save for the Thief girl Yoshino, who pops up in 3 and 6.Characters: Yu is the only recurring character with any sort of characterization/development, most of his allies are only given one episode of screentime, but leaving you wanting to know them more than what we are given. Only a few other characters I can recall were Colonel MacDougal from Ep 2 for how entertainy he was, even if he wasn't as creepy as in the 90's film. And Lieutenant Colonel Maria Clemente in Ep 4 since she managed to have some form of a character arc in the only episode she appears in. Many of the supporting cast fail to leave some form of impression for me and a lot of viewers and I found that tsundere schoolgirl Hatsuho to be pretty obnoxious.Animation: I was weirded out by it at 1st for being this hybrid 2D-3D mix, but the results turn out alright and the action scenes do get better later on.Music: Lot of Techno music playing in the background during actions.

Kyle McCarley as Yu in particular is a standout. Though it did had some repeat castings like Kaiji Tang voicing 3 different characters for example.In Conclusion, the show is most likely worth watching for the action scenes, science technobabble, and might have a favorite voice actor involved.

Treasure Thief, but most of them only show up in only one episode so far save for the Thief girl Yoshino, who pops up in 3 and 6.Characters: Yu is the only recurring character with any sort of characterization/development, most of his allies are only given one episode of screentime, but leaving you wanting to know them more than what we are given. Only a few other characters I can recall were Colonel MacDougal from Ep 2 for how entertainy he was, even if he wasn't as creepy as in the 90's film. And Lieutenant Colonel Maria Clemente in Ep 4 since she managed to have some form of a character arc in the only episode she appears in. Many of the supporting cast fail to leave some form of impression for me and a lot of viewers and I found that tsundere schoolgirl Hatsuho to be pretty obnoxious.Animation: I was weirded out by it at 1st for being this hybrid 2D-3D mix, but the results turn out alright and the action scenes do get better later on.Music: Lot of Techno music playing in the background during actions.

The beginning sequence is okay and the mixing of traditional animation and CGI is not problematic. But the airport scene is just bad, bad in every shot: disproportionate drawings, derpy faces and janky animation. It's not something you would expect in 2022 and not from a producer that clearly has enough money to make decent things when they want (e.g. Yasuke, Vampire in the Garden).

That being said... There are many issues- I noticed big plot holes, cliches, vague explanations- you name it. While I like how this series jumps into the plot instantly to avoid filler, this causes a lack of foreshadowing and background explanation. There are a few points in time where the characters just stop what they're...doing to explain what ____ does or other concepts that should've been explained or shown prior. Another issue is how vague the explanations are (if we even get any), for example, we never get any explanation on how Yu joined ARCAM, or why his eyes glow at certain points. Will I be excited to find out in season 2? For sure. But would it have been nicer to learn this season? Most Definitely.On another note, I love how the episodes are paced and how they decided to include little bits of Yu's personal life. At first, I was annoyed and wished they just went back to the story, but I ended up loving the school scenes because they provide a nice breather from all the action, and are truly the only way we can learn more about what type of person Yu is when he's not on some mission.Art:  8The art overall is pretty good, while I am picky, I could care less if an anime uses 3D modeling as long as its integrated well and sparingly (i.e Kill La Kill). Spriggan does... an alright job of this. They actually integrate the 3D models surprisingly well, and in many circumstances, it's hardly noticeable whatsoever (besides episode 4 oh god). The animation during many action scenes is reminiscent of OPM (yes, I said it), and is very impressive compared to other action animes that just feel too clunky.Sound: 6The sound is pretty good at first. The techno beats really set the scene and make some aspects of the anime more enjoyable. However, after a while, you sorta realize all the sound assets are constantly reused and at times quite unnecessary.Characters: 6Yu himself is actually very interesting, he's naive, bright, and so on. There are times when his actions fall out of line with his personality, but, in the end, he's quite an enjoyable main character. The side characters on the other hand... are quite lackluster, I can't really blame anyone considering how quick they have to start the episode -> introduce characters -> and then wrap up the end of the episode. Because of how episodic the series is, it doesn't allow for much character building as many characters introduced are never brought up again (i.e Jean, Rie). This leads Spriggan to have a smaller, ultimately forgettable cast.Enjoyment: 8.5Despite its flaws, I did really enjoy this series. It's wacky, nonsense, yet full of action that I (don't really know why) just truly enjoy. It really knows how to pull you into the scene, as I had multiple instances where I truly was invested in the episode.Overall: 8.5 but leaning closer to an 8This is because looking at this objectively, it's quite mediocre. While I became invested in Yu and his crazy antics, the story has many issues and many things that I wish were different. I definitely recommend this, and it's for sure worth a try, but if you don't end up liking the first episode, you most likely won't like the rest. doing to explain what ____ does or other concepts that should've been explained or shown prior.

Not only are they exposing a generation of newer weebs to source material they probably wouldn’t of touched or thought to seek out, but I’m always fascinated to see what fantasy/sci-fi stories were told before everything became about isekai-ed losers, videos game levels, skills and demon lords.Spriggan takes place in the future (for 1996) where a number of the worlds militaries are in an arms race to find powerful, mythical artefacts and ancient technologies in order to create new weapons.

You will already find plenty of reviews about this anime just as an anime or as an overall storyline concept. I was pretty excited to see this manga get an adaptation - I should not have been.A huge part of what makes the Spriggan manga great is the art. So many of the interesting mythical creatures and areas are intricately drawn and wonderful to observe. It gives the world a huge amount of depth and feeling without having to say it...using words. This goes double for major event reveals or monsters which have a style unto them which greatly enhances the story. The story was never going to be anything insanely complex or heartfelt, but it was a vehicle to get you to these interesting places and see wonderful art/interesting mythology and have a fun action fight mixed in.The CGI elements and their heavy-handed use ensured none of this charm carried over. This leaves the story to fend for itself on the aspects of storyline and character development - characteristically where the Spriggan manga is weak. Another area the story telling in the anime format fails at is humor. The Spriggan manga is often more humorous, taking itself less seriously and having a lot more humor built in whereas the anime tries to make itself ""cool"" and a bit more serious. That just cannot work when you over the topics the way Spriggan does - which is silly let\'s be honest.Without the wonderful art and beautifully detailed world nor the humor, the Spriggan anime is a shell of its manga self. I highly suggest anyone who did not like this anime or is potentially interested in it give the manga a shot instead. using words.

For me the the 3rd episode when I started to enjoy it because I understood the story at this point Yu, was protecting artifacts that could destroy the world which are kinda of like weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Story, needs work and also the fight scenes needs more tension for example at the end of episode 2 it just felt like talk no jutsu and I thought we are going to get something epic but nothing surprised me...till like episode 5 which I thought the teacher who talked about Ki was cool and Jean, when he turned into his monster form was pretty cool as well. Everything in this anime is fine but not good or very good or anything. Also, the CGI wasn't to bad but at times the frames of the CGI dropped to 30 frames per second and that looked horrible. The only character we enough screen time is with Yu and Yoshino where she appeared in episode 3 and 6. That needs to be improve, we need more established characters in the anime. This anime kinda remind of Full Metal Panic! Anyways I enjoyed the last 4 episodes and hope they make another season but better. till like episode 5 which I thought the teacher who talked about Ki was cool and Jean, when he turned into his monster form was pretty cool as well. Everything in this anime is fine but not good or very good or anything. Also, the CGI wasn't to bad but at times the frames of the CGI dropped to 30 frames per second and that looked horrible. The only character we enough screen time is with Yu and Yoshino where she appeared in episode 3 and 6. That needs to be improve, we need more established characters in the anime.

Switch,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3574/Switch,"[""Story: The plot line of the OAV is fairly interesting. Nothing particularly special but nonetheless interesting but the suspense builds up about half-way though episode one.Art: This was the reason I was most concerned about when I heard Switch was getting an anime series. Because of Naked Ape's unique art style it can create problems for the character designs when making it an anime. I'm happy to say they did not disappoint. Kai's hair colour is not the same as his manga counterpart and his eyes tend to get really shiney but other than that I have nothing but praise for the art. The...art was consistent and of very good quality making it a pleasure to watch.Sound: What can I say? Stellar cast. The theme songs are nothing special but they are perfectly suitable for Switch but the background music is surprisingly notable. I was expecting a little more rock feel to it but instead it was more orchestra. I especially like the twisted violin waltz that is played at the beginning of the first episode. The other songs give off a very pleasant feel. In my opinion, the background music made up for the not so memorable theme songs.Character: Kai has very genuine emotions and Hal actions are very intriguing which made me want to learn more about him. They are charters that are amiable and interesting but most of the people who watch Switch would already know this from reading the manga.In conclusion, Switch really is worth watching. I hope that the producers consider making another OAV sometime soon. art was consistent and of very good quality making it a pleasure to watch.Sound: What can I say? Stellar cast.

I had no expectations, and had never even heard of the title. My first impression was ""oh, this is just going to be a cheap rip-off of Death Note where they\'re going to try to shove as much mediocre bs into 1 hour as possible."" However, I found myself inexplicably wanting more after it had finished (for two reasons, mostly good) I haven\'t watched Death Note in a while, but as someone who truly loved the anime/manga and is revolted by the idea of a cheap imitation, I can reasonably say...that this anime did not sound the alarms, despite the noticeable similarities in art and music.Story (8.5)Unfortunately for this anime, it\'s just too hard to pack a strong plot line into two episodes, however, this OVA did a surprisingly good job at conveying a captivating but not excessively complicated plot in only 1 hour. In terms of mystery/detective stories, I can\'t say that the plot is very unique - undercover agents trying to expose a malevolent drug-dealing organization - but it is executed nicely with a clean few plot twists that are not too contrived or predictable. I can actually say that the execution of the plot is quite perfect, it\'s simple enough to be conveyed in one hour, yet complex enough to keep you interested and captivated. The producers made the (right) decision to end the show with a little bit of mystery rather than trying to explain everything in the last few minutes, which, while it does leave me a little unfulfilled, it also leaves me satisfied with the developments the story has taken.While I was expecting it to be a rip-off of Death Note, but was pleasantly surprised to find that the plot did a pretty good job at staying independent. There are certainly similarities (to be expected of the shared genre) and there are some attempts to mimic the dark, tragic, and mind-game aspects of Death Note, but Switch manages to hold it\'s own fairly well in this regard. My only complaint is that is seemed to make a subtle hint at the supernatural in the end, but I may have been mistaken. If it ends up being true (in the manga) I\'ll probably be disappointed (Death Note only got away with  the supernatural aspect because of how well it was explained and incorporated into the series) The ending is slightly unsatisfactory in that it leaves many loose ends, but I prefer that to them being hastily and messily tied together like too many other short (and long) shows do. I rather like the feeling of mystery it leaves us at the end, and it\'s actually making me want to read the manga.Art (10)The art/colors/animation/composition is definitely reminiscent to that of Death Note, without a doubt. However, despite my cringing at the clear similarities (and my fear that one of my favored series might be tainted by a crude copycat) I grew to really appreciate the quality of the art and the attention to detail. They may have imitated the art style, but they did it well, and if I had never watched Death Note I know I would definitely say that the art and animation is excellent, so I\'ve given it a 10.Sound (8)The OP is pretty good, I\'m rather picky when it comes to music, but I can say that I did like it within reason. The ED (which you only hear once) is also pretty nice. As a 2 episode OVA I can\'t say that they really matter much, as you only hear them twice at most. My biggest beef is with the OST. Another noticeable similarity to Death Note is the heavily orchestrated soundtrack. I have to say that Switch did not to such a great job at incorporating this type of music into the show. While the music was good, there were times when it stood out too much and it was clear that they were trying to capture the same classical dramaticims that Death Note was so flawlessly able to do. Unfortunately, operatic an Orchestral music is very refined and possessed great potential, likewise, it is must be used carefully and be specifically tailored to the situation. There were certainly good parts, but I would have been more satisfied if the producers tried a little harder to find something that would work better for them. I like the idea of using orchestral music in a modern-drama-mystery-suspense, (especially compared to some other types of music) but the execution could have been better, though it was by no means bad, and in some parts quite enjoyable.The Seiyuus on the other hand were very good, I really don\'t have any complaints in that regard. The Seiyuu lineup is actually pretty impressive.Characters (10)It\'s pretty hard to develop a character in just 1 hour, but there is a shade of character development, if you\'re careful enough to catch it. In one hour we still have much to learn about the characters, much less give them room to develop, but we do have some clever plot-twists that shed new light on our main characters at different points in the show. I thought the characters were very well made, they all seem quite realistic, and even the ""bad guy"" is pretty likable (I can\'t stand it when the ""bad guy"" is pinned as evil and given an unrealistically horrible personality) None of the characters are too contrived, though they aren\'t particularly unique as far as anime characters go - but that is also part of their success. Nothing is over-the-top, the characters are relatable, intelligent, and well-designed (you can actually tell the characters apart!) and they all act like real human beings (which is sometimes rare in anime)Overall, I really did enjoy this show, and it\'s short enough that I\'d probably watch it again. It\'s by no means perfect, but I\'m very impressed by the work put into it. I don\'t view it as so much of a series in and of itself (it\'s not) but as more of an introduction to the characters, story, and ideas that I will probably follow up on by reading the Manga. When I look at it that way, it\'s an excellent piece.Perhaps my rating of 9 is a little generous, but in terms of enjoyment (or perhaps it was just surprise) I give it a 9, and I definitely suggest you give it a try. Make it past the (slightly cliche\'d) intro and OP, and try not to get too cynical about the similarities it has with Death Note. Just keep an open mind and enjoy the show :) that this anime did not sound the alarms, despite the noticeable similarities in art and music.Story (8.5)Unfortunately for this anime, it\'s just too hard to pack a strong plot line into two episodes, however, this OVA did a surprisingly good job at conveying a captivating but not excessively complicated plot in only 1 hour.

But I really wanted to share my thoughts.In the end I got hooked and yet was left really frustrated."", ""I expected much more with Switch and honestly, I was extremely disappointed. It's the cheesiest, most boring, overdramatic animes I have ever seen.Story Rating: 5The story is just your basic police story. Just a bunch of cops trying to stop some kind of drug and weapon possession. Basically, they did something bad. You can have no clue on what these guys did to get in trouble with authorities and you'll follow it easily. Basically, the story is just kind of bland but probably the only thing that tried to hold this anime together.Art Rating: 4Being an 'old' anime, I didn't expect much for...the animation portion. The colors are extremely muted and the art style is pretty generic. Nothing stands out to make it look like anything new or spectacular. It's just like animation backwash. Then again, I didn't expect much.Sound Rating: 1TIME FOR WHAT I F*CKING HATE ABOUT THIS SHOW!For the voice actors, a lot of these people actually went on to do more note worthy roles so, i'm glad they got a job after this. However, none of them had any situation to give it their all. I guess they did their best with what was handed to them. Maybe except one actor who had to have their voice so high they sound like Alvin in the goddamn chipmunks. Yeah, you're suppose to take this anime seriously.Now, the music....THE F*CKING MUSIC! I hated it so much! It's what made the show practically unwatchable. It was placed at parts that were so unneeded and played in scenes that were so boring yet, they make it sound like a dramatic war movie or something. Again, you're suppose to take this anime seriously. How the all sweet lords of hell am I suppose to take it seriously when you play someone banging on piano keys over two people talking about FLOWERS!So...STUPID!Character Rating: 3I probably would have liked the characters a lot more if they one; made more episodes of the series or two; actually gave these characters some time together to actually work off each other. That's what makes a character, a character, to see their personalities work off or with other personalities. There's a few scenes with our main characters but they go by so fast you can miss them. How am I suppose to get invested in these characters if you don't show them having any personality. Kai, I guess would be the only exception. I actually kind of cared about him through out the episodes. Everyone else, EEEEHHH Fuck 'em!Enjoyment Rating: 1This anime was...so....BORING, and stupid, and bland. Just a forgettable, waste of time. It's so disappointing. You expect something good like with something 'Psycho Pass' did or maybe like 'Death Note'. But, it doesn't even try to be anything new or inventive. It's just something to pass the time with, in a very lame way.Overall Rating: 3Overall, this anime is not worth your time to watch. I didn't hate it and I might read the manga since I hears it's much better (andIdonthavetolistentoanyfuckingoverthetopmusic), I just got disappointed much like in the way 'Mirai Nikki' did.Unless you want to be the kind of Otaku who has seen every. single. anime. ever!

From what I saw the art looked fairly well done, and both episodes were only thirty minutes, so I was intrigued to see what it was about. And overall I wasn\'t too disappointed by the hour long OVA.Story (8/10): the plot of the show reminded me of a James Bond movie, which was the main reason I decided to keep watching. It\'s centered around a police narcotics division trying to bust a group selling the notorious drug Funny Angel, or FA. It\'s thrilling, has a sense of suspense and causes you...to think a little. The overall world is quite immersive since the story moves so quickly, reminding me a lot like a movie. My only complaint is how many unanswered questions the show leaves, not only at the end, but throughout the whole thing. I can recall thinking in the last few minutes ""what the fuck??"" way too many times.Art (7/10): there\'s nothing terribly unique about the art style or the overall animation. It\'s well done, and the characters are nice to look at. Yet again, there wasn\'t anything that was extremely hard to execute on a visual level.Sound (8/10): the soundtrack worked well with the vibe of the story, which again reminded me of a secret agent/spy movie. It wasn\'t something that\'s extremely noteworthy, but it was definitely used well to fit the show.Character (6/10): the characters were okay. There was quite a few of them, varying in importance, but none of them were really developed. If someone asked me to describe the characters, I wouldn\'t know what to say. At the most all I could do is divide them into two categories: the criminals and the cops. I especially wouldn\'t know what to say for Kai, who I guess would be considered the main character. We never know his motivations for wanting to protect Hal- let alone any character\'s motivation. Does Kai love Hal, or does he want to help his best friend? We\'ll never know! As a side note, there weren\'t any girl characters. This didn\'t bother me, but it was just odd to realize every character was male.Enjoyment (8/10): watching the show in one sitting and being able to take it in such a short amount of was very enjoyable to me.

And I am happy to say that this OVA continues all of these strengths.The anime is made up of two parts. The first part is the swimsuit episode. You can see...all the girls in their cute bathing suits while Tsubame is creeping on them. This half was funny, had great fanservice in terms of muscles and this half suprisingly had amazing animation, especially when Tsubame did her Consecutive Normal Punch towards the air.The second half centers around Misha not believing that being a maid is hard work, so Tsubame dares her to do chores for the whole day. And she accepts. So this whole half is made up of how Misha-being-damn-cute-fanservice and I love it. It also has a suprisingly heartwarmig and funny end.So overall, I really liked this OVA.

Even before that I saw this as my well spent 10 minutes that will always leave me craving for more.Despite not really knowing their names the characters seemed so sweet and I could feel their love (if that makes sense).I was also vibing with the art style. It was something unique and the mix of reality was quite fitting.So here are my thoughts on this (how I interprent it).So the man with brown hair is dying (in space I guess) and in...his final last moments he dreams about the man whom he is engaged to and imagins their life together. It's sweet as well as heartbreaking. It's wirth watching for sure. his final last moments he dreams about the man whom he is engaged to and imagins their life together.

He takes you on this ""trip"" (if you know what I mean), and lets you imagine or even feel the reality of a feeling that perhaps, in my interpretation, never really happened.And if you got this far and didn\'t quite understand what happened, the theory that made the most sense to me so far is this:""The white haired guy is actually an AI! Red hair (the pilot) was in a spaceship with the AI, but something collided with the ship and caused it to malfunction. The AI deduced that there...wasn\'t enough oxygen for the pilot to safely reach earth. He then put the pilot to sleep so he would consume less oxygen.

Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37722/Uchi_no_Maid_ga_Uzasugiru,"['After catching a lesbian pedophile stare at his daughter, the real hero of this story, mr. papa went and hired her as a maid. Thanks to him, we now have a shojo ai anime about a lolicon maido and she is really into small girls. This is why the word ""perfectness"" was invented.The single best part of this show is the real main lolicon target girl who is half russian and whenever she is being assaulted (with overwhelming amount of love and warm feelings) by the maido, we hear some generic russian songs and they are really uplifting. The OST is just fantastic, best...one and most ruski score since Girls Und Panzer.Ultimately, this is a comedy series, and the animation details highly serve this idea. Be it love arrows piercing the maido\'s hearto or side characters doing chuunimoe dance moves when teasing little girls, lots of detail is put in the visuals and it plays a big part in making this series so damn fun and entertaining to watch. The comedy side of this show is simply hilarious.Since the series is just slice of life with comedy elements, nothing of real importance really happens story-wise. Character interaction and character-centric goofs are put in a spotlight and they tend to radiate comfy and cuteness. And once again, those who are into this type of shit will have very few reasons to not love it. Maido is actually some sort of elite soldier, but she got unemployed. Now she is using her training to spy on our girl by climbing telephone poles and holding her breath for an hour just to see her bath. What is real important to note here is that this is much closer to 2pure4this world than lewd, and it exists to warm the hearts of its viewers. I, for one, have been forming sushi rolls with my blanket when viewing this for maximum comfy.However, more serious aspect also exists in the series, which is entirely relying on the main loli\'s feelings as she is dealing with some heavy concepts, the main one being the death of her mother. The series can at times get quite feels-stuff regarding this subject, and while these are often followed by maido drowning her in hugs and warmness, the series is not just all happy and goofy comedy, and this other side has played out rather well so far. In fact, it\'s rather unique concept to insert inside a comfy comedy series and it surely works here.Conclusions: so damn cute = 10 letters = 10/10. one and most ruski score since Girls Und Panzer.Ultimately, this is a comedy series, and the animation details highly serve this idea.

The most significant change is making the pedophile a female, pretty smart none will notice a lolicon maid being a pedophile. Well, is not clever, but I am giving the author some credit for trying something new. Honestly, I was surprised in the first episodes. The show was enjoyable, original, hilarious. After some episodes, I noticed the series re-used the same joke every time to have the comedy afloat. The anime that we praised became boring, irrelevant, and in the end, it is just another series that will be...forgotten as an average comedy because the director does not hurry the pace of the main plot.The plot is very straightforward with languid pacing because they focused more on the jokes than in the story itself. A lolicon maid falls in love with a young girl because she hasn’t her first period *roll my eyes* Yes, it is funny haha – I tried to laugh but I couldn’t, sorry. So, this maid became a stalker that follows the girl every time, asks for marriage (most all the time), she disguises to be with her. It is fun. The maid enthusiasm combined with the girl repulsion is hilarious. Sadly, since the same joke is repetitive, I got tired. Maybe I expected too much; the first episode delivered an animation quality out of the chart. That is very unusual for a comedy, but the plot quality at the end wastes the animation quality, and the show is now average. You can blame me and send me back into the medieval bonfire, but this show is boring and stupid. In the middle of the series since the first maid lacked humor, the author has the ingenious idea of adding a second maid with some masochism behavior. However, this does not change anything,  now we have two perverts for the price of one, and both do not fill the comedy moments showed from the beginning.On the other hand, Misha, the girl, has a bright personality, and she is the only character that has some development during the story. She is charming, cheerful and is trying to continue her life after the death of her mom. Misha hates the lolicon maid aka Tsubame who has a bizarre personality, and Misha elaborates plans to get Tsubame fired. The maid is a stalker, lolicon, pedophile, she is a hard worker and wants to marry Misha. That is delightful. However, the constant repetition is tedious because in certain parts Misha looks like a person with schizophrenia awaiting Tsubame's assault. Perhaps that was the reason for adding three secondary characters to refresh the plot. Those are Midori aka the extra maid with a twisted personality. Mimika aka glasses and probably Misha’s best friend and since the MC needs someone that challenge her, they added Yui, that always wants to compete with Misha. About Tsubame, I wanted to know more about her but we got some sporadic scenes about her past, so her background is incomplete, sadly.One important aspect of this series is the animation, and it is impressive in the first episodes. Although, the quality changes and now is a mix of beautiful and weird. There are certain parts were the characters are rough and ugly and are more appreciable in the second half of the series. If we check the colors are very bright and charming. The palette is pleasant to the eye, and a lot of spectators will feel the series warming.The sound is very nice. The OST is very vivid and helps to catch the spectator in the hilarious moment. The OP and ED are average, but the rhythm buried the lyrics, however.Finally, my verdict is average (5). I liked the first episodes and was near to give the series an 8 – 9. Nonetheless, after the half, I notice that the fun disappears. It is an alarm if you get rid and tired of the same jokes because the comedy fails. “Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru” issue is the lack of an outcome when it is needed. I disagreed when some persons said me that this show does not have a plot but is a combination of jokes. The show has a plot (Misha life after the death of her mom, that’s why her dad gets happy when Misha wants to share anything new with him, Tsubame life in the air force, how did she lose her eye, was Midori involved? That is called a plot) but if the director takes too much time deciding when to advance the main plot (last episode), that is another thing. forgotten as an average comedy because the director does not hurry the pace of the main plot.The plot is very straightforward with languid pacing because they focused more on the jokes than in the story itself.

In their world, maids are much more than just eye candy but portrayed as individuals who treats others with respect, dignity, and care. In the Western world, people will probably see maids differently. Watching Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru brings out an absurd side of the maid culture that I didn’t realize I wanted.Also known as “Our Maid is Way too Annoying”, the show doesn’t intend to hide its intentions from the very start. The first few episodes immediately sets off some red flags as we meet Tsubame Kaomi. She’s a former JSDF...fighter pilot and now serves a young girl named Misha Takanashi. In no less than a single episode, we discover Tsubame’s unhealthy obsession towards Misha. At every chance, she tries to initiate some intimate moment between them. The teases ranges from sneaking into baths, proposing marriage, and always trying to be at the same place. It’s the type of humor that can make or break for the viewers.Because let’s face it, this show’s plot is more of a deconstruction of the maid culture. In real life, maids wouldn’t ever behave in the way that Tsubame does. However, this anime made it clear that Tsubame genuinely cares about Misha’s well-being. From many instances, she comes to her aid when the young girl needs it the most. On the other hand, Misha begins to accept Tsubame more and more despite responding in a tsundere fashion. I should point out that Tsubame definitely leaves hair-raising moments for Misha and it’s not easy to accept her as a maid. Tsubame’s actions speaks louder than words whenever she shows affection towards her. This also extends to another character later on in the show named Midori. The catch is that Midori’s affections are pointed at Tsubame while the latter seems indifferent about them. Amusement ensues.Yet despite the reception, this anime can be entertaining to watch when you get attached to the character chemistry between Misha and Tsubame. That is, you’d have to accept them as a pair from the start. There’s no overwhelming character development for either character but it’s shown that they grow to care more and more about each other with every passing episode. There’s also a variety of humorous gags used as comedy stands out as one of the main selling points. It’s pretty cartoonish most of the times that even feels like black comedy. I’m not going to lie, Tsubame’s obsession sometimes borderlines on pedophilic tendencies. Although the show doesn’t really step foot into such category, some of the humor can really be exaggerated. On the other hand, you could definitely watch this show with the intention of absorbing the humor. A lot of it is played for laughs that does what it intends to do: show the audience a different side of maid behavior in Japan. The show is just so damn playful that it’s impossible not to laugh once or twice every episode.While the plot feels almost nonexistent, there’s some actual characterization with the main characters. The background stories of Tsubame and Midori are explored in details that makes us understand where they came from. The same can be applied to Misha although it’s shown in less vivid details. But honestly, don’t jump into this show with the intention of some interesting plot. The storytelling is mediocre at best and a poorly executed joke at worst. It’s the type of plot that adheres to comedic misadventures with almost every episode being a story of its own. This even extends to Misha’s life at school as she hangs out with her friends. Self-proclaimed rival Yui Morikawa also brings in some oddball drama based on her own perceptions. But seriously, don’t try to invest yourself into this show’s plot.Doga Kobo’s track record with slice of life content have relatively been regarded as safe and fluffy. Some of their anime also associates with shoujo-ai and it’s not hard witness those moments. This show actually jumps a bit over itself compared to their other works so I was surprised they would take such a project. The 4-koma itself also contains the absurd humor. Not to mention, the character designs are portrayed with care to make the maids look larger than life. Tsubame is a character that no one can take eyes off of whether it’s her personality, stylish maid outfit, or having a ripped body that few can match. This is a sharp contrast to Misha who wants to be as normal as possible as a child. On most parts, the show maintains a balanced art style although the comedy segments can go over the top at times. Character expressions often jumps overboard and the easiest finger to point at is Tsubame. Her affections are shown through the way she blushes and expressing her undying love in the most absurd of ways. The same can be applied to Midori towards Tsubame so you’d better get used to it. I should also point out that Tsubame’s VA did a flawless job at portraying her character. Sure, she’s not a realistic maid to accept but one that definitely gets the job done when it comes to selling her personality.It’s not an easy show to recommend but that’s ok. When I first decided to watch this series, I had no intention of expecting anything groundbreaking considering its premise and style. It took me perhaps more than half the show to truly accept what this series is capable of. Don’t get me wrong though. Once I embraced the humor, it became a show that I didn’t realize I wanted. This all depends on how you commit to this series as you can easily quote a line or two after watching.

Boy i was proven wrong.So what do you get when you put in a introvert shut in Russian Loli and a hardcore Military retired Maid with a ripped body (and i mean really ripped) who is a hardcore lolicon together? A total Blast of slap stick comedy filled with lolicon moments and scenarios and i mean in a really enjoyable way including good touching and emotional moments in between.The Show basically revolves around Misha (the loli) who has started being a shut...in and introvert due to her mothers recent demise and given upon a normal life. As her father yasuhiro is mostly busy with work and wants someone to take care of the house and Misha, he hires for help, and enters our Lady Tsubame the ex-military officer who applies as a maid and damn she is the very definition of lolicon, assaulting on Misha everyday with her undying love for her through various ways like preparing delicious food and trying to help her in some other ways , and misha obviously revolted  with tsubame\'s lolicon fetish trying to escape her antics but sometimes falling for her  tricks such as her cooking and getting surprised by Tsubame\'s Military prowess and techniques all presented in a really good comical manner.There are also funny moments where there are lines and scenarios which might make it awkward or a bit uncomfortable but if you really have a high tolerance of comedy you will really enjoy it.The Best part of this series in my opinion is its not all rainbows and sunshine, because they add some really good, relatable emotional and touching scenes for example misha\'s memories with her mother , and her current personality due to her mothers death, and the viewers can really feel the emotion of the moment, but the flow of the story is so good that when the scene continues and it goes into lighter and comical moments quickly the viewers can enjoy the rest of the entire episode too and also indulge and savor the emotional part of the episode as well, which made me  hooked on to this series.The last Episode just proves that and was done really well.Talking about Art, Doga Kobo works usually are one of the best. The animation is really good, the expressions, and the flow of it is top notch. Detailed drawing like Tsubame\'s weird but funny lolicon imaginations and Presenting her Ripped toned body which brings out her manly side in a funny way for the viewers and other aspects of the story which the audience will notice when they watch the series.As for the Sound, Haruka Shiraishi the VA for Misha and Manami Numakura the VA for Tsubame have done an amazing job for the characters, The op ""Uzauza☆Waosu!"" and the End ""Tokimeki Climax""  are both sung by the VA\'s.""Tokimeki Climax"" being my favorite which is sung from Tsubame\'s perspective is  too good , its really catchy and enjoyable to hear and watch. :DCharacter wise Tsubame is really my favorite, She has a multi talented character development, where she is a high classed trained individual but succumbs to her love of little girls especially misha and totally loses it at times, but is totally dependable, mature and sometimes a mother like figure totally a  refreshing sight for a female Mc.Misha is also really good with her cute, shy , introvert and her inner gamer personality which some people can relate to. She can be really funny while reacting to tsubame\'s advance and tactics and her reactions are priceless.In the end i would say if you are looking for a story or a anime with a powerful hidden message or story , then no this isn\'t something you should watch, But for a good  refreshing slice of comedy with   the element of lolicon, weird, cringey comedy (in a good way) and a bit of emotional, serious moments, which people who like humor will enjoy and to sit, back relax & be entertained then yes this really a recommended watch . in and introvert due to her mothers recent demise and given upon a normal life.

In point of fact, the Maid in question says well over a dozen times that she isn\'t attracted to any girl who has had her first period. This is also shown in flashbacks at least twice. In every episode she also...does illegal and morally dubious (at BEST) actions, such as sneaking into the bath of an 8-year-old, recording her sleeping, stalking her at school, rubbing her underwear, stealing clothes, collecting her hair, etc etc and so on.So, pedophile.I actually felt dirty watching UzaMaid at times, because every episode had a couple sequences that were just so...wrong. And not in a naughty way: I mean dirty in the way you feel after you accidentally pick off a mushy scab in the shower and it gets stuck under your fingernail.So why did I finish the show? Two reasons: the first is that I adore Doga Kobo to the point half my favorites list are productions by them. It\'s even better because I didn\'t realize they were behind all those anime until I accidentally noticed this about a week ago (which is why I began UzaMaid in the first place...""it must be good, right!?"") The second is that UzaMaid has two underlying strands that are IMMENSELY compelling: very good situational humor and a heartrending dramatic subplot that rui--ahem, is portrayed in the last three episodes. If some fan  were to remove all the pedo scenes this would be a fantastic anime.UzaMaid could E A S I L Y have stood on its own merits without all the fucking nasty shit Kamoi gets up to. Kamoi herself is a unique character; she\'s a military veteran who\'s totally jacked but also looks great in a maid outfit. She\'s smart, athletic, looks good, and has shockingly-deep backstory. The loli around whom Kamoi helicopters is animated well, voiced better, and has a strong enough personality to carry the series herself. All the supports are great too!It\'s actually heartbreaking, unironically. Like, who is UzaMaid supposed to appeal to? Normies will be utterly revolted by the pedophilia. Studio fans like me will hopefully be able to pretend that stuff isn\'t there and enjoy what\'s left, but will be wondering why it exists in the first place. And the third group, well, pedos don\'t get to have an opinion because monsters aren\'t people. So it\'s GOT to be that UzaMaid exists only to appeal to those subhumans, in my opinion, which means it\'s a piece of shit not worth watching even if you love Doga Kobo. does illegal and morally dubious (at BEST) actions, such as sneaking into the bath of an 8-year-old, recording her sleeping, stalking her at school, rubbing her underwear, stealing clothes, collecting her hair, etc etc and so on.So, pedophile.I actually felt dirty watching UzaMaid at times, because every episode had a couple sequences that were just so...wrong. And not in a naughty way: I mean dirty in the way you feel after you accidentally pick off a mushy scab in the shower and it gets stuck under your fingernail.So why did I finish the show? Two reasons: the first is that I adore Doga Kobo to the point half my favorites list are productions by them. It\'s even better because I didn\'t realize they were behind all those anime until I accidentally noticed this about a week ago (which is why I began UzaMaid in the first place...""it must be good, right!?"") The second is that UzaMaid has two underlying strands that are IMMENSELY compelling: very good situational humor and a heartrending dramatic subplot that rui--ahem, is portrayed in the last three episodes. If some fan  were to remove all the pedo scenes this would be a fantastic anime.UzaMaid could E A S I L Y have stood on its own merits without all the fucking nasty shit Kamoi gets up to. Kamoi herself is a unique character; she\'s a military veteran who\'s totally jacked but also looks great in a maid outfit. She\'s smart, athletic, looks good, and has shockingly-deep backstory. The loli around whom Kamoi helicopters is animated well, voiced better, and has a strong enough personality to carry the series herself. All the supports are great too!It\'s actually heartbreaking, unironically. Like, who is UzaMaid supposed to appeal to? Normies will be utterly revolted by the pedophilia. Studio fans like me will hopefully be able to pretend that stuff isn\'t there and enjoy what\'s left, but will be wondering why it exists in the first place. And the third group, well, pedos don\'t get to have an opinion because monsters aren\'t people.

The first episode wasa nut in the gut, i found the muscled women kind of displeasing, and the caracter was obviously masculine (i think the produces didnt allow to go with butler instead of maid)BUT i tough again, lets wait, its not total shit, it seems like there is a past in this mess, and then, i endured (because thats what i did) the ridiculous amount of molesting, the lack of common sense, and the completely asshole maid for an entire episode.Lets make some clarifications... im not a progresist, but for the sake of god, that was horrible, the half-brain father who leaves the child in hands of someone clearly dangerous, the lack of comon sense in the maid was faraway from the line that marks afection and sexual abuse, and lack of sensitivity to not to be a nuisance...""I\'m not interested in anyone who already had his first period""Wait.... WTF? lets be clear, since inocence is a great present from heaven given to the children, its inocence that makes them wonderful, loveable, and put inside everyone of us some kind of protection instinc that makes us preserve their smiles, its ok to feel like that.... BUT, when you are becoming a sexual harraser, who openly admits that you are sexually atracted to children, and start saying things like that, better get the fuck of the children, search for help, and do not touch them. I understand that this is an anime caracter and no-child has been harmed, but its the caracter itself that makes me cringe, because the show happens as if those toughs are nothing, and this kind of behavior is normal and everyting is fine with begin like that...THAT IS NOT OKWhile the second and third episodes were actually fine, (the got deeper into the story and relationship, the espeectator become to understand more of the caracters, etc...) and i actually thought that they were geting the best part of the show....how wrong i was... after the 4th episode, the show fall into more sexual harrasment, more spine-chilling behavior (they add a new caracter in 6th episode) perversion badly presented and threated in the show, and behind a ""everithing its ok"" smoke screen the caracters actually are talking of adult thing (SERIOUSLY ADULT THINGS) in front of grade school girls.The show is dangerous, do not touch it Rusian loli and actually picked mi atention.

The set-up is straight up uncomfortable.Tsubame wants to get a new job after working in the air-force and comes across the house of Misha. After her mother died Misha became an enormous brat and a neet who terrorised all her maids. Then Tsubame becomes the maid of her and Misha is ready to terrorize her too. That doesn't happen, instead it happens vice versa. Tsubame is an enormous female lolicon and she took this job just to care for this cute...russian girl. Misha, ofcourse, doesn't like it and now she has to survive in the hands of this lolicon maid.It is Obvious why this anime has controversy surrounding it: A series about the practises of an lolicon is not particular comfortable for many (I hope), so people rightfully so point that out. So here is my take on it: The lolicon stuff is heavily implied and joked about, but never really practised. There is no disgusting fanservice like in Eromanga Sensei. The closest thing you are gonna get to that are the abs of Tsubame and those abs makes you want to stay more then leave.

From the sensei who teaches his young boy students martial arts while trying to avoid showing his excessive perversion to women when said boys are around (and slips most of the time leading to funny moments of the boys being either confused or judgemental). To the eccentric mangaka-sensei who has adult female students and asks for ""references"" for his drawings. To the dirty teenage female student who wants to liberate a dystopian future which has...banned all porn and perverted jokes and words. To the group of boys who attend an all-girls school and who get sent to the school\'s personal prison in fear of their boyish charms rubbing off on everyone. To the man who\'s entire premise is wanting to bang a female hamster, with sadly hilarious moments of inner-turmoil and bizarre reactions.Yessir, I like \'em all. While it is wrong to actually perv on people in real life, watching said acts done in a variety of ways may be entertaining to watch; not necessarily cause you sympathize with those jerks or you find the idea of perversion to be justified, but because they have actions and traits that define them more dominantly, have limits on how far they go with their perversion, or have the sh*t kicked out of them for some well-served justice.With that being said, I think Uchi no Maid does perversion in the wrong way.The pervert is an adult women, perving on a child, who has no say in the matter and has no way of fighting back or escaping her; and while at first it might seem that the maid\'s affections are purely those of a woman doting on a cute little Russian girl, you\'ll find out quick that\'s not the case. Woman\'s thirsty AF, yo. She constantly asks the kid to marry her, while she tries to see her naked or kidnaps her on trips in attempts to bond and spend time with her. Lady tries to incorporate most of her time tormenting the kid with her presence and lack of understanding of personal space. It doesn\'t come off as the least bit charming or endearing, I just wanted her to leave the poor kid alone. Doesn\'t help that the dad that hired that woman never gets his own daughter\'s message that this woman literally wants her as her child bride.It doesn\'t matter how much depth and traits they give the lady later on with having the child feel sympathetic to her or having sad music play when she reveals about her troubled past as a war veteran. She still has no concept of personal space or the word ""No"" given by a kid who\'s probably not gay and who\'s not interested in a bulky woman-handling.The child though, that\'s the best thing this series has going for it. Her attitude, her interactions with her friends, her pets, her interests and hobbies, it\'s all funny and cute. Had the show taken a different angle to this girl\'s life without having the annoying maid be the catalyst to her personal development, this show could have been fun to watch overall.I\'m doubtful this show will not go any other way but having the maid become the most sympathetic and understanding character by the end of the series, and that would mean the child she harassed would grow to like her. For now, I\'ll continue to watch this poor kid get tormented and HOPEFULLY never succumb to the maid\'s pervy ways, cause that part of the show is kinda funny. I’m hoping, however, that this show\'s idea of developing this maid to become liked by the child will not become a reality by the end, otherwise this sticks to being a horrible example of perversion in anime. banned all porn and perverted jokes and words.

I always found stuff like that condescending personally. That said, given the nature of this particular show, and the specific things that I want to criticise it for, I will make an exception and say it. No, you are not a bad person if you like UzaMaid! I mean...not by default anyway. Maybe you just like this show as a dark comedy. Or maybe you just don’t assign the same kind...of morality to anime that you do to real life. Basically, there are non-creepy ways of enjoying this series, and if you do, good for you. Now that that’s out of the way, let’s talk about the actual show.When I first heard of UzaMaid! and read the plot synopsis, I’ve immediately written it off as…let’s just say not for me. Honestly, a part of me still can’t believe that I actually did sit through the whole damn thing in the end. So why the change of heart? Well, you see I’ve actually heard some people on various websites coming to the show’s defence and voicing a belief that UzaMaid! is actually just an incredibly dark comedy. And so I took some interest in it, wondering if it would be possible to get something funny out of a premise so uncomfortable. I can honestly say that I approached this one willing to give it a chance.Truth be told, after the first two episodes, I was not exactly hating it. Was I having a good time? Not really, as most of the humour made me cringe more than laugh, but I could see where the appeal of lied. It seemed like the people defending this show as just a bit of dark humour were not wrong at least.And then Episode 3 happened.Something in that episode made me feel more uncomfortable than all of the pedo jokes from the first two combined. Because it was in this episode where the show started to portray the titular maid, Tsubame Kamoi, as a sympathetic figure. That becomes a theme running throughout the show. Every few episodes we get a moment during which we are clearly expected to be happy about her and Misha getting closer. Whether it would be Misha beginning to realise that she is missing Tsubame when she is gone, Tsubame saving Misha from a bear, or generally acting as an emotional support for the little girl. The intent is clear. We are supposed to view Tsubame as a not entirely negative force in Misha’s life. Someone who may be kind of creepy, but ultimately capable of making a positive change. Perhaps even filling the void that was left by the death of Misha’s mother.And once I realised that, I could no longer laugh at all.Even if Tsubame would not go as far as to force herself onto Misha, that does not make the things she does do to her any less wrong. She keeps sexually harassing this kid, and thinks up multiple elaborate grooming strategies throughout the show (yes, stupid ones, but still). Despite the show’s gross, half-assed attempts at arguing otherwise, Tsubame is a selfish, manipulative pedophile, and the idea of her being an okay influence on Misha in the end is not just insane, it is also disturbing.To those who want to tell me that I’m taking this show too seriously, I’m pretty sure the show itself would disagree with you. I won’t go into spoilers, but the entire final episode is highly dramatic and attempts to talk about Misha’s trauma caused by her mother’s death seriously. And Tsubame is presented as her wise, concerned friend and ally. So no, I don’t think the defence of this relationship not being meant to be taken seriously on any level works here. Perhaps, the show itself should not have taken it seriously if that was the intent.As a result of all that, whatever development the writers wanted Misha to go through becomes dead on arrival because it all ends up being directly connected to her grossly tone-deaf relationship with Tsubame. Which is a shame because Misha is actually a character, I can see myself liking if she were in a better written series. In the scenes that she does not have to share with Tsubame, she is pretty entertaining. Her sass and deadpan snark got a few laughs out of me when it was not being portrayed as her being “tsundere” for a fucking pedophile.And yeah, I certainly couldn’t care less about whatever “sad backstory” they tried to give Tsubame. Look, none of that changes the fact that she is a child molester that the show tries to portray as “just kind of quirky.” Once again, the sheer tone-deafness of that alone is enough to kill any possible investment I could have had in her automatically.The other characters are a mixed bag at best. Misha’s step-father, Yatsuhiro gets some moments that would probably be charming in a different show. His main struggle comes in the form of trying to act as good parent to his step-daughter after the death of his wife and Misha’s biological mother. He is in an awkward position as he has to look after and raise a kid whom he has only really known for a little bit, and who, does not resent him, but does not seem to acknowledge him as her father either. I love the idea behind Yatsuhiro’s character, but I just find it difficult to take this story about the difficulties of parenting seriously, in a series the main premise of which is watching Yatsuhiro’s daughter get sexually harassed behind his back, and that harassment being portrayed as endearing.Then there is Misha’s school friend, Mimika Washizaki, and her frienemy, Yui Morikawa. Mimika is largely a nothing character, without much of any personality to speak of outside of being obnoxiously cutesy. Yui is the better of the two, but still not great. She is a fairly typical tsundere, being aggressive and bratty, but having a sweet side. Her primary gag is her frequent challenging of Misha to different sorts of contests, due to her jealousy of how her peers seem to view Misha as cuter than her. Remember how Riko from Dragon Maid was when she was first introduced? Well, Yui is basically that but for the entire show. Is it funny at least? Sometimes. Because of how one-note her comedy is, it grows old rather quickly, but I won’t deny that her ridiculous levels of arrogance and pettiness can be occasionally endearing. Especially in contrast with her sweeter side whenever it shines through.There is one character in UzaMaid! whom I can honestly say I found consistently enjoyable and that is Midori Ukai. A past acquaintance of Tsubame, who has been obsessively in love with her ever since. A lot of the comedy she provides is similar to that of KonoSuba’s Darkness, as she is a raging masochist who gets off on just about any form of physical as well as emotional abuse you can think off. Her over-the-top perviness does make for plenty of laughs. Outside of that, she also gets a few moments of being a pleasant and helpful person during some of her interactions with Misha and Tsubame. An all-around fun and charming bright spot, in a show that is otherwise largely devoid of either fun or charm.I will give the show credit that it is quite well made. The animation is very fluid and filled with energy and the art style is nice, albeit nothing too remarkable. The music is catchy. Especially the show’s ED which I found surprisingly hard to skip. The voice acting is also solid across the board with Haruka Shiraishi, Manami Numakura, Mao Ichimichi, Shiori Izawa and Masayuki Katou all capturing their characters very well. So did Sayaka Harada (the voice of Mimika) though she was sadly not given much to work with.Still, no amount of technical competence or voice acting talkent can save a story as poorly conceived as this. If UzaMaid! wanted to be a weird, creepy comedy, fine. But the moment it tried to be more than that, it crashed and burned, as it did so in just about the worst way it possibly could have. As I said at the beginning of this review, if you are not bothered by the stuff that I was bothered by, and you can just see UzaMaid! as a bit of ridiculous fun, that’s great. The intent behind this review is not to guilt-trip anyone. Still, for me, it was a chore. I have watched UzaMaid! in 2020 and, while not the worst anime I’ve seen that year, it may have been the one I was the happiest to be done with. And one that made me hate my annoying inability to drop shows once I started them the most. of morality to anime that you do to real life.

Her over-the-top perviness does make for plenty of laughs. Outside of that, she also gets a few moments of being a pleasant and helpful person during some of her interactions with Misha and Tsubame. An all-around fun and charming bright spot, in a show that is otherwise largely devoid of either fun or charm.I will give the show credit that it is quite well made. The animation is very fluid and filled with energy and the art style is nice, albeit nothing too remarkable. The music is catchy. Especially the show’s ED which I found surprisingly hard to skip. The voice acting is also solid across the board with Haruka Shiraishi, Manami Numakura, Mao Ichimichi, Shiori Izawa and Masayuki Katou all capturing their characters very well. So did Sayaka Harada (the voice of Mimika) though she was sadly not given much to work with.Still, no amount of technical competence or voice acting talkent can save a story as poorly conceived as this. If UzaMaid! wanted to be a weird, creepy comedy, fine. But the moment it tried to be more than that, it crashed and burned, as it did so in just about the worst way it possibly could have. As I said at the beginning of this review, if you are not bothered by the stuff that I was bothered by, and you can just see UzaMaid! as a bit of ridiculous fun, that’s great. The intent behind this review is not to guilt-trip anyone. Still, for me, it was a chore. I have watched UzaMaid! in 2020 and, while not the worst anime I’ve seen that year, it may have been the one I was the happiest to be done with. And one that made me hate my annoying inability to drop shows once I started them the most.', ""Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru is a pretty good anime, I have to say I overall enjoy it, mostly because it not only focuses on the character development, but its side characters too. I like Misha and Tsubame's relationship because Tsubame sometimes feels like a mother figure to Misha, and sometimes it's just plain lolicon comedy I never fail to laugh at. I'm eager to see how this will turn out, but it's definitely my favorite anime of the season.Story 7/10For a plain comedy, this anime has its contrast between being hilarious and sometimes even serious, although Tsubame's lolicon-like attitude can sometimes get repetitive and...a little over the top.Art 6/10The art is pretty decent, artstyle seems pretty good, it's moe and I like that. I still can't believe how the animators coped with Tsubame's overly athletic figure, I admire them for that.Sound 10/10I'm not overreacting here, both opening and ending songs got stuck in my head over only one episode, and the ED easily became my favorite song.Character 8/10Just like I said, I like how the anime portrays Tsubame as a mother figure, and a lolicon at the same time, it gives the show a unique feel, seeing how the two react to eachother. It's just hilarious.Enjoyment 10/10I recommend this, even if it's not finished yet, it's worth the wait because it'll never disappoint you, then again it just depends on what kind of person you are so no promises! :D a little over the top.Art 6/10The art is pretty decent, artstyle seems pretty good, it's moe and I like that.

The show is about a literal pedophile who wants to marry a child. I don't know how this is supposed to be funny, all it is. I tried to give it a shot, but I had to take breaks every 5 minutes.The main loli character is fine, I actually like her as a character. The show should've focused on her. The maid though. No. She's the issue. She makes the show...uncomfortable to watch. She wants to marry a child, that's not ok even in anime.I don't suggest that you watch this show. uncomfortable to watch. She wants to marry a child, that's not ok even in anime.I don't suggest that you watch this show."", ""I quite enjoyed this show at first, it was right up my alley. Cute characters, funny and overall no real story. Just the type of show I would enjoy. However, it quickly became a boring mess. The jokes got really repetitive and it turned into a chore to watch after about 5/6 episodes. The characters lost their appeal and it started to take multiple sittings to get through an episode.What little soundtrack there was, was pretty bad. I don't usually take much notice of soundtracks, but this show was so quiet. It was just voice acting a lot of the time without any music...to go with it. Just complete silence at times. What little music that actually was added was extremely simple. Yeah shows like these don't usually need a solid soundtrack to go along with it, but a good ost will really bring out the enjoyment of the show. It was disappointing to see wasted potentialApart from that, it was cute and colourful. Overall i wouldn't recommend people to watch this. There are much nicer slice of life shows out there to spend your time on. to go with it. Just complete silence at times. What little music that actually was added was extremely simple.

At the core of it though, this is just another poke at the wide valley of mediocrity. So, here we go, starting off with the good first:The art, music and voice acting are pretty good (although they REALLY overuse the horror music track). Overall feel is pretty decent too. That is all. Now, the bad.. And there's way more of it BUT... Its still not enough to make the show bad, although definitely enough to not make it good.Lack of story. This can't be stated hard...enough, there's literally nothing there. Now then, that in itself is not always a bad thing, plenty of comedies pull it off pretty well with even less than this show does, the way this one is structured simply does not allow it to. Mainly, until about the half point, there's just two main characters in the show, with two more side characters that have very little screen time. Then a third more or less main character shows up, as well as another side character and it does make it a bit better, but still, without intense comedy and no story, the overall entertainment value and engagement is quite low.Since i just touched on comedy, i'll get back to it again - yes, there's very little of it. Or rather there's very few jokes that actually hit hard. They're still there, in fact when it works it can be pretty good, but for the majority of the time it isn't, usually being light humor, with the jokes being too flat, stretched, or the disturbing nature of the main character (maid A) taking away from it. Speaking of, this is probably the biggest, and worse point of this anime - its disturbing nature. Now don't get me wrong, perversion and lolicon can be hilarious in anime, and in fact it USUALLY is, but definitely not here. And what separates this from how it usually is you ask?Context. In most shows the stuff is a passing or recurring joke that shows up here and there. Here its the WHOLE PREMISE! The story goes like this - a shy Russian-Japanese loli (named Misha, although that's a MALE'S name in Russian, so go figure) who lost her mother and has only an overworked father to support her, becomes difficult due to this and also becomes a shut in. The father hires a maid (a new one, the girl chased all the previous ones away) to take care of her. She also happens to be an ex soldier, and is an extreme lolicon, and is also entirely open about it (yeah, good job there dad)! And from there on, she's hired and is always around, thus its nonstop harassment and violation of personal space, with sexual harassment, sneakiness, stalking, lying and all sorts of manipulation included, the whole package of abuse, hooray!So yes, even if this show would be a 10/10 otherwise, this alone would take a lot of points off for me, but since it isn't.. We are where we are. Things only start getting somewhat less frequently disturbing when somewhat after the half mark the third character shows up and offloads some screen time, as well as the current situation becoming 'normal', but its still too little too late. Overall i'd give this a solid 5, maybe a 6, but i doubt it'd deserve it, after all, for a comedy, the comedy aspect is really weak (even if it does work at the start, its pretty much the same joke repeated, so it gets old and less funny extremely fast, and the creepy way its implemented and the protagonist being unable to escape it really takes away from it too, as i mentioned), and there's little else there. enough, there's literally nothing there.

The story itself is quite funny, but when I take a good second to think about it, its actually quite fucked up, but that doesnt make the anime any less enjoyable. The art style the anime uses for the characters is pretty generic, but it still makes the MCs cute nonetheless....I also enjoy the music and the soundtrack (also has some russian-like OST added in there).Overall I give it a solid 7/10.

This is one of the worst animes I've ever seen and I only watched 4 episodes before quitting.I can talk about the non-existent story (which is expected in slice of life animes) or the mediocre sound design, but that isn't what the biggest problem is with this anime: the characters. Misha, the little girl is cute and interesting, she also has to deal with a personal trauma (which I won't spoil), so there is no problem here.

I could not recommend this anime to anyone, unless you are a total creep.I'm all for lolicon jokes in anime, but this anime is disgusting and wrong on so many levels, so that is why I gave this bad score to it. suggested, she is sexually attracted to little girls and that is funny I guess?

I would have liked it to be toned down so their relationship could actually have room to grow, instead of having one episode where it grows a little and one where it grows a lot. Same with goth cat darkness rip off, her masochism could also be toned down a bit.However, this show is still really cute and there were even a few times I laughed...out loud.

At that point, there’s no way back and your mind will be forever tainted by this. However, if you give Uchi no Maid a better chance or if you don’t mind the pedophilic nature, you can find some things that are very funny and some of them have a certain depth.As a fan of Doga Kobo and its classics like New Game...and Himouto Umaru-chan, I expected some good laughs and of course yuri, despite the big elephant in the room called the questionable interaction of the maid and the Russian loli. I’ll put some spoilers from now on, so go with caution.Story (8/10):The premise is simple; a former JSDF member called Tsubame Kamoi tries to reinsert herself into civil society by being a maid, so in a snowy day, she passes by a house of a family of Russians, in where she sees a young white girl called Misha Takanashi playing in the snow with her Russian mother, Tsubame gets instantly in love with the little girl. A few years later, Misha is alone with his “father” Yasuhiro after the death of her mother and is known for driving out the maids from her house; enter Tsubame who gets hired to take care of Misha and the house. The now 8 years old girl is determined to drive out another maid to protect her feud, but Tsubame is skilled enough to keep her pursuit of little Misha while taking care of the house.In one of the most disgusting moments of the anime comes early is when Tsubame starts talking about why she’s in love with Misha, and in a flashback, she confesses that she prefers “girls who haven’t menstruated”; but for the rest of the series, it’s more focused on the interactions of the former JSDF member with the Russian girl, with the occasional stalking from the maid to the girl in the most outrageously funny ways possible, like climbing an electricity pole, or putting CCTV cameras everywhere.Unsurprisingly, it touches sensitive issues like why Misha doesn’t go to school, explaining that she gets all the attention because of her blonde hair and she feels “ashamed” of it, Tsubame explains to her in a Martin Luther King way that she shouldn’t be worried of her hair color, because sooner or later, they’ll judge Misha by the content of her character, showing a small transition from lolicon maid to lolicon maid with motherly attitudes.After Misha gets back to school, she meets Mimika Washizaki (Washiwashi from now on) who’ll be her best friend, and supposed rival Yui Morikawa who only cares about beating Misha. The group will now be entangled with the misadventures of Misha with Tsubame, who the girls have a great appreciation due to her modals and great efficiency in doing the job done.In latter episodes, another former JSDF member who goes by the name of Midori Ukai is trying to find her former comrade and crush Tsubame, Misha then finds Midorin in the dumps after doing some weird things in the neighborhood, and sensing an opportunity to finally get rid of her maid, attempts to hire Midorin, much to the chagrin of Tsubame. Despite the consistent efficiency of Midorin in all things concerning to house cleaning, she has terrifying cooking skills due to her consistent masochist tendencies.Misha, feeling now missing Tsubame’s cooking talent, attempts to rehire her by sacking Midorin, but the latter informs her that firing someone has to be done with 1 month of anticipation according to Japan’s labor laws. And in typical Uchi no Maid fashion, Misha confesses that she prefers Tsubame’s food, and the recently rehired maid records the scene for posterity.Entering the final quarter of the show, we start getting more insight on Misha and why she constantly protects the room where her late mother used to draw, and also why she acts like that with Yasuhiro, her dad. She feels alone, and when she was in her mother’s death bed, she receives a ferret who called Kumagoro as a parting gift from her mother. She also wants to have her dad constantly around her as she feels alone and explaining why she went full hikikomori after the disappearance of her mother, considering that Yasuhiro is actually self-conscious about it.Tsubame in fact, despite her hardcore lolicon tendencies towards Misha, she appreciates her a lot, sometimes taking a symbolic position as Misha’s mother by giving some advices and helping her in the most dire situations when she saver her from a bear in Hokkaido.In the final two episodes, we start to see the high chemistry between the 3 lolis, Misha, Washiwashi and Morikawa, in which the first invites the other two to a pajama party with the help of Tsubame and Midorin. However, in typical Uchi no Maid fashion, it has several chaotic moments like when they were in the bathroom, or eating, or basically every moment the three girls and the two maids are in the house. In contrast to other episodes, Washiwashi and Morikawa entered the holy grail of Misha by accident, her late mother’s studio, and Misha discovers that and gets extremely angry, so in order to provide cover to the two girls, Tsubame assumes the guilt.By “assuming” the guilt, Tsubame is trying to maintain the equilibrium that Misha has made since she came and by taking a step too far like finally explaining that her late mother is not there and won’t come back; she immediately becomes like Misha’s de facto mother. And while the maid has her owns doubts because of the semblance of her infancy, Midorin opens again Tsubame’s eyes to have that final dialogue with Her Lady. By explaining the situation, Misha confesses that she had the fear of forgetting her mother, but started to move on from that when she asks her maid to clean the former holy grail of the house.Art (9/10):What I expected from Doga Kobo, very fine details and making very cute and accurate characters. For example, Misha is drawn with the typical phenotypes of a Russian girl, very pale skin, very blond hair and with turquoise eyes; Tsubame has a more bulky type best shown with her amazing set of abs, which is unique in modern anime, but also with a rose on her right eye which doesn’t explain what happened there; Washiwashi and Morikawa keep the cute designs seen in other classic Doga Kobo animes.The animation is extremely consistent, due to the high standards of quality of the studio, it has the occasional weird frame here and there, but it’s minimal; the bright color pallet enhance the characters and the backgrounds with seemingly no effort. The animation is fluid and never stalls, with some nice detailed backgrounds, specially the house of Misha.Sound (9/10):The sound is typical Doga Kobo, very cute with the occasional variant of more dark scores, nothing too impressive, but serviceable for Uchi no Maid, loved especially the Russian tunes in several moments which they complement very smoothly the calmness of the anime. Some background sounds magnifies the comedic and stalker ambiance nature of this show.The opening and ending are sung by Misha’s and Tsubame’s seiyuus, Haruka Shiraishi and Manami Nukamura and exemplify the comedy aspects of the anime; the ending in particular is the better. Nukamura is clearly the highlight of the voice actress with acting roles in Overlord, Shirobako, Aikatsu and fellow Fall 2018 anime Release the Spyce, she proves her talent by changing smoothly between the funny and stalkish voice of the maid and the more ceremonial and serious tone that personify Tsubame easily. There’s also the talent of MAO while voice acting Midorin and getting the best of the masochist tendencies of her.Characters (10/10):There are just 6 characters overall and all of them is important in the plot of Uchi no Maid, this is in my opinion the strength of the anime:Misha Takanashi is an 8 years old girl who is a shut in since the death of her mother, she doesn’t express correctly her emotions, but in the inside, she feels lonely and wants her father Yasuhiro to be with him most of the time. Misha is also a tsundere with Tsubame, somehow justified by the questionable actions of the maid, but she also prefers to have Tsubame around, especially when it’s about cooking.Tsubame Kamoi is a 28 years old former member of the JSDF who explicitly said even when younger that she prefers “girls who haven’t menstruated”, which clearly indicates that she is a lolicon and has an obsessive crush on Misha, to the point of telling she’ll keep loving her even after having her first period. In surprising fashion, she’s very efficient in doing house chores like cleaning, washing, cooking and maintains an aura of formality and respect to hierarchy when addressing to other people. Tsubame, with her obsessiveness with little Misha, she begins to close on her to help her with problems like loneliness, extreme introversion, like her late mother did a few years ago.Midori Ukai is also a former member of the JSDF who is in love with her former comrade, Tsubame, and because the latter rejects Midorin, she enjoys being treated badly by her. In spite of this, she is also very skilled in survival due to her more than intense training in the forces, giving some interesting and funny moments on how she hates comfort and prefers the hard way.Yasuhiro is Misha’s dad and was married to her mom; he is a hard worker and doesn’t have time to be with her daughter, so he hires maids to take care of her until Misha drives the maid out of their house. He also has problems in being considered Misha’s father and he wants to have the honor.The other 2 characters are Washiwashi, Misha’s best friend and a compliment towards Misha’s cool and direct attitude, and Yui Morikawa, who is the self-proclaimed best girl in the class and Misha’s rival, but in a one-sided way. While not very well written as the other four, they clearly play a huge role in the final 2 episodes.Enjoyment (8/10):I have to take out a point from here because of the obvious reason that there’s lolicon inserted in the anime, and it’s clearly explicit in the way that is presented. However, it’s clear that I have enjoyed this anime a lot, the wacky and chaotic comedy moments were extremely well made, even in the moments of higher tension, the comedy is still on point to dilute the mood a bit, even by considering the constant repetition of the lolicon “joke”, and the characters are very consistent and realistic inside this somehow unrealistic crazy comedy.If you pay attention closely to the intricate and tsundere interaction of Misha and Tsubame, you’ll start seeing it more as a mother and daughter-lite interactions which for me makes the show earn its coins despite the big problem mentioned constantly above. As a final parting word, a second season could do justice if they can manage to touch things not mentioned at all in the anime like why Morikawa acts like that, how Yasuhiro came to meet Misha and her mother, etc.Final Score: 9/10. and Himouto Umaru-chan, I expected some good laughs and of course yuri, despite the big elephant in the room called the questionable interaction of the maid and the Russian loli.

For example, Misha is drawn with the typical phenotypes of a Russian girl, very pale skin, very blond hair and with turquoise eyes; Tsubame has a more bulky type best shown with her amazing set of abs, which is unique in modern anime, but also with a rose on her right eye which doesn’t explain what happened there; Washiwashi and Morikawa keep the cute designs seen in other classic Doga Kobo animes.The animation is extremely consistent, due to the high standards of quality of the studio, it has the occasional weird frame here and there, but it’s minimal; the bright color pallet enhance the characters and the backgrounds with seemingly no effort. The animation is fluid and never stalls, with some nice detailed backgrounds, specially the house of Misha.Sound (9/10):The sound is typical Doga Kobo, very cute with the occasional variant of more dark scores, nothing too impressive, but serviceable for Uchi no Maid, loved especially the Russian tunes in several moments which they complement very smoothly the calmness of the anime. Some background sounds magnifies the comedic and stalker ambiance nature of this show.The opening and ending are sung by Misha’s and Tsubame’s seiyuus, Haruka Shiraishi and Manami Nukamura and exemplify the comedy aspects of the anime; the ending in particular is the better. Nukamura is clearly the highlight of the voice actress with acting roles in Overlord, Shirobako, Aikatsu and fellow Fall 2018 anime Release the Spyce, she proves her talent by changing smoothly between the funny and stalkish voice of the maid and the more ceremonial and serious tone that personify Tsubame easily. There’s also the talent of MAO while voice acting Midorin and getting the best of the masochist tendencies of her.Characters (10/10):There are just 6 characters overall and all of them is important in the plot of Uchi no Maid, this is in my opinion the strength of the anime:Misha Takanashi is an 8 years old girl who is a shut in since the death of her mother, she doesn’t express correctly her emotions, but in the inside, she feels lonely and wants her father Yasuhiro to be with him most of the time. Misha is also a tsundere with Tsubame, somehow justified by the questionable actions of the maid, but she also prefers to have Tsubame around, especially when it’s about cooking.Tsubame Kamoi is a 28 years old former member of the JSDF who explicitly said even when younger that she prefers “girls who haven’t menstruated”, which clearly indicates that she is a lolicon and has an obsessive crush on Misha, to the point of telling she’ll keep loving her even after having her first period. In surprising fashion, she’s very efficient in doing house chores like cleaning, washing, cooking and maintains an aura of formality and respect to hierarchy when addressing to other people. Tsubame, with her obsessiveness with little Misha, she begins to close on her to help her with problems like loneliness, extreme introversion, like her late mother did a few years ago.Midori Ukai is also a former member of the JSDF who is in love with her former comrade, Tsubame, and because the latter rejects Midorin, she enjoys being treated badly by her. In spite of this, she is also very skilled in survival due to her more than intense training in the forces, giving some interesting and funny moments on how she hates comfort and prefers the hard way.Yasuhiro is Misha’s dad and was married to her mom; he is a hard worker and doesn’t have time to be with her daughter, so he hires maids to take care of her until Misha drives the maid out of their house. He also has problems in being considered Misha’s father and he wants to have the honor.The other 2 characters are Washiwashi, Misha’s best friend and a compliment towards Misha’s cool and direct attitude, and Yui Morikawa, who is the self-proclaimed best girl in the class and Misha’s rival, but in a one-sided way. While not very well written as the other four, they clearly play a huge role in the final 2 episodes.Enjoyment (8/10):I have to take out a point from here because of the obvious reason that there’s lolicon inserted in the anime, and it’s clearly explicit in the way that is presented. However, it’s clear that I have enjoyed this anime a lot, the wacky and chaotic comedy moments were extremely well made, even in the moments of higher tension, the comedy is still on point to dilute the mood a bit, even by considering the constant repetition of the lolicon “joke”, and the characters are very consistent and realistic inside this somehow unrealistic crazy comedy.If you pay attention closely to the intricate and tsundere interaction of Misha and Tsubame, you’ll start seeing it more as a mother and daughter-lite interactions which for me makes the show earn its coins despite the big problem mentioned constantly above. As a final parting word, a second season could do justice if they can manage to touch things not mentioned at all in the anime like why Morikawa acts like that, how Yasuhiro came to meet Misha and her mother, etc.Final Score: 9/10.', ""It's really great to see when the comedy surpasses expectations. although it is rather a controversial theme lolicon / pedophilia, I really think that in animations these themes can pass, just as a murderer or a thief can win the sympathy of the public in fiction, our heroine Kamoi can either, being a character that transits between this forbidden area saying really disgusting phrases, and a love that resembles the maternal love. The other characters are also quite caricature though complex, with feelings and reactions quite human. The anime knows when to hold you for a serious situation, when to be funny, and when to...make fun of your own absurd situations. Very well written characters, beautiful animation and music, a lot of fun in general. make fun of your own absurd situations. Very well written characters, beautiful animation and music, a lot of fun in general."", ""This show would have benefited greatly from either being more wacky or being more grounded.  As it is, it occupies an uncanny middle ground.The story would have worked better if the maid were just clingy and overprotective.  Making her a real weirdo detracted from the suspension of disbelief.  Even if the writer wanted to keep that aspect, her lolicon fetishes should have been expressed to the audience through internal narration, rather than spoken aloud all the time.I wanted to like this show more than I did.  The animation is good.  The ending song sequence is oddly catchy.  Voice acting...is great.  Many of the sound cues are overused, which is really distracting when you watch the series in one sitting.There's a lot of missed potential.

Maybe some antics like Sousuke from Full Metal Panic.  One of the girl's classmates could have a military father that always ends up indirectly competing with the maid.  The dad's mother or aunt or whatever could visit and try to get rid of the maid by assigning stupidly difficult tasks to her.Whatever its faults, the show kept me watching all the way through.

I\'m glad they actually managed to answer every questions in the last episode (Kamoi & Misha\'s pasts especially) and created a decent conclusion.

I really liked when Midori showed up, it gave a second tone to the atmosphere. Indeed, her bipolar nature (both sado-masochistic & very serious woman) made everything funnier and built a kind of ""loving triangular"", which was totally appropriated here !Anyway, except for the last episode that has a sad effect (with a relieving conclusion though), every other episode was a good moment.Great anime overall, could be watched whenever your mood is going a bit down ! in the whole anime aren\'t several.

AAFDM was actually made by the same studio that made this anime, but managed to get more attention through marketing or some other trickery. While often a genre that people the FBI has an affinity for, viewers who have no intimate interest in underage anime girls can still find enjoyment in the less perverted and more wholesome moments.The Bad:Subjectively, if you like things pertaining to lolis. The ethics of such a thing is another argument entirely. This is just a review of the quality of a show...that revolves around the subject.Characters besides the main loli character act in a completely unrealistic manner, which isn't a complete gamebreaker for a comedic show. There's comedic anime that have realistic acting characters who still manage to be funny, this just isn't one of them.There's some rare moments where anatomy looks all kinds of fucked up, particularly when a younger character moves in fast/unique motions, or when the maid who's as ripped as Arnold Schwarzenegger in his steroid days is viewed from specific angles. Again, this is rare and 95% of the animation is fine.The good:Right off the bat, the OP/ED is a bop.A lot of the comedy managed to get a laugh out of me, so it succeeds in being a comedy.The characters, while lacking in many aspects, have unique and interesting backstories. I won't go into deails as you should just watch the show for yourself if you're curious, but it's not anything similar to the characters I've seen in the dozens of other anime I've watched.The ending is actually pretty heartfelt and wholesome, almost got some tears out of me. Sadly, this heartfelt moment ends pretty quickly and goes back to the already plenty abundant perversion.It has a muscular mommy-esque character so that's like an immediate +1 score, right?In the end, watch it if you like lolis or AAFDTM, maybe watch it if you liked Dragon Maid. If you didn't like either of these shows, but like comedic anime, watch this with a grain of salt and don't feel obligated to stick with it if it doesn't catch your interest in the first one or two episodes.

it is good while the other part is the thing that you kind of wish didn\'t exist.\xa0 Cause this is the kind of conundrum I default to when I talk about Uzamaid.Story:Our story follows Misha Takanashi, a half Russian half Japanese girl who only lives with her stepfather after the passing of her mother.\xa0 Needing help to care for his stepdaughter due to working long hours, Misha\'s stepfather hires Kamoi Tsubame, a previous member of the Japanese Air Self...Defense Force as a maid, who just so happens to also have fallen in love with Misha, much to the grade schooler\'s chagrin.There\'re two parts of Uzamaid: the parts where Misha starts coming out of her shell and opens herself up both to the characters and to the audience, and the parts where Kamoi threatens Misha\'s chastity on a daily basis which really should be grounds for a restraining order.Both of these parts fit into the series in a rough 40:60 split of the entire runtime, meaning that the show is mostly comedy based with enough emotional and character moments to deepen the its characters.\xa0 Personally, I feel like the show suffers because what you end up getting is lost potential.\xa0 Despite being a comedic series, the show has a lot of backstory for its relatively small cast.\xa0 In fact, a number of its episodes are devoted to a single member of the cast (particularly Misha) so much so that I wish the show was primarily about things like Misha and coping with the loss of her mother rather than Kamoi being a pedophile half the time.And that\'s really where the show primarily sits on: Comedic lolicon pedophilia.\xa0 So often you\'ll see Kamoi go to hilarious (and creepy) lengths to fawn over Misha.\xa0 Schedules are set, particulate things are collected; out of context it\'s all very unsettling.\xa0 However, luckily things don\'t go only that way thanks to the fact that Misha acts as a very strong counterbalance to Kamoi\'s actions, consistently retorting and taking equally hilarious (and extreme) measures to make it so that she doesn\'t have to associate for Kamoi for maybe a half an hour of the time.\xa0 At most.\xa0 An issue I find is that because this is the show\'s default mode, often times more heartfelt moments have their mood shut off completely because now all of a sudden, we\'re back to Kamoi holding a camera and drooling again.\xa0 Thankfully the comedy isn\'t written so poorly that it doesn\'t become \'unfunny\', but it does get tiring if not a little annoying cause we\'re quite frankly watching a second grader wanting as much privacy as she possibly can.The result of all this culminates into a show where comedy presides over the majority of the script with enough character defining scenes and moments to validate a more personal and emotional script.\xa0 Given the potential of the characters\' backstories and the tastes that we\'re given, I\'m very disappointed that the show didn\'t offer more of that, given how there are entire episodes where we\'re structured an A and B part without much character to go off.Characters:Takanashi Misha is the best character this show has to offer.\xa0 No doubts about it.\xa0 She\'s written as an oddly mature second grader given how she retorts back to Kamoi in such a blunt fashion and speaks with a vocabulary well above someone her age, all while at the same time still feeling like a kid.\xa0 But I feel what makes her good is just how much the show focuses on her.\xa0 She is the protagonist, and so much of the runtime is dedicated to fleshing out her relationship with both her parents and her pet ferret, as well as the changes she has in her life once Kamoi enters it.\xa0 Kamoi does (unfortunately) have a positive impact on Misha, and I wish that was explored more rather than the more...prominent side of her character.\xa0 There\'s a clear difference from how Misha is at the beginning compared to how she is at the end, which, coupled with her very well-timed retorts to Kamoi\'s actions, make for a protagonist worth watch.Kamoi Tsubame by comparison is a character with a lot of ups and downs.\xa0 Mostly downs.\xa0 Kamoi\'s main character trait is her undying love for Misha, a love so strong that she regularly asks Misha for her hand in marriage, as well as casually stalks her so she can see her at all parts of the day.\xa0 You know, normal maid stuff.\xa0 This trait stands above everything else so much that half the time I forget that Kamoi was once a pilot-in-training because they only bring up her military background every once in a while, coupled with shots of her extremely ripped body to showcase how much effort she put while in the force.\xa0 The tragedy here is how the show hints at a deeper past with Kamoi, but we never really get it until the very end where the full story is fleshed out.\xa0 We see pictures, a few somber (and humanizing) moments, as well as the fact that she doesn\'t have one of her eyes, but it never comes up often enough to really matter, only serving as a means to the end to finish up Misha\'s full character arc.The rest of the cast falls into either a slightly more developed area where the second maid Midorin and Yasuhiro, Misha\'s stepfather.\xa0 Yasuhiro especially feels like he really could\'ve used more work as a character since he like Kamoi has a lot of potential, but he\'s shafted mostly because the show doesn\'t give him enough time in the spotlight to really make a difference, save for one episode.\xa0 A shame.\xa0 Other character involve other girls from Misha\'s school, but they primarily exist as extensions of Misha\'s character due to Misha\'s overall growth.Art:Doga Kobo is one of smaller those production companies that I oddly never have a complaint with.\xa0 Usually I find at least one negative running trend for each company, but at the very least here, the trend is consistent moe animation quality.The show doesn\'t really look anything special.\xa0 It\'s a moe style meant to exemplify the cuteness of Misha especially and \'all of her second grader glory\', as gross as that sounds.\xa0 The few standout qualities that the art has is just how detailed the show goes into showing off Kamoi\'s ripped body.\xa0 It\'s kind of unsettling (and a bit of a culture shock), but I don\'t really mind in the long run because it does ultimately fit with the weirdness of the situation regarding a military grade maid.The only complaint that I have with the art is some inconsistency issues coming off the tail end of the series.\xa0 Given how large Misha\'s eyes are drawn, it\'s easy to see the frames and similar ones like it have consistency issues that end up with a picture of a little girl looking cross eyed.\xa0 It doesn\'t happen very often, but several distance shots have this problem.Overview:+ Standard animation-\xa0 Slight inconsistency issuesSound:Both ""Uza Uza☆Wows!"", the show\'s OP and ""Tokimeki☆Climax"", the show\'s ED are sung by the seiyuus of Misha and Kamoi, Shiraishi Haruka and Numakura Minami respectively.\xa0 Both of these songs have a very upbeat tone to them (reflecting the common tone of the series), and a lot of repetition in them.\xa0 They\'re ok, but I wouldn\'t give too much attention to them personally.Really the only interesting thing I can say about them is how they reflect the two halves of the characters\' relationship towards each other.\xa0 The OP is dominated by Misha and constantly insults Kamoi, whereas the ED is dominated by Kamoi where she constantly gives praise to Misha.\xa0 It\'s an interesting duality, but the ED especially is jarring because some episodes end on a somber note, and the first thing you hear once the episode\'s over is loli praise.\xa0 Just kinda weird if you ask me.An extra note on Sound is the show\'s bgm being basically just a bunch of random stings or soundbites put in the background at the right time.\xa0 Like this show literally has its own Psycho soundbite for whenever Kamoi does something creepy followed by Misha\'s screaming.\xa0 It\'s basically an overused laughing track by this point.Personal Enjoyment:I expected pedophilia comedy, I didn\'t expect so much of it.\xa0 Uzamaid really surprised me as to how well it could write a second grader still reeling from the death of her birth mother, while also making her bratty enough to be a kid yet justified in her anger.\xa0 Really what I\'m saying is, I watched this show for Misha, as she is pretty much the driving force for the show and she carried a lot of weight to get this series to the end.\xa0 If she wasn\'t as well written as she was, this show would be a lot worse by comparison.Though even with that, I feel like what this show was really lacking was enough time on its more emotional moments so the mood would settle down instead of springing right back to more of the show\'s more creepier shenanigans with Kamoi.\xa0 Both Yasuhiro and Kamoi don\'t get fulfilling enough sections of the runtime to be better characters, and had they did, I feel like this show would\'ve been a lot better than it is now.Ultimately my recommendation for the show is really for those who want to see a good protagonist with valid growth...and I guess lolicon comedy if you\'re into that.\xa0 The show strikes a decent enough balance (though leans a little more towards comedy) that I feel warrants maybe a watch, but aside from that, it\'s probably not worth the time to invest into it.

have with the art is some inconsistency issues coming off the tail end of the series.\xa0 Given how large Misha\'s eyes are drawn, it\'s easy to see the frames and similar ones like it have consistency issues that end up with a picture of a little girl looking cross eyed.\xa0 It doesn\'t happen very often, but several distance shots have this problem.Overview:+ Standard animation-\xa0 Slight inconsistency issuesSound:Both ""Uza Uza☆Wows!"", the show\'s OP and ""Tokimeki☆Climax"", the show\'s ED are sung by the seiyuus of Misha and Kamoi, Shiraishi Haruka and Numakura Minami respectively.\xa0 Both of these songs have a very upbeat tone to them (reflecting the common tone of the series), and a lot of repetition in them.\xa0 They\'re ok, but I wouldn\'t give too much attention to them personally.Really the only interesting thing I can say about them is how they reflect the two halves of the characters\' relationship towards each other.\xa0 The OP is dominated by Misha and constantly insults Kamoi, whereas the ED is dominated by Kamoi where she constantly gives praise to Misha.\xa0 It\'s an interesting duality, but the ED especially is jarring because some episodes end on a somber note, and the first thing you hear once the episode\'s over is loli praise.\xa0 Just kinda weird if you ask me.An extra note on Sound is the show\'s bgm being basically just a bunch of random stings or soundbites put in the background at the right time.\xa0 Like this show literally has its own Psycho soundbite for whenever Kamoi does something creepy followed by Misha\'s screaming.\xa0 It\'s basically an overused laughing track by this point.Personal Enjoyment:I expected pedophilia comedy, I didn\'t expect so much of it.\xa0 Uzamaid really surprised me as to how well it could write a second grader still reeling from the death of her birth mother, while also making her bratty enough to be a kid yet justified in her anger.\xa0 Really what I\'m saying is, I watched this show for Misha, as she is pretty much the driving force for the show and she carried a lot of weight to get this series to the end.\xa0 If she wasn\'t as well written as she was, this show would be a lot worse by comparison.Though even with that, I feel like what this show was really lacking was enough time on its more emotional moments so the mood would settle down instead of springing right back to more of the show\'s more creepier shenanigans with Kamoi.\xa0 Both Yasuhiro and Kamoi don\'t get fulfilling enough sections of the runtime to be better characters, and had they did, I feel like this show would\'ve been a lot better than it is now.Ultimately my recommendation for the show is really for those who want to see a good protagonist with valid growth...and I guess lolicon comedy if you\'re into that.\xa0 The show strikes a decent enough balance (though leans a little more towards comedy) that I feel warrants maybe a watch, but aside from that, it\'s probably not worth the time to invest into it.', 'This anime is misunderstood.For sure you\'ve read somewhere some rant about the maid being a full-fledged pedophile as the main theme of this anime, but there is nothing that could be more wrong.Sure, the comedy skits may sometimes seem to lead in that direction, as well as the (ironic jokes) recurring phrases from a certain character, but in reality there is nothing more than simple affection and the relationships between all characters are platonic at most (as it should be in a non-h show). Despite the heavier irony it pushes, for comedic purpose, this show is more innocent than you think.This gets properly unveiled...and explained in later episodes, but it\'s already possible to discern it with attention from the very start.From now on slight spoilers may be present. Beware.This is a story of love. But not a romantic one.This is the story of two people who were on the verge of despair after losing everything.Two people who suddenly found a light in front of them, a light that was destined to nullify that despair and bring happines back in their lives again.Those lights were nothing else that each other.The story unveils their lives, that were apart from each other, as well as falling apart, until that moment, intertwining with each other and healing themselves in the process.The story shows the growth of both characters, that with their weird interactions, started learning how to enjoy life, and start living once more.The show doesn\'t spare you moments of hardship, but knows how to appease you when it\'s time to show moments of joy.This show is a metaphor for life.A weird life, that is.In conclusion, I have to add this: personally I don\'t really care if this story, continuing in the source material, will end with romantic elements between the two main characters down the line, after some years, when Misha is grown up.There, I said it. To be fair, if she\'s an adult when it happens, there would be no problem at all.There isn\'t any coercion or abuse from Tsubame to make you hurr durr at grooming, nor there is planning (unless you count the romantic delusion gags as planning).You maybe could miss it at the start, with all the jokes and such, but after the big reveal, you\'ll have to concur with me that Tsubame set very strict boundaries for herself, that she never surpassed, and she really never did something to make Misha uncomfortable beyond help or go against her desires and will. Sure, some actions may have made her uncomfortable from a (spoiled) kid\'s standpoint, but that was still within the limit of what a parent would do (and her dad was always fully informed about things and gave permissions, by the way) to make their kid somewhat ""uncomfortable"" (with quotes). We\'re talking about helping someone to grow, not to force them to do so, or something else, o making them hate you.TL;DR there is no planned, forced or abusive grooming in this. I don\'t see Misha falling for Tsubame anyway, but I wouldn\'t mind if she ever does. and explained in later episodes, but it\'s already possible to discern it with attention from the very start.From now on slight spoilers may be present.

Yomigaeru Sora: Rescue Wings - Saigo no Shigoto,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1843/Yomigaeru_Sora__Rescue_Wings_-_Saigo_no_Shigoto,"[""* This is my first review, so please excuse any errors I've made.** In case you're watching Ureshii's subs, for some reason they didn't translate the ranks so I've added them in parenthesis as a guide/reference.***This DVD-only episode titled The Last Mission takes place roughly 3 years before 2nd Lieutenant (sani) Uchida Kazuhiro is assigned into the Komatsu Air Rescue Unit, from February 12th to March 1st, 2003. The episode focuses on the then Chief Master Sergeant (souchou) Motomura Hiroshi who was Komatsu's lead rescue medic. You'll notice in the TV series that he has since been promoted to become the squad's Warrant Officer...(juni).I feel that this episode was a touching concluding episode for the series as it goes into detail about the past of Motomura and how he met Major (sansa) Shuujirou Hongo, which I found as a surprising coincidence. The major event that occurs in this episode is Motomura's last rescue mission before resigning as a medic. The rescue mission is different from the ones seen in the TV series, it's not a disaster-type rescue but more of one of those milder rescues. The rescue holds a value of importance to Motomura which you'll see why near the end of the episode.Overall animation is the same as the TV series, including the CGI graphics and is still nicely animated. This episode features only an ending theme, the same one from the TV series but a slightly different cut of the song.If you watched the entire TV series, you might as well watch this special just for completion sake. For, you, the random visitor who happens upon this review and haven't watched the TV series (yet!) you should really consider giving the entire series a shot.

Yesterday wo Utatte,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39710/Yesterday_wo_Utatte,"['[Spoiler Alert]Never in my life have I felt so angry, depressed, displeased, irritated, and resentful as when watching this anime. It\'s the first time that this has happened and all because of a girl. It was not because of the hatred I felt towards her, but instead of love. The love that I had for her is not something that a mere being like me can express as she deserves but it doesn\'t matter, I know it\'s there.Yes, I\'m talking about Haru Nonaka - an 18-years-old girl whose only desire was to be loved. Did you know her Height is 153cm and Weight 42kg? You...probably have forgotten about that but surely I haven\'t. I remembered that since the first time she said it to Rikuo. The latter barely gave a shit even though, when ""realistically"" speaking he should have. People think ""realistic"" means stuff that might happen in the real world too, but without realizing everything we know is not that real, to begin with. What it really means is the way you envision it to be.So, to make it fair I visualized myself as the main character and according to me, I\'d instantly fall in love with Haru. Remember when in the first couple of minutes of the first episode Haru shows up and asks for a bento? Asking for such a thing, a cute girl with a voice of an Angel would surely make anyone fall in love. Unfortunately, in this abomination of an anime that didn\'t happen because the protagonist is an incompetent homunculus. He is by far the worst thing of the entire anime. Because of his inability to see through people\'s feelings (something he should be able to do with ease), he has made suffer over and over again Haru but the worst thing about this is that he never realized that.When Haru said to Shinako that she wasn\'t going to lose to her, I immediately knew that the latter was going to be a pain in the ass. Which it turns out she was. Shinako (the main villain of the series) is the girl who had told Rikuo several times that she didn\'t want to date him and that they were just friends. The truth is, because of the contrived writing that doesn\'t turn out to be the case since you know, Rikuo has spent more time with Shinako rather than Haru, you know, the promised girl. In all of this, it also turns out Shinako has loved somebody else but in the present storyline, he is dead. As Rikuo wasn\'t enough to have gotten manipulated by Shinako, it also turns out she has also manipulated his once lover\'s little brother which it turns out, he loves Shinako, because of course, he does. Of course.It\'s all confusing that serves nothing but to make Haru suffer, just for the sake of it. Is like, why? Shinako rejected Rikuo many times, yet, the two still meet but not as friends but rather as... I guess lovers? For the lack of a better term, I\'ll go with that. In the continuity of the story, it doesn\'t make any sense and it shouldn\'t have gone that way at all. I don\'t think there\'s anything else to talk about since it\'s the same stuff. Only misunderstandings that aim to solely wound Haru. Everything goes like that and It\'s repellent. It sickens me.As for the finale - I would be lying if I said that I\'m not happy for Haru ending up with Rikou, but there\'s a big NO here. There was little to no development here. It should have been more development on the two\'s relationship for that to work. What I saw was futile. Not worthy but Haru was at least lovely, so there\'s that. Still giving 1 for all the suffering Haru has gone through, though.I\'m sorry for continuously repeating ""Haru"" but goddammit if that\'s frustrating. Don\'t you think that way as well? You don\'t? It\'s fine - yet every time I see her being left alone, my soul gets empty. I can\'t avoid that. Do I really have fallen in love with her? Huh, it seems so. probably have forgotten about that but surely I haven\'t. I remembered that since the first time she said it to Rikuo.

Huh, it seems so.', 'This is a show about a bunch of permanent adolescents who whine and bitch about stupid shit they shouldn’t be whining and bitching about anymore, and they do so all whilst acting like the petty elements of their lives which they’re whining and bitching about are actually mature in their complexity and worthy of deep contemplation. Ultimately, this show is either one of two things: a very young, amateur author’s idea of what adults’ emotional tribulations look like, or a cynical ploy by a very intelligent author who knows exactly how to pander to impressionable audiences and trick teenagers into watching a show by presenting...it as being more high-minded than it actually is. Your ability to relate to the show on any given occasion is predicated on whether or not you’re a fucking crybaby, which would honestly be fine if all the characters were petulant little brats, but they’re not, at least not physically. They’re (petulant little) young adults...right? Is that not the selling point of the show? Because I forgot as it dragged on, and the show refused to remind me, because despite the fact all the concurrent events have the characters in their twenties, every plot-relevant detail to the drama is drama which took place in their highschool and college years—which, if nothing else, is the true marketing genius of the show: giving young viewers adult characters to project themselves onto yet also keeping the ideas at hand simple enough for even a toddler to lament.The main guy is a loser who never came to terms with being a loser, and seeing as he had no reason to become genuinely, seriously depressed, he just became a gloomy incel who works as a convenience store cashier to get by with his shoebox apartment. Despite having no human worth whatsoever, he still holds feelings for his college idol who’s ninety lightyears out of his league—but wait! Her being above this guy in every way and the two having zero chemistry isn’t the real issue, the real issue is she herself held feelings for someone else, that someone else died, and she can’t get over him and move on. Then there’s Manic Pixie Dream Girl, a highschooler who breaks down the awkwardness between the two by turning the whole thing into a contrived love triangle where no one is actually in love with the right person because drama. Main Guy likes Tragic Heroine but that can’t happen because she’s held back by Dead Plot Device Boyfriend; Tragic Heroine insists she likes no one despite constantly leading on Main Guy and giving Manic Pixie Dream Girl the idea she has a rival; and Manic Pixie Dream Girl herself likes Main Guy because she borderline stalked him after they had one single human interaction which was so insignificant, he literally forgot it happened between them. There’s more characters, of course, like Seemingly Asexual Best Bro or Anti-Romance Younger Sibling, but if you’re looking for a character which can’t be permanently defined by an archetype you’ve seen too often to count, you’ll find yourself very much out of luck.The show tries to come across as down-to-earth and relatable by keeping things quiet, but seeing as no character has even the thinnest shred of a personality, the plodding nature of the show just comes across as torturously boring, and that’s not even mentioning how much the set-up itself utterly butchers everything which it’s blatantly attempting to rip-off. If any facet of the concept sounded familiar to you, it’s probably because it is familiar. It unabashedly steals dramatic pretexts from genre staples like Maison Ikkoku and Welcome to the NHK and keeps forcing together this bizarre concoction of unoriginal plot devices out of their bastardized elements until the monstrosity that’s left can actually stand and walk on its own two feet, even if it’s less of a walk and more of a drunken stumble through meaningless interactions, trite conversations, and an absolutely depressing lack of any lasting character development whatsoever. Like, it couldn’t be content with just being vapid, it had to then go and reel people in with dramatic familiarity and unfounded nostalgia only to outright disrespect them, seeing as the price of admission for relating to this cardboard cutout of a show on any given occasion is your ability to project your real feelings onto the fake ones this show instates upon its non-characters for the sole purpose of killing time: both its and yours. A worthless coming of age starring individuals who should’ve already done so which glorifies the fact they have yet to.Which I suppose is the one and only silver lining to this pathetic realization of a fundamentally hackneyed script, because if you take it to be intentional, you could then make the argument it is, indeed, actually the thematic heart and soul of the work. “The Asuka in your head and the Asuka in hers.” Shinseiki Evangelion described this dynamic ingeniously over two decades ago, and while I think comparisons to one work are not valid criticism for another, I also think watching three uncharismatic assholes project their emotions on one another until they’re all caught up in this maddening downwards spiral of melodramatic nausea and childish misunderstandings which don’t even resolve themselves over the course of twelve full episodes of TV anime is the dictionary definition of hell on Earth, and if that’s your idea of engaging media, then my review will be of no use to you. This show is cold, hard proof the current generation—Gen Z, Millennials, Zoomers, whatever you want to say—is so pathetically coddled, their immaturity has effectively pushed back the age at which teen melodrama can be acceptably portrayed in media. It repurposed elements from more mature and meaningful works as a vehicle to deliver on a product not only inferior and worth no one’s time, but a product which is so mind-numbingly juvenile, the stolen elements cease to even reach their intended audience any longer, and do little more than add to the already towering mountain of melodrama. While it’s easily Doga Kobo’s most beautifully animated project in years, it’s just as easily their most unenjoyable project since ever.Thank you for reading. it as being more high-minded than it actually is.

Finally a show that will approach the unpredictable waves of life, It’s always a nice fresh air to watch something different after a long journey of constant Isekai binge-watching.Our main character is Rikuo. Rikuo like many people around this times faces a lack of ambition....This lack of ambition makes him work at a convenience store, a place where usually part timers, make money for college. He has a degree, but won’t go forward with life, and settles for the routine to keep him from getting hurt. One of his enjoyments in life was his crush, which he never confessed to because he also lacked the sense of worth.After a while dealing with monotony, his former girl friend crush appears once again on his life, and also a quirky younger girl that apparently knows him from somewhere. Rikuo is faced with the past and the future when he can’t even settle himself in the present.We later find that Rikuo, Shinako and Haru even though they are in different life situations have trouble dealing with the past. Dropping school, having a respectful job or having an ‘’embarrassing’’ job, no matter how it looks in today’s society, doesn’t matter since we all are human and we all are emotionally scarred by personal fears.Yesterday wo Utatte set a high bar for me since the beginning. The saturated color palette, the realistic vision of the main character really got to me. I was expecting a rough, bittersweet journey of this show, like a journey of a person finding its meaning on the world. This vision fell down right quick after I acknowledge the deception.Even though the thematic is interesting, new and rather useful for people who actually can relate with any of the characters, the fact that the romance is the motivation of their change is kind of ridiculous in my opinion. Realistically, it isn’t love that solves your lack of ambition, a grievance or a sense of miss. It may help but, it’s all about how YOU deal with it by yourself.I don’t like this approach, and I can tell there is going to be love triangles and clichés, which are a turnoff since I am about the age of the supposed adults and they still act like teenagers. I just wished this show went in another direction. This lack of ambition makes him work at a convenience store, a place where usually part timers, make money for college.

I just wished this show went in another direction.', 'Life is complicated, especially when it comes to love.Who do we have feelings for, are they enough for a close and familiar relationship or is it more of a friendly nature? This anime focuses on these aspects and presents them in everyday situations that can also be imagined in real life.Yesterday wo Utatte was one of the most hyped series for the Spring season in 2020, so let\'s take a closer look at it:STORY:Friendzone or more? Many of us have already gotten into this situation. If the feeling of love is only one-sided, even friendship is in danger. Our protagonist Rikuo is also affected...by this and experiences how difficult and uncomfortable it can be. Initially without big goals and dreams, he continues to develop with the help of his friends. He really loves his old college female friend Shinako but she had a sad past and lost the person she loves the most. She isn\'t sure about her future...in the meantime we also get to know Haru, our energetic and happy girl. She loves Rikuo and is willing to do everything for him. Also Haru had a hard past where she dropped out of school even. But in the end it doesn\'t matter how hard or uncomfortable the past was, whether old love reappears, the most important question is how the future looks like. Where do I get the motivation to change my life? Our protagonists must also ask themselves all these important questions.CHARACTERS:The characters play an enormously important role for love relationships, they are the absolute main aspect. Without being able to understand their thoughts and actions, this anime would not have succeeded. The nice thing is that you can put yourself in the role of the characters. We can understand their joy and their pain very well. We experience how they develop, set new goals and all of that step by step. Love relationships are complicated, but every person wants to love and be loved.ART:The environment gives you a very idyllic, but also realistic feeling. Every single scene was presented as it could be in real life: from the houses, buildings to the decoration in the rooms, everything was very well thought out. The expressions and emotions of the character also come out well. Not even the smallest detail has been forgotten.SOUND:Nowadays we experience not many animes that do not have an OP. ""Yesterday wo Utatte"" is one of the few exceptions. After a short opening scene where we normally expect the opening song, it is left out. In the beginning maybe a little unusual, but suitable for this anime. During the episode everything was well thought and even the smallest detail are presented perfectly: We hear quiet engine noises during a dialogue in the background, we can hear their emotions from the characters\' voices, even the pouring of water sounds like in reality. Perfect ED songs complete the whole thing. The lyric of these are suitable for the feelings and also the music is tuned accordingly.ENJOYMENT:After the first episode, this anime got my full attention. The everyday situation, a complicated love affair, all of this captivates the viewer. Everyone wants to know what\'s going on. Where does the journey of our characters go, who gets together with whom ... the anime answers all these questions a little more with each episode. One or the other will probably ask herself/himself what she/he would have done in such a situation.BUT!!! Without spoilering anything, it can be said that 12 Episodes is definitely not enough to cover the whole plot. A rushed ending can give you a very unsatisfying feeling.All in all, I recommend everyone to give this anime a try, even if you might not like such genres in general.

It's a story about relationships, the various circumstances in which they can take root, and the ways they blossom, pitifully, and beautifully.While watching this anime, every other line of dialogue just seems to hit way too close to home, and there is enough character development by the end of every episode to make you feel like you've watched an entire season. This is one of the most grounded series I've watched-- no frills, no gimmicks, just silent, heavy realism.Story: (10/10) The plot...flows naturally like everyday life, without any apparent purpose. But it is in these normal interactions that these characters shine-- growing, and learning about themselves. It truly feels like a mirror into real life, the brooding thoughts, the huffs of anticipation, the silent insecurities ... they're all reminiscent of some of the most difficult thoughts we have from within the depths of love.Characters: (10/10) Oh, but love is messy. People are messy. The reasons we give others and deceive ourselves with ... can at times make perfect sense, and still make no sense at all. The characters in this series are complex. They deceive themselves, and contradict themselves. They are inscrutable and yet ... painfully familiar.Art: (8/10) You really need to focus on the backgrounds, which set up the perfect ambiance for every scene. The muted color palette, the camera angles, it's all exquisitely executed.Sound: (10/10) Again, perfectly sets up the ambiance. This series is light on the music, and whatever music there is, is sparse-- to really make you focus on the dialogue between the characters, adding just the perfect amount of garnish to the emotions of the scene. In addition, there is incredibly realistic and well-engineered background noise that immerses you in the characters' surroundings: the mellow whistle of the winter breeze, the birds chirping in the distance, the incidental rustle of dry leaves. Ughhh it gives me shivers like I'm practically there, eavesdropping on these heartfelt conversations.Enjoyment: (10/10) If you haven't realized by now, I *really* freaking enjoy this show, lol.Overall: (10/10) tldr; Watch it. Give it just 1 episode, 2 max, and I assure you, you will be drawn in flows naturally like everyday life, without any apparent purpose.

Whose destination where you find fun and enjoyment in watching, essentially for inexperienced people. It\'s more like a long serious novel you don\'t find in your everyday anime, which their purpose was to move adults emotionally-- in the case of telling a great story of how several characters grow in their minority to adulthood. The coming-of-age narrative ""Sing Yesterday for Me"" tells a story about a young man with little ambitions in life after college, who works at a convenience store in order to make a living.Story: 9""You have nothing to hurt people or to be hurt by....You lie, you play along with what people say, and have a BS life."" Beautiful, yet bittersweet emotions. The story can typically be summed up by announcing that it\'s regarding a love quadrangle. There are two young men and two young women, just springing out in life after school, and we accompany them as they try to determine who will marry who and what each will do as a profession. Not simple for them. The writing is very emotionally resonant It captures past adolescence so painfully well. There will be moments where characters will throw out a random line and without obtaining a significant opportunity out of it you imagine ""Damn. That hits way too close to home."" Each episode in this anime has been so deposited in substance it feels like you\'ve gone through a complete season in just 15 minutes.""You seem pretty evasive about life. Do you think you\'d look dumb if you were a tryhard? You\'re just self-deprecating to give yourself a way out, aren\'t you? So that you won\'t get hurt, no matter where the chips fall.""Art: 8Doga Kobo does a great job of animating from manga to anime. The art is given a fascinating feel to it. Every episode that I watch, I enjoy the scenery and the landscapes. What caught my attention the most, is that the animation made it worth watching. And you should too.Sound: 8The actors are pretty capable and no one does badly. The opening is really good. The ending is really good as well. The opening for sure is a song that I cannot skip. One day, it will be iconic. The ending theme song really caught my consideration.Character: 9Without the characters, this anime wouldn\'t be the same. The adult who feels raw, depressing emotion in his past adolescence.Uozumi Rikuo: The main character who has little to no ambitions in life after graduating from college as a student. He has a love for photography. Working part-time at a convenience store to pay off his rent and supplies to maintain his health.Enjoyment: 8I enjoyed every part of the anime. By the end of the first episode, I was already 100% invested. This is an unconditionally exquisite production and I\'m thoughtfully astounded that after all the cute girl shows that Doga Koba is known for, they\'ve instantly attained their time to shine with depressed adults do existential crisis matters.Overall: 8There are still some flaws in this anime. This anime falls in its own spot. This is definitely not the best anime that I\'ve personally seen, but this anime depicts such raw human emotions that any adult that enjoys anime would watch for sure. In summary, this is a remarkably descriptive depiction of earnest adolescent Japanese people as they pass through the most significant beginning degree of their experiences.Do I recommend this anime? Yes, by all means, please watch this anime whenever you get the chance to. You lie, you play along with what people say, and have a BS life."" Beautiful, yet bittersweet emotions. The story can typically be summed up by announcing that it\'s regarding a love quadrangle. There are two young men and two young women, just springing out in life after school, and we accompany them as they try to determine who will marry who and what each will do as a profession. Not simple for them. The writing is very emotionally resonant It captures past adolescence so painfully well. There will be moments where characters will throw out a random line and without obtaining a significant opportunity out of it you imagine ""Damn. That hits way too close to home."" Each episode in this anime has been so deposited in substance it feels like you\'ve gone through a complete season in just 15 minutes.""You seem pretty evasive about life. Do you think you\'d look dumb if you were a tryhard? You\'re just self-deprecating to give yourself a way out, aren\'t you? So that you won\'t get hurt, no matter where the chips fall.""Art: 8Doga Kobo does a great job of animating from manga to anime. The art is given a fascinating feel to it. Every episode that I watch, I enjoy the scenery and the landscapes. What caught my attention the most, is that the animation made it worth watching. And you should too.Sound: 8The actors are pretty capable and no one does badly. The opening is really good. The ending is really good as well. The opening for sure is a song that I cannot skip. One day, it will be iconic. The ending theme song really caught my consideration.Character: 9Without the characters, this anime wouldn\'t be the same. The adult who feels raw, depressing emotion in his past adolescence.Uozumi Rikuo: The main character who has little to no ambitions in life after graduating from college as a student. He has a love for photography. Working part-time at a convenience store to pay off his rent and supplies to maintain his health.Enjoyment: 8I enjoyed every part of the anime.

It felt like it was going to be something unique from this season, and being named after a song by the great musician Paul McCartney? Even better.Yet, it was my biggest disappointment in this season. I forced myself to keep watching to see if it would get better, but well, it didn\'t. Giving it a 3 because it wasn\'t completely trash to be hateful, just disappointing.The idea of this show, as they said, is to be ""slow-paced"", but it feels more like dead-paced. The characters...have no development, their arcs have no sense and the story goes nowhere.Take Rikuo, the protagonist: He has no will in life, doesn\'t get over Shinako, whom he had a crush on during college and works on a job he hates. This is a good starting point, and when he got rejected by Shinako and later decided to take Haru\'s picture I thought his story would be about valuing the people around him. But after 5 episodes (during those we also had a timeskip), what changed? Not his life, nor his mind. We have no further characterization from him, and all he does during this time is mistreating Haru, the girl who likes him.His crush, Shinako, is equally boring and annoying. Her entire story is about mourning a friend, and that would be reasonable if he wasn\'t dead for 7-8 years already. And as expected, nothing changes about her besides her hair during the time the story covers. Everything she does is about her dead boyfriend, everything reminds her of him, like Rou, his younger brother and the one who should be suffering the most from his death.The problem with Rikuo and Shinako is that their stories are too heavy to be introduced so soon. We are supposed to care about them, yet we have no motives for it. The reason why some anime with drama manage to be good (like Sangatsu no Lion, ERASED, Bunny Girl or even battle-shounens like Mob Psycho) is because we first know the characters and their goals, we like them, and then we feel it when something bad happens to them. This doesn\'t work with two characters who have no personality, no goals nor a reason to care about them.All we know about Rikuo is that he is childish, annoying, treats people poorly and mistreats his friends, people who have been nothing but kind with him. He is worse than the ""Welcome to NHK"" protagonist (from where most of the basis of this anime came from) as he is a terrible person. And he is supposed to be a ""self-insert"" protagonist representing Japanese young adults, and it\'s ridiculous to think that in real life a girl would like and insist that much on someone that is not interesting, has zero qualities and doesn\'t have a good appearence either. He deserves way less than the life he is living.Shinako has no personality. She is not a ""punching bag"" but a wet cloth, you twist it and tears come out. All she does is crying, all her scenes are supposed to be dramatic, but at the second of the one hundred times it\'s used it becomes tiring to watch. Every time she appears you care about her even less.The best one of the main characters might be Haru, designed to be the optimistic, energic best girl of the crew. Her contrasting with the rest of the boring, undeveloped trash cast was one of the reasons I managed to watch it for so long. I was expecting Haru to be the wild card of the series, the one who was actually going to be developed and be a good character. Yet, she ends up having the same destiny as the rest. Rikuo mistreats her for months, yet she continues to be in love with him. She realizes what he does, knows he is a bad person and that she could be with someone better when Minato asked her out, but she doesn\'t change.A shame, because maybe if she left Rikuo the story could change and actually progress. She had so much potential, but they decide to stuck her in a toxic relationship, which is also a dead-paced story.The entire anime has no pace, no progress, all the episodes do a full 360º, they end right where they began.In other aspects, the animation is good and I have no problem with it. Yet, the character design is mediocre as all the male cast (besides Rikuo\'s co-worker) have the same appearence. I already had a problem trying to separate Rikuo from Rou from something besides the hairclip, then Rou\'s brother appeared in a flashback looking exactly like him, and also his teacher, who I first thought as Rikuo. In episode 5 we also met Minato, that is basically Rikuo with a short beard.There is no OP, but the ED song is great, maybe the best thing of this whole anime.Overall, I wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone, not even seinen or shoujo fans such as myself. The flaws are too much to take the interactions and sad scenes seriously and there is no plot.It reminds me of My Little Monster, as the story there also goes nowhere.

At first, I thought it would be some kind of usual slice of life anime with a bit of drama (or sadness) as anyone would've probably imagined. But then, I realized that I was wrong.The story of this anime is just so realistic. Not too much, nor too ordinary. So realistic, yet so mysterious, I don't know why I kept on watching. It started pretty much decent, then as more episodes went by, it became something else, like...more stories (and secrets) were revealed, and made me all curious. I ended up guessing all sorts of stuff, but each time I guessed, the stories kept running like they opposed all of my speculations, so I don't know what to expect next. And in my opinion, that's what makes this anime exceptional.Another thing was, normally an anime would just end each episode with something that makes the audience curious about what will happen in the next episode, right? But it's not the case with Yesterday wo Utatte. Each episode somehow ends with a peaceful conclusion, but for me, it's what makes me get all curious about what'll happen next. The peaceful conclusions give me a better mood to continue to the next episode.All in all, I'm looking forward to the next episodes of this Yesterday wo Utatte. And to any of you who's still stopping by to think whether or not you should watch this anime, please, do watch, and don't stop after the first episode.

Growing up without a father during some of the most important times in a boy’s life is hard. Whereas most people would turn to their fathers for advice and help with relationships, life, decisions, etc. I instead turned to anime/light novels/manga.One of the mangas that has been the most influential in my life and development since my father’s passing was Yesterday wo Utatte. A tale about unrequited love, the struggles of adulthood, the pain of loss and learning to accept the way things are. Needless to say, when I heard that the anime...was in production I was ecstatic. DG have always been a favourite studio of mine due to their success in the CGDCT department, but they’ve also made more serious shows that taught me life lessons like Plastic Memories.YwU is another impressive entry into their already solid line up with stunning visuals, life like animation and masterful direction that makes you forget you’re watching anime and feels very real. In fact, speaking of removing the anime-y feel, the series has no OP which I believe was a great touch and enhances the experience.The story is a relatable one. We’ve all had crushes in uni/hs and wondered how things would go if we reconnected with them. We’ve all had unrequited love, we’ve all done things that go against our best interest, and we’ve all felt lost in life. These are very human things. We are by nature, irrational. YwU does an amazing job of capturing the complexities of human emotions and crafting an engaging narrative.The seiyuu castings for all of the characters are perfect as well. For me, seiyuus are quite important. They can make or break my experience with a show and in this case, they made it. The older I get, the more I struggle to deal with the traditional high pitched squealish anime voices and much prefer the deeper, more realistic tones which this show features.To avoid rambling(I could go on and on about how much I love this), suffice to say YwU was, in my opinion, anime of the season. While it takes some rather large shifts from the manga, the story remains every bit as emotional, educational and thought provoking. For me, a masterpiece.

Yesterday wo Utatte gets 10 crows out of 10.', ""Spoilers for the story’s end in the last paragraph - because everyone deserves to know what a vomit-inducing ending it is.“What if we took Welcome to the N.H.K. and bastardized it into pure wish-fulfillment? We’ll earn millions!”The isekai LN title of this series would be “I’m the most dull, unremarkable, and devoid of appeal ‘literally me’ MC in existence, yet I’m inexplicably beta-orbited by an underaged manic pixie dream girl and an inexplicably single 9/10 woman in her prime.”In case you don’t like isekai LN titles and prefer comparisons to the previously seen shows, NHK ni Youkoso! is a perfect one. Imagine NHK. But instead...of a mentally ill shut-in, Sato is just a nondescript part-timer schmuck. And instead of the troubled characters with deep backgrounds, Misaki and Senpai are just wish-fulfillment waifus. And instead of the bizarre, eccentric and cringy story arcs - nothing happens. In other words, imagine NHK but entirely devoid of depth, fun, or identity.Yesterday wo Utatte is an insanely frustrating show to watch because it’s not awful consistently. Despite being full of the massive red flags that scream “this is garbage, drop it without finishing a single episode,” it occasionally manages to have a genuinely poignant moment of drama that would be great in a better show not ruined by its awful premise and awful characters. No, “occasionally” isn’t the right word - that’s literally how every episode is structured. They follow the pattern of the first 15 minutes of nothing that leaves you all the time in the world to ponder how terrible this series is and what are you even doing with your life, followed by the 5 minutes of decent drama. Yeah, here is a wise saying: if you mix 5 barrels of wine with 15 barrels of mud you’ll get “don’t fucking watch this show, it’s bad.”Since the characters are the main issue, I’ll elaborate on those:Rikuo is what happens when you make your characters out of the TVTropes quotes. Here: “A soulful, brooding male hero, living a sheltered, emotionless existence. If only someone could come along and open his heart to the great, wondrous adventure of life.”Haru is by far the worst thing about the entire show. You know how some characters, say, Haruhi get called a Manic Pixie Dream Girl just for being quirky and female? Not the case. She fits the definition of MPDG to a “t” - an assertive eccentric girl with wild hair and a pet raven that has no goals, agenda or purpose beyond attaching herself to the male protagonist. That’s unironically her entire character - her life is empty so she pursues the MC just to have some meaning in it (which doesn’t explain why she pursues this particular wet noodle). She’s so awful, the moments where she is being emotionally hurt are by far the most enjoyable moments in the show for me (and there is no shortage of those since Rikuo treats her like furniture). Also, she’s 18 y. o. because this is anime and you can’t have anime without a JK (the MC is 25 y. o.).Shinako is the protagonist’s former classmate who kinda liked him in the past and now they’ve met again by chance. I wasn’t joking about the whole NHK comparison. And the comparison makes the biggest problem with her glaringly obvious - there is a snowball's chance in hell a woman like this wouldn’t be married or swarmed by dozens of potential suitors at this point of her life. That’s just not how it works. Senpai in NHK was married despite being an absolute mess - because that one is a well written story. Shinako here is not because this one is not. I mean, she has a half-decent story reason for staying single - but that doesn’t explain why every single male acquaintance doesn’t try to ask her out or why she spends all of her free time beta-orbiting a boring fucking nobody.Rou is basically a male clone of Haru in a sense that they’re both teens unhealthily beta-orbiting a much older person that treats them like a piece of furniture. Outside of that his personality is that he has a safety pin for an earring.There is also that one flirty shoulder-length-middle-parted-blond-hair-with-a-hairband guy that I swear I’ve seen in 50 shows before, even though I can’t recall his name in any of them. He’s not relevant or anything, I just want to point out a trite cliche.That’s really all there is to it - the main characters all kinda make sense in a vacuum. What doesn’t make sense is why these 9-10/10 women would be throwing themselves onto this 4/10 man and how fucking dumb the show thinks I am if it expects me to not question this masturbatory fantasy of a premise? Literally just replace the MC of the story with Satou Tatsuhiro (i.e. a loser that is at least distinct enough to tell him apart from a potato sack) and this will instantly become a barely watchable poor man’s NHK, instead of an unwatchable morally hazardous shlock.And now, the ending:So, yeah, the manic pixie dream girl “wins” - after the MC first dates the actual woman for a while and then breaks up with her and decides, “Guess I’ll go for the back-up now, it’s not like that tool has anything to do besides waiting until I whistle.” They meet, kiss and the series treats it like a happy end. But not before actually lampshading what a piece of shit the MC is for doing that.

What if I tell you that, Yesterday wo Uttate is almost, the second coming of Fuuka?I really wanted to like YwU, but the more I watched it, the worse it became. For the first 5 minutes of the first episode, I thought that I was going to love this anime, boy I was wrong. Despite the smooth artsyle and animation, this anime was already doomed from the start. You see, this anime is filled with an alarming amount of tropes I absolutely despise on...anime. Don\'t misunderstand me, being predictable or generic isn\'t a bad thing from the get go, the problem here, it\'s just that the studio never knew what to do with it\'s plot and characters, so we ended up on a spiral of plot conveniences, contrivances, infuriating characters and very idiotic events that I fail to see as ""realistic"".Let\'s open the package, we get:- The dense MC Rikuo, who is in love with a potato he met in college. This guy is a complete retard who fails to say things when he has to, and when he does, he shows his inner stupidity to everyone.- The Potato Shinako, who is the MC\'s main love interest. She had a boyfriend who died and now she\'s stuck in the past (There\'s nothing wrong with that, until there is)- The annoying Haru, who claims to be in love with the MC. (I\'m sorry to all the Haru Fanboys, but someone\'s gotta say the truth). Her timing is awful as she almost always find a way to conveniently find Rikuo, as if she were stalking him, blatantly sticking her nose in the business of 2 idiots, ""challenging"" Shinako into a fight she\'s never going to win, unless you make the characters retarded.- The MC\'s rival Rou, who is cringe inducing. He\'s only there to spice up the drama. There\'s nothing much to add up to his character, but the fact that he wants a girlfriend who cooks meals for him lmfao.Having all that, I already knew what kind of anime this shit wanted to be, and I was hoping that things would end up being different, sadly, that never happened and only got worse.This anime could have been done in less episodes, if only Rikuo would have made clear that he had no interest in Haru. Instead, despite him rejecting her indirectly, he won\'t stop giving her hope by fulfilling her selfish requests, which, in the end, would keep hurting her because Rikuo is that stupid. Not just that, despite him rejecting her, Haru would keep pushing her way into his life, hoping that something goes her way. I fail to understand how others like Haru, but if I had someone pushing their way into my life despite showing no interest on them, the last thing I would do is giving them hope by fulfilling their selfish requests. Then we have Shinako, whose pressence is to make things way worse by dragging things up. She\'s stuck in the past because her beloved boyfriend (who we never got to see what was so good about him) died, and thanks to that, every time she seems like doing a step forward, she gives several steps back. She also suffers from the same thing Rikou does: Not telling things when she has to, prompting others into a spiral of misunderstandings and events that could\'ve been ressolved easily if these characters weren\'t that dumb.Thanks to Rikou and Shinako\'s indecisive being, we got 12 episodes of dragged shitfest full of melodrama and very infuriating events. This is sad because the animation is really good and the visual storytelling this anime has, would have added a lot of value to the anime, sadly, it does nothing when the ""plot"" and characters have little to no value at all. Animation alone can\'t save an anime, and we\'ve seen that happening several times. This is just another trashy romcom disguised as a seinen.If you despise anime where the characters are this infuriating, do yourself a favor and stay away from this. anime. Don\'t misunderstand me, being predictable or generic isn\'t a bad thing from the get go, the problem here, it\'s just that the studio never knew what to do with it\'s plot and characters, so we ended up on a spiral of plot conveniences, contrivances, infuriating characters and very idiotic events that I fail to see as ""realistic"".Let\'s open the package, we get:- The dense MC Rikuo, who is in love with a potato he met in college. This guy is a complete retard who fails to say things when he has to, and when he does, he shows his inner stupidity to everyone.- The Potato Shinako, who is the MC\'s main love interest. She had a boyfriend who died and now she\'s stuck in the past (There\'s nothing wrong with that, until there is)- The annoying Haru, who claims to be in love with the MC. (I\'m sorry to all the Haru Fanboys, but someone\'s gotta say the truth). Her timing is awful as she almost always find a way to conveniently find Rikuo, as if she were stalking him, blatantly sticking her nose in the business of 2 idiots, ""challenging"" Shinako into a fight she\'s never going to win, unless you make the characters retarded.- The MC\'s rival Rou, who is cringe inducing. He\'s only there to spice up the drama. There\'s nothing much to add up to his character, but the fact that he wants a girlfriend who cooks meals for him lmfao.Having all that, I already knew what kind of anime this shit wanted to be, and I was hoping that things would end up being different, sadly, that never happened and only got worse.This anime could have been done in less episodes, if only Rikuo would have made clear that he had no interest in Haru. Instead, despite him rejecting her indirectly, he won\'t stop giving her hope by fulfilling her selfish requests, which, in the end, would keep hurting her because Rikuo is that stupid. Not just that, despite him rejecting her, Haru would keep pushing her way into his life, hoping that something goes her way. I fail to understand how others like Haru, but if I had someone pushing their way into my life despite showing no interest on them, the last thing I would do is giving them hope by fulfilling their selfish requests. Then we have Shinako, whose pressence is to make things way worse by dragging things up. She\'s stuck in the past because her beloved boyfriend (who we never got to see what was so good about him) died, and thanks to that, every time she seems like doing a step forward, she gives several steps back. She also suffers from the same thing Rikou does: Not telling things when she has to, prompting others into a spiral of misunderstandings and events that could\'ve been ressolved easily if these characters weren\'t that dumb.Thanks to Rikou and Shinako\'s indecisive being, we got 12 episodes of dragged shitfest full of melodrama and very infuriating events. This is sad because the animation is really good and the visual storytelling this anime has, would have added a lot of value to the anime, sadly, it does nothing when the ""plot"" and characters have little to no value at all. Animation alone can\'t save an anime, and we\'ve seen that happening several times. This is just another trashy romcom disguised as a seinen.If you despise anime where the characters are this infuriating, do yourself a favor and stay away from this.', 'edit: allow me to point out that like me, others here have written their first ever MAL review solely for this show. If the frustration factor is enough to bring some people out of the woodwork, take this as a warning: first few episodes are totally swell, then it turns to unmitigated crap.I went into this show with not only zero expectations but zero knowledge. I literally only began watching this because there\'s a VA I like in this; I had absolutely no concept of what this would be whatsoever. Point being, my review is as much an assessment of the show as it stands...on it own as possible, free of external bias. This is also my first and probably only review, but I need to vent about the failed opportunity and enraging character choices. This will contain spoilers because it must.The short version is this: it doesn\'t go anywhere and it wanders all over the place. It seems entertaining at first, but it isn\'t. Nothing fucking happens, and characters do things with no motivations. When the motivations are there, you don\'t know WHY they\'re there. It\'s meant to be a serious, somewhat slow presentation of adult relationships and the complexities/problems that arise when these form between people who are or feel aimless and searching for a purpose. That\'s totally fine. What isn\'t fine is that the characterization, or lack thereof, becomes insufferable, and this show is about nothing *other* than characters and their interactions. They had one job and they\'ve failed. As such, I will only be focusing on the characters, because in a show like this, nothing else matters.As I said I began watching this show because I like Haru\'s VA. I saw someone comment on her MAL page ""Haru carries the show, hard."" Which made me wonder what show, and I found and started watching this, and they were right. Without Haru this show would be worse than wonderbread bland, but that\'s just blatant opinion, so pardon that. Allow me to explain the groundwork and then the problem here:Yesterday (heretofore called YwU) is about a guy (we\'ll call him Guy, I\'m not spelling his name a bunch of times) who graduated from college and didn\'t want to do anything with his life, so he now works at a convenience store part time. A girl, Haru, develops an interest in him and tries to get a relationship between them going. Guy had a crush on his college friend, Shinako, and still does; he was essentially in the friendzone and for the most part still is. Shinako isn\'t interested in Guy romantically and isn\'t over a years-old crush on a guy who passed away years ago (who she never had a romantic relationship either). That dead guy had a younger brother, who has a crush on Shinako as well. I find this dynamic somewhat on the weird and creepy side, and there\'s really not much to it at all either, so I won\'t be talking about him or this relationship.As another review or two has mentioned, the mediocrity from this show comes from its frustrating, irritating, sometimes infuriating lack of development alongside character actions or lack thereof. It starts out strong when it sets everything up, it builds the groundwork, gives us fully fleshed characters, backstories, connections, the whole deal. After the first couple episodes it\'s easy to come away pretty positively thinking ""finally, a mature show that deals seriously with adult relationships."" Instead, what happens is that everything they establish in the first couple of episodes remains mostly unchanged, and characters consistently make decisions (or lack thereof) that will annoy or frustrate the audience enough to make them want to slap the character.Haru is great. She\'s an adorable, quirky girl full of life and energy, and even though things get her down (totally reasonable, as it\'s usually a result of Guy\'s rebuffs) she fights through it and somehow forces herself to be positive. She picks herself back up, dusts herself off, and keeps going. Her vibrancy, tenacity and cuteness are a solid positive addition to the cast.Guy McDudeguy starts off seemingly good. On first impression he strikes you as a reserved man who\'s disappointed in his choices in life but cares too little to do anything about it. He seems at first to be a charming deadpan snarker and a mature guy who doesn\'t get his feathers ruffled easily (boy is that wrong). He\'s pretty indifferent about the things that surround him. He was close friends with Shinako in college and always had a crush on her, but was in the friendzone. Haru is always trying to get his attention in her own adorable way, but he simply doesn\'t care. And that would be fine, if that\'s all it was at first, but instead he gets more and more cold and heartless to her for no solid reason, while his attention is raptly held by a woman who is clearly settling for him and ""dates"" him for months without even holding hands or kissing him. You quickly learn that Guy is actually pretty wimpy, and had so little self-respect that he\'s perfectly fine with being upgraded from outright beta orbiter of Shinako to beta ""sort of boyfriend"" by episode 10 and 11. This will of course be a subjective statement, but I\'m willing to wager that most people who watch up to 10 will conclude Haru is the far, FAR better option for Guy, yet he\'s constantly treating her poorly and ironically is insufferably head over heels for a woman that treats him as a Plan B fallback ""I\'m not really attracted to you"" option. The only thing that really changes with Guy is that he changes from a part time job to a full time studio position. Even technically becoming Shinako\'s sort-of boyfriend changes nothing about how he and her interact. He\'s an unlikeable moping wimp who gets too flustered too easily and puts Shinako on a pedestal, at one point basically telling her he\'ll wait as long as it takes.Shinako could arguably be worse, depending on your perspective. She isn\'t introduced as anything special and she doesn\'t have anything that defines who she is, other than being unable to get over her long-dead crush and how everything everywhere reminds her of him. She starts off in the show as bland and generic romantic interest, and gets worse with her meandering indecisiveness and selfish romantic actions. She outright admits to herself that she\'s selfish (reluctantly) basically by keeping Guy on a friendzone leash and leading him on in other ways. Haru, who is interested in Guy, wastes no time in declaring war to her face (god bless you, Haru), and Shinako, who is NOT interested in Guy (and I would argue still isn\'t; dude, if a girl is settling for you, she isn\'t attracted to you) responds by saying she just wants to be friends with him. Haru then retorts that that\'s not fair; if you\'re friends you can\'t ""lose"" in a romance war, he could be friendzoned forever, and it\'s selfish of Shinako to do that. But that\'s what she does anyway. Shinako spends all her time every episode hemming and hawwing over what she should or shouldn\'t do, rejects a kiss from her ""boyfriend"" of three months, invites him up to her apartment before changing her mind and apologizing for not allowing him to come in, etc. etc. There is absolutely zero romantic or erotic dynamic between the two of these people, and it does nothing but evoke images of a cold, awkward, uncomfortable and benign ""better than nothing"" relationship of convenience. One in which one party holds all the interest and the other is reluctant and indecisive about not only whether to have a romantic relationship with him but whether to even do anything, ever, even when in one. Regardless of what the show may later claim is how Shinako truly feels about Guy, her actions and inactions scream far louder: she isn\'t attracted or drawn to him, and is using him as a security blanket, there to keep her occupied or help her out whenever needed. Guy, equally intolerably, allows her to walk all over him and insists on having infinite patience as though she\'ll wake up one day and see how in love she is with him. Instead of, you know, telling Shinako ""okay that\'s enough"" and spending time with the younger cute woman who actually has passion and interest in seeing him.Thus far, there\'s no lesson to be learned here. No one has grown or become better from their experiences, and aside from Haru getting hurt over and over again pushing her towards giving up completely, nothing happens. Even when things ""happen"" they don\'t, because nothing changes. Shinako and Guy McBetaWimp still interact in almost the exact same friendzone way three months into their ""relationship"" as they did at the start of the show. There\'s no arc. There\'s no inspiring message. It\'s one step forward, one step back, with Haru\'s kawaii genki qualities being the only thing making the show tolerable. It is simply not a good anime about relationships in general, let alone adult ones, and the actions and motivations or lack thereof are complete garbage. I suppose you could chalk things up to a difference in culture but my god if this is a good metric of relationships in Japan, there\'s no hope for that birthrate :(Adding insult to injury, a number of characters say that Shinako is a ""pretty lady,"" because they HAVE to, because the art damn sure doesn\'t make that clear. If I told you she was a plain, boring, 40 year old generic slice of white bread schoolteacher, you\'d believe me. Haru, on the other hand, actually is portrayed physically and otherwise as cute. So why does Guy treat her like nothing? Because he isn\'t interested. Why not? The answer to that question should be the mantra for the show itself: ""I don\'t know.""edit2: Final episode just aired and it\'s as rage inducing as the previous 11 episodes combined. Knocking this down to a 4. It\'s like they thought the rationalizations and justifications given in the final episode were meant to be heartwarming and romantic but instead they\'re just stupid and explain absolutely nothing. ""I was over the moon"" he says yet this is never portrayed in any of the previous episodes at any point. ""I like it when a woman is nice to me"" he says yet he\'s a total dick to Haru who is super nice to him. ""We were just confused"" he says as if that magically handwaves away all the BULLSHIT that did and did not occur in all previous episodes. Trash. I hope to Christ the manga isn\'t this unforgivable.In summary, writing characters like the ones in YwU as they are is fine, as long as you DO something with them. If you do NOTHING with them, and make them meander or make stupid choices or portray decisions with little to no proper motivation behind them, you\'ve failed at presenting an actual story, and failed at actually crafting characters. Even if the relationships change in a few episodes, they\'ve wasted over half a season with no accomplishment, no changes, no morals of the story, nothing actually happening, and no character development along with no motivation. on it own as possible, free of external bias.

When I saw its premise, I immediately felt a strong sense of connection to it. It's been more than a year since I graduated from college, and the show reflects the uncertainty I've felt about the future recently. Not everyone will find their success story immediately once they set foot on the real world. Feeling like you're in limbo during the time between graduation and employment is normal. Perhaps, these are just assurances to comfort me as I’ve been stuck in one place for a while now. Watching the first few...episodes made me reflect if I made any real progress in life as an adult. It made me root for Rikuo's character, hoping things get better for him eventually. The show could've been an emotionally compelling coming-of-age story about overcoming obstacles that adult life brings. Instead, it ended up being a complicated romance story with mixed results.Even if the show didn't end up going for the coming-of-age route, I became invested in the romance. Rikuo finds himself stuck between two women that showed interest in him. One of them is Haru, who is the eccentric yet cheerful type that has a massive crush on Rikuo. The other one is Shinako who Rikuo has a crush on ever since they were classmates back in college. To make things more complicated, we also have Rou who's in love with Shinako even though they are childhood friends. The show does a decent job initially in exploring each character's backstory and making the audience understand their train of thought. I honestly didn't care who will end up with who as long as enough time is given to flesh out their characters. The show's focus on romance was starting to get the justification it deserved until it got ruined with one logistical decision that led to its downfall.As the show progressed around the halfway mark, it started to have a noticeable drop in quality with each episode. They no longer have the same impact as the earlier episodes. It felt like a long period had passed between episodes, and the show's continuity suffered because of that. I soon discovered that a lot of content from the manga were skipped over, and most of them are considered crucial to the story's progression. New episodes would have developments that startled me and made me wonder if I wasn't paying enough attention to the previous episode. The characters' actions started to make less sense, and I still tried to connect the dots despite that. It's almost like Doga Kobo was in a rush to conclude the whole thing, which is a disappointing move that even the extras that are supposed to fill in the gaps couldn't remedy.I can't help but feel that this anime could've been way better as I reached the final episode. It started extremely well, began to lose focus, and ended up with a conclusion that didn't feel earned. The main characters didn't get the proper exploration that they deserved. Every major decision they make doesn't feel justified later because the show starts to make less effort to help us understand what made them reach that decision. They all feel like the same flawed person they were at the start. They deserve to be more than that because they feel like real people. At least, their interactions made it feel that way, whether it's those moments of awkward silence or sudden outbursts of emotion.

What started as a great anime about people searching for their passion and trying to grow up ended up being one of the most disappointing horrible romance anime I have ever seen.If you are looking for romance that is only consisted of ""I love you so love me back"" type of story then this might be for you. The characters in the anime all had love interests and I think that was what made go down a bad route. Searching for your passion and trying to find meaning in...your life which was the original plot was just thrown out of the window and now everyone knows what they want to do for some reason. That was just sad to see.The characters were decent at the start, each one had his own worries and each of them was trying to overcome it. Some episodes were so good to see with the characters\' feelings and development made me feel bad that I should also go out and do stuff. all of the development felt like it was thrown out of the window and they became 4 shallow characters trying to find their love.The art, sound and animation were great. The directing was fine in the first 11 episodes but the final episode was really bad and rushed.Overall, I would give it a 4/10. I said it a lot in the review but I was really disappointed by what could have been a great anime.Wouldn\'t recommend it even to people that love random romance. your life which was the original plot was just thrown out of the window and now everyone knows what they want to do for some reason.

A young girl who just had her heart broken and is running home screaming while some classical music is blaring in the background? In small doses, but more importantly, when done RIGHT, it pleases me a lot.The (main) problem with Yesterday wo Utatte is that it wants to be both... and doesn\'t succeeds...in any. It looks like a mature show at first, but upon closer inspection, something is just... off.It wants to showcase the struggles of real people with real, believable problems while also soaking the whole thing with soap opera nonsense. In experienced hands, I could see that working, as the contrast between two extremes can add to the experience, but Yesterday\'s serious approach is nowhere near as strong or present as its daily drama vein. Its realistic approach is ""well done"" to a fault: the experience very akin to watching paint dry.First, we\'re introduced to Rikuo, the main character, an empty slate of a person at odds with what to do after graduating from college. He runs away from allumi meetings, stopped searching for a real job, and is satisfied with working part-time at a convenience store. He\'s a bit socially awkward, but considerate, even going out of his way to feed crows with expired food from the store. Ever been on your smoke break, feeding \'em birds, having thoughts on how life went out? Of course you did.That\'s when he runs into another big member of the cast, Haru. Haru is... not as empty as Rikuo, and that\'s about the most I can praise the character. Her initial appearance just screams of Manic Pixie Dream Girl. And oh boy, if only that was her sole problem... She missed her train, now she and her crippled pet crow (perhaps the show best character when all is said and done) are hungry. Rikuo handles her a lunch box on a whim and she leaves. And then a friendship is formed... except Rikuo doesn\'t feel like reciprocating, which is completely understandable. In fact, he\'s pretty bummed out once he founds out it wasn\'t a random encounter between them and she\'s hanging out at this workplace almost every day now. Because that\'s how love starts, right?(As It turns out, Haru was actually stalking him from the get go, being in love with him FOR YEARS after a five-second interaction between them that happened a long time ago. I\'m not making this shit up. It\'s contrived as hell.)Rikuo has a lot more on his mind, still having a crush on a friend from college. They meet each other again, but it turns out that person, Shinako, has someone she likes. And she, now a teacher, knows about Haru and her nebulous past (a past so nebulous we don\'t even get to see it for more than two minutes). It\'s a sticky situation, a boring one at that, because: a) Rikuo doesn\'t mind waiting for Shinako, b) Shinako doesn\'t mind Rikuo waiting for her and c) Haru is there to annoy both because that\'s the sole reason her character exists.Pretty early on, Haru declares war on her former teacher, a scene as bombastic as cheap fireworks in the rain. Such declaration came out after gems like ""I don\'t even know who I am"", ""can women and men be friends?"" and (my favorite) ""what is love?"", so the viewer is already used to all the telenovela dialogue, but it still sticks out like a sore thumb, because the anime just showed us Shinako\'s backstory, by far the most emotionally powerful thing in this series. To follow that with some brat spewing bullshit is pretty jarring. But being jarring is Yesterday\'s bread and butter.There\'s also Rou, the youngest of the main quartet, who is basically the male Haru, although he is more cocky than creepy. He\'s more tolerable mainly because sometimes he just disappears for a while and his motivations are linked with Shinako\'s, so the quality of his character is elevated a little by mere association. Still, at the end of the day, his main characteristic is that his earring is a safety pin.""Well, now the main quartet is finally established, time to watch it all bloom into something significant!"" was my train of thought, but... it doesn\'t go anywhere. Shinako moves on from a tragic past with a lasting impact on her life to... a hair cut. Rikuo gets a new job, but not the spine to tell Haru off. Rou is, huh... less entitled now... sometimes. Haru still can\'t get a clue and doubles down on her stalking. Nothing ever changes, no matter the angle you look at. Shinako\'s actions can be forgivable because of how much she has on her mind, how hard is for her to let go of her past, but it keeps playing that same beat until the end to the point of staleness. It\'s a character-driven show that fails on the romantic side and doesn\'t fare better when focusing on other relationships.There are a few side characters, but they basically come and go without adding much. I found it hard to tolerate our main cast, so there\'s no reason why I would care for Haru\'s hipster-ex-classmate or blonde-guy-who-worked-with-Rikuo. Dude goes touring with his band, apparently. Good to know someone in this show had any fun.This ""coming and going"" is a thing the show does right, but literally on accident: sometimes in life people stop being constant, and in Yesterday this is showcased well... like, two times. The first would be a spoiler, and the second is on episode 6, when it (re-)introduces someone from Rikuo\'s high school past (in well-tread fashion - it\'s basically the same way Haru enters his life sans a crow), and their interactions feel genuine for once. She looks and acts her age, a far-cry from the dumb teens and emotionally-stunted adults. For once I thought the story was headed somewhere, and then... she\'s gone in a flash like all good things in this anime.And here\'s the main question: Are we supposed to care for Haru? Am I just not part of demography anymore so her clinginess and over-the-top devotion doesn\'t reach me? Her love isn\'t an obsession - it\'s nonsensical. She\'s a stalker, attention-seeking moody young adult whose most realistic trait is having a pet crow. Erase her from the plot and the whole thing is a lot more bearable, down-to-earth. Still mind-numbly boring, but still! Maybe the anime adaptation just butchered a confusing, mysterious character, I don\'t know. Maybe her best is yet to come, as the show just spun its wheels in place for torturous 12 episodes. I knew things looked bleak when she declared war on Shinako, but when she screamed in frustration while waiting for the lights to turn green (the closest I got to relating to this show, ironically), I had to check if Mari Okada didn\'t write the script. Maybe she ghost-written it while high on sleeping pills.Perhaps the better question would  be: are we supposed to care about ANY of these characters?! My main problem is with Haru, but your mileage may vary: every single one of the leads are insufferable in their own frustrating ways. Charisma is a word absent from Yesterday\'s monochromatic dictionary.The art in Yesterday is okay, faring well because of how dire things look in the writing department. It has clear, crisp animation and a decent budget. I liked the color palette at first (no pink moe hairstyles in sight!), but it starts to blend together in an ugly grey-ish mush as the episodes go on. The places the characters visit are mostly desert, the streets they walk feel empty and cold, which sometimes adds to the experience, but it is so overplayed, it loses its impact very fast. Characters are walking back home in a grey background to a grey apartment. Next scene, it\'s the end of the afternoon and everything is a nauseating orange. This, but it\'s 12 episodes. And the grey easily overshadows any other color used, to the point the stunning display of cherry blossoms in the second episode begin to look like a dream. Man, the late 90\'s were whack. Thank God mankind invented different colors!The sound is on a similar note. The main trick here is the lack of any background music to add weight to some of the characters conversations. This would be a good thing... if they had anything good to say instead of repeating their doubts and fears EVERY.SINGLE.EPISODE. And when the music and the dialogue stops simultaneously, it\'s more unbearable than anything you ever experienced in real life, because it also goes on and on and ON AND ON.Other times, they just go with a cheesy piano noodle here and there, some strings, you know the deal. The show doesn\'t have an OP (which means an extra minute and a half of awkward silence and sighing every chapter!), but it makes up for that with three decent different EDs. I like the second one\'s theme (an arcade game - one of the few times the show executes the ""vintage anime"" aspect well is through videogames) and the third one is wasted on this wreck, its bright colors not fitting the dull experience that preceded it.Direction-wise, it nearly equals the train-wreck the script is, the staff running out of ideas on how to handle scenes so equal in action and tone. They had to adapt a long-running manga with 11 volumes and they just decided to fill half of it with filler in the form of silence and the characters looking hurt/sad. It fails to build any sort of atmosphere.Were you to create a drinking game where you take a shot every time the characters are staring at each other in silence or sighing, you probably would end up in a hospital bed halfway through it.Oh, and as the anime draws to a close, they ditched the organic-if-boring approach to one sprinkled with cliff-hangers. Pathetic, cliché ones at that, and so out-of-nowhere that you wonder what was the point, it\'s like the show is AIMING to be tone-deaf. These cliff-hangers stand out not because they\'re shocking or well-placed, but because they are one of the few things not repeated to death in the anime. They\'re there because the previous 23 minutes didn\'t show any progress, so these final 10 seconds need to.Some of the cinematography shines, though (Shinako\'s flashbacks, Haru\'s hanging out with the hipster), but mostly in the beginning, because as the repetitiveness of the show comes crashing in, it\'s hard to keep adding new spins to another stalking/walking scene. The last episode has some interesting camera shots and perspectives, despite the content.Yesterday grabbed attention for being a seinen with adult characters past high school, but with the way it is written, it fits better with the adolescent crowd, and honestly I don\'t see it faring well against recent high school (melo)dramas, with even flawed titles like O Maidens In Your Savage Season showcasing more depth. The discussion surrounding Yesterday in anime forums simply boils down to ""exciting"" shipping wars - although I don\'t see this one being remembered for very long.Compare Yesterday with, say, Welcome to the NHK (adult life struggles + zaniness) or the more recent 3-gatsu no Lion (where a contrast in tone succeeds) and nothing remains.  As a cautionary tale for a younger audience, its messages ares all muddled -- ""teens will be teens""? ""moving on is hard to do when what you need to move on is yourself""? ""focus on individuality, romance can wait""? None of these felt earned or properly addressed. Perhaps ""life is boring and grey"" is more fitting.For those that want something similar to this show but done extremely well, look no further than Honey and Clover. It\'s a stellar show that executes the end of adolescence and the start of adult life with perfection, with one its main characters being very similar to Rikuo but with actual payoff. It even has romance if that\'s what drove you into Yesterday in the first place. The anime adapts all the manga in two seasons, too.What I got from this in the end is the following: it\'s a mediocre show with average-to-downright-terrible characters, severe pacing issues, a glorified walking compilation not worthy of its pretty visuals. It\'s just a very basic soap opera that occasionally paints a realistic portrait of grief and loneliness, but instead decides to focus on artificial creepiness and over-reactions. It\'s a love triangle/quadrangle between two different age-demographics where everyone acts as kids, a coming-of-age story that doesn\'t really go anywhere. It makes any other love story with the slightest bit of characterization and proper storytelling look better in comparison.Yesterday is now tomorrow and I need a break - here\'s hoping I don\'t run into a stalker with a pet crow. in any.

Do you think you\'d look dumb if you were a tryhard? You\'re just being self-deprecating to give yourself a way out, aren\'t you?""For an understated and reasonably well-made and interesting show, Yesterday has earned itself a lot of controversy over the course of its short run. A lot of people were attracted to this show as it started, and many of these fans were seriously put off by how the series progressed, particularly over the course of the season. Having an understanding of why this show is polarizing to its fans is important for...deciding whether or not to pursue watching this show.I agree that there are some significant problems with this show, particularly with how it was adapted and published. In June 2020 the community is understandably peeved as the season ends, as the nature of the 6 ""extra"" episodes was miscommunicated, at least to the English-language market, leading basically everybody to realize that instead of the 192 minutes of plot and character development left in the season, there was really only 48. This was an extreme exacerbation of a core problem the series had all along - the source manga is a bit too long for 12 episodes to begin with, and 18 full-length episodes would not only be original but appropriate. Even if we knew all along that 12 episodes were all we had, the pacing was going to be a bit of a mess.Consequently, the story, character, and relationship development in this show is rushed, skipped, implied, and maybe just flat missing, particularly in the second half of the series. There are huge (months-long?) and invisible time-skips. Sure, maybe ""nothing happens"", but this is a slice-of-life romance show. We\'re here because we want to watch nothing happen in romances. The story earns a solid 3/10, at least in this adaptation.I did not care for the story, but I also did not much care about the story, because it was never the strength of this show.Photography and still art are a major motif in this show. Uozumi is a photographer, Hayakawa is an artist, and flashbacks are often ""animated"" as still manga panels. In a medium defined by movement, this focus on still art as a capture of a memory or an unchanging moment in time drives the theme of looking backward hindering forward progression. What is holding these characters back? When we see these pictures, can we see what they see?Likewise, for the show itself, its strength is not in its narrative, or the development of its plot or relationships, but in the specific moments of reflection it creates. It effectively and artfully delivers powerfully relatable emotional ideas several times per episode in every episode. This show is incredibly consistent and uniquely understaded in its mood, tone, art, and acting, as well as with its delivery of these moments. Clearly, the production decision to condense as many of these reflective moments into the anime was to the detriment of the story, but I also think that this was the correct decision.Although this means the show does a poor job in changing the characters through events that occur during the show, this focus on moments and ideas of importance to them means that every major character is developed deeply based on what has happened in their past. They don\'t act like each other, they don\'t act maturely, and they don\'t act perfectly, and all of those differences are motivated and interesting.This creates a hidden strength of this show - whereas most shows have the ""3-episode rule"" for a viewer to decide whether or not a show is for them, 1 episode is more than enough for Yesterday, because it starts handing out these little photographic moments right away. If you\'re like me, and you got walked over by the scene where Kinoshita undresses Uozumi\'s idea about being fine as a loser, then I can wholeheartedly recommend this show, because these little-picture moments never stop until the very conclusion of the show.This show is not for everybody: the dueling-love-triangle setup can accidentally suck in and disappoint a lot of people who are in it for the romance, comedy, and drama of the waifu war. But a lot of people also feel stuck, like they\'re fine being a loser, or like their romantic inexperience is symptomatic of a toxic personality that needs to be cured, or like they don\'t know whether to pursue or drop an unrequited love, and they wonder what it would sound like for someone to attack their vulnerability. This show is not shy about using the relative experience and intelligence of its main characters and the tool of shifting perspective and point of view to expose and dissect these emotions, and the show\'s artistic decisions, skills, and quality make these uncomfortable emotional positions easy and even enjoyable to take in.I really like this show, and I may even love it - time will tell. I don\'t like the same thing in every show, but usually I will choose to value a show based on what it does differently or well. Because of how it spoke to me early in its runtime, these little-picture moments were what I looked forward to every episode, and they never stopped coming, and they never stopped impacting me. The way the show realistically, artfully, and honestly attacks the brokenness and weaknesses of its characters reminds me a lot of OreGairu and Charlie Kaufman\'s movies, which I love as well.I don\'t think this show will be seen in the future as a pivotal or groundbreaking work, and if its rating continues to fall, it may not end up even being popular beyond a season where 3/4 of everything else was canceled. So if you read some reviews or watch the first episode, and decide that it\'s not for you, or you\'re not sure how much you like or identify with the characters, just skip the show, you won\'t miss much. On the other hand, if you read some reviews, watch one episode, and feel sucked into the ""2meirl4meirl"" vibe, this show is a must-watch. deciding whether or not to pursue watching this show.I agree that there are some significant problems with this show, particularly with how it was adapted and published.

They don\'t act like each other, they don\'t act maturely, and they don\'t act perfectly, and all of those differences are motivated and interesting.This creates a hidden strength of this show - whereas most shows have the ""3-episode rule"" for a viewer to decide whether or not a show is for them, 1 episode is more than enough for Yesterday, because it starts handing out these little photographic moments right away. If you\'re like me, and you got walked over by the scene where Kinoshita undresses Uozumi\'s idea about being fine as a loser, then I can wholeheartedly recommend this show, because these little-picture moments never stop until the very conclusion of the show.This show is not for everybody: the dueling-love-triangle setup can accidentally suck in and disappoint a lot of people who are in it for the romance, comedy, and drama of the waifu war. But a lot of people also feel stuck, like they\'re fine being a loser, or like their romantic inexperience is symptomatic of a toxic personality that needs to be cured, or like they don\'t know whether to pursue or drop an unrequited love, and they wonder what it would sound like for someone to attack their vulnerability. This show is not shy about using the relative experience and intelligence of its main characters and the tool of shifting perspective and point of view to expose and dissect these emotions, and the show\'s artistic decisions, skills, and quality make these uncomfortable emotional positions easy and even enjoyable to take in.I really like this show, and I may even love it - time will tell. I don\'t like the same thing in every show, but usually I will choose to value a show based on what it does differently or well. Because of how it spoke to me early in its runtime, these little-picture moments were what I looked forward to every episode, and they never stopped coming, and they never stopped impacting me. The way the show realistically, artfully, and honestly attacks the brokenness and weaknesses of its characters reminds me a lot of OreGairu and Charlie Kaufman\'s movies, which I love as well.I don\'t think this show will be seen in the future as a pivotal or groundbreaking work, and if its rating continues to fall, it may not end up even being popular beyond a season where 3/4 of everything else was canceled. So if you read some reviews or watch the first episode, and decide that it\'s not for you, or you\'re not sure how much you like or identify with the characters, just skip the show, you won\'t miss much. On the other hand, if you read some reviews, watch one episode, and feel sucked into the ""2meirl4meirl"" vibe, this show is a must-watch.', ""Don't waste your time - NOTHING happens here. Just some mundane people doing mundane things. No character development, no sweet love moments, no cool twists, even the drama is not up to par! Nothing. The two main female characters behave extremely inadequate and disrespectfully towards the male characters. I swear, if someone treated me like that - constantly changing their mind and giving me false hope - i would immediately kick them out of my life, rather than feeling bad AND CLING TO THEM!! I really don't know why I kept watching - probably was hoping for something to change, but then came the finale...which was downright cringeworthy.That aside, the animation, music and overall setting are on point - a typical slow-paced slice of life anime. I read here that the manga is good and I feel bad for the people who was looking forward to the series. which was downright cringeworthy.That aside, the animation, music and overall setting are on point - a typical slow-paced slice of life anime.

It's just all of them going back and forth with no proper conclusion to happen whatsoever....I very much rather if it was about the side characters Kinoshita, Minato and Chika. They were actually a lot more likeable than the MCs tbh. I thought I liked Haru but the more I watched the show, the less...I liked her just as much as the rest....I had high hopes for this series but yeah I just couldn't stick it any longer.

Who will you meet at the intersection before moving on?Rikuo Uozumi is stuck. A college graduate with no future goals and a dead-end job. His friends have begun their lives as adults, leaving him behind. Throughout Sing Yesterday for Me, he encounters other stuck people. Shinako, his old friend from school and now a full-time teacher, struggles to move on from a loved one’s death. The two reconnect when she comes back to town for a local job. She seemingly always had a vision...for her future, Rikuo admires that. He conflates his desire to find purpose with his unrequited love for Shinako. After he confesses to her early on, her choice to just stay friends is for the best because until Rikuo figures himself out. You’d expect them to both grow as people and come together, but that was not the case. There is no real growth, and what we get is artificial at best. Sing Yesterday for Me is a trainwreck moving at 5 miles per hour.Then there’s Haru, an eccentric high school dropout with no future goals, only her love for Rikuo. They’re both so dysfunctional it’s easy to picture them sorting through their problems together like the nuanced romance in Welcome to the NHK—this is not the case with Yesterday. What we get is miles less interesting. Yesterday’s outlook on the world is bleak and hopeless, similar to that of an immature teenager struggling with adolescent melancholy. “The world sucks, I hate everyone. No one gets me.” Although the use of symbolism to convey this mood is commendable, it’s skin deep and juvenile. I must not be in the target audience because everything about this show made me want to take a permanent nap.Rikuo immaturely believes he can’t find meaning in his life without a girlfriend’s help; This is the logic of a high schooler. Shinako has what he lacks, but if you enter a relationship expecting your partner to give you what is missing, you will be disappointed. That’s just not how life is. For a man in his mid-20s, Rikuo has more in common with a neckbeard manchild. He’s bland, frustrating, and he has less spine than a jellyfish. In response, you may say flawed people can be good characters—that’s sometimes true, but in this case, it isn’t. Rikuo never learns what is wrong with his outlook towards finding a goal. He never grows up by the end. In his own words, he is “high on the idea of being an outcast.” He is indecisive, he rarely commits to anything, he makes terrible decisions, and his behavior is inconsistent. We’ve all been there, but people change. They grow up.One moment Rikuo will be frozen with awkwardness while Shinako talks to him, but in the next moment, he will smugly shrug off his coworker, asking who she is. Like any blank slate character, he is completely apathetic. If you can’t self-insert into this manchild wish-fulfillment fantasy, you have no reason to watch it. Despite still being in love with Shinako, he continues to lead on Haru. He is well aware that Haru is in love with him, yet he still hangs around her because he needs a backup option. Anyone who treats potential love interests like this is the scum of the Earth. If you genuinely relate to this man, consider that women aren’t objects.As Shinako spends more time with Rikuo, inevitably, Haru gets thrown under the bus. For the latter half of the show, she becomes an afterthought. She’s proud to be his side-hoe. I’m not a fan of Haru, but it’s infuriating to watch Rikuo lead her on and treat her like a dog. Rikuo never commits to his feelings for her. However, I understand his aversion to her. Haru is supposed to be adorably persistent. Instead, she comes off as irritatingly persistent. She appears at the most convenient (or inconvenient) times. Rain or shine, night or day, she finds her way to Rikuo’s doorstep or his job, always unannounced, to intrude on his mundane life. She follows him during the night, observing him from a distance, appearing when he is alone to comfort him with reaffirming attention. Like a stalker, she always seems to know where he is. Does the writer think this is how real women act? The majority of Haru’s scenes are spent with Rikuo, talking about him, or thinking about him. With a change in music and framing, this could have easily been a horror story. For some reason, the show never calls her out on being a creepy omnipresent stalker, so we’re just supposed to accept it. Good luck getting a restraining order, Rikuo. Characters like her get created to teach the depressed loner protagonist to appreciate life and all its adventures. Her secretive past and present prevent her from being developed. The more I learned about her identity, the less I cared. She’s just not interesting. Despite Haru’s curious personality, with her pet crow perched on her shoulder, she never becomes more than an archetype. An accessory to Rikuo.“Rikuo is an asshole. He doesn’t think about how I feel. He thinks I’m settling for being the backup. I hate that bastard!” She looked at the guy once, then fell and love, and now he treats her like a plastic bag. I’m a believer in love at first sight—this is not love. By design, Haru is a Mary Sue existing only to shower the hero with unconditional love. It’s generic, cheesy, and boring. Haru proclaims she is Shinako’s rival in the battle to win Rikuo’s heart. In that one moment, I related to Shinako. We both looked at Haru and wondered, “This girl is batshit crazy.” In the awkward conversations between Haru and Shinako, in which their words are implied rather than spoken, their awkward glances say more about the writer’s uncertainty than the characters. Neither of these characters has a personality outside of their confusing love for Rikuo. These cringe-worthy exchanges, repeated ad nauseam, are enough to embarrass any self-conscious director.Shinako. What’s her deal? Why can’t she make up her mind? It’s been six years since her boyfriend died, and she’s still crying. She hangs around his little brother Rou, and he now has a crush on her, so it’s no wonder why she hasn’t gotten over her ex. There’s not much to say about him. Rou is possessive of Shinako. He comments about Shinako wearing make-up, suggesting he believes she might be interested in a man. When he finds Uozumi talking to her, he becomes enraged and confronts him while he’s at work. His desperation to protect her is just bald face misogyny mistaken for romantic interest. He’s a normal kid, and he develops predictably. Shinako’s indecisiveness to move on from Rou and her ex is frustrating. Her desire to help Rikuo stems from her need to help herself, which is evident to anyone except her. Her problems are of her own doing. I will sum up her entire character arc in two sentences: “It’s not you, it’s me” and “I think we should just be friends while I figure myself out.” We have all seen this archetypal character countless times, and this ancient 90s manga adaptation did nothing original. Why does Rikuo love someone so generic? That’s easy.Early on, Shinako says, “You give the impression of someone who needs to be taken care of.”“That might be why I like her,” Rikuo monologues. And isn’t that every man’s dream? A relationship with a woman that takes care of you for life.There are a few background characters who furnish the scenes in between the love quadrangle interactions. They exist to prompt the main characters to exposit their life story and current feelings towards their love interests. A few side love interests pop into the show for a single episode to shake up the Love Quadrangle. After they get their miniature character arc, they’re gone forever. It’s the laziest way to get rid of a character short of randomly killing them. You’ll quickly realize their existence was just a distraction from the main plot akin to a filler episode. The script also suffers from what I call “Cafe-syndrome” in which the writer uses a cafe/restaurant whenever he needs to spoon-feed exposition to the audience. After all, this is a love story about children, except the characters look like adults to seem mature. I hate this new trend of anime about “adults” when they are indiscernible from angsty teens. Take away the cigarettes, give them school uniforms, no one would bat an eye.The script is so artificial and contrived that not even the talented animators at DogaKobo could save it. Although, it would’ve helped to be less faithful to the manga art. The background art is drab and uninteresting. Characters’ apartments appear sparsely decorated, but the art quality is crystal clear. When the artists can design pretty backgrounds, like a grocery store, they use real photos with a gaussian blur creating a hideous effect. It’s supposed to feel artistic, but it just looks lazy. The story would’ve been more suited as a live-action adaptation because it strives to be realistic. The loose line-work on the character designs worked against this. As a stylistic choice, it made no sense. Animation requires a level of suspension of disbelief, preventing you from immersing entirely. With live-action actors, they could have captured the subtle character responses the script needed. The animation medium has done less than nothing to benefit it.It’s not always an ugly show, but it’s always poorly produced: Rough editing, distracting staging, and an endless stream of plot contrivances that you can predict to the moment. Scenes are stitched together with too much breathing room or none at all. Within seconds the scene will change multiple times with different characters, times of day, and location. The production is incomprehensible, yet the writing is incredibly simplistic. Invariably, musical cues get used to direct the audience on how to feel. As a last-ditch effort to save the script, the music hardly elevates it beyond mediocrity. Most egregiously, to underscore pivotal moments of romance and regret. Aside from those moments, the score gets scarcely used. Awkward pauses plague the script, devoid of music as if the director was uncertain what emotion they were trying to evoke. Other times musical cues will signalize humor where there is none. Given this was adapted from a 90s manga, the comedy is pretty outdated. Exceptional audiovisuals could’ve enhanced this faux-intellectual story. Instead, the entire show felt like one long elevator ride to nowhere.As popular as this animated mundanity has become, it’s trainwreck ending is likely critic-proof. Designed for self-insertion, an infinite number of reasons will get fabricated to excuse the vapid writing. If I can convince just one of you to look beyond the milquetoast characters and vacuous script of Sing Yesterday for Me and watch the infinitely better Welcome to the NHK instead, then my hours of boredom will have been worth it. for her future, Rikuo admires that.

You would root for one or more characters. In itself it didn't stand for much; it was rather 100% supported by the apparent complexity of the characters, and you know what happens when a support fails. Also the Drama genre is not bad per se, but it needs to be properly dealt with, with proper pacing. Some say they rushed the story too much (it was supposed to be 18 episodes long instead...of the current 12) so it would be fair to say a lot got lost in translation and and the COVID factor affecting animation studios didn't help.Art 4/10: Could've been better but it's still watchable.

Or that they think about anything beyond their immediate surroundings. Or that they have well-defined personalities to begin with. For a romantic drama, you need some kind of chemistry between the characters. Well, apparently not here because here we have the characters stand around saying nothing of relevance. That simply doesn't work. No matter how slice-of-life your...story is, no matter how artistic the visuals or sound, you need to actually weave some words into it. In Yesterday, sometimes the events in the plot advance, sure, but the characters barely ever contemplate the motives behind their actions with any real precision, so the events simply happen.First, take our protagonist, Rikuo. He likes Shinako, but why? They went to the same university and hanged out a lot and... that's it. He can't even put it to words why on a basic level. What is it about Shinako's personality that he likes? I don't know, and I bet he doesn't know either. Even after he is rejected by her, he still clings to her indefinitely. And this problem goes beyond the romance itself. Rikuo is really averse to explicitly thinking about things. He goes with the flow and doesn't do or say much. No matter the topic, this guy has nothing to say. For instance, he is stuck in an unrewarding, monotonous job at a grocery store despite having a university degree. What does he think about it? Nothing much. He just does it out of apathy and neither praises nor criticizes the situation all that much. If it is society's fault, eviscerate it. If it is your own fault, berate yourself. Take some stance on something, please. Anything else? Seen anything interesting on the news lately? Apparently not. Any semi-witty jokes to deliver? Nah, none.Why does Haru like Rikuo? For reasons that are also poorly established. What is it about Rikuo's personality that she likes? I have no clue. They had barely even met before. Now he even purposely neglects and ignores her, and she still doesn't give up for whatever reason.Shinako can't get over her previous love interest, who died many years earlier. (They never actually dated either, mind you.) This is the main defining trait of her character, and almost all of her dialogue revolves around it. She has friendzoned Rikuo in a half-hearted manner while still giving him just enough hope to cling to. She has even less to say than Rikuo.Rou is the brother of Shinako's dead love interest and believes that he is the best option for Shinako simply because they knew each other as kids. In fact, he is upset at the very notion that she might date someone else. How dare she! His entire character revolves around Shinako. Of course, I don't know what exactly he likes about Shinako's personality either. She has friendzoned him too (or family-zoned him, I guess), but he clings to her anyway.Some of the ending songs are nice, but that is obviously not enough to save this.

I know it is meant to look realistic, but even so.You may have noticed a theme in this review, and it is that I was bored out of my mind and quite frankly should have dropped it earlier. But here we are. My main motivation for watching the last few episodes: morbid curiosity about how they would screw up the ending. And without going into spoilers, disastrous it was, as it was a rushed ending that was missing build-up and justification. With all the changes, it is fair to call it an anime-only ending as well. I really need to emphasize how terrible the adaptation is. They cut out much of the content, entire plotlines, and even many side characters who were important for the plot and were able to at least shake up the status quo a bit. With all this cut, the ending feels all the more rushed and jarring. That said, the manga was already flawed. The dialogue was still often stale, and many of the feelings of love still seemed poorly justified. However, the adaptation efforts do matter because instead of a “meh” or slightly bad show we have an unmitigated trainwreck.Actually, no. Trainwrecks may actually be interesting in the sense that you can't turn your eyes away from them. This is more like boredom incarnate. story is, no matter how artistic the visuals or sound, you need to actually weave some words into it. In Yesterday, sometimes the events in the plot advance, sure, but the characters barely ever contemplate the motives behind their actions with any real precision, so the events simply happen.First, take our protagonist, Rikuo. He likes Shinako, but why? They went to the same university and hanged out a lot and... that's it. He can't even put it to words why on a basic level. What is it about Shinako's personality that he likes? I don't know, and I bet he doesn't know either. Even after he is rejected by her, he still clings to her indefinitely. And this problem goes beyond the romance itself. Rikuo is really averse to explicitly thinking about things. He goes with the flow and doesn't do or say much. No matter the topic, this guy has nothing to say. For instance, he is stuck in an unrewarding, monotonous job at a grocery store despite having a university degree. What does he think about it? Nothing much. He just does it out of apathy and neither praises nor criticizes the situation all that much. If it is society's fault, eviscerate it. If it is your own fault, berate yourself. Take some stance on something, please. Anything else? Seen anything interesting on the news lately? Apparently not. Any semi-witty jokes to deliver? Nah, none.Why does Haru like Rikuo? For reasons that are also poorly established. What is it about Rikuo's personality that she likes? I have no clue. They had barely even met before. Now he even purposely neglects and ignores her, and she still doesn't give up for whatever reason.Shinako can't get over her previous love interest, who died many years earlier.

A coming of age tale that was a nicely paced slice of life. At least, that\'s what it looks like on the surface. This anime was probably the biggest disappointment that I\'ve ever experienced. The MC is unlikable to a ridiculous level(Bland attitude to everyone except his love interest, whom he simps heavily for, and acts like a complete prick to the girl who says she\'s into him), and any attempts at romance in the show are just bogged down over and over again by cliche after cliche. The main character just throws the...show into the mud, and makes it sad because some of the other characters, like haru(in some cases) or rou, are actually really interesting. And as I keep watching, I can\'t help but notice the level of Character development drop more and (SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 5) in the latest episode, Rikuo is just talking completely normally with Shinako, but then the other love interest walks in cliche literally DESTROYS the scene from something that should be beautiful into something that\'s cringy. 5 MINUTES LATER, the producer\'s play the ""character being oblivious to the point of anger"" card when Minato is coming into the shop every day, and Haru just SOMEHOW doesn\'t know that he\'s into her, given their past as well, and STILL decides to lead him on by spending an entire day with him, but rejects him anyways. I hope the anime gets better(Again, I was excited for it), but in all honesty, I don\'t think it will. show into the mud, and makes it sad because some of the other characters, like haru(in some cases) or rou, are actually really interesting.

I hope the anime gets better(Again, I was excited for it), but in all honesty, I don\'t think it will.', 'There is a particular pet peeve of mine that only recently has surface because there have been so many good examples of it. If I could describe Yesterday wo Utatte with it, the word would be ""Pretentious.""That is not to say everything about Sing ""Yesterday"" for Me was bad—in fact quite the opposite, but it\'s that exact reason that I want to breakdown exactly why I find YwU ultimately lackluster to what it could be.To start off I want to define what I mean by pretentious and explain why YwU fits that mold as well as it does. Ultimately a pretentious anime is a show/film...that thinks it\'s way more deep and complex than the writing actually reflects. A show can look as nice as it wants but if the writing is ultimately juvenile at best then what\'s the point? A show like the Monogatari series can use avant garde style directing and composition and it can work seamlessly because the writing takes itself seriously enough to treat its audience like adults and allows the viewer to interpret what certain actions by the characters mean.Something like YwU on the other hand is simultaneously trying to be ""deep"" as well as easily understandable to the general masses. This makes sense, it was originally a seinen manga not a novel. The problem is that YwU thinks it\'s really deep and is trying to be this somber SoL tale, but it doesn\'t trust it\'s audience enough to pick up the slack.Something you learn fairly early on in creative writing classes is the classic rule ""show don\'t tell."" I personally do not believe this has to be cardinal law, you can explain ideas without patronizing the audience, but YwU doesn\'t do that. Instead, it proceeds to explain the major traits and flaws with the core cast with clinical precision, not allowing for the audience to interpret for themselves. This behavior is seen even with the first episode and if a series starts out as insecure as it does then that\'s usually a bad omen. normal people don\'t spend time psychoanalyzing each other and themselves so when it shows up in a narrative it\'s extremely irritating for someone like me who already got the point. I mean it\'s an extremely slow moving SoL drama, I don\'t need to be explained the main characters\' issues with moving forward in life after you spent the last 22 minutes projecting through visuals and dialogue. And this wouldn\'t be a problem except it happens every episode for most of the show, so it\'s not something I can just overlook, this is simply how Kei Toume writes. And there\'s really only three main characters despite what the poster might make you believe, so there is only so much one needs to understand. For example, the main character is summarized so perfectly by their bio on MaL, you could easily predict where their arc is going to go from that alone.And as evidenced by the fact the MC could be described in two sentences means the characters in this show aren\'t necessarily that complex in the first place. Rikuo is kind of bland all things considered, seems like a bit of an audience stand in which isn\'t uncommon in anime but with a series that is trying to be ""deep"" it comes off as wanting your cake and eating it too. Haru is where things the characterization shines the best because none of it is explained directly but makes sense from what we see from her life for the most part.To talk about more positives, the directing of Yesterday wo Utatte is genuinely fantastic. I honestly came back after episode 3 after I constantly told myself I was going to drop it over and over simply because every time I started an episode, I got sucked in again. Yoshiyuki Fujiwara clearly read the source material and tried to make what would be an extremely slow and tedious series normally as engaging as humanly possible and he largely succeeds. I could probably count on my right hand how many times I slightly lost interest which is a sincere accomplishment for a show like this. The cinematography felt clear and precise; and the animation, especially in the beginning, is phenomenal. I don\'t know what kind of favors the director called in but wow it shows. There\'s Disappearance of Haruhi levels of smooth and that is a big compliment coming from me. The soundtrack, while nothing unexpected for this kind of show, perfectly conveys what each scene is trying to accomplish. If the digital backgrounds weren\'t inconsistent I would\'ve said YwU is one of the most well made shows of the year. (The most well made is Ishuzoku Reviewers, obviously)Which only makes it hurt more when things like the writing turn me off and break the immersion I so remotely experience with most media. And the lack of an OP with 3 ED\'s in a one cour show makes me feel like the show is trying too hard to be seen as special. Which it doesn\'t necessarily need, the anime takes place between 1997 and 1998, which in my opinion is part of the charm. It\'s a period piece, and despite the surreality of the main characters being old enough to be my parents if they were real, nevertheless gives it a charm that very few shows can claim. In fact the narrative only works at certain points because of the time period it\'s trying to portray.*Skip to the end if you wish to not read spoilers*The ending itself I\'m quite confused about, so I think the theme is that love is not just getting the attention of others but understanding one another. That\'s a great message but I don\'t think that was communicated very well.  Haru waits around the entire show for Rikuo to finally notice her but the point I thought was going to be made is that Haru is still a kid and Rikuo is a college grad, not only are their experiences vastly different but he kind of treated her like garbage for most of the show. Ultimately outside of no longer avoiding her family, Haru didn\'t learn anything. It\'s ok to follow a guy around you barely met and put on a facade of a manic pixie dream girl if it means the guy will eventually like you. And is Shinako now going to get with Rou? That entitled baby b**ch? WHY? If not the show didn\'t communicate that very well.I get what the author was trying to go for to a degree, I just think the ending would\'ve been vastly more poignant if she had committed to the realism seemingly initially sought after by the beginning. Rikuo and Shinako finding a comfortable distance and understanding what their true feelings are is great and I love that the show took that route. It just got caught in the parachute right before hitting the ground, it didn\'t die but tarnished an otherwise respectable feat.*End of Spoilers*Overall Yesterday wo Utatte is a disappointing experience that could\'ve been remedied if the writing over the course of the show substantiated the tone the work so effectively communicated. I will say running a serialized story over the course of almost 20 years is no small feat and I highly commend the author for doing such, I just wish they had planned things a bit better. I wouldn\'t be able to recommend this show to anyone because of it, it\'s too slow and artsy for the kind of audience that the writing would resonate with, but the writing is too weak to ignore for anyone who would appreciate the sheer craftsmanship of the work. More than anything else, that is the most disappointing.Now time to end my overly long and pretentious MAL review, just what this show needed. that thinks it\'s way more deep and complex than the writing actually reflects.

It had a predictable ending with zero-character development."", 'Probably this year\'s prime example of how the 12-episode format and the hardheaded insistence on it do more to damage anime than to help it thrive. Or even keep it alive, as the case were.Yesterday wo Utatte is about as common, simple and pedestrian a slice-of-life as a story can be, so if you expect it to distract you from real life, you\'re gonna be disappointed. The characters themselves are also perfectly normal, everyday people, if some of them a little too one-dimensional; I\'m sure many of us can find one or more we easily relate to (or could, at one point or another in...our lives). There isn\'t a whole lot of action, as befitting life in general - if anything, it spends a lot of time contemplating the trivial everydays in quiet melancholy. Mind and soul often take center stage, and even when a given character isn\'t outright analysing a stray thought or a fickle feeling, it\'s easy to pick up on how things are affecting them and why, almost as if reading all their diaries. Although it relies a little too much on ""coincidence"", and at a point feels like it\'ll adapt a wholly episodic storytelling where the side characters appear for an episode and then leave at the end, this seems to go on for a while, and if you like this sort of reflectional work, neither of these details will bother you.[SPOLERS AHEAD]It seems to go on like this... and ultimately that sort of becomes the downfall of the story. The problem is it barely (if ever) feels like any of the characters is going anywhere at all. Professionally, maybe, but even that\'s only the guys: Rikuo moves on from being a convenience store part-timer and finds a job he likes and is interested in doing, Rou finds a goal and manages to pursue it... But that\'s about the extent of it. With so much self-inspection, one would come to expect some form of growth. Changes to happen as people live their lives - changes that just aren\'t there. The stalker remains a stalker, the ""maybe-but-not-really"" couple dances their weird dance around each other, the woman who couldn\'t cope with the death of her crush never moves on from it... And they just keep hurting not only themselves but each other as well. The side characters seem to do more to push our main quartet forward than they do themselves, which, sure it happens, but not like this. It doesn\'t help that we\'re often not sure just how much time passes by between two scenes. There are cases when things are obviously directly connected, but about as many others where there\'s a gap in time between two events. Worse still is the fact that these gaps are absolutely random in size: they can be minutes as well as months (or more?). Such a generous application of erratic time skips really doesn\'t help make the story feel coherent at all.And then we arrive at the last episode. No opening, it picks things right up where the previous one left off, and goes straight for the drama. Then we get a somber, indeed beautifully done and realistic discussion between two people who, seemingly, finally grew up. The end. Except not really, there\'s another half to it, one that turns everything upside down. There is absolutely nothing to explain or justify anything that happens here, indeed Rikuo himself saying he doesn\'t know how to explain it is a perfect summary of it. I\'m not familiar with the source material - whatever the ending is, it might make perfect sense there. But that\'s exactly the elephant in the room. There\'s a huge amount of stuff that never made it into the anime... obviously, and that in itself would be just fine. However, for some inexplicable reason, it seems like whoever was responsible for it was not content leaving it unfinished and ending it on a note that would have made (at least a little) sense in the anime - no, they had to go for what is (apparently?) the original ending. Well, it fits about as well as the square peg in the round hole. Not only does the episode itself upset the whole tone and pacing set throughout the previous 11 episodes, switching to a lot more ""action-packed"" style; but it also comes off as a case of wanting to have the cake and eat it too.All in all, the ending becomes the bullet that\'s shot into the foot. Without it, the anime would be a decent romantic slice-of-life, with some flaws that one could sort of squint at and maybe overlook through rose-tinted glasses while reminscing about their own similar memories of childhood and youth. As it is, however, it amplifies those flaws to a magnitude where they turn the decent attempt into a butchered, disjointed mess, in which if you thought you\'d found characters to relate to, you\'ll conclude that they weren\'t characters, only certain traits or patterns - and they might actually be more harmful than you figured, too. It\'s a very unfortunate note to end a series on, and it might even leave a bitter enough aftertaste to discourage people from picking up the manga.Overall: 5/10, simply because the art and animation were really good at worst and outright beautiful at best, the sound and voices were also well done and contributed a lot to setting the atmosphere. However, the characters having a rather gaping flaw or two at best, and being wholly one-dimensional at worst, with an almost complete lack of growth, plus the lack of any moral to the story in the end really soured whatever enjoyment the contemplations in the first half or so may have offered.

Here, I guess it boils down to being a victim of this nonsensical anime format.', 'As a manga reader, this is the worst job they could do as an adaptation.Rush things is normal and common, but when you just cut everything out and remove all important side character in a SLICE OF LIFE, this just became a mess.If you haven\'t read the manga, give it a try and taste one of the best slice of life you\'ll ever see or just watch this ""adaptation"" that looks like a different thing.I\'m really sad with this because the first episode was so good that made my hopes go to the ceiling.It\'s not DogaKobo fault or something, i know what happens to an...anime that don\'t make money and stuff like that. Damn you, producers. anime that don\'t make money and stuff like that. Damn you, producers.', 'If Scums Wish and Domestic Girlfriend had a child.I think this anime is a pioneer in the field of seinen and slice of life, two genres which are my favourite. I recommend this to anyone who likes either of this genre along with romance.The anime might feel a little childish at first but this anime gives off the vibe of Blue Period while merging into the romance genre, the show is slow in dialogue but its actually very crammed into 12 episode and a lot of emotions and stories are conveyed in as little time as possible. The main takeaway from this anime...is ""Value the present more than the past"". is ""Value the present more than the past"".', 'Yesterday.......All my troubles seemedSo far away...Now it looks as throughThey\'re here to stayOh I believe in yesterday.....Ok, so the series\'  title was ""Yesterday wo Utatte"" or Sing ""yesterday"" For me, funny that this anime so much so has that thing about , Paul McCartney\'s song \'Yesderday"" , cu\'z , if one was to observe this seires as a whole everything has something to do as to how the past affected the character\'s in this anime , so basically it wasn\'t much of a surprise that this series\' genre was about coming of age cu\'z as the anime progresses we see as to how the...characters develop.

When he got to know about Shinako getting along with Rikou, he felt a level of jealousy where he thinks that Shinako was playing him for Rikou , the part of the song where he needs to find a place to hide away was him seeing Shinkao getting cozy with Rikou.... the last part was from the manga where he went to France and Shinako waits for his return.Enjoyment- Good 7: It was enjoyable watching it where it doesn\'t feel like a chore, but I can deny my disgust to the two characters Rikou and Shinako, cu\'z one was a dickwand while the other was an indecisive weak bitch.....Overall- Very Good 8: The score was for the clean ending, so don\'t expect a season 2, ever, cu\'z this was very good as it is characters develop.

That is a tricky question. You see, cinema, movies or any kind of other entertainment, you can consider it a medium. It is a kind of meditation, it's the 'beneficial time' that you get out of it that is very important, if you do get any. You might spend watching an anime or doing something else for hours, but you might get an experience worth much...more than the time you spent watching or performing the task that will answer a question you've been longing to answer.I'm an adult and let me honest, I'm enjoying this to its fullest, it might be not for your reasons, but I have my own reasons. I like Uozumi for the fact that he is patient, relatively-mature and despite being pretty confused and sometimes quick-tempered, I felt I could relate to him. I gained some life-lessons from his experience and it helped me apply it to my own life and see it in a different perspective. I understood where I am and where should I go now. I am not very passionate about life or the things I do, neither is Uozumi, I need someone to push me so I could do something. If I am not pushed, I might as well just stay in the same place and don't bother. I have some things I love doing and I am okay with staying where I am and doing what I like when I want to. Seeing his experience has given me ideas what he did wrong, what I did wrong as well, and what could be different.Manga vs Anime?First of all, there are some minor scenes that are left out and will be left out, but as a whole, it doesn't really impact the story that MUCH. If I am being honest, it's great they focus on the main story which seems less confusing and distracting compared to reading the manga. You might be tempted to read it as well and you can, there is nothing to lose. Go ahead, read the manga, I was reading it and almost finished it. I don't mind seeing the ending, because there is a lot of information to take in, which is why I am still going to finish the anime to see the story being more fleshed out and focused on the main events.Closing remarksYou might think the story might be pretty unrealistic, but it is only because you are looking from the perspective of the viewer. As a person in a real-life scenario, it probably wouldn't be so obvious. In fact, I've had similar situations and found this anime to be relatively accurate, even though I didn't have so many acquaintances who had such relationships. If you haven't found an answer to something similar as me and want some insight on your life, you might as well enjoy this anime along the way. It doesn't take too much time to watch an episode or two a day, does it?By the way, remember I said I had a similar experience?I chose Haru.

The art looks great, the mature tone is adequate and it looked promising, when I still had hopes for a good character arc for the main characters. Sadly, there is not. The characters don\'t really change or learn anything and the flow of the episodes gets to a dead point in the second half.Up until episode 7, I was enjoying this anime quite a lot. Things seemed to be progressing. But from episode 8 at the very start it all begins to go down. It starts with quite many events that, although they are not a big deal...they are depicted in a somehow more realistic tone than the usual, and they were important for the characters. There are a couple of scenes that show determination in some characters, and I was hoping the rest of them would learn from that and also have their moments later on.Too bad I was so wrong. The characters don\'t advance at all from episode 8. The episodes are filled with pauses, contemplation of the nothingness, and repetition of the same situations (the boring ones) we already saw. When something appears to change, it immediately doesn’t. Most of the times due to the extreme shyness, laziness or whatever craziness the main “adult” characters have in their heads. I feel like the show would have been so much better if Haru and Rou were the main characters. They know what they want and they work for it even if it means to suffer from it. Completely the opposite of Rikuo and Shinako…The worst characters are the main ones, Rikuo and Shinako. Both are so empty of drive that look just as bored as the audience. Haru is more interesting, but the whole thing of ""crow girl"" that gave her an interesting introduction doesn\'t really lead anywhere. In the end the reason she is so madly in love with such a useless guy as Rikuo is completely empty. Plus, we don\'t really see her much in the second half of the show. On the other hand, we see quite a lot of Rou, but it doesn’t really add anything new to what we know in the first half.Side note for a thing that particularly bothered me: Rikuo gasps, breaths and sighs more than he talks. It drove me nuts. It perfectly shows how passive this character is. At some points it was just too ridiculous.The plot is so limited that it completely relies on the characters, and the characters don’t hold up. The only way I think someone can enjoy this is watching it in a couple sessions top, so that the “power” of the initial episodes lasts until the end.First 7 episodes: 8/10Last 5 episodes: 2/10Note: Check the date when reviews were posted.

What a disappointing end for an otherwise beautifully colored anime. I\'m only basing my reaction from the anime, and boy I have to tell you why I was so unsatisfied. But first, I have to be generous.Art Style 7/10:The anime is very beautiful. There are a lot of wallpaper-worth shots here, and it certainly got my enthusiasm. However, it hurts to see some wacky animation frames, even in scenes that are supposed to be dramatic! Still, it definitely improves the atmosphere so well (but it\'s not enough for the atrocity of the rest...).Sound Design 8/10:Very immersive, I must say....I can only criticize the last ED choice, which is ironic since it sings the anime title itself. Apart from the song choices, the background music can be quite uplifting. It does carry a good weight for the anime\'s mood and atmosphere.Character 3/10:Here is where things fell off hard. The audacity of the anime to introduce so many heartfelt characters only to butcher the developments (even the most minor of such for what could have been the best characters) and plaster a terrible and pretentious open-ended conclusion. The pacing started off with gentle steps on the side of the road then it crashed on the river beside it, only to flow so fast along the raging water. Why?! Why ruin such a good setup of characters and conflict and ""resolve"" it over a measly face-value approach to the reality of things?Short breaths. Sometimes, it felt like only two characters are legitimate (even in their being stubborn). Sometimes, it felt like only two characters are reasonable. Then there were the frustrating parts where it felt like only two characters are given proper spotlight. I get it. It severely lacked a satisfying character progression for the size of cast that it showed. There was even an episodic take early on to explore the main characters further. Then the pacing, as demonstrated earlier, suddenly jumped to a mess. I felt like the anime only suffered from introducing multiple perspectives. There are strong quotes even from just the 1st episode, but it\'s the pacing (especially for a strongly character-centric anime and genre) that went up and down in a very disappointing way. I feel like it is a massive disservice to the characters and their reflections of actual people.Story 3/10:I rarely feel a strong and direct Visual Novel vibe from an anime, specifically due to the recurrence of specific points. This is not a complaint. I think it actually improved the immersion, and it could have allowed room for a smoother pace and better focus on the actual weight of the material. However, the anime managed to step on the good qualities of the anime by its sudden shift in progression. I hate to rehash previous points, but overall, I feel like the anime needed 24 episodes to be more convincing.Notes:Will I recommend this anime? Sure. Simply for the aesthetic. If you have anounce of respect for immersion with characters, please do not give this a shot. I wish I did not project so much personality to the characters that overrode the level of the actual presentation. And I will stand by this thought. It is not petty. The least amount of thing you can do for a slice-of-life and romance anime (that is serious in nature) is to be considerate of the characters and the reality of their progression. This anime broke my heart. I entered into its world without any ideas, found myself feeling affection for the developments, then ended up with a terrible conclusion. I wish no one will get this feeling of disappointment for a once beloved anime. I can only criticize the last ED choice, which is ironic since it sings the anime title itself.

Whether struggling in romance or towards other general life aspirations, each character feels complex with emotions and motivations that are just as vague and confusing to the characters themselves as they are to the audience, and it makes them feel very human instead of the usual tropey caricature. The writing is excellent thus far, with the right amount of glimpses shown about the characters' pasts: enough to draw connection to how their past relates to  their current problems; hints that they have far more real history as people than the show will...explore; without oversaturation of flashbacks which take away from the development in their current lives. explore; without oversaturation of flashbacks which take away from the development in their current lives."", ""Okay, I guess I know what the author tried to transmit with this story; love is confusing and all that stuff.

Though it\'s certainly not free of contrived moments and frustrating actions, all the elements of the show good and bad work together to portray the complexities of relationships - from the couple involved to friends and peers and the ensuing dynamics.The description really doesn\'t do this show justice - though there are misunderstandings, they...are far from the irritating frustration felt in classic romance anime. And past the surface lies a deeply moving and resonant message about our expectations of others and ourselves that anyone can go ""ah ha! that\'s low key me"" too.Though by no means perfect, Sing Yesterday for Me is a masterfully taken snapshot of a human experience we all eventually come to share. It\'s really been worth a watch so far! are far from the irritating frustration felt in classic romance anime.

It\'s really been worth a watch so far!', 'The beginning was just shinako bitching about having a crush on a guy in high school that she never officially dated and using that as an excuse to stay single. This show was very enjoyable in the middle of the series. The middle showed shinako moving on and accepting feelings for the mc. But then the shit show started. They start dating and shinako can barely hug him let alone kiss him. She does the same thing for mc and little bitch boy who wants to date his dead brothers crush and calls that a relationship. Bitch boy tries to be forceful and gets rejected...like 4 times and never accepts it. Shinako goes from saying that all she wants mc to do is stay by her side, followed by heer chasing another guy literally 2 minutes later. Atleast in the end mc gets to be with haru but still wtf was this bullshit with shinako chosing bitch boy after rejecting him 4 times. She used he’s like my brother excuse while cooking for him everyday and saying she wishes she could always cook for him. Bitch boy had a reason for falling in love but shinako’s reason was he kind of looks like his older brother and he wants to take his brothers place as my spouse so i might as well accept it. This show was half great half absolute dog shit. If you have the chance do not watch this or else you will wish you hadn’t. Or stop at episode 11 and ignore the last scene with bitch boy interrupting. Anyways thats all i have to say about this shit show like 4 times and never accepts it.

This is not a bad show, because it aims to convey how true love is, which only contains pain and tears. Yesterday wo Utatte is about anime is as...fun to possible, and it never really aims to fill that gap with a lot of substance or meaning. The starting and ending points are the same.Maybe they want to feel bad. Maybe they just want to feel emotions, any emotions. But I will make sure you feel something. love is a difficult thing, and teenagers are at the most confusing stage of their lives.Maybe this is too strange because basically their rival, Haru is utter garbage. Actually this is a love story of Rikuo and Shinako, the appearance of Haru makes this story more complicated and so heavy.  Besides Haru, there is also someone who has the same character he is Rou, I don't understand why they made a rival that has no meaning?  Is it to broaden the story?Besides having a bad character, I also don't like the background.  I was disappointed with Doga Kobo, I thought this would be the same as the Koisuru Asteroid that aired previous season.  The background in this show is very boring, the setting is just the same, it makes no difference, chairs in parks, apartments, and restaurants.  Are they not able to make other ideas, like in a love hotel?But I like how they convey dialogue with cinematography.  This is a good show because in this season only this show has the genre romance. fun to possible, and it never really aims to fill that gap with a lot of substance or meaning.

And perhaps this resounds more to me than ever before as the characters of Yesterday wo Utatte are of my age right now -- an age where one is faced with the fact that ""reality is a lovely place, but I would not want to live there"" (quoting Adam Young / Owl City in the song ""The Real World"").What stuck me the most here is the minimalist treatment of the story. Four characters that balance each other\'s personalities, 1990s timeline and setting, the wise use of soundtrack -- and the lack of it,...and a nostalgic art style that reminds me of anime art direction of my childhood. The lack of other frivolities helped stand out the realism that the story, the art style, and the characters portray, and that\'s a leap of faith from a studio known for shows causing moe overdose.After watching the first five episodes, I think I\'d love to get lost in this series, and later find my way together with Rikuo, Haru, Shinako, Rou, and everyone else. But I understand that not everyone would appreciate a show that dilly-dallies story development for more characterization, hence this show rests very unstable in a niche that is quite ""lost"" amidst your typical SoLs.Would I recommend watching Yesterday wo Utatte? By all means, get lost in its world and find your way back to reality with it and through it. Just don\'t expect too much. And we still have quite a long way to go anyway... and a nostalgic art style that reminds me of anime art direction of my childhood.

And we still have quite a long way to go anyway...', ""Man, this anime is getting a shitload of unnecesary hate, and I think a lot of people might not be judging it objectively of for what it is. I mean, first of all, this is an anime itself, not just a copy of the manga with more movement and voices, so even if I'm not doubting that the development of the manga might be different and better, the anime had some limitations concerning time and budget, so made an alternative order of facts and, in my opinion, got a pretty fair result. I mean, 9 might be a pretty high grade, and my standarts are...lower than most of the MAL community; I don't think the anime deserves less than a 4 though, and I'll try to explain why I think so by analyzing each aspect of it. [Spoiler alert, if you haven't watched the anime I recommend you to take a look at the first episode at least, might be a worthy experience].Story - 8I mean, for a manga reader this might be a joke. It's obvious that the anime rushed a lot of the development from the manga, and made more than a hundred chapters in only 12 episodes plus 6 specials that I guess nobody watched. Would it be better for the anime to not adapt the whole manga and have and end completely opened? Don't think so, people apparently love Haru so much that if the season ended with Rikuo still hanging out with Shinako, probably a lot of people would be unsatisfied and I think the producers thought exactly that- I mean, don't get me wrong, Haru is incredibly charismatic and lovely, but it was coherent that Rikuo prefered Shinako, and I would be fine with that ending-. Now, if the anime had 24 episodes instead of 12, or even 13 or 14, the story would probably have a more peaceful pace, and would have some time to base better the ending.Though, 12 episodes is what we got, and I think the script of the anime is still decent if you stop to think about it. I will discuss only the final episode because it's definetely the point of tension about the anime: it was coherent enough. Rikuo breaks with Shinako, sees that their relationship is going nowhere because of Shinako's fear of changing things, and while Shinako is worried about her relationship with Rou being broken, Rikuo thinks about how he neglicted Haru. Then, there's the scene on the train, where direction and script are really meaningful to portray Rikuo's internal chaos of feelings until he realizes that not only he wants Haru relations to just go back to 'normal', wich he knew would not happen and would end just as his relation with Shinako at the beggining of the anime, and just by inertia he decides he must confess to her, even if he's not sure whether he loves her or not. Surely there could be more construction to it, but then it would be different, it would not have the same message, and it's really closing the question that was raised on the first episode, about just being afraid of making any effort and fail and being just complacent with life.Well, I've already got off my chest all that I've felt of the last episode. Not gonna lie, it was a nice therapy. Well, going back to the main point, history really evidences it's rush and lacks more completion on it's ending, since there isn't any fanservice showing the future or anything like that, but from my point of view (and this point is very personal, I understand anybody rating the story like 3 or 4 but not less), it's very solid.Character - 9I mean, nothing to say about Haru, she's in fact amazing and everybody agrees. Now, apart from some side character that, even if they feel incredibly real, do not have more that 20 minutes of screen time, we have 3 other characters to analyze. I won't stop on each of them because damn, that analysis of the story was so boring and exhaustive that I don't think anybody is still reading at this point. Consequently, I'll just ask you to think about any of their traits that isn't realistic, relatable and very well-written. You may disagree, and I really believe development in the manga might be better, but c'mon, they're mostly the same characters and I've felt like each of them is not only a gag, nor a trait, nor a deep character, but just almost complete persons. And if Yesterday wo Utatte has something that stands out is it's realism.Art - 10Well, don't get me wrong. Yesterday wo Utatte doesn't have the best animation on history, but I really don't think it needs to be so in order to get my 10. Direction is pretty organic and really captures the essence of each movement, as well as design and cenarios are portraited in such a way that this will potentially be the closest thing you'll found to a realistic anime visual. Also, even if it's not completely outstanding it might still be by far the best aesthetic work made by Studio Doga Kobo, and the passion and wit put into it is pretty much undeniable.Sound - 6I'm not really into judging sound yet, so my opinion will be very superficial. Sound design is good and voice acting has some nice peaks, but i really felt the lack of soundtrack on the background of many scenes. I'm not really a guy that gives extreme importance to soundtrack, but if you do this is definetely a weak point of the anime.Enjoyment - 10Enjoyment is personal, and anime hits people differently depending on their experiences, moment and feelings. Yesterday wo Utatte was there in the right time, I'm facing some anxiety about dealing with problems and starting my path for becoming an adult, and so was really invested on the whole story. I also love to analyze deeply the characters and story of anime that I find interesting, and it's not like I have anything better to do on Sunday at 2:00 AM. So yeah, maybe I've overrated this anime by giving more value to my interpretations of it's greatness than to the real story, and I'm sorry if I've sound like a fanboy trying to explain something that is not really on the screen; but maybe I'm exactly that. While some people might be exceeding with their hate, I do really love this anime.Overall - 9 lower than most of the MAL community; I don't think the anime deserves less than a 4 though, and I'll try to explain why I think so by analyzing each aspect of it.

This is worth giving a try, if you don\'t mind a rather slow narrative.At first, the story focuses a lot on our main protagonist, Rikuo, showing some of his backstory and how he got into the situation he\'s in, which is pretty convincing. As it continues, more characters are introduced to us, such as Haru, Shinako and Rou, then, with most of the...cast already set, the show gradually gives more focus towards the relationships between each other and more detail to the drama concerning Rou and Shinako\'s past. And lastly, but avoiding spoilers, the path each one will take regarding their romantic relationships.With that said, I\'d like to point out some things about the story.While there\'s plenty space for the romance, it feels like there isn\'t much focus on their careers and efforts, such as Rikuo\'s lack of ambition or Rou\'s aspiration for fine arts, as they start to fade and become more of a background. As for the romance, it has a slow development and they keep extending it, and there\'s no problem with that. Yet, at a certain moment, its noticeable a pretty sudden turn in the events surrounding the relationship of all four of them, without any hints for these changes whatsoever.Aside from the story and its elements of romance, its characters are quite great.Even though the story may have not explained some of their actions beforehand, I felt like their characteristics and thoughts weren\'t bad, and quite the opposite, they were rather understandable. That is, most of their expressions and thoughts were somewhat similar to what you would expect from someone real, and wouldn\'t be odd if you can relate to them while watching the show.Still, it\'s up to you want to watch it or not. And I hope the review helped to decide. cast already set, the show gradually gives more focus towards the relationships between each other and more detail to the drama concerning Rou and Shinako\'s past.

It has a different air/atmosphere to most of the other anime I've been watching lately, which I think is great.What I like most so far in the series are definitey the characters and the aesthetics. The characters are very realistic and human. Also, none of the characters are stand in for the watchers, as in they all have their own personalities, whether you find them agreeable or think negatively of them is up to you. About the aesthetics, what I like is that there aren't any flashy...fight scenes or special effects that are hard on the eyes. Furthermore, some of the scenes ae absolutely gorgeous, like the shot of Rikuo's ex smoking towards the end of episode 6.Basically, it's a fresh breath from other anime, it has a mature atmosphere, and the art is pleasing.

To get the full experience you have to think/analyze the characters and their true motives.This show hides so much between the lines, therefore it requires the viewer to be actively watching. The characters in this show might seem simple at first but they are truly fleshed out and have a lot of depth.

I then watched a trailer, and was drawn in by the chill aesthetic and promising ""mature romance."" Sadly, after watching the 11th episode this morning, I can conclude that this anime is a complete travesty, and I couldn\'t contain the sheer vitriol I had for it.You walk into this show expecting a mature, grounded and realistic romance story concerning a small group of people. You expect each of these characters to bounce off of each other in interesting ways. Most importantly, you expect actual meaningful events to...occur regarding said characters.What you will find instead, is an empty nothing of a show.Watching this show, you will get used to angrily calling characters out on their stupidity. You will get used to the immense hatred of even the idea that you\'ll see three-quarters of the main cast. You will get used to failed expectations. You will get used to enjoying the better dialogue you can write in your head in ten seconds. But nothing can ever prepare you for the sheer tedium of watching this show.I believe 85% of my watching experience was waiting for something, anything of importance to take place. And when something of importance actually does take place, it was instantly overshadowed by the two idiotic motifs of this show: ""Rikuo\'s a good guy"" and ""I miss your dead brother."" That\'s what all this goddamned show boils down to.The actions of the characters are reprehensible, and when you think through what they did and try to justify them, you end up hating them more. For example, Rikuo starts off as a confused emerging adult with mixed feelings toward his two romantic attractions; but as the story progresses, he devolves into a bumbling buffoon who can\'t decide on anything if his life depended on it. And when he actually does decide on something, you can\'t stand his decisions and hate him for his idiocy.Shinako is a scheming and manipulative evil robot hiding under a soft, fleshy exterior. Her only defining characteristic (from the other characters of the show, anyway) is that she\'s pretty. What you\'ll come to find is that she is a trashcan person. She will express attraction to both her love interests, but when it is reciprocated by either of them, she retreats behind the fact that she misses Yu-kun. That\'s not all, however. Shinako will inexplicably flip-flop between Rikuo and Rou, causing the viewer to exclaim; ""You dumb woman! Make up your ****ing mind already!"" Sadly, this exclamation will grow from an unexpected annoyance to the thing that takes center stage in this anime.Rou. I can\'t stand this character. This may be the first character in all my years of media consumption that will instantly trigger a fit of rage. Seeing this character for two frames was enough to get my blood boiling. This kid is the most entitled POS ever, and his scenes with Shinako are just awful. I will not be explaining him further, because I value my mental health more than this show valued its story and character writing.Now, Haru, on the other hand; Is the saving grace of the show. She is energetic, decisive, meaningfully emotional, dynamic, and her scenes were genuinely enjoyable to watch. I could not wait for all the other characters\' scenes to end so Haru could finally show up and brighten my experience of watching this show. She will show up and give entertaining lines, compared to the flippant utterings of other characters. What\'s a complete slap in the face to the viewer is how Haru is treated throughout the show. One could claim that the most consistent aspect of this show is Haru being treated unfairly. The other main characters are boring, painful to watch and indecisive, but somehow they get rewarded with what they want to some degree; but Haru always gets the short end of the stick. All she wanted was a romantic relationship with Rikuo, but she is led on and tricked by this slab of muttering marble into hanging around him until Shinako decides to like him back. As Haru says in the 11th episode, ""It\'s unfair.""It is absolutely unfair that such good animation, such good art, such good music, such good voice acting, and such a good character like Haru is wasted between the triangle of boredom that is Shinako, Rou and Rikuo.To conclude, in the roughly 264 minutes of this show that I\'ve watched so far, the total of positive scenes I remember wouldn\'t go past 15 minutes. I wish this show covered parts such as: Why both Haru AND Shinako fell in love with Rikuo despite him being a complete nothing of a character, why Shinako is still obsessed with Yu many years after his death, why Shinako can\'t decide between moving past a dead person and loving said dead person and why Rikuo, Rou and Shinako are all such terrible people. I wish that this show included a scene of Rikuo, Rou and Shinako driving away to some faraway location and dying in some off-screen fashion; followed by scenes where Haru is treated like a person instead of a backup plan.

As Haru says in the 11th episode, ""It\'s unfair.""It is absolutely unfair that such good animation, such good art, such good music, such good voice acting, and such a good character like Haru is wasted between the triangle of boredom that is Shinako, Rou and Rikuo.To conclude, in the roughly 264 minutes of this show that I\'ve watched so far, the total of positive scenes I remember wouldn\'t go past 15 minutes. I wish this show covered parts such as: Why both Haru AND Shinako fell in love with Rikuo despite him being a complete nothing of a character, why Shinako is still obsessed with Yu many years after his death, why Shinako can\'t decide between moving past a dead person and loving said dead person and why Rikuo, Rou and Shinako are all such terrible people. I wish that this show included a scene of Rikuo, Rou and Shinako driving away to some faraway location and dying in some off-screen fashion; followed by scenes where Haru is treated like a person instead of a backup plan. I can\'t help but feel like this anime was a huge waste of potential.', ""This anime really captures the reality of growing up and finding a place in society. The characters try to find their path, but stumble upon their past experiences that they can't let go. Rikuo, the MC had a crush on a girl in the past, and now when she appears before him, he can't seem to even look another girl. It's not romance, just nostalgia that locks him in one place and unables him to move forward. Life goes on, and he meets another girl, who is the total opposite, but she loves him with all her heart, not demanding anything in return.

It\'s so simple, yet it roots its viewers about the realism of this story. Our lives aren\'t packed with action or emotions or reflective thinking. Sometimes we are just breathing and working and we\'ll all have an uncomfortable silence during our days.Every episode we are able to slowly see character...growth, but not in an outstanding way. It\'s normal and slow and extremely annoying to watch. And that\'s fine. This is real life. The characters are chaotic in their own way and that\'s why it upsets many viewers. It\'s the grasp of familiarity colliding with us.Besides the story and the characters, I have to mention the camera work. During the dialogues, It\'s really nice to be able to see the character\'s surroundings. It somehow creates the reality that the characters are in. They are not just speaking or walking in a random street. It is the same exact street they walk everyday. And if you turn right, you\'ll see the park where they met. And if you walk 400m, you\'ll find the school. It reminds me that while we are watching one character\'s ""important screen time"", there\'s always going to be something going on the other side.I can see why many people are annoyed at this series. I am too. I hate every single character except Haru. None of the characters are perfect, but the toxicity that some are portraying makes me extremely mad. At least we are on the same page on that. However, discrediting the work just because the character is making the wrong decision or being toxic is really stupid. The creator is not trying to make flawless relationships.

Because conflicting personalities exist. Insecurities exist. And grief may be there inside. PSTD too. Stop judging people like they are hell and acknowledge that people can be shitty sometimes. And it\'s your choice to forgive or leave.Something that does bother me is that, I think people should first be happy with themselves before getting into a relationship, you know... fix your own problems before joining someone else\'s, but I\'m pretty sure half of the couples in this world can\'t understand this concept and that\'s why the author decided to go with this type of drama. Emotionally supporting each other is also a perk of being in a relationship, but the border between toxicity and non-toxicity can easily be broken.All in all, the last episode was a shipwreck. Haru is precious and she deserves someone stable and thoughtful. She didn\'t do anything morally wrong in the series but the way she clings on to her love is really childish. She should finish her high school degree instead of chasing a broke, insecure and ugly man. I hope Rikuo learns ways to boost his brain cells and self-esteem. Shinako needs a therapist before trying to date anyone. Rou needs to find someone for his age and stop looking at his dead brother\'s classmate/crush.

The protagonist is Uozomi Rikuo, a college grad tired of living and works in a convenience store.Uozomi Rikuo wins the award of the most infuriating and pathetic character I have ever watched. As of writing this review, I have watched just over 200 anime shows.*spoilers ahead*In the first episode, Uozomi confesses to his long time crush in college and is rejected.  The story is set up in the first episode as a great redemption story but none of this potential is...fulfilled. This would be the one time he demonstrates any sort of proactivity for the remainder of the show.There was no moment where he takes charge and tries to be a better person. His two jobs came to him courtesy of his friend and his boss respectively.

His long time college crush Shinako even tries to tell him to be more assertive in their relationship.

The reason we are provided is that Haru likes him because he thanked her once for picking up his student pass.His supposed 'redemption' moment in the finale comes as he realizes he likes Haru all along. Through out the series Haru has been blatantly ignored, and treated as a nuisance for the previous 11 episodes.  This romance at the end is simply abhorent writing.Overall review: do not watch this show unless you want to watch a show with ultra-realistic characters to the point of infuriation. Uozomi Rikuo is the kind of person that will work in a gas station all his life with no ambition or motivation to improve in any form.

I\'m going to address some of the negative points people have brought up in other reviews and debunk them as well as add my own insights to some of the aspects of the show.1. ""The show is so slow paced it feels like its dead in the water"", ok for this one it IS true the show is slow paced, there are very few defining moments that act as a large push for the characters to take action and even if there is sometimes they just don\'t...(note that sometimes people just want to hide away from their problems not everyone is the type of person to tackle their way through life head on). However people are ignoring the gradual changes within this. Shinako is gradually coming to terms with the loss of someone who was very significant in her life, this takes time and expecting a giant amount of progress in months is ridiculous. And even beyond this she does change, making small gradual improvements to the point she can face Rou and Rikuos feelings where she never could in the past. Rikuo has a good development too, first working in a store, content with just scraping by with nothing to strive for in life. He was ok with a static life until he realised that he couldn\'t depend on Shinako or others forever, that sounds like progression to me. Its very rare in life for someone to make a 180 turn, it happens slowly over the course of years, we just don\'t notice these smaller changes.2. ""Rikuo is a man-child, Haru is immature, Shinako is bland and Rou is possessive"" - All comments ive heard about these characters and with the exception to Shinako I agree with all of them. Theres one key thing that people are missing however... THATS THE FREAKIN POINT. Rikuo starts as a whiny dude who tries to rely on others to move him forward, after meeting Shinako again he has something to work for so he improves himself. Haru is the most innocent of the cast and probably the most one note that doesn\'t mean she\'s a bad character as such but it does make her somewhat predictable. Rou-kun is possessive because he always wanted Shinako to look at him the same way she looked at his brother. imo Rou is the weakest character of the show just because his negative attributes aren\'t really looked at until the very end of the show.3. ""Rikuo doesn\'t really care about Haru"", Well this one is just not true. There are several occasions where Rikuo is shown to either worry or take pleasure in being in Harus company. Whether that be through dialogue or through action. He often tries to downplay these actions because he doesn\'t think of Haru as his perfect woman. She wouldn\'t look after him or spoon feed him because she has not yet began her life as adult.This isn\'t to say this anime doesn\'t have flaws. The soundtrack whilst very professionally written, doesn\'t stand out much or have moments that really make me want to listen to it alone. I just does the job well. The art is sometimes lifeless but the characters are animated with a sense of realism about them which is a nice touch. As I mentioned before Rou just doesn\'t grow out of his negative traits for me to like him.On the flip side though the sound design and dialogue can only be described as OUTSTANDING. The pacing of lines, breathing, tone of voice, reactions, they all feel as if you could say them yourself to someone. I think that takes a lot of work and a lot of talent to pull off in this medium.I can\'t recommend this anime enough. If you can\'t feel empathy for these characters fair enough its not for you, but thats not the story or the pacing that is to blame.

The first few episodes were good but then it just progressively gotten worse through out the season. I didn't know I could have such hatred towards some anime characters until I watched this show. Like I stated before, the beginning of the show was good, some would even say above average. The characters were likeable to an extant until around episode 5-7. Around that time I could not stand Rikuo, Shinako, and Ro. Those three were like a cancer to the show. The only good thing about this anime is Haru....She was the only one that had some sort of value as a character. The love story in this show was complete utter trash. How do the characters not know if they're in love with one and another? The only ones that were confident in who they loved were the two that weren't even legal yet (even though I don't Ro, I still have to give him credit for this). The story was one of the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Shinako wants to get with Rikuo and the feelings mutual, but then Ro wants to get involved too. (spoiler) At the end she choose Ro, who is her deceased boyfriends little brother and also her student. The story indicated that Ro was like a little brother to her too. On top of all of that he was a little asshole that always wanted things to go his way, and she still chooses him over Rikuo. If he put in a just a tiny bit of effort into it maybe it would've a little better. Also if its trauma that's making you not want to love, don't try to fuck his little brother. It's that simple. On the other hand Rikuo... Rikuo has been ignoring our sweet little haru this whole time when she puts in all the effort in the world for him to notice her but ends up getting rejected multiple times. When Rikuo knows that he can't get Shinako (because she wanted to be the pedo teacher) he finally reaches out to Haru again.

It doesn\'t get better.The end is even worse than all previous 11 episodes combined. Actual s***tpiece. 0/10.So, I just learned that you can\'t send a Review this short in this site. I didn\'t know. As I said, I just created an MyAnimeList account. And english is not my first language, so I didn\'t want to explain the reason WHY it is bad.But as...I have no option, here is a few  thoughts on the anime, even though the other reviews probably did a much better job ranting on it:1 - These anime characters doesn\'t behave like real person: The crow-chick keeps getting stepped on and her hearth spitted at again and again by someone ""she loves"" even though the anime doesn\'t even EXPLAIN WHY SHE LOVES HIM (she even admits herself she doesn\'t know why) and she keeps ""loving"" that stupendous giant shit protagonist.2 - The stupendous giant shit protagonist is a stupendous giant pile of shit protagonist: he can\'t express his feelings, he can\'t amaze/surprise the girl he likes, he can\'t even reject the girl he DOESN\'T like because it\'s easier to don\'t even bother.3 - The characters don\'t kiss, don\'t hug, they barely look themselves in the eyes. They act like they are 10 years old or smth. Even though they are supposedly old enough to have ciggs, drinks, work, bother about marriage, etc.4 - SPOILER ALERT - And on top if it all... the end is SHIT: ALL OF A SUDDEN when he is ""DATING"" the girl he ALWAYS WANTED TO (WITHOUT exercing any of the items above (somehow still considered to be dating by the two Pepegas), not only him, but they BOTH decide they weren\'t being honest with themselves and now are 100% certain they love other side-characters in the last minute/episode. WHITOUT ANY DEVELOPMENT IN THE STORY. WITHOUT TALKING TO THEM. AFTER REJECTING THEM MULTIPLE TIMES. AFTER SPENDING 3 MONTHS TOGHETER DATING WITHOUT KISSING. It\'s just a shitshow. I hope everyone involved in the making of this dies.Sorry. Not that far. I got a little over my head. I really hope everyone is ok and live a long life and die old of natural causes. Maybe they can redeem themselves making a better piece later in their lives after this dark time. It won\'t be hard at least. Even Boku no Pico\'s writer managed to comeback doing great work. They still got hope. But I will say though that I do want my valuable life-time minutes spent watching this thing back. Please don\'t waste yours.5 - and last point: I really feel deeply sorry for the mangaka/author of ""Yesterday something"" (I can\'t bother to remember the name and I won\'t look it up because it\'s better for my soul if I forget it). This author really thinks humans interactions works like that. It\'s just sad.EXTRA: I forgot to create a point that mentions that the anime takes itself too seriously for an anime that has a girl with a crow as pet, adults that act like children, and ""sad"" moments when there is nothing to be sad about. It would be a waaay better anime if it had some comedy to it.

I was recommended this because of Welcome to the NHK!, and since I\'m a big fan of NHK!, I\'d give it a go. Saw it was completely drama/romance focused, so I was prepared for it to be slow if it were for the right reasons. It unfortunately wasn\'t.Apart from Haru ""Crow Waifu""...Nonaka, the characters are mostly unlikable, and paired with a trash story, makes this a grind to continue keeping interest in their love triangle. The main character, Rikuo, is so boring and uninteresting, I don\'t know why he has two girls swooning for him. Christmas Cake Shinako keeps pretending to be innocent when it comes to relationships, yet instigates all of them, making it hard to feel sorry for her, and Rou is just a childish loser. Also, why did Haru fall in love with Riuko? Because he passed by her everyday while she was in middle school? Do they really expect me to believe she\'d be so faithful to him because of that? Unfortunately, they do.The quality of the anime is fine, and the first 6 episodes are pretty okay; they don\'t focus on the love triangle, and the side characters are actually pretty nice... but then you\'ll want more, and unfortunately, the next six are boring trash. The big question from here is if you want to even bother starting on the journey if you know the ending payoff is bad.I think the worst thing to come out of my experience watching this anime is that I\'ve fallen in love with Haru Nonaka, and I\'ll probably never get closure with her unless I read the manga which I hear is also an infuriating process to go through.TL;DR you can try, but I wouldn\'t suggest it.

I was excited to see an Anime portray adult romance. It’s always a breath of fresh air to see a setting outside of middle school or high school. But I wouldn’t say a breath of fresh air is what I got. Instead I got the pleasure of meeting a cast of mostly supposed adults that act with the emotional intelligence of middle schoolers. Before getting into the nitty gritty the show is average. Do I recommend it? No, not really. The time watching this show never resulted in any great pay off. There’s no moment...of real growth or raw emotion that really captured me, which I think is vital for drama or romance type shows. So try it if you’re just absolutely craving a romance Anime, but go in with tempered expectations. I hate to say it but you’re not finding a hidden gem but more like a safety pin in an earhole.First off I just don’t understand the characters and what the direction and the theme of the show was supposed to be. Are these characters supposed to be like real people who showcase their flaws and learn to change?Spoilers ahead:Rikuo and Shinkao are both college graduates so they’re likely at least in their early twenties. I understand still figuring out life in your twenties but goodness both of them are just terrible at expressing themselves and are hot messes as individuals and just don’t make for realistic people who are in their twenties. Honestly these two characters are such headaches and I don’t even want to discuss them. I see Rikuo as basically a typical bland self insert who does the typical unsure of himself then figures out what he wants and that’s it. Shinako on the other hand is just stuck unknowing of what she wants as she leads two guys on. I understand that maybe the show is trying to demonstrate that love isn’t easy and that real people in their twenties can have difficulties expressing themselves. But these two characters never feel real and really just seem like middle schoolers disguised as college graduates.Then we have Haru and Rou, what’s the lesson here with these two characters? Neither of them really truly change throughout the whole series. Both of them have this weird sense of entitlement to Rikuo and Shinako respectively. Haru’s initial meeting of Rikuo years prior to the show drives her to become pretty much a stalker for most of the series, but it’s ok because she’s cute. While Rou is extremely attached to Shinako and believes it’s his fate to be with her because his older brother was her crush who passed away years ago. Ah yes, because that’s how a normal person would view the girl who had a crush on their deceased brother. But honestly I feel bad for these two characters. At least they’re more adept at understanding their feelings compared to their older counterparts.  Both of them at various points in the show also show they’re not ignorant to the fact they don’t have a good chance of getting the love they seek from their crushes.They know it’s probably better for them to move on so they can continue to grow. I feel bad that they never get that because just as they’re preparing to move on Rikuo and Shinako return into their lives. And supposedly that’s a happy ending.Now here’s the thing, say the message is that it’s actually not a happy ending and the show was supposed to showcase the flaws of humans with love. That’s a good enough message to build a show on but y’know what the show could’ve executed it way better.The animation is fine. I initially thought that having no OP was really good, they’d get to fit more content in but in the end it never really felt more content was fit in despite having an extra ninety seconds.  Instead that extra time was devoted to awkward pauses and the longest four sentence conversations. My favorite part of the show was the show’s first ED song ""Kago no Naka ni Tori (籠の中に鳥)"" by yourness  which  belongs in all soft Anime music playlist but other than that I’m not taking much from this show. The characters aren’t great. The pacing is poor. The message they were selling just wasn’t hitting strong with me.

This psudo-realism is created by snow and by not being hyperactive, usually anime is for people with ADHD, even the slower Slice of Life series tend to be fast-paced in an unorthodox way, but this thing isn't fast, it's actually the opposite of fast, it's slow, but slow isn't really a bad thing, i'm a slow guy myself, big fan of being slow and slow-related things, the problem with the show isn't it's slowness, it's the fact that it's unrealistic, contrary to the usual ADHD anime, it has a serious and...more (psudo)mature dialogue, it's a common trick by these so called mature shows, the characters in the screen talk about emotions and their real life problems, but this is just to trick the innocent viewer into thinking the person on the screen is literally them, it's easy to relate to words, but they're not literally you, they're not even nothing, they're not characters, they're just things made to say words which people commonly associate with. These so called characters don't have problems, but they pretend they have, the characters speak as if they had them but they don't, they're just words.VISUALLY ACCEPTABLE-Visually? not bad, might even go as far as saying it's quite good, and while the characters themselves look fine, the designs don't help their personality, after seeing them be absolutely moronic in a scene while they were making THAT face, every scene afterwards when they just happen to coincidentally make the same face, you'll remember how stupid they were being and you'll just get annoyed more. It's got a cold look though, which i greatly like, however, it's the same thing, a cold aesthetic will enhance a great thing but it will de-enhance it if it's bad since it's more of a betrayal to the coldness you (might) like, at least that's way it is for me, if you're gonna be shit then don't use themes and aesthetics i like.SOUND-I didin't notice it so it doesn't really matter.Everything else isn't very good either, the finale sucks dick, also the crow girl is just bad as kanahana's character. Did you know the title isn't in reference to the song by the beatles?by the way the reason i didin't really write about the other parts of the show is because i saw everyone also gave it a negative review, wasn't really expecting people to dislike it, no point in just another review with the same opinion. more (psudo)mature dialogue, it's a common trick by these so called mature shows, the characters in the screen talk about emotions and their real life problems, but this is just to trick the innocent viewer into thinking the person on the screen is literally them, it's easy to relate to words, but they're not literally you, they're not even nothing, they're not characters, they're just things made to say words which people commonly associate with.

I put on the first episode, blinked, and it was over. Theres something about this show that sucks me into its world for 25 minutes in a way that no show ever has. Theres something so natural about the characters, the way they speak to each other, and the world they live in. There's not really a gimmick here. No alternate world, no sci-fi twist, not even a quirky moron love interest. This show is like a window into these character's lives.

If you want something that will make hours of your day disappear, pick this up."", 'I think a majority of the anime was good. However, that ending. Well it\'s really bad. The relationship (part from the end) was believable. They felt like real characters. How they interacted with each other felt real. It does a good job sparking conversation and questioning what it means to be mature or how to handle drama. Unfortunately, getting us to think about that isn\'t the same as answering that. Although, it did a good job at giving us these questions, that ending undoes most of the leg work put in to resolve it. It\'s not that I hate the pair that the writer decided...to take. I\'m fine with either pairing, with the caveat of one rule. It makes sense. That heel turn makes absolutely no sense and disassemble all the build up. It really isn\'t best way to end your story.To explain what I mean I need to go into spoiler territory. You see a relationship is about being there for each other, working each other\'s problem, feeling each other\'s pain, and work to help each other overcome their struggles. The majority of the story Rikuo and Shinako have been doing this. It is extremely believable for me to see that they are in love; they\'re just bad at it. (Which is understandable considering their personalities.) They are willing to suffer for each other to be together. That felt like love. They stumble a lot and made many mistakes because they have reach peak maturity yet. But that how relationships are. You make mistakes and mature for each other. Haru on the other hand didn\'t go through this with Rikuo. It felt more like an immature crush. Haru has ""best girl personality"" and did what considered a favor. Pushing Rikuo to chase the job he wants is a extraordinary favor. But it doesn\'t bond a person closer in the way you think. It just makes you appreciate them more. They didn\'t put in effort take on each other\'s struggle at all. The only suffering being experience is when Haru experience heartbreak or jealously. Rikuo never felt that. He didn\'t feel her struggles. He just felt bad for her and tried his best to not make it worse. They do support each other. But only in out of nowhere moments that wasn\'t present through out the series like that break-in thief moment. This is more akin to friends support rather than romantic support. Haru has ""best girl personality"" which makes her likable, yes. But that\'s not the same as pairing her up with what Rikuo and Shinako experience together. What they went through together was special. Trading that away for someone with a better personality leaves many viewer feeling empty. I\'m not mad at pairing her up with Rikuo. I\'m mad at how it was handle. If the author wanted to pair these two up at the end, he needs Rikuo and Haru to go through something special. They need to have a moment where Rikuo sees Haru differently for the first time. Rikuo needs to accept Haru\'s struggle and he also needs a struggle that doesn\'t depends on Shinako so Haru can accept his struggle. Since his struggle revolves around Shinako, Haru can\'t exactly accept it the same way Shinako and Rikuo accepeted each other\'s struggle. How the author paired up Haru and Rikuo was poorly done and failed to be special like what Rikuo and Shinako had. Haru should have had a different happy ending.Let\'s talk about Rou now. Rou whether it was intentional or not, represent immaturity. He would have been the perfect allegory for what all the other character should be trying to get away from. Every character are on a path to maturity. He is the most immaturity character on the show. He constantly lashes out and make create selfish drama. He would have been a great foil if the show used him right. The most logical step for his character is finally mature at the end. If the show actually done that, I would\'ve like his character. Instead, every screen time he gets, we never see him make steps into growing as a person. He remains the same person throughout the story. This makes him my least favorite character. Pairing him up with Shinako was a bad idea. Shinako states over and over again that he is nothing more than a kid brother to her. She cannot see him anything other that. Nothing\'s changed. Why did Shinako choose him out of no where. It makes no sense. Where did that come from? Yes, she loves Rou more than Rikuo. But it\'s she over and over states it\'s because he\'s like a little brother to her. He is family. That\'s why she loves him. How is loving Rou more than Rikuo an excuse for the break up? Her relationship with Rikuo never changed. It was stagnate. Nothing happened to change how she sees him. Even if she did love him all this time and never realized it, it doesn\'t make sense. Why did she reject him in the begin and throughout the series if she loved him back the same way all this time? Why about being in a relationship with Rikuo made her realized she loves Rou. This is never explored. It just comes out of nowhere especially since her perception of him never changed. Although I don\'t agree with the decision, there is a way to make the pair work. Include a scene that shows Shinako seeing Rou in a different light. Then show a scene where Shinako finally sees him as a potential love interest. I still would like it but it\'s workable. That at least have some level of working. Her conflict with Rou didn\'t even resolve. She just kinda says I love him and that was that. Having that be the other half of why Shinako and Rikuo\'s relationship fall apart just insulted the audience really bad.At the end of the day, The first 11 episode showed two adults reach the next level of maturity. But then the 12th just plummeted to high school maturity, which is worse than where the show began. That ending was beyond bad. I do still think it\'s a good anime. It challenges the viewers to question what it means to be mature. Just don\'t expect it to give you answers because the answers it give are bad. There where much better ways for the author to end with the pair they want. You can enjoy series, but you most certainly won\'t enjoy the ending. to take.

How the author paired up Haru and Rikuo was poorly done and failed to be special like what Rikuo and Shinako had. Haru should have had a different happy ending.Let\'s talk about Rou now. Rou whether it was intentional or not, represent immaturity. He would have been the perfect allegory for what all the other character should be trying to get away from. Every character are on a path to maturity. He is the most immaturity character on the show. He constantly lashes out and make create selfish drama. He would have been a great foil if the show used him right. The most logical step for his character is finally mature at the end. If the show actually done that, I would\'ve like his character. Instead, every screen time he gets, we never see him make steps into growing as a person. He remains the same person throughout the story. This makes him my least favorite character. Pairing him up with Shinako was a bad idea. Shinako states over and over again that he is nothing more than a kid brother to her. She cannot see him anything other that. Nothing\'s changed. Why did Shinako choose him out of no where. It makes no sense. Where did that come from? Yes, she loves Rou more than Rikuo. But it\'s she over and over states it\'s because he\'s like a little brother to her. He is family. That\'s why she loves him. How is loving Rou more than Rikuo an excuse for the break up? Her relationship with Rikuo never changed. It was stagnate. Nothing happened to change how she sees him. Even if she did love him all this time and never realized it, it doesn\'t make sense. Why did she reject him in the begin and throughout the series if she loved him back the same way all this time? Why about being in a relationship with Rikuo made her realized she loves Rou. This is never explored. It just comes out of nowhere especially since her perception of him never changed. Although I don\'t agree with the decision, there is a way to make the pair work. Include a scene that shows Shinako seeing Rou in a different light. Then show a scene where Shinako finally sees him as a potential love interest. I still would like it but it\'s workable. That at least have some level of working. Her conflict with Rou didn\'t even resolve. She just kinda says I love him and that was that. Having that be the other half of why Shinako and Rikuo\'s relationship fall apart just insulted the audience really bad.At the end of the day, The first 11 episode showed two adults reach the next level of maturity. But then the 12th just plummeted to high school maturity, which is worse than where the show began. That ending was beyond bad. I do still think it\'s a good anime. It challenges the viewers to question what it means to be mature. Just don\'t expect it to give you answers because the answers it give are bad. There where much better ways for the author to end with the pair they want. You can enjoy series, but you most certainly won\'t enjoy the ending.', ""A criminally underrated anime. I've read some of the other reviews that gave out very low scores. They seem to dislike the ending. I haven't gotten to the ending yet, but regardless of how good or bad it is, the anime is worth watching just for how good it is upto this point. It has some phenomenal character development, and extremely relatable and mature characters.If you're reading this review, you know the type of anime you like. It's very hard to come by good romance drama anime, that doesn't have some stupid gimmick or is part slice of life / comedy. This is a pure...romance drama, with phenomenal characters and art.

Maybe some fans wrongly think she\'s a bad person for ""toying"" with Rou and Rikou by not explaining thinks clearly and giving them chances, she\'s not. Most anime fans are used to think all female characters must be perfect, no important problems allowed, that\'s why when they see one with emotional problems, they don\'t understand it and if she somehow gets in the way of their waifu (Haru), they will hate her to death.She stays negligent with her decisions in the climax, something I disliked.I remember Haru saying that Shinako has the advantage over her because she has known Rikuo for a longer time than her and had more opportunities, but that\'s not true. Even if Shinako has the ""time"" advantage, she never used her opportunities with Rikuo until near the end of the anime because she was trapped in the past. That\'s why Haru won, because she worked hard for Rikuo\'s love for longer and used all her chances, unlike Shinako.Sound: 5Ok for me, background music does its job, but I found negative the lack of opening tbh.Character design, scenarios, animation: 4 | 8 | 6 = 6- Character design: Kinda mediocre, but good enough when needed.- Scenarios: Good, beautifully made and better than the average.- Animation: Ok, but could have been better.

Well, the ending is satisfying if you are a Haru fan but not satisfying if you are a Shinako fan. About the story, well, it is not that interesting, to be honest, but if we try to connect with our daily life, then we may find it is likely relatable (Afterall it's a slice of life). In real life, we run after the wrong person who doesn't feel for us like we do feel for them. Look at Rikou; he ran after Shinako, who didn't feel love for him. That...kid Rou also loved Shinako, but Shinako was more into that dead brother of Rou. Haru ran after Rikou, but one of Haru's friend (Forgot the name of that guy) proposed Haru, but Haru turned him down. Rikou didn't feel for Haru at the start, but in the end, both Rikou and Haru ended up together, which is a good ending for Haru fanbase. In our real-life, we may not be a lucky person like Haru, who ends up with the person she loved. We may be the supporting character like that guy who proposed Haru but got rejected.

It’s soft-grey reflective tone, gritty yet beautiful animation offers a darker feel than you’d expect from most titles of this genre.The network of relationships Kei Toume captures starts with a ghost or a young woman who almost became a ghost (depending on how you look at it). The main characters the show introduces us to are the ones caught in the midst of this immovable object (the dead man) and this unstoppable force (the young woman that almost died).

Of course, I don’t think that this show would impact everyone the same way that it did for me, so I can partly understand why people might not like this. That said, I wonder if people are simply missing the point with this show, especially considering its serious tone.Just to get it out of the way, I can think of a few reasons why this isn’t as highly rated as I think it should be. One weak point that I saw was the last episode, which felt like it...was shoving half of a season into a single episode. I won’t go into too much detail into everything that seemed rushed or left out (although there might be more spoilers later in this review), but honestly, I don’t think this ending broke the show. Rather than taking away from the overall experience, I would argue that it’s only the absence of something that could have been. I didn’t know that the anime cut content from the manga when I watched it, so it didn’t bother me too much when I watched the last episode because nothing was out of place or atrociously bad. In fact, as I neared the end I knew that whatever happened the ending would not make or break the show, but I’ll get into that more later. Besides that, the only other flaw that I could point out are characters that needlessly show up for a single episode or even a single scene, but don’t have much of an impact on the plot. Given that the anime would have to cut out a lot of content towards the end anyways, I would have rather them cut out the two episodes featuring Minato and Yuzuhara and move that extra time to the end, but again I didn’t think this was a fatal flaw. It’s not like a filler episode, and these characters do help characterize the main characters they’re connected to, so again this “mistake” doesn’t take away anything from the show.But I’m sure that the big thing that turned people off was the characters and their interactions with each other, which I actually saw as one of the strongest parts of this show. As I’m sure many of you watching might have noticed, the main cast are (mostly) adults, yet throughout the show they act like prepubescent middle schoolers with their first crush when it comes to love. They are all to some extent clingy, and don’t know the importance of distance when it comes to relationships. Rikuo follows a self-fulfilling prophecy, where by calling himself a loser he becomes one. Shinako is indecisive and can’t move on from someone who died six years ago. Haru is persistent and obnoxious, and her entire character is pretty much consumed by her attraction to Rikuo. And Rou, as the youngest one out of them, acts more like the ten-year-old in Shinako’s memory, expecting Shinako to stay in his life when she has her own to live. On top of which, Rikuo and Shinako only go halfway in rejecting the people who like them, selfishly wanting to keep them close without realizing that it would only hurt them more. Understandably, these personalities and the way they clash with each other can be grating to the viewer, and the maturity level suggests an environment more akin to high school drama than adults braving the real world. But, surprisingly, none of this comes off as criticism to the show.We all have a perception of how mature adults act, but what if that’s only how they should act? Not everyone behaves the same way all the time, and this show seeks to capture how people act in real life. That is not to say that everyone can relate to these specific characters, but it’s like how Rikuo is able to capture good wedding photos because he knows the people so well—taking shots that other photographers would pass over. An often heard mantra is that for a good story, the audience should sympathize with the characters. Like I said, the characters hardly do anything to deserve our sympathy. But what if their weaknesses and flaws draw us to them? I found myself connecting to Rikuo the most. Not really sure what I want to do in the future, wanting to stay friends with a crush even though it would only make it worse, making self-deprecating remarks because I want the attention and pity. It’s not like the author is supporting the actions that some of these characters take. To the contrary, I felt like some of the advice given was true to said characters was true and pertinent to people in a similar situation. Maybe those that can’t really relate to any of these characters will find it hard to get invested in the characters, and that’s fair. But even for those who don’t, it’s hard to deny that the characters are based more on real people than stereotypes. Even Haru, who embodies an over-the top personality that is prevalent in a lot of anime, shows her human side more often than not. Another part that I appreciated is that, no character out of the main four was elevated above another in terms of screen time, and everyone was given a chance to be fleshed out. To be fair, having everyone involved in a giant love chain is a bit unrealistic, but I think it was necessary both to give everyone enough attention and to really drive home the theme of unrequited love. As someone who has had a crush but never had one realized, I can acknowledge that I may be a bit more biased towards this story than something like tsuki ga kirei. But even in terms of the characters, you don’t get the feeling that everyone else in the group is being left out except for the main couple, which is quite refreshing.Another criticism I might see is with the plot, which I also thoroughly enjoyed. Throughout the show, you have a lot of tension between the characters, with silence and awkward conversations abound (especially in any scene with just Rikuo and Shinoka). But rather than being annoying or tedious, I would say that it is another example of being a “snapshot” of real life. And even just for entertainment value, I didn’t find these scenes to be tedious or annoying, as the conversations and monologues are easy enough to follow along and often serve to develop a plot point or a character. On that note, having a bubbly, almost preposterous personality such as Haru was a wise decision to act as a foil to the more reserved, overthinking Rikuo. This is not a depressing show, but even so her antics and dialogue add a splash of color to an otherwise completely serious story. I would also add that rather than being a mundane experience where watching each episode seems like a chore (the bane of many slice-of-life shows), there is definitely enough drama going on to make you want to watch the next episode. The lack of any progress in terms of romance until the very end may be frustrating to some, but I don’t think this experience would have been the same any other way. Because you don’t always get what you get in life, and sometimes the struggle is more interesting than the reward. Although in most shows you tend to start rooting for a certain ship, I think this show is unique in that by the time I got to the last two episodes, I knew that I would enjoy the ending no matter who did or didn’t get together. Because these characters are all flawed, but share a commonality in the desire to be loved and cared for. Maybe one episode romances aren’t your thing (going back to the pacing of the last episode), but even though I had been supporting Rikuo and Shinoka’s relationship in the previous episode, I was pleasantly surprised with how they handled the break-up. More often than not, relationships don’t work out despite the underrepresentation of break-ups in stories, and this is just another facet of reality that the story captures so well. To be fair, the way that Rikuo went back to Haru when he had clearly treated her much worse than Shinoka in the past was selfish and inconsiderate, and Haru should not have accepted him so easily after all that he had done to her. But it’s not like he was proud of it, and Haru can make her own choices.Besides that, art and music were amazing, and just icing on top of the cake that is a deeply meaningful story. I would disagree that this show tries to be what it isn’t, and recommend that anybody approach it with an open mind without looking at all of the negative reviews. was shoving half of a season into a single episode. I won’t go into too much detail into everything that seemed rushed or left out (although there might be more spoilers later in this review), but honestly, I don’t think this ending broke the show. Rather than taking away from the overall experience, I would argue that it’s only the absence of something that could have been. I didn’t know that the anime cut content from the manga when I watched it, so it didn’t bother me too much when I watched the last episode because nothing was out of place or atrociously bad. In fact, as I neared the end I knew that whatever happened the ending would not make or break the show, but I’ll get into that more later. Besides that, the only other flaw that I could point out are characters that needlessly show up for a single episode or even a single scene, but don’t have much of an impact on the plot. Given that the anime would have to cut out a lot of content towards the end anyways, I would have rather them cut out the two episodes featuring Minato and Yuzuhara and move that extra time to the end, but again I didn’t think this was a fatal flaw. It’s not like a filler episode, and these characters do help characterize the main characters they’re connected to, so again this “mistake” doesn’t take away anything from the show.But I’m sure that the big thing that turned people off was the characters and their interactions with each other, which I actually saw as one of the strongest parts of this show. As I’m sure many of you watching might have noticed, the main cast are (mostly) adults, yet throughout the show they act like prepubescent middle schoolers with their first crush when it comes to love. They are all to some extent clingy, and don’t know the importance of distance when it comes to relationships. Rikuo follows a self-fulfilling prophecy, where by calling himself a loser he becomes one. Shinako is indecisive and can’t move on from someone who died six years ago. Haru is persistent and obnoxious, and her entire character is pretty much consumed by her attraction to Rikuo. And Rou, as the youngest one out of them, acts more like the ten-year-old in Shinako’s memory, expecting Shinako to stay in his life when she has her own to live. On top of which, Rikuo and Shinako only go halfway in rejecting the people who like them, selfishly wanting to keep them close without realizing that it would only hurt them more. Understandably, these personalities and the way they clash with each other can be grating to the viewer, and the maturity level suggests an environment more akin to high school drama than adults braving the real world. But, surprisingly, none of this comes off as criticism to the show.We all have a perception of how mature adults act, but what if that’s only how they should act?

Oh, another new person? Oh and another?Basically they introduce new characters one after the other to make an awkward interaction between the main characters, making each other believe that they've got a thing going on with this newly introduced character when in fact it's all misunderstandings and just overall dumb stuff.It honestly started becoming annoying to watch this and highly obvious what was going to happen next since the exact same thing had happened the episode before and the one before that, just with other side characters. "", 'I don’t agree with writing reviews before the season/series is over. Because that review would only cover the first few episodes, and these may not be an accurate representation of the rest of the season. Yesterday wo Utatte, or Sing “Yesterday” For Me, is now my go-to example for that argument. The first handful of episodes are really good, interesting, beautiful, and had characters that had complex relationships and emotions. However, as the series went on, it became more evident that only the art and the animation would stay good. The story is a little irritating, and the characters are very irritating, and the sound...and art are good. Yesterday wo Utatte was very promising in the first quarter, but quickly turned as the series progressed. 5/10.*Spoilers beyond this point*The story is the bog-standard love triangle plot. However, there are two episodes dedicated to the side character’s romantic interests in two of the main characters. These two episodes are a small, but necessary, shifts from the love triangle plot. These two episode side stories are better than the main plot by far. The ending is awful! Rikuo gets with Haru, and Shinako might get with Rou. This betrays the trajectory and logic of the story presented thus far.Moving on from something that is plain to something good, the art. I like the art style. The colors are dull and dim, and they set the mood rather well. The only place that has anything close to bright or vibrant colors is Shinako’s apartment. This makes a stark contrast between the rest of the anime and her living space. Perhaps it is Rikuo’s perspective. Everything without her is dull and bleak, and when he is with her the world is vibrant. If not, then why is the rest of the world dim when she is bright? If so, then congratulations Yesterday wo Utatte you passed sixth-grade symbolism.Another thing I liked was the music and sound. There is not an OP for  Sing “Yesterday” For Me, and this keeps the story flowing and is a change of pace from all the other anime that have invasive OPs. There are only EDs in this anime, and it is well documented by my friends, and anyone else who will listen, that I love Sayuri’s music. She has the second ED called “Aoibashi,” and it is great. On a more personal note, this song is only used for episodes 7, 8, and 9, while the other two are used for episodes 1-6 and 10-12. They gave six episodes to the worst ED and made the better two split up the remaining ones, but I digress.A common flaw in many romance anime is that the romance is not believable, or could be solved by simply communicating with each other. Yesterday wo Utatte is the new figurehead for this argument. To name a few examples, Shinako could tell Rou that he doesn’t own her and can’t tell her what to do, Shinako could tell Rikuo that she needs time to be in a relationship, Rikuo could tell Haru that he isn’t interested, so on and so on. On the topic of Shinako, she is a real disaster as a character. She leads Rikuo and Rou on for the majority of the anime, she doesn’t tell others how she feels she just expects them to know what to do or what to say, and acts like Rikuo’s jealous girlfriend, but then turns on a dime and becomes uninterested. When she is uninterested, like with Rou, she doesn’t tell him to stop. Rou unsurprisingly acts like a child. Demanding that Shinako cooks for him even though he is in going into college and could cook for himself. He also keeps acting like a passive-aggressive edge lord. Finally, he demands to know Shinako’s relationship with Rikuo. Rikuo is no saint either of course. I was empathetic towards him for a while. Being a university student I also worry that I won’t get anywhere in life. This was the only good thing about him. He winges about everything constantly, not dissimilar to Rou. He also leads on Haru. Haru is the only good main character in the bunch. She is a bit clingy and pushy at times, but this is what makes her a good character. She is flawed, not awful. I now understand why the vast majority of fanart I have seen is of her. Other than Haru, none of these characters are enjoyable to watch. They aren’t flawed people like in Scum’s Wish. They are awful people who act like teenagers. Shinako’s friend even said, “You aren’t teenagers anymore.” I swiftly responded with, “Then why is everyone acting like one?!” Honestly, the terrible trio of Shinako, Ruo, and Rikuo are all very similar to people I knew back in high school. So, if the main cast is a let down then where can I turn to get good characters? Interestingly enough, the supporting characters, more specifically, the two one-off characters. They have depth, interests, likes, dislikes, and most importantly, they act like adults. When the man was rejected he understands a goes about the rest of his life. When the woman found out that she is interfering with Rikuo’s friendships she leaves. The terrible trio would never do this. They would just sit there and whinge and cry about their lives.For these previously mentioned reasons, I did not enjoy Yesterday wo Utatte. If the characters acted like adults, used their words, and used some common sense, then this show could have been great. An interesting and emotional walk through the lives of the four main characters showing their highs and lows in their lives. Scum’s Wish has better characters because they were messed up people, but also good characters. Give me a story that is more interesting, adults that act like adults and not angsty teenagers, and a color pallet that is more consistent. With these changes made this would be a better, more enjoyable, show.If I would have reviewed Yesterday wo Utatte, or Sing “Yesterday” For Me, early I would have gone off about how great the show is and how much I enjoyed watching it. The art, characters, music, and story all ranged from good to great, but as the series went on it started to decline until most of my good feelings soured. Never before have I seen the main cast of any media be so unlikeable. Rou is a child, Shinako is an indecisive tease, and Rikuo can’t act like an adult. Haru is flawed but she is the best character because of her flaws. I would suggest you skip this anime and find one that has a better story and characters. But, if you want to watch this then watch the first quarter, search Aoibashi by Sayuri on Youtube, then either stop watching it or lower your expectations to a sub-par anime. All in all, a 4 for the story, 7 for the art, a 6 for the sound, a 3 for the characters, and a 4 for enjoyment. Coming out to a 5 overall. and art are good.

I thought the pace was pretty steady and seemed comfortable for learning more about our four main characters, but wrapping all that up in only one more episode seemed absolutely outlandish. I was pleasantly surprised. The ending was not as horrid as I thought it would be, and for being rushed and a poor adaptation, I at least think it wrapped up the series as best as it could and gave the viewer some sort of endgame.I'm not a reviewer...who likes to dramatically alter their review based off the ending alone. I gave it a score lower than I originally intended, but I don't feel the need to move my rating down to a 1. I don't understand the number of users who drastically change their opinion of an anime and give a scathing review based on the ending rather than looking at the series as a whole and the episodes beforehand. Personally, I'd rather watch a good anime with a poor ending than a bad anime that is standardly bad throughout.It's true. The ending episode was rushed, and I think those extra episodes were needed to draw out Rikuo and Haru's relationship, as well as resolve whatever is going on between Shinako and Rou. Those 6 extra episodes that we originally thought we were going to get would have been absolutely perfect, and it's a shame we didn't get them.HOWEVERFor the first 11 episodes, I was satisfied with the story and the pace. I was invested in the character's lives and eager to join them on their journeys. I find there are very few slice-of-lifes to watch these days, and while this show isn't certainly the pinnacle of the genre, I still think that it did its best with the 12 episodes. The artwork was great. I enjoyed the THREE endings the animators made for only a 12 episode series. I felt myself growing emotional at some points. And I really was invested in the characters and story.I'm sure there are a number of Shinako haters judging by the sheer amount of drama she caused in this show (yes, this is a drama-laden show), but I also think she's one of the most emotionally complex and best written characters. In fact, I think most of the characters were well written and had so much potential to have been further fleshed out if we had been given a better adaptation. For what we were given though, I still got a sense of each character and their thoughts/feelings (besides Rou, who I think had a lot of untapped potential in this series).Sing Yesterday for Me isn't perfect, but I've seen enough horrid anime endings to see this ending as a perfectly pleasant one, even if it is not ideal. Would I have liked a more complete story and those 18 episodes? Yes, but I still enjoyed the ride, and while my enjoyment is lessened with the rushed ending, I still found the show entertaining and enjoyable. It's a perfectly good anime and better than a few anime I've seen this year already, so I encourage the wary reader to give a watch anyway. who likes to dramatically alter their review based off the ending alone.

In order to create a work of compelling fiction, a driving force needs to be present that pushes the narrative and characters forward. This is missing from Yesterday wo Utatte.Yesterday wo Utatte follows four characters: Ritou, Haru, Shinako and Rou.Instead of a driving force pushing development, the anime feels slow, sluggish and stagnated. The main characters are all unlikeable with the exception of Haru who single...handedly carries this show.Ritou is truly an unlikeable person. He's indecisive, dumb, emotionally deficient and is obsessed with Shinako; a girl who has rejected him.Haru is a truly kind girl. Rather eccentric, she wholeheartedly loves Ritou.Shinako can only be described as a female Ritou. She is in love with her dead friend and tries to keep all of her love interests close but far away at the same time.Rou is an emotionally unstable young man who is the brother of Shinoka's dead friend. He is in love with Shinoka.As I am sure you can imagine, the anime is a train wreck. It is only comparable to domesticed girlfriend.The ending is poorly executed and rushed.

The former is pervasive to the point that we might as well classify it as an invasive genre in the anime medium; on the other hand, the latter is equally undesirable, as it fails to engage the...audience in any meaningful fashion (a critical element in these types of anime).  So perhaps the question then becomes: will a healthy balance be struck?—And if so, will it done with grace and ingenuity?Sing “Yesterday” for Me, in my estimation, establishes the balance with an anachronistic cast of characters…in fact, the juxtaposition of differing ‘philosophies’ is the engine that drives the show.  Rikuo, the indecisive male lead, is primarily focused on what he could be and who we wishes to be with.  But this prospect driven mindset thwarts him from living in the here and now; thus, ‘closing doors’ (i.e. Haru’s kindness) and limiting his overall happiness.  This indirect ‘self-sabotage’ is the impetus behind Rikuo’s capitulating personality, allowing him to be manipulated by the unwitting Shinako.  Hence, Rikuo would do well to adopt Haru’s ‘presence’ and begin exploring all the possibilities presented to him, rather than holding out for one long-shot.Shinako — Rikuo’s ‘one-and-only’ — has the antithetical problem, she cannot dislodge her mind from the past.  Having the displeasure of watching her lover’s health slowly deteriorate, Shinako resigned herself to a life of solitude and emptiness.  Numerous scenes show Shinkao reminiscing about her past lover in a way that demonstrates her unwillingness to believe in herself via moving on from the traumatic event.  She, therefore, is apathetic toward her own future — precipitating an inner tumult that leads to emotional stagnation.  Even when she initiates a relationship with Rikuio, it seems as though she’s sabotaging it via making fun of his limited vocabulary or blowing him off (as nicely as possible) on more than one occasion.  But she hangs onto to him, nonetheless, as support for her own shortcomings and her inability to terminate what she knows is a fruitless endeavor (as noted by Shinako’s reluctance to kiss Rikuo).Rikuo and Shinako are both fleshed out characters that give the viewer much to ponder in terms of being too ‘nice’ and not knowing when to close a particular chapter in one’s life.  Furthermore, none of the their actions or spoken sentences felt out of place, nor did they come off as tired character tropes.  The subtle nuances in each character provided a slow-burning level of intrigue that was hard to turn away from.  Haru, on the flip side, is more forward with her actions.  Not all surprising from someone who embraces the chaotic beauty of living in the here and now.  While some viewers may interpret her character as ‘obnoxious’ or ‘creepy,’ I much prefer to classify her as passionate, resolute, and, yes, a bit foolhardy (this is a compliment!).While her proposed competition with Shinako seemed a bit outlandish and rude, it is precisely what we all do in pursuit of the ideal partner.  If one questions the rationality of this statement, then I suggest they neglect taking showers, become homeless, uneducated, and attempt to woo the girl/boy of their dreams.  Whether the other ‘competitors’ is known is of no consequence, as we are all ‘competing’ for the right to date/marry a worthwhile, loving partner.  Haru acknowledges this hidden reality and makes no bones about her wanting to make Rikuo hers.  Sure. Some men see this persistent as annoying, but this commitment to achieving her goal is admirable and praiseworthy.  To make the topic crystal, I’d choose an ‘annoying’ girl with self-awareness and the courage of her convictions, over an equivocating, over thinker any day of the week.  Of course, that is not to say that Haru doesn’t have doubts or regrets about her decisions, but she knows the path she is on and does not allow mishaps to deter her future ambitions.  Plus, the fact that she constantly goes out of her way to see Rikuo and show her admiration for him with gifts and warm smiles is proof that she cares about his well-being; whereas Shinako is, inadvertently, neglectful about Rikuo’s happiness.The characters, without a doubt, were the strong point of the anime.  The plot, also, was exceptionally consistent, save for an episode where Chika stumbled into Rikuo in the convenience store back alley and pleaded to stay with him until she got back on her feet; causing Shinako and Haru to become distraught about Rikuo’s ‘playboy’ lifestyle.  I would have preferred if this episode didn’t exist, as it felt like the plot was being accelerated to inject a certain level of ‘excitement.’  But it felt superfluous because the methodical, emotional build up was entertaining enough in its own right, and needed no additional ‘spice’ to liven it up.  Although some may argue the plot was a bit leisurely, I would contend it never laggard, as most of the events felt organic.  And this authentic approach not only kept events grounded, it also made even mundane experiences feel important; like when Rikuo was having a difficult time giving Shinako the necklace for Christmas or when Shinako’s lip was quivering when Rikuo gently stroked her hair.  So while there were no overt plot devices that would give the viewer metaphorical whiplash, there were enough small events that added nervous anticipation about possible events to come.  Mix this with the pleasant backgrounds and placid OST, and Sing “Yesterday” For Me was just an overall satisfying experience.“It burnt slowly, but it never lost its heat.” — Krunchyman audience in any meaningful fashion (a critical element in these types of anime).

I am that scared of the drama tag lol.Warning: Mild spoilers ahead, read at your own risk.Now diving into the anime, we have Rikuo, our protagonist, who is your average college pass-out. He is lazy, he is unambitious and he has a terrible luck in love. He has a long-standing crush on his college friend Shinako, but is too shy to propose her. Sounds...just like me, huh? Things are moving uneventfully for him, when boom enters Haru, a short, young and pretty(?) girl who has a crush on Rikuo.You must be thinking, ah here’s another of them BS love-triangle anime where the MC is a blockhead and two pretty girls are after him. Well, you’re wrong, partially that is. Rikuo is too kind of a soul to hurt any of the girls (what an absolute idiot imo) and keeps Haru’s hopes alive while trying to propose to Shinako. Also, there’s this boy called Rou, who happens to be the little brother of Shinako’s first love, and has a crush on Shinako. Love-quadrilateral? This is some real nerve testing drama shit.Story (7/10): The plot’s well-paced and keeps you hooked up alright. But sometimes it becomes a bit predictable, nothing boring tho. You get a good look at the lives of 4 normal people, nothing extraordinary and overblown like most other romance anime. The best part is that if you’re someone normal (like me), you can relate a lot to the story. But Good Lord, that ending. Who in their right mind could even direct it. Destroyed the whole anime.Art (9/10): The art is amazing. I am a big fan of the art-style. Daga Kobo did a great job with the art, specially the light effects and cityscapes. I love it.Characters (6/10): If there’s one beef that I have with this show, it’s the characters. Don’t get me wrong, the characters are very much real-life like and well designed, but I cannot help myself from hating Haru and Rou. Why you ask? Because I am an unashamed shipper of Shinako x Rikuo. Personal feelings aside, the characters are amazing and you’ll find yourself thinking about your life every now and then (unless you are an extremely successful and happy person). There’s a lot of character development here and the emotions they express feel very much real. Also yes, fuck Rou and HaruSound (7/10): I am really not a sound guy, but the OST is good. I am specially a fan of the first ending theme, it was really soothing and calm. The little music that plays every now and then really sets an ambiance to the show and feels perfect.Enjoyment (6/10): Now comes the real part. Did I enjoy the show? Hell yeah. Will I recommend it to others? Hell yeah again. Do I have gripes about the show? Yes, and there are a few specific ones. First of all, drama anime/manga always tests my patience and Yesterday wo Uttate made me want to punch the screen a few times. Specifically, I wanted to punch Rikuo a few times. How big of a dunderhead can someone be smh.Overall (5/10): Why 5 you ask? Well, don’t get me wrong, Yesterday wo Uttate is a great show(until episode 11 that is) and I’ll recommend it to a few people, but that’s it. It’s not the best romance anime that I’ve watched and definitely not one of the best SoL anime too. Is it a good drama anime? Absolutely, and that’s why I rated it a 5(sorry :P). I would've rated the show a good 7, but episode 12 killed it for me. They rushed the whole thing, destroyed all that I loved about the show and made me want to erase the last episode from the mind. Also, I feel like 12 episodes didn’t do justice to the anime. The characters could have been fleshed out a lot more, and the fans could have been rewarded with more enjoyable moments. MAL did me a major angry after it edited the show from 18 episodes to 12, BOOOOOOSo do I recommend you to watch it? Absolutely yes, watch it till episode 11 that is. 12 is a clusterfuck and ruined the entire show. just like me, huh?

Miraculously it is assumed even, after 3 months the Haru would still be interested in Rikuo and would end in a happy relationship.Art: 8Very good art, where the unique art style helps depict the slow pace of the anime.Sound: 7Pretty good soundtracks here and there, nothing memorable though.Characters: 6Almost every character is unbearable to deal with except Haru. It amazes me how around 24 year olds act like they are still teenagers. Rikuo should have given up his relationship with Shinako after she initially rejects him, yet he continues to pursue this toxic crush. Shinako being the nice girl she is, being unable to confront Rikuo, keeps teasing a potential relationship. Rou is an obsessed teenager over his childhood crush despite her being a teacher. Haru is the only good character in this show, carrying this show hard. Her maturity and attentiveness towards characters was amazing and she shows she truly cares for the characters, as she was able to notice the smallest change in a character's personality and digs deep. Aside from Haru, the side characters were way better developed than the 3 main cast, as there was little to no character development from episode 1 to 12.The characters feel so shallow, as none of them ever confront each other for any of the mistakes they make, making the show feel like a ticking time bomb.Enjoyment: 7The ending left a bitter taste in my mouth, but I really enjoyed the first 6 episodes.Overall: 7Had it not been for Haru being the amazing character she was, this show would have been terrible. and break it off.The last 5 minutes of the show showed Rikuo crawling back into Haru and supposedly having a happy ending, and Shinako crawling back to Rou.

I was in love with the sounds, the setting, the feeling. The voice actor for the main male MC was just phenomenal–it's the same one who voiced the wolf in Beastars. That voice is almost iconic now. For the first couple episodes, this anime was 10/10 all around.And then I'm just not sure what went wrong. Maybe it was the show trying to focus on the four main characters instead of the just the three in the first triangle? Maybe it was how even at the end, 2 of the 4 characters were just not redeemable in any...way?

This anime is slow. Slow as life after daigaku, or dropping from high school, trying to make something worthy in society that is so stratified that breaking the chain of middle school - high school - (daigaku) leads to suboptimal jobs and weird looks from society.Also, it is difficult to understand when you were not in that situation (same as Kuzu no Honkai has very wide range of ratings).It definitely isnt anime high schoolers or even many college attendees wil value much. It is in its heart as life you are trying to stitch...together between working shifts in one or two works and pretend you do sort of well.

Slow, full of problems and realization that now you are on your own.', 'Honestly, I\'ve never really been emotionally invested when it came to seinen or coming of age stories. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, March comes in like a lion, A silent voice, etc...they touched upon depressing matters, but they never felt very realistic to me. Rather, it felt more of a melodramatic story no matter how you spun it. The fact that Yesterday wo Utatte tries to capture this sense of ""realisticness"" that I don\'t think other coming of age stories quite manage to cinch.I sympathized with Uozumi. Not sure what exactly you want to do, don\'t want to take that extra step forward because...it might end up not working. Frustrated because things didn\'t work out the way you imagined it to be. Honestly, I felt like I was in his shoes, and I felt like crap. I felt like crap. Damn, it was pretty depressing, and I think the show makes you understand Uozumi\'s feelings.Then, just like that, right around the point where he just got rejected and was depressed, a strange girl. Haru comes over into his life. Uozumi, however, still hasn\'t moved on, and the story becomes a touching romance and coming of age story as to how he becomes a better person and finds the courage to move on with his life after dealing with rejection.At least, that\'s what I think should have happened. So why exactly does this show turn from a melancholic coming of age story to a straight up drama and romance show? Uozumi\'s character is clearly childish and it really doesn\'t feel like he ever becomes mature. In fact, Haru is the character that shows the most composure in the entire show. Uozumi never really changes in that aspect, and I was hoping that the show would be focused on his coming to age and with Haru. Instead, I get this convoluted love octagon (the anime skips a lot of this). Yes, you heard me right. there\'s like 8 different people that are introduced into the story in order for there to be many, many love interests. I just don\'t understand why this show devolved into a romance drama where Haru likes Uozumi, Uozomi likes Shinako, Rou likes Shinako, etc.Not only do I not care about anyone that\'s not Uozomi, Shinako, and Haru, but these strained relationships ruin the entire show. Uozomi is standoffish and cold towards Haru for a majority of the series. Shinako is ambiguous with Uozomi from the beginning to the end. Uozomi doesn\'t move on with his life and romance for the entire series until the very end. I had to read the manga in order to make some more sense of the series. Trust me, it doesn\'t get much better. The only thing that you miss from the manga that\'s important is the fact that Haru and Uozomi have a lot more bonding moments/making up moments that aren\'t touched upon in the anime. This makes it so that Uozomi is less of a psychopath towards Haru, I guess. The entire series comes crashing down when the show isn\'t about Uozomi\'s self development, but rather, it\'s more focused on romantic interests and drama between these romantic interests the entire story. The manga is 112 chapters long. Clearly, the anime skipped quite a few things. But the reality is that 90% of the stuff that the manga skips is the filler content that\'s about useless romantic interests that litter the story. The author thinks that it\'s necessary for there to be people in love with other people out of the blue in order for there to be any semblance of character development. Plus, there\'s even romantic development in random side characters that I really didn\'t give a damn about.The show gets so sidetracked with this love drama, that it lost the essence of reality that it was trying to ground itself in. I didn\'t really care about who Uozomi gets paired with in the beginning, honestly. But the fact is rather than feeling sympathetic for Uozomi in the end, I find him to be pretty psychopathic. I can\'t even begin to figure out his thought process, especially towards the conclusion of the series. it might end up not working.

Usually, even if the couple that I shipped didn\'t win in the end in other romance anime, it will only left a little bit disappointment as long as the show itself is enjoyable, but not with this one. Heck, the couple that I ship actually win this time in Yesterday wo Utatte (I won\'t say who, because it will spoil the ending), but I just feel tortured watching those dreadful episodes before finally reaching...the desirable ending, especially starting the middle episode onward.The female villain is so horrible and cruel I can\'t barely watch, she would always thinking, worrying, and talking about another man while torturing the MC pretending dating him. Also the MC is too stupid and indecisive letting the sly woman do as she please. Hence, most of the later episodes are consist of the pitiful heroine getting trashed every time while the villain gloomily playing with her masochist MC. I\'m glad I didn\'t see this while airing, so I can skip most of the villain scene with her bratty crush.So in summary, the story is not that bad, the occasional humor is pretty spot on, and the ending is pretty good, I just hope the happy couple (MC and heroine) got more footage in the end. other than that, the characters are mostly bad and unlikable, except the main heroine, almost no character development, bad execution will make you feel wasting your time especially the last half of the episodes.I won\'t recommend watching this pathetic anime, except you\'re ready for the torture or prepare to skip a lot of scenes. Watch ""Just Because"" instead, far better than this. the desirable ending, especially starting the middle episode onward.The female villain is so horrible and cruel I can\'t barely watch, she would always thinking, worrying, and talking about another man while torturing the MC pretending dating him. Also the MC is too stupid and indecisive letting the sly woman do as she please.

Yesterday wo Utatte is a drama-romance-comedy anime about crushes, dating and friendship. I gave this anime a 9/10 score, and will go into the details now. (my main points are written in the ""character"" section btw.)📖Story (8/10):The plot is pretty simple. No action, adventure, fantasy magic, ecchi fan-service, oversized boobs, etc. Just a coming-of-age story with innocent love and friendship. We start off with a love square. Haru loves Rikuo, but Rikuo has had a crush on Shinako since their university years. Shinako considers Rikuo a friend. A highschooler...called Rou loves Shinako, but she only considers him as family. The whole anime is about the development of these four\'s relationships. A simple setting, but intricate story.It\'s very entertaining to watch if you want to spectate realistic human relationships and conversations. Some of their lines really hit home, and bitter but sweet thoughts and emotions welled up in my heart and mind. I personally thought back on my relationships (past and present) while watching this anime, and could relate to a lot of events, while some I didn\'t relate to, but made a note in my mind to do/not to do the same thing.📷Art (10/10):The art and animation is magnificent. This is pure eyecandy. There are no flashy lightings like in action animes (Fate UBW for example), nor is there colorful tones everywhere. The colors are very realistic. They\'re colors you would actually see in real life. The usual grey, black, white, brown. But the art-style is beautiful. The details in the characters are impressive, and the animation of their movements, their facial expressions capture actual human movements and faces so well. For reference, if you liked the art and animation style of Plastic Memories and Engaged to the Unidentified, you\'ll most likely appreciate this anime\'s art as well.🎵Sound (8/10):Personally, I didn\'t find anything impressive with the sound and music in this anime. Music didn\'t really stand out, but it wasn\'t useless either. While there were no epic drops or anything, this anime\'s story and style didn\'t really need those epic sounding soundtracks. For this anime, the sound was pure background music. You don\'t really pay attention to it, but if it weren\'t present, something would feel off. The guitar+strings combo added a sweet and heartwarming feeling to each scenes in the anime. So while the soundtrack wasn\'t really noteworthy, it was essential and enhanced the anime\'s flavor and style. Therefore, I gave it an 8 for very good.😶Character (10/10):So, many people had problems with some of the characters, complaining that they were too ""indecisive"" or ""uninteresting"" or whatever. Personally, i found that to be the charm and core of this anime. In most animes these days, you have a lot of unrealistic characters who act in certain trope ways (tsundere, yandere, the super honest pervert, always shouting and screaming, etc.)But this anime captured a real human being\'s behaviour, attitude and emotions very precisely in everyday life situations. The hesitation you feel when giving your crush a present. The indecisiveness when you\'re about to confess. The thoughts that go through your mind when you want to tell someone a secret. The feeling of disappointment in yourself when you let someone else down. The feeling when you\'re lost in life and don\'t know what you want to do (as a job, as a living, as a friend, as family, etc.).While I admit that many of the characters were awfully indecisive, I believe that many people in the world would actually act in the same way when confronted with the same situation. Even the childish characters and mature characters were portrayed masterfully.I could relate to many of the characters, as some of them portrayed my stages in life pretty accurately. The childish one who acts a bit annoyingly. The indecisive one who doesn\'t know what to do with life. The mature one who doesn\'t hesitate to speak up her mind. The silent one who doesn\'t want to ruin her current relationships. Most of them I found relatable, and whenever a character picked out the flaws of another character, I would silently nod in agreement while also feeling offended. Especially the ""I wish you had the pushiness that [Name] does.""... That one really did a lot of internal damage... I thought back to all the past relationships, friend and family relationships that went wrong, and how it could\'ve been corrected if i were pushier...Anyways, so conclude, the characters in this anime were written very realistically. Many anime watchers didn\'t like them as they watch anime looking for entertainment and unrealistic scenarios (fantasy, magic, superpower, isekai, harem-protag). But I think that the anime industry has too many of these ""unrealistic"" settings today, and this one was a breath of fresh air, where every character was somewhat relatable, and reminded me of some of my irl friends & family.🎉Enjoyment (9/10):As someone who loves stories like this (realistic setting, intricate character relationships and development, drama, romance and friendship), I really enjoyed this anime. It wasn\'t like those superpower, fantasy magic anime where the action was amazing and the fight scenes were breathtaking. No. This one was slow-paced but attention grabbing. And watching the characters grow was also entertaining, as if i were watching my own child (i don\'t have a child tho) grow. It is something you definitely DON\'T want to watch when you want some heart-wrenching drama, tearjerking romance, or hilarious comedy. But something to watch when you want to relax a bit and want some fresh air, but still want intricate characters and relationships? I think this is worth a chance.Overall: I gave this a 9/10 overall. The anime wasn\'t a masterpiece, but it definitely portrayed human relationships and behavior, emotions and thoughts masterfully. It was truly a ""great"" anime. One that I will keep in mind when people ask me for \'realistic\' romance anime. called Rou loves Shinako, but she only considers him as family.

I say this because it had the makings of being a great show, with a good OST and somewhat unique art style but the show itself is just so mediocre with a hollow story. I've seen worse shows than this but at least they brought something new to the table.I kept waiting for the story to develop into something better since I thought it was 18 episodes but to my surprise there's actually only 12 and I would say it was a huge waste of time.Barely anything of importance...happens except poor character and relationship development. It also didn't help that the ending felt rushed. This is my first review on here and I had to write one because this show was such a drag and so pointless that it made me a little mad.

The characters are complicated with many different issues of thier own that they have to deal with on a daily biases. As the story progressed you really saw an attempt to grow each individual character and maybe become a better human from this experience.The most disappointing story i have watched so far was this anime... You find out that at the end of the show that the characters decides to not grow as a human and rather just stay exactly who they are and purposefully through out all the growth that they...did have...This story really did feel like a big middle finger to the face...

This show is extremely underrated. I guess you have to like such series, but I finished it in no time. The moments I wasn't watching I was probably as much in my head as the main characters. For anyone who likes a slow-paced romantic drama that depicts how confusing life and love can be for those who overthink, this is the show you want to watch. I honestly think this show is next to none in what it tries to achieve. Nonetheless, I do understand those critics that suggest that anime might perhaps not have been the best style for this...script; yet since I love anime, I do not mind it in the least, and even prefer it (despite the few disadvantages). script; yet since I love anime, I do not mind it in the least, and even prefer it (despite the few disadvantages)."", 'I\'m sorry, but this is going to be more of a rant than a review. This will mostly be about the last episode, and why I don\'t think it ruins the whole anime, as so many others do.This is actually aimed at the people who already watched the anime, and if you haven\'t, I think that you should go watch it and form an opinion of your own, untainted by what other people think you should think about it. Go and watch it with an open mind (if you like character dramas, and are okay with characters so realistic they even tend to be unlikable...because they remind you of the stupid mistakes and you\'ve made in your own life, and even call you out on your own self-sabotaging behaviors) and when you finish, come back here to read.  Because, obviously HEAVY SPOILERS AHEAD.Here I go:OKAYYY... So people are hating on the finale, and I can totally see why. But I wonder if... Mmm...Okey, let me break this down in parts because I just can\'t...First, I would want to know how easy people get their own opinions changed by ""the general opinion"". Last week I was super excited about this ending, and then heard people saying that this was going to be the last episode (I thought there were 18 as many others) and that that would mean this would cramp up an incredible amount of material into 24 min.So, YES, they did cramp up a LOT into this episode, and I did feel that. I came in totally expecting to hate this episode, and maybe it was because I\'d lowered my expectation, but I also... just kind of liked it? Yes, it could\'ve been better, but come on, people, learn to put your expectation on check when it comes to anime. You know how the industry is.Even for an episode that went through so much in so little time, I felt it did more than decent as an ending for this story. The story is about characters that are as human as I\'ve seen them in an anime in a long time. And yes, this means that most of them aren\'t actually likable. I was in for the Shinako and Rikuo ship because they started out as people with a bunch of personal baggage, and they were doing some serious advances in changing as people (I didn\'t like any of them at the beginning), and then they break up. I get it, people, you\'re disappointed, and feel it was all for nothing, but to me, it\'s just two people that realized that they didn\'t have to change to be in a relationship at all. That they were forcing something that wasn\'t meant to be, just because they wanted to do it a long time ago.And all it took was for Rikuo to see Shinako chase after Rou. Yes, people. Emotions change like that. He realized he didn\'t do that for Haru, and that that might have meant that he still loved more Shinako than she loved him. So why keep fighting, when you\'re still the one putting more effort? when you\'re also hurting the one you\'re dating just by being with her? And when you realize that someone liked you since before you even started putting your life together? Rikuo even admits something in this episode that I had kept thinking the whole time: That they\'re too similar, and that they shouldn\'t be worrying about what the other is thinking. They\'re both introverted people, and yes, for a relationship, that can be pretty exhausting.I don\'t know, maybe people don\'t want to read between lines. Or maybe it is because they actually think Rikuo is an asshole for going straight to Haru after breaking up with Shinako. I mean, he says to Haru ""Shinako dumped me"", which makes him looks like a total asshole, but we know that\'s not true. He was the one that told Shinako that they shouldn\'t be together. But again, he was nervous and he said he didn\'t know how to explain. So he said Shinako dumped him. Maybe because he felt guilty? who knows. But he was doing what he thought was right. Was it rushed? Yes. And Haru herself was not very much explored in the anime, which makes it even less satisfying, but her being completely infatuated by him, I feel like both their actions made complete sense.We don\'t see what happens with Shinako and Rou. I don\'t think we\'re supposed to think they started dating. Just that they fixed their broken relationship. So on the whole, this finale does what it can to wrap up everything without leaving loose ends. What bothers me is that they accelerated the pacing this last few episodes when the ones in the beginning were so slow. Though they were still rushed if we think how many manga chapters they were adapting in the first place.I only read the first volume of the manga before the anime. I wanted to be an anime-only, so maybe that bothers some people too. Fans of a manga will defend it till death for it to have a Faithfull adaptation, for better or worse. And since I saw the first episode I knew it would get rushed, because the first episode IS THE FIRST VOLUME. So I also had my expectations in check, but I prefered to be an anime-only. So, as an anime-only, I say that I really enjoyed this finale, even if it had more of the flaws the series had since the very first episode. WOW. How dare you anime, ending with the same flaws you started with?Anyway, I\'m reading the manga now. I enjoyed the anime, but I know the manga will probably be much better. Does that mean the anime is bad? Hell no. Does a rushed ending means the anime is bad? Well, if you think that, you probably didn\'t like it all along.

Think about it.8/10', 'This is my first review ever! ---* SPOILER FREE *---This anime seems to be receiving more criticism than it deserves. The anime does borrow some aspects from other romance animes, HOWEVER, this is not a bad thing.Quick Explanation-Yesterday wo Utatte is very enjoyable, at least for me. It has a slow pacing, enjoyable characters, is incredibly realistic and relatable, and manages to pronounce higher maturity than its counterparts. There is no intro to the show, which I find is actually great. It means the episodes are longer and more fulfilling, and instead of interrupting the watching experience, entrances the watcher more. The show revolves around...a similar mc to that of Toradora. The story is more accustomed to that of real life, it is a seinen.My Thoughts-Six episodes in, and this anime seems to have garnered itself a lower review from the average than I believe it is worthy of. This show is slower, but I love the pacing. It develops the episodes fast enough to enjoy and understand the concepts displayed, makes great use of making the audience understand rather than spoon feeding the viewer. To finish up my review, this anime thus far is one of my favorites. I have seen a considerable amount of anime, from a very young childhood upto now, and I must commend this anime for what it is worth; which is a lot. Take what I have said with a grain of salt, but form your own opinions on the show! I made this review because anime viewers- myself included- prematurely judge animes based on the predisposed reviews we are exposed to.TLDR-If you are looking for a show with a breezy pacing that is relaxing yet tells a compelling and relatable story, then watch this anime! Form your own opinion on this show, it is worth the watch! It may not change your life, but it will give you a nice laugh and fulfill your viewing desires.P.S. Waiting for new episodes sucks- Sincerely, an accustomed ""weeb"", Zander a similar mc to that of Toradora.

Waiting for new episodes sucks- Sincerely, an accustomed ""weeb"", Zander', 'This show blew itLiterary, this show had the chance to be great, but the end was early from the start.Characters:Haru is the character by far in this show. My favorite aspects of her is that she clearly expresses what she really wants. She may not understand what being in love is, but she knows that if she were to fall in love it was to be with Rikuo. The reasons are very detailed, but she puts the most honest effort into a relationship which he neglected even on a friendship point of view.Rou: I honestly didn\'t like him at first, but I grew to understand...how he feels. He\'s in love with someone who will never love him back in the same way. He\'s also upfront about how he feels, just as much as Haru and that\'s to be appreciated. He\'s young so he can\'t be faulted for being as he his if you see him in a negative light, but he\'s more grown than either of the two ""adults"" in this show.Rikuo: I had hopes for him to not be as sorry as he ended up being. He legit pushed away everyone else to go for a girl who rejected him multiple times and wasn\'t even sure she liked him romantically ""she didn\'t after all these episodes"". He gets dumped in a way that makes no sense, like you just come to the conclusion that it wasn\'t love after 3+ months? That\'s not even the main issue, you go for Haru after being rejected, confess and make it seem like it was the right thing to do. Real life doesn\'t work like that, if you tried something like that you would probably get cursed out and get called a tool. I can\'t believe how this dude really treated her like crap, only feeling guilt for 11 episodes then feeling that he\'s in love with the poor girl.Shinako: The worst character in this show by far. If Rikuo is a 3, Shinako is a -8. She is legit the worst, she toys with Rou, not giving this man the real time of day to understand where he\'s coming from. She toys with Rikuo, even if you say she didn\'t understand how she felt, she really put this man in a circle since college! They are grown adults in the mist of their careers, do you even realize how much emotional distress was going through both Rikuo and Rou since then? The character ranks would be way higher if she wasn\'t in this show, or if she wasn\'t so unappealing an vial as a character.Side Characters: The side characters such as Chika and Fukuda had way more positive feeling character development than either of the adults in this show; that\'s sad.Animation: The animation is the best aspect of this show, I won\'t go into much detail since it\'s not anything special. It\'s nice with it\'s back grounds, I noticed a sense in episode 12 where the animation didn\'t seem super fluid, but that\'s all I took or remember.Music: The music isn\'t special, not worth mentioning. Ending 1 and 2 isn\'t cool, it\'s just there.Story Board: Worst aspect of this show next to the Rikuo and Shinako as characters. The only times of this show that felt good is when Rikuo and Haru were having fun in the first few episodes. A moment I really did enjoy was when Haru confesses everything about herself to Rikuo since she was always keeping her personal life hidden from others. The story it self is trash, legit no sense of direction and a lot of time skips. This anime really was just showing us that we should block out everybody else for the sense of love, and the love really wasn\'t even the right feeling.Conclusion: I wouldn\'t recommend this even if it was the only anime show on earth; legit go watch Nisekoi where it doesn\'t have a conclusion in the anime, but the manga ending is worth just watching it and then reading the ending online somewhere. it\'s more rewarding than this show by a landslide. Love and Lies is another anime like this in my opinion with the love triangle that would be better than this, it\'s not amazing, but it\'s leagues above this show.Don\'t watch this crap. how he feels. He\'s in love with someone who will never love him back in the same way. He\'s also upfront about how he feels, just as much as Haru and that\'s to be appreciated. He\'s young so he can\'t be faulted for being as he his if you see him in a negative light, but he\'s more grown than either of the two ""adults"" in this show.Rikuo: I had hopes for him to not be as sorry as he ended up being. He legit pushed away everyone else to go for a girl who rejected him multiple times and wasn\'t even sure she liked him romantically ""she didn\'t after all these episodes"". He gets dumped in a way that makes no sense, like you just come to the conclusion that it wasn\'t love after 3+ months? That\'s not even the main issue, you go for Haru after being rejected, confess and make it seem like it was the right thing to do. Real life doesn\'t work like that, if you tried something like that you would probably get cursed out and get called a tool. I can\'t believe how this dude really treated her like crap, only feeling guilt for 11 episodes then feeling that he\'s in love with the poor girl.Shinako: The worst character in this show by far. If Rikuo is a 3, Shinako is a -8. She is legit the worst, she toys with Rou, not giving this man the real time of day to understand where he\'s coming from. She toys with Rikuo, even if you say she didn\'t understand how she felt, she really put this man in a circle since college! They are grown adults in the mist of their careers, do you even realize how much emotional distress was going through both Rikuo and Rou since then? The character ranks would be way higher if she wasn\'t in this show, or if she wasn\'t so unappealing an vial as a character.Side Characters: The side characters such as Chika and Fukuda had way more positive feeling character development than either of the adults in this show; that\'s sad.Animation: The animation is the best aspect of this show, I won\'t go into much detail since it\'s not anything special. It\'s nice with it\'s back grounds, I noticed a sense in episode 12 where the animation didn\'t seem super fluid, but that\'s all I took or remember.Music: The music isn\'t special, not worth mentioning. Ending 1 and 2 isn\'t cool, it\'s just there.Story Board: Worst aspect of this show next to the Rikuo and Shinako as characters. The only times of this show that felt good is when Rikuo and Haru were having fun in the first few episodes. A moment I really did enjoy was when Haru confesses everything about herself to Rikuo since she was always keeping her personal life hidden from others. The story it self is trash, legit no sense of direction and a lot of time skips. This anime really was just showing us that we should block out everybody else for the sense of love, and the love really wasn\'t even the right feeling.Conclusion: I wouldn\'t recommend this even if it was the only anime show on earth; legit go watch Nisekoi where it doesn\'t have a conclusion in the anime, but the manga ending is worth just watching it and then reading the ending online somewhere. it\'s more rewarding than this show by a landslide. Love and Lies is another anime like this in my opinion with the love triangle that would be better than this, it\'s not amazing, but it\'s leagues above this show.Don\'t watch this crap.', 'Based on other people\'s negative reviews, I felt compelled to write about this. (no spoilers)A lot of people disliked this anime because of the character\'s behaviours, getting frustrated because ""everything could be solved if such and such did this or that"". Perhaps as anime watchers we get used to headstrong, consistent main characters who have only one goal and strive to achieve it. But in reality, everyone deals with conflicting emotions, thoughts of ""what if"" accompanied with a looming sense of regret, and and struggling to what they think and what they actually feel at the time.That\'s what I love about this anime. It\'s...so rare to see our main characters (Rikuo and Shinako) fleshed out so deeply, struggling to make sense of their situation. Choosing to throw away this logical idea of stability in order to chase something that makes them passionate and alive, is such a raw display of emotion that is so rare to see, even in slice of life. I doubt we will ever see this sort of internal conflict expressed so elegantly.The art in this anime though: wow. Expectations aren\'t really that high for slice of life anime, but I was shocked to see the effort put into the animation here and how realistically the characters move. It just brought everything to life for me and drove it home for me.In the end, I fell in love with the characters, and I felt relieved that everyone was able to find peace with their relationships with each other. If you\'re looking and expecting a tear-jerker, this isn\'t going to be it. In the end it expresses emotions as subtly as we feel them in real life. Still, brilliant writing and brilliant execution. Definitely worth a watch. so rare to see our main characters (Rikuo and Shinako) fleshed out so deeply, struggling to make sense of their situation.

Definitely worth a watch.', ""MAJOR SPOILERS AHEADI like this kind of tropes --one-sided love then being reciprocated.I enjoyed Haru's character but I wish she was given more depth than a highschool dropout who fell in love with a college boy at first sight and followed him around until he got used to her and eventually fell in love with her. She had so much potential given the kind of introduction she had in the first episode.Rikou was the most realistic character for me. Except for the ex girlfriend part which was, to be honest, a useless arc. He perfectly depicted the life of a person who was...somewhat lost and had no motivation or goal in life, that is until he ventured out of his comfort zone and worked hard to get a full-time job as a (learning) cameraman from his part-time job at a convenience store. I appreciate his growth throughout the series. The part where he was confused with his feelings for Haru is partly understandable. He did say many times to Haru not to wait for him anymore and it was mentioned that he was too nice and was not assertive enough so that's why he couldn't be frank in telling Haru to keep distance. or probably because he was in denial or he wasn't able to face the looming fact that he was growing feelings for Haru already. His actions were understandable, but I wouldn't tolerate it if it happened to me, lol. He did disappoint me in many scenes where I thought he would go to Haru but instead always ended up at Shinako's door.BUT SHINAKO, oh good heavens, Shinako was such a mess. I understand that she has not yet moved on from her past love, and she can grieve for as long as she wants to, but I wish she didn't involve other people's lives while she was healing. She was so undecisive and her relationship with Rikou was going back and forth. One minute she was ok with Rikou x Haru, the next minute she and Rikou were hanging out as more than friends. She was told to keep distance from Rou, but she keeps on coming back to their house to cook them (or Rou) meals. She was sad, and that's okay. But she was unfair to the people around her because she didn't vocalize her thoughts and feelings properly. But Rikou knew all of these anyway and both of them consented to the kind of relationship they were gonna have, so the mutual breakup was inevitable and calm.I think this is what makes the series relatable and more realistic than it seems. Our emotions and our fate are fragile, unpredictable and uncontrollable. There were annoying parts, but if you think about it, it could happen in real life. We don't have everything planned out that goes smoothly.One MAJOR THING that turned me off though was that in episode 3 up until episode 5, it was clear that Rikou was developing feelings for Haru, and their banters and slight jealousy made my heart pound, but midway through the series it focused on Rikou x Shinako whose relationship was soooooo stressful. And then they ended it with a mutual breakup and then we see Rikou running off to see Haru and Haru kisses him off the hook. Haru went the extra mile to see Rikou all the time and she was more often met with heartbreaks, so I kind of expected that Rikou would be given at least the slightest challenge to get Haru back, BUT NO. Ugh.Haru deserved better than feel like she was a backup plan (because Rikou told her during his confession that Shinako dumped him when in fact he was the one who broke up with Shinako!) But I'm glad they ended up together. The ending felt rushed though.This series had a lot of potential if the story had focused more on Rikou x Haru and had shown more progress on their relationship rather than the stressful Rikou x Shinako. somewhat lost and had no motivation or goal in life, that is until he ventured out of his comfort zone and worked hard to get a full-time job as a (learning) cameraman from his part-time job at a convenience store.

It’s possible this has shaped how I view this show, but it would still be one of my favorites so far. Rating the show 10/10 is merely because of how much enjoyment I’ve gotten out of the series. Every saturday it felt like I had something to look forward to in my otherwise uneventful life. Regardless of what I say here on out, I’m not saying the show is perfect. I’m saying this is how much I enjoyed it.This show very realistically and melancholically portrays how...love, and the complexities behind the concept interact with each other, and how people grow up and get thrown into the adult world. This is the strength of the show, and it executes it brilliantly.MINOR SPOILERS BELOWStory: 9/10 , Characters 10/10As far as the story goes, it is set in the late 90s, before cell phone usage was common practice. This makes certain aspects of the show unfamiliar, especially in terms of how you contact loved ones. Back then it was by letter, calling or meeting, nowadays you can contact anyone while mobile. We follow the four main characters - Rikuo, Rou, Shinako & Haru - as the relationship dynamic between them progresses.Our protagonist Rikuo, is a part-timer who lacks direction in life post-graduation. To me, this along with his laid back and introverted personality immediately made me identify with the character, as I have been having the same struggle. His daily life is sort of mundane, but he has a passion for photography which he will develop as the series goes on.His life changes radically when Shinako, his high school friend and crush Shinako moved back into town after completing her teaching education, and starts working at a nearby school. Rikuo finds out she’s back in town and all his old feelings for her come back, although they are bittersweet. On the day of their graduation, he was rejected by her, and seemingly did not comprehend why. He starts talking to her, and then two new characters get introduced in his life; Haru & Rou.Rou is the younger brother of Shinakos middle school crush, whose entire family is close to her. He is mellow, but is not afraid to say what he thinks and what he wants. Rou has had a hopeless crush on Shinako for as long as he could remember, also feeling jealous of his older brother. His dead older brother. As he shows romantic interest for Shinako, she declines, and he doesn’t know how to take no for an answer so his emotions boil over.Shinako has been in a mentally unhealthy place since the loss of her loved one, and settled for a job in teaching. As the series goes on she warms up to the idea of dating Rikuo but it’s not fleshed out if it’s because she was in love with him during high school but couldn’t admit it because she was still mourning, if she was projecting her other love onto Rikuo, or if she grew fond of / started appreciating him as an individual.The ever so eccentric and outgoing Haru is a high-school dropout who went to the same school as Rikuo, and additionally, Shinako was her teacher when she dropped out. She had a minor interaction with Rikuo at some point, which eventually led to falling deeply in love with him. Her outspoken and direct affection for Rikuo is not proportional in both directions, and she faces the cold reality of following someone who at most is leading you on.If I were to summarise the dynamics at play, I would say that Haru and Rou are both in love with people who are not interested in them, while Shinako and Rikuo are in love with an idealised version of their teenage crushes. This is a simplification which leaves out the intricacies, but the symmetry of these interactions and similarities between each pair feels upon reflection, very intentional and interesting.Though I enjoy it, and live through the show, going this deep into a romance will not be appreciated for everyone. I’ve seen countless comments on the internet complaining about “things not happening”, “Haru best girl”, and “Rou/Shinako are manipulative”, just don’t cut to the chase. Though I can admit to have enjoyed shows of a more sexual nature, shows with less in depth, defined, and more immature relationships, and shows with more teasing, falling deeply in love is always what I’ve preferred in romance, and will always prefer. The “cheap tricks” of sex, affection, “moe” certainly have their place in anime, they are just not as prevalent in this one, and for good reason; it doesn’t need it.Another criticism I’ve heard is that the characters don’t talk as much as some people would have liked… and I have to agree to a certain extent. It probably has something to do with the short length of the anime, but judging the episodes we’ve seen alone it doesn’t really ring true. I know personally, that talking about these subjects can be tense, you may not get your point across, you may not say the right words, do the right things, at all. This show captures that aspect of REAL LOVE better than anything I’ve ever read or watched before, and this criticism is in that aspect, a compliment.The only reason the story isn’t rated 10/10 is because the initially reported 18 episode long season was cut down to 12 episodes, and I don’t think the 113 chapter long manga could fit in just 18, let alone 12 episodes. The ending ends up feeling rushed and bittersweet, as I would have wanted to delve deeper into their lives. With that said I have no clue if there will be a 2nd season, but if there is I reserve further judgement until then. Because of this I feel like I have to buy and read the manga.Art 8/10It has a style, a palette and executes it well. The only criticism I have is sometimes the framing / animation could have been better, and less choppy, and while the cinematography is great it could be better. Imagine having this show animated with more interesting backdrops and a higher animation budget - I’m ecstatic by the thought of it.Sound 9/10The soundtrack fits great with the mood each moment has, and the tracks are very cute. I have no complaints, but it’s not jaw dropping hence the 9/10.And thus, my most thorough review to date, is complete. Hope the read was worth it! love, and the complexities behind the concept interact with each other, and how people grow up and get thrown into the adult world.

A story that took 18 years to make. Overall I was happy that the mange finished and got an anime. The author really took their time with it.This story is not about High Schoolers falling in love and getting a happy ending or whateve. But about Adults. And that's refreshing. Anyone of these character either there main or supporting can be relatable.So I really recommend watching this anime.

Basically Guy A has crush on college friend Girl B, but has a confession from a notably younger and independent girl C whom he doesn't even remember why she knows him. The show spends 90% of Guy A and Girl B trying to...form a relationship and goes into EXTREME DETAIL over them trying to make it work. The entire time Girl C is way more likeable and genuine and honest and you like her SO much more, but Guy A treats her like actual GARBAGE until the last fucking episode where suddenly everything goes 180 and it all gets resolved in the span of half an episode.Thanks, I hate it. form a relationship and goes into EXTREME DETAIL over them trying to make it work.

He can\'t. Or at least he can\'t with this cast.""- YESTORAKS, GeeKon MagazinesThe typical Fujiwara Yoshiyuki anime (Vanguarg G, GJ BU) can be classified by a few words: contrived, insipid, and predictable. Yesterday wo uttate ,while not the worst work Fujiwara Yoshiyuki has done, is a limp misfire. There are moments during the course of the anime when it looks like it might be headed in an interesting direction, but those hopes go up in smoke during the last act as everything aligns itself for the...tearful, feel-good ending. The central problem with the anime isn\'t that it deals with several hot-button topics, but that it addresses them with a shocking lack of emotional honesty.This is the synopsis make me want to facepalm:Rikuo Uozumi has all but resigned himself to a bleak future, aimlessly working at a convenience store in Tokyo after graduating from college. His monotonous life is interrupted when the peculiar Haru Nonaka makes a lively appearance, frequently dropping by his workplace to befriend him. When Rikuo learns that an old college friend and crush, Shinako Morinome, has moved back into town, he reaches out to further their relationship. Unbeknownst to Rikuo however, Shinako is carrying painful memories from her past that were holding her back from accepting his feelings. Meanwhile, as Haru continually opens up to Rikuo, he discovers that she, much like him, is living by herself and wants to step out of her comfort zone into an uncertain future.The prickly interaction between Rikuo and other character that will be conflict is predictable. Rikuo brings with her the winds of trouble.That ambiguity is what makes parts of Fujiwara Rule interesting at times. When one considers how poisonous the accusation is, and that it might be issued as a means of revenge, it gives the anime a bit of an edge. Unfortunately, ""edgy"" is not one of the three nouns I used above to describe a Yoshiyuki endeavor. Eventually, things are resolved definitively and in a manner that\'s far too pat for a movie with this many deeply troubled characters. At a minimum, Rikuo is in desperate need of counseling, but in a Fujiwara movie, all that\'s needed to set her right are a hug and a tearful apology. If it was this easy to reconcile dysfunctional families, we would all be living happily ever after.Fujiwara is a crafter of fairy tales and trusting him with material that demands a darker tone and a defter hand is a mistake. Not that Tanaka Jin script is well-written. The dialogue is mostly awful, a subplot featuring a bunch of cheap girl conflict is painful, and the ending is unacceptable. But Fukiwara\'s involvement does nothing to improve upon the screenplay.Yesterday wo uttate will most likely be recalled as the movie that resulted in Morgan Creek CEO James G. Robinson rebuking Lohan for her poor work ethic. There\'s certainly nothing else about the production worth remembering. tearful, feel-good ending.

Uozumi has a crush on Shinako his old college classmate,...he idolizes Shinako as she has managed to do something with her life, and she has always been pulling Uozumi through life. But Shinko is stuck and straight up rejects Uozumi at the beginning of the series as she has not got over her own personal hang-ups, she is still chained to the past. All this sounds great but the issue with sing yesterday to me is that the is all open to interpretation, meaning a lot of other viewers don’t think of the series like this. Sing yesterday to me only presents the skeleton of a romance story without building on to it while plodding along at an inconsistent pace, introducing characters and then removing them from the story the next episode or even the same episode while skipping certain parts to give screen time to things that frankly don’t matter. The show also puts arbitrary roadblocks such as misunderstandings to create drama. For a show that has adult characters everyone is surprisingly childish.Art: Sing yesterday to me employs a sort of rough pencil drew aesthetic which can be interesting to look at and flashback sequences prefer to show the characters through manga panels creating as clear distinction between flashback and present-day moments.Sound: There isn’t anything memorable to say about the sound department the voice acting is solid, and the OST matches the scenes. Although the show doesn’t have an opening theme, but this might not even be noticeable as the show flows so well. Sometimes.Enjoyment: Another is with sing yesterday to me is that it doesn’t have a core hook. The characters aren’t to interesting to watch and the drama is so forced and predictable  you can see it coming from a mile away. Although it’s not too bad but some characters like the fourth ‘main’ character which I have deliberately avoided talking about are annoying to see on screen. he idolizes Shinako as she has managed to do something with her life, and she has always been pulling Uozumi through life.

For a show that has adult characters everyone is surprisingly childish.Art: Sing yesterday to me employs a sort of rough pencil drew aesthetic which can be interesting to look at and flashback sequences prefer to show the characters through manga panels creating as clear distinction between flashback and present-day moments.Sound: There isn’t anything memorable to say about the sound department the voice acting is solid, and the OST matches the scenes. Although the show doesn’t have an opening theme, but this might not even be noticeable as the show flows so well. Sometimes.Enjoyment: Another is with sing yesterday to me is that it doesn’t have a core hook. The characters aren’t to interesting to watch and the drama is so forced and predictable  you can see it coming from a mile away. Although it’s not too bad but some characters like the fourth ‘main’ character which I have deliberately avoided talking about are annoying to see on screen.', 'This is my first review.I wouldn\'t necessarily consider myself a neophyte of Anime. I watched the first episode of Pokemon as it aired in 1998.But I don\'t speak Japanese, and I think I only have a tenuous grasp (at best) on the ancillary ""I watch Anime"" culture. (What is a weeb?)I began this review like a 13 year old girl starting her diary for two reasons. 1) As a caveat that I could be wrong. 2) Because I think there is a reason why I don\'t watch more Anime.I read a review of this show as I waited for the 12th episode to simulcast...on Crunchyroll. I loved and agreed with everything the reviewer said. But he rated the show a 3, and I am just avoiding giving this show a 10 like Shinako and Rikuo avoid a relationship for 12 episodes.The reviewer picked up this show for the same reason I did. I mistaken belief that it is an allusion to The Beatles instead of whoever RC Succession is.He continues, ""The idea of this show, as they said, is to be \'slow-paced,\' but it feels more like dead-paced.""Reviewer concludes, ""The characters have no development, their arcs have no sense and the story goes nowhere."" Haru couldn\'t have said it better herself in her first appearance of the last episode.So, I said I was writing my own review, but really... I just kind of co-opted someone else\'s review. He gets it! But, I guess I have to write my own review. So, here is what I wish I could say to him:Who says we need another better SAO, while SAO is still currently airing? (Looking at you Tower of God)Who says we need character development in slice-of-life? Isn\'t the whole point of slice-of-life that life is interesting by itself without giant robots, the supernatural, explosions, plot twists?Anime, what I am trying to say is that Postmodernism looks good on you!It is not fun to be stuck in a dead end job, looking around, and watching the world pass you by. I could have used a Rikuo when it happened to me.And rejection isn\'t novel to television. But TV has told me (and reviewer just like everyone else has bought in) that rejection lasts for 23 minutes, and then we move on... Next!I\'m not writing this to be a snob. (But I am aware that I am one). But if I am a snob, I am a hypocritical one. I love the tropes; they work! I rewatch the same vapid mid-2000\'s NBC comedies before I go to bed at night, because the formula exists for a reason. It distracts us from real life.But, it is nice to see real life, even if it is an animated fiction. It\'s nice to escape the formula, tropes, and what my wife calls ""high stakes.""Ok. I\'ll ruin my review the same way RIkuo ruined the ending of the show. I\'ll just come right out and say those 3 words.More of this! on Crunchyroll.

Yesterday wo Utatte is the story of a guy who meets some girl and then ends up seeing his crush from college the same day.I watched this when it aired, so my opinion is of someone who put aside time once a week just to watch the new episodes of an anime they didnt enjoy. I think that dedication makes this review a worth reading.I think it's a extremely lacking in the story department, and becomes unenjoyable nearing the end of the show.

You'll be getting a slow paced, slice of life love drama, that attempts to be realistic. Long story short, we get a few characters' daily lives as they go through the complicated struggles of love.To start off with, one thing I really liked about this anime was the art style and the animation. Just looked a bit different to the stuff we're now used to seeing, so it was nice to look at. With the animation, I'm obviously not saying that you'll be seeing the most eye-catching things in the...world, I just appreciated that the characters tended to actually move and change expressions as they talk. It was actually nice to watch the dialogue (which is quite important in a drama that revolves around people talking).Now let's go with the story. I personally enjoyed most of it. People have their everyday issues, and this story simply follows the way our main characters end up coming to terms with them (or generally, the ways in which they deal with them). It mostly revolves around the characters (romantic) feelings towards each other (since this is a love drama after all), as well as some exploration of our protagonist and what he wants to do with his life in general. There isn’t much else. And many may feel that this, on its own, is probably not enough for this to be successful. If you would agree with that, or if this generally does not sound interesting enough, then this anime will NOT be for you. The show doesn't really do anything too special, so it would be completely reasonable to not find this idea interesting. In general, it seems quite slow paced; not much progression is actually made in each episode (with the exception of the ending, which was very much rushed, and the main reason I couldn’t give this a higher score, despite my overall enjoyment). However, I personally enjoyed that aspect of the story. Something about just taking it slowly, and trying to slowly flesh out the characters and their web of feelings and interactions appealed to me. Overall, I felt the show was really good, with the exception of the ending, which was rushed (this would have benefited from having 6 more episodes, which is what many of us that watched it as it aired expected it to be in the first place)So, in the end, should you watch this anime?If a slow paced drama sounds appealing, then yes!If it doesn't, then there isn't anything special about this show, so this may be something to just skip. world, I just appreciated that the characters tended to actually move and change expressions as they talk.

I really had my hopes in this one as my new favorite anime.At first, we have some very good written characters that can develop a lot while times pass.Rikuo was forced to grow up even that he wasn\'t prepared, he had a complex and secret personality, he used to run away from pain and never face up the things. And that is for me an interesting main character to a slice of life, romance, drama like this one.Then we have Haru who is mature but childish at the same time, similar to Rikuo, she runs away but also hates doing it...""maybe I don\'t have any other places to run"" (at least in Spanish she said something like that).Shinako was different in some ways, she tried to move and become a teacher as she wanted, but had a big problem in the past that stopped her from a lot of things like loving someone.Finally, Rou who was... more childish with his emotions and actions but it\'s ok, I don\'t blame him.. he has some troubles in the past and even present.They were very careful in their presentation, wanting to share a good impression so they used to hide a lot of their problems and not being honest with themselves either but trying to do it as a process would be in real life (maybe with some therapy)Not the best explanation of the character but it\'s something.They had a lot of potentials that in my opinion wasn\'t really exploded, I´m assuming that it´s because it\'s 12 episodes long but even then...The whole plot its that four or three characters and how they grow up, entering the adult life and loving if you can´t show us that properly maybe you should wait a bit longer.Please don´t get me wrong, I actually liked it, but my expectations were so high up that I expected something a lot better because this anime could give us that.I don´t wanna spoil anything but THE END WAS SO GODDAMN FAST... That\'s it. thx for reading.Ps: I\'m gonna read the manga hoping to read a better ending and development; also for good fanservice ""maybe I don\'t have any other places to run"" (at least in Spanish she said something like that).Shinako was different in some ways, she tried to move and become a teacher as she wanted, but had a big problem in the past that stopped her from a lot of things like loving someone.Finally, Rou who was... more childish with his emotions and actions but it\'s ok, I don\'t blame him.. he has some troubles in the past and even present.They were very careful in their presentation, wanting to share a good impression so they used to hide a lot of their problems and not being honest with themselves either but trying to do it as a process would be in real life (maybe with some therapy)Not the best explanation of the character but it\'s something.They had a lot of potentials that in my opinion wasn\'t really exploded, I´m assuming that it´s because it\'s 12 episodes long but even then...The whole plot its that four or three characters and how they grow up, entering the adult life and loving if you can´t show us that properly maybe you should wait a bit longer.Please don´t get me wrong, I actually liked it, but my expectations were so high up that I expected something a lot better because this anime could give us that.I don´t wanna spoil anything but THE END WAS SO GODDAMN FAST...

Besides the pretty picture, this story is nothing good. I forgot the closing song, but I didn't listen to it anyway. Yesterday wo utatte is an anime that wannabe wants to be a slice of life with a drama wannabe. I want the characters to evolve from the past. But you know what? This story has been broken...since the idea. This fails like everything else, so I advise, don't waste your time on it. Let's go see another story.Characteryesterday wo utatte is an anime with a rather puzzling character development. Sometimes the characters get stuck in the past, but in later scenes they will act as if they were thinking, and later scenes came into the drama. We hardly saw any serious character development. I've been watching this story from start to finish, and I still don't know when the characters develop. Like in one episode, I cried, and in another I said I can think of it ?? Which additional characters will be used discarded? Is something outside that is not necessary for the matter at all, even younger Extra characters that come in one episode to show us how the characters are and what actions they are doing now, in a nutshell, besides unnecessary. There was a quick cut of those additional characters, that is, the characters' past stories, it was necessary that the characters had their backs. But it is not necessary to tell like this It can be added in series. Don't see And the character of yesterday wo utatte is silly enough. It's something that is really frustrating. For example, Rikuo Uozumi, who can be called his character, is literally trash. Or characters like Shinako Morinome and Rou Hayakawa, who are both Saisaian and veiled at the same time. On the side, Haru Nonaka, this character is very strange, strange and stupid.SoundYesterday wo utatte is good in music. Is that it performed quite well in the first closing song I honestly say that I quite like and listen to it many times and OST. Probably not because of me. I didn't notice much, fool. If it had, I think it wouldn't have been used in a very important area. Oh, anyway. This would not have been used for tone control, OST, this was not going to be put on more, and the soundtrack of the movie was very confusing for me. Where sometimes it has put in the mood that does not fit the situation at all. And doesn't seem to make me reach the character's mood at all It is something that is not at all exciting with anything like this. Honestly, quite sleepy (most likely because of the script of the story)Image and animation worksTo be honest, I think the pictures of yesterday wo utatte are fairly beautiful art. And the movements are quite smooth, especially the characters. But the background of this story is very empty. Is that it is extremely free The design is totally ugly. Is one room in this story, I haven't seen anything. Not that it is very free What you just do is bring things and display them. There is something, but honestly. The model houses still look more detailed. Oh yes, I forgot to mention the buildings. Is that it is very free We could hardly see anything. Like they hate each other That is, it does not have, is not really For example Those rooms or studios that rarely see anything inside, the story just shows a few rooms in that location. But in fact, it would not be just living together. And people we hardly see people walking by, or even shops where it's closed or barely there.Elements within the storyOK, before entering this topic What I will say on this topic, if you read and analyze carefully. You know it should be in the character topic and the character topic. It should be the topic of the element. But I am too lazy to fix. And if asked, why not change the topic easily Well, I used the words for that topic already, if I wanted to fix it, I would be lazy.A character like Rikuo Uozumi is a very stupid and trashy character, why? Because he knows that Haru Nonaka likes him, but he still thinks of staying close to Haru Nonaka by this tribute. That Rikuo Uozumi is a good person, but it looks like It seems to be to make Haru Nonaka a role model. I won't have much to do with this one. But because of this, I tried to say that Rikuo Uozumi's side was a good person, so it was controversial, because if Rikuo Uozumi was really good He won't talk to Haru Nonaka because he knows it will only hurt his opponent. And a character like Haru Nonaka that is very much like Extreme stoker Because she watched Rikuo Uozumi's script to wait for him at home. It also disrupts personal time Forcing it to gradually do that. There is also hatred towards Shinako Morinome, who holds Rikuo Uozumi's heart, and Shinako Morinome's side, where the story tries to convey that the character is trapped in the past. Is really wanting to ask that throughout From high school to the great danger She never thought about it ?? And finally, the side of Rou Hayakawa who is the most famous character is like, in summary, what kind of love he has for Shinako Morinome is, and Shinako Morinome is the same. What kind of thing she has for Rou Hayakawa? Where will the characters like Yuzuhara, Fukuda, Sayama, Kinoshita, Minato That is something that is not even necessary Where is the subject of audition and self-discovery I do not know why to wear it as well. Like crows? Do you like taking pictures? Do you like teaching children? Do you like to draw pictures? Why not put them on? It gave this story a scattered idea. since the idea.

It gave this story a scattered idea."", 'I\'ve really enjoyed watching this chronicle of the lives of four your people trying to move on with young adulthood in the Tokyo metropolis. The story at times may appear slow-going and a little buried in routine, but this is meant to capture the reality of how their existence is felt by the protagonists. One of the interesting developments is that although these four main characters, involved in a love quadrangle, are not all at the same age and stage of their professional and personal life, they all seem to perceive their situation and daily routine as quite similar.The exploration of personal feelings, contradictions, struggles...between different desires and aspirations, choices to make is both delicate and searching. The characters appear warts and all, and this makes for some quite realistic storytelling.Rikuo is a recent college graduate in his mid twenties who at first doesn\'t seem to figure out what to do with his life. Of all the characters he is perhaps the most indecisive and the story sees him, slowly but none too surely, begin to overcome this detrimental side of his personality.Riuko is in love with a former college classmate of his, Shinako, who has become a high school teacher and unlike him, appears to be set on a fine career path. However, Shinako remains rather aloof from Ruiko and other suitors because she is still grieving over the loss of her first love, who died young.Rikuo is also the target of the affections of a rather forward and eccentric younger girl, Haru, 18, who had dropped out from school, has a bit of a troubled home life coming from a recomposed family, and has decided to live on her own with her pet crow, Kansuke. Haru used to be a pupil in Shinako\'s school and she is brave enough to challenge Shinako into a competition to win over Rikuo.Shinako\'s doubts of whether to settle with Rikuo are also fueled because she has stayed close to her former boyfriend\'s family, and is very fond of his younger brother, Ro, who is studying art and wants to be considered by Shinako as a grown up man rather than the little boy she used to mother a bit. Ro has yet to get into college and faces the challenge of loving Shinako, an older woman whom he knows better than anyone else to be still devoted to his deceased brother.Although the story centers on these four characters trying to figure out with whom they will end up (and this remains in doubt until the very last episode) there are several nicely drawn supporting characters who make appearances with more or less lasting consequences for the four protagonists. They too appear a bit in drift but swiftly make decisions to move on seriously with their lives, and they can point out to the four main characters that they, too, can ultimately make it.I was particularly fond of the treatment of Shinako and Haru as characters. The older young woman is shown as not necessarily wiser, though perhaps more delicately concerned with preserving the feelings of either Rikuo and Ro. Her great kindness and her struggle to honestly figure whether she may be mistaking deep friendship for love make her quite likable when one might get annoyed with her for indecisiveness. There is also a nice parallel drawn between the form that her grieving for her former boyfriend takes and that of Ro for his big brother. Haru is funny and bubbly, determined and intrepid though perhaps in need of a little maturing, to become as considerate of others and prudent as Shinako is. At times her energy appears to give her much more personality and presence in the story than any of the other characters (particular high marks to the end theme sequence during about half the episodes that features Haru as the character of a video arcade game struggling to pass obstacles to secure Rikuo as a ""treasure"" before Shinako comes along!)This isn\'t an ""action"" story in any way, but focuses on psychological and personal development, so I\'d only recommend it to people who like these themes. It also deals quite heavily with the way the past, either in the form of reminiscences or fantasies, can impact on later lives. Each character must learn to deal with their past, either free themselves of its too great embrace, or else manage to use it as a force for experience and future progress. It\'s also not typical shojo either because there are some grim realities (poor employment prospects, limited perspectives, untimely illness and death) that weigh on the story and its characters. The ending is pretty open and could leave the perspective of further episodes and development of the stories. At the conclusion, the characters have finally made some choices and progress, but will they keep going, that remains to be seen. between different desires and aspirations, choices to make is both delicate and searching.

It\'s also not typical shojo either because there are some grim realities (poor employment prospects, limited perspectives, untimely illness and death) that weigh on the story and its characters. The ending is pretty open and could leave the perspective of further episodes and development of the stories. At the conclusion, the characters have finally made some choices and progress, but will they keep going, that remains to be seen.', 'Story: 9Art: 9Sound: 5Charecters: 10Enjoyment: 8Overall: 7Doga Kobo is back at it again with ANOTHER moe anime and it\'s... wait... what? It appears this anime isn\'t moe at all. This is a darker themed reflection on adulthood and growing up. For all that are reading this I want to make sure that you know that this review is coming from a highschooler. That\'s what I am at the moment. I have no experience living on my own, paying my taxes or really falling in love. So I want that to be kept in mind as my point of view will probably be much different then...someone in college or already in the work force.This anime focuses on 4 people. Rikuo Uozumi, Haru Nonaka, Shinako Morinome and Ruo Hayakawa. Over the series these charecters are experencing and experimenting with love and adulting. (except for Ruo who is in highschool most of the series). Sometimes certain scenes will leave me in awe with how well executed and how well these charecters personalities clash with one another. It\'s truly amazing to me how well a studio like Doga Kobo could do something like this. This is no Umaru-chan. These charecters are so deeply personalized and individualistic it would seem almost impossible for me to describe them! You really have to watch it to get it. Doga Koba did an AMAZING job with this aspect. It really had potential to be a 100% 10/10 overall for me. But I\'ll get into that later.The music. Not the biggest fan. I\'m not going to let it affect my overall score becuase I feel like in a show like this it would be irrelevent. It\'s not drop dead horrible but it didn\'t really catch my attention.Except for one very special ED.The third ED in this show just GOT ME! I don\'t know why but I love how they show all the charecters and all the different ""love combonations"" at the beginning. To then cut to each of the charecters in doing things in their ""natural habitat"" you could say. It then resolves under one backround, unifying all the charecters, together.Almost every episode of this anime felt like a full length movie. But that\'s a huge almost. The pacing was perfect in this anime! Slow and steady wins the race. Until the last couple episodes. Everything went so fast it was almost sickening. And I understand that they had to work under a 12 episode handicapp but I feel as though it would\'ve been a much better option to have two 12 episode seasons or an 18 episode season (LIKE WAY MAL HAD PUT IT... thanks a lot...). But I really think if they had the opportunity to take their time this could\'ve been something truly amazing. And this is coming from someone who liked the outcome. You can\'t build a rollercoaster that has a slow build up to a huge drop but halfway through stop building the other half of the ride up and only finish the drop. Granted, the riders will still get to the bottom, but as you could probably imagine it\'s not going to be AS fun.Overall I would recommend this to others. And I heard the manga is so much better. So I\'ll probably be checking that out.Thank you for reading. someone in college or already in the work force.This anime focuses on 4 people.

The story is good, i would give 8/10 for it, as for the art 6,5/10 (the art is actually good  also, but just not my taste, so you can call it my personal preferences)One thing that annoy me is,  I'm not really fan of how this anime ending. I'm not gonna spoil much, but after all 11 episode, by watching the 12th and watched it end makes me kinda disappointed.I will be rooting for different end for sure =)It's a MUST WATCH anime for drama fan.well so that's it, i hope...its helpfull its helpfull"", 'One thing I greatly value in a story is whether or not the actions of the characters are believable given the circumstances. ""Sing Yesterday For Me"" does that, for the most part.Really what I\'m getting at is that the story feels like it was constructed from very real human emotions, a project developed from passion and not a product from greed. There are the occasional exceptions, scenes that clashed with that view and decisions of which characters to focus on that I did not agree with, which prevent me from giving it a higher score. But overall I was really pleased with the final...product.For the positives: There\'s a refreshing lack of cliche. It\'s still there, but it felt like there was markedly less of it here than in the average show. My favorite episode introduced a new character that immediately had me making assumptions of how things were going to progress. I was delighted with the direction they actually took. The thoughts and feelings of most of the characters feel real, like something a person would actually do (even if it\'s excruciatingly frustrating), and that\'s something I value. The music was really beautiful and relaxing, the art style is pretty, and the EDs blew me away. I also enjoyed the themes of moving on from the past.For the negatives: I absolutely hated one particular character, and mildly disliked another. Mileage will vary depending on you feel about the cast, and, in my case, how forgiving you are. The few cliches that are there might be a bother for some, but I was okay with them in the end. It is relatively melodramatic, which I understand is a turn off for some, though oddly it was a plus for me. Perhaps the greatest sin the show commits is who it decides to focus time on. Unfortunately for me, there was a lot of focus on the character I mildly disliked.

The first half of the show is bursting with flare as we are introduced to the characters and each of their own personal struggles. These dilemmas that the characters face range from having no career goals, getting over someone, or feeling not good enough. These issues to me are really easy to relate to as one way or another we have experienced them whether it be during our teenage years, or in the case of the characters and myself, early adulthood.However, sadly, the second part of the show becomes increasingly unbearable for me....My annoyance with the latter half of the season is the overemphasis on the romantic relationship between the lead characters. This reduced the ""real life"" drama that I came to love about sing yesterday, and instead was replaced by cliche romantic advice, such as loving means hurting someone. Yes, these types of romantic troupe dialogue have their place, but it just cannot replace the gritty life drama that made me love the series in the first place.The actions of the characters, although reflective of their personalities, were also excruciatingly painful as it seemed that they were not showing their age. It was cringy to watch the awkwardness and lack of chemistry between the two adults Shinako and Rikuo that for whatever reason were still trying to make their ""relationship"" work. Speaking of Shinako, this character has also got to be one of the most annoying characters I have ever encountered. The amount of indecisiveness that this character has is probably enough to dethrone at least a Yonko (Emperor of the Sea) or two in the world of One Piece.The only saving grace that made me persevere and actually finish the series was Haru. This girl, despite being younger than our two adult leads, was more mature than the two of them combined. My only comment, particularly in the second half of the season was there was not enough of Haru. To me, she undoubtedly deserved the spotlight better than Shinako.Overall, sing yesterday for me started off strong but fizzled towards the end as the change of tone from life lessons to romantic advice became too drastic and unappealing. I would only recommend watching or finishing this if you really love Haru, cause if you don\'t, I doubt you\'ll persevere, or maybe you will because you like Shinako better for whatever reason.

This anime started off an 8 and ended a 4 (if I'm being nice), so I'll give it a 6 overall.The beginning few episodes highlighted the feeling of living aimlessly, which I felt was executed well and arguably relatable. However, the way they cut off so much of the manga just didn't allow you to see how the characters developed over time; rather, it seemed more like the little tidbit of...romantic drama they introduced in the anime was somehow enough for all the characters to mature by years (even if you do argue that it was enough for Rikuo and Shinako to realize their flaws, the anime left no room for the development of characters like Haru and Rou).Also, (and this goes for both the anime and the manga), as for the story itself, it just left Haru in the dust until the very end, when Rikuo realized things didn't go as he had ideally planned and just turned to Haru. This was pretty jarring and even inconsiderate.Story aside, the artstyle is warm and picturesque, with textured linework that makes some shots look almost like paintings. Also, the 1st ED is just phenomenal, even if the anime was disappointing.

The characters do not have adolescent problems, they are adults. The soundtrack is very scarce with the intention that here, the important thing is the dialogues and the characters.

lot of potential, but that not only rushed to finish it, but also they could not take advantage of its history, transforming it into something that seemed like child\'s play.In the first chapters my expectations for this anime were quite high, the animation seemed simply beautiful to me and the character design was quite well achieved, even the story at first interested you and encouraged you to get into it: the message you I was trying to convey ""how difficult it is to choose your path in life and the difficulty that...appears in life when you become one, all this at first seemed fresh and well accomplished, even the love trio between the protagonists had a good start.The problem came when we met the real badly worked personalities of the protagonists from the middle of the story and how this ""Love Triangle"" seemed more like child\'s play than an attempt to recreate an adult relationship.Shinako was the biggest problem, her story is just stupid, and they never knew how to make sense of either her actions or her selfishness.Because ?, Simple, the character is horribly misspelled and it is not difficult to realize, not even in its end did they try to reflect on the character in the mistakes he made, leaving that weight entirely to uozumi, who was not a good character either as such, but consider his behavior more logical, apart from the fact that at the end he himself assumed his error, giving a complete update to the character himself, and one for good, this did not happen at any time with Shinako.Rou\'s involvement in the story was also a complete mistake, a boy who falls in love with an older person and lives blinded by ignorance and other victims affected by Shinako\'s own badly working selfishness, but still that doesn\'t take away from the fact how pathetic the character was, and how unnecessary trying to get him into the drama of the ""Love Triangle"".Then we had Haru, who was undoubtedly the attraction of the anime, a completely wasted character who instead of welcoming him to the leading role, decided that it was the ""Fanservice"" of the play.Both it was as if during the 12 chapters they did not even deign to give a development to the character, their function was simply to be ""the second option of the protagonist"" and here that implies the hasty end of the work.Anyway, I could talk more but I think that watching the anime yourself can realize these failures, but of course this is just my opinion.A wasted anime that could have been my best times, in a failed attempt to represent an adult relationship, accompanied by the

day.Story-9So far,I liked it. It's a nice chill anime, that lots of people can relate to. As with typical slice of life animes the show has a slow pace to it so if you're not a fan of this genre then you won't enjoy this anime. I haven't read the manga btw. I just like this animes approach. You have relatable people in somewhat relatable situations. The quotes that they sometimes give just hits you.Art-8When I first saw this anime I thought the art style was meh, now that...i've watched it for a while I have grown to like the art style. It has this old yet refreshing kind of vibe to it that just meshes well with the story, the animation is also pretty good. It's a nice break from the overly colorful worlds that we have this season.Sound-7It's weird how this show still does not have an OP even though it's almost halfway finished. But nevertheless I think not having an OP makes it unique. It's usage of sounds really capture the essence of the entire show.

Enjoy!From the very first moment I watch this anime, I only have one thing in my mind. It is realistic. The struggle of the main character, the feeling of not having any clear life goals, just wandering through life aimlessly. Well, it may or may not resonate with you, it's just a matter of your personal life.The problem each character faces throughout the story is unique. Work, school, and love problems, many things...keep pressuring each character, but they continue to move forward, with a drama in-between (enjoyable drama though, for me).As for the more visual side of the anime, I find it fine to watch. The animation is fluid, character's movement is smooth, but the art is decent, nothing more. It still suits the anime theme very well.Another part of the anime is sound aspect. I don't really have anything to say about the sound, but I just want to point out a few things, such as follows:1. This anime has no opening theme.2. The ending theme is really good, all three of them.3. Any other sound aspect such as background music is easy on ear and add a nice feel to each scene it is accompanied with.Overall, I enjoy this anime. This anime really emphasize on the character's everyday life, the character's struggle, and how they sort out their life. keep pressuring each character, but they continue to move forward, with a drama in-between (enjoyable drama though, for me).As for the more visual side of the anime, I find it fine to watch.

With the static, full, and detailed art style and presentation combined with one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a while it is a must watch for anyone who enjoys slice of life.The topics covered were very pertinent and depicted reality without much fluff and had a very earthy tone to it all.

If it had been for 18 episodes than it would have been definitely in my favorite list. Still the story is very good though a little disappointment. But people who love Romantic Drama anime will definitely enjoy this....Characters are great, Art is also surprisingly interesting and I have no complaints with sound. Overall I gave it 10/10 but it's more like 9.5 or something like that. But since I am kind of little biased so I gave it 10. If you love Romantic Drama you will enjoy it. {Sorry for bad english that is if there is any grammatical mistake}.

I still cant help but feel a bit disappointed tho, this anime had such a promising premise but it fails to deliver.The title hints at the idea that the characters all have something dragging them down in the past, yet all we really see is Shinako and her deceased crush. Even then, the backstory is left really surface level. Haru\'s backstory was basically summarized in three comic frames. We get no real elaboration on her unhealthy fascination with Uozomi, nor do we find out why...she changed from a shy schoolgirl to a delinquent (all we know is she got ""tired of people""). Any sort of non-romantic character development from Haru halted at episode 3, all of the screen time in the following episodes were solely on her being obsessed with Uozomi. The younger brother is the second person given a more elaborate backstory, mainly because its linked to Shinako, but even if it evokes sympathy he is so unlikeable that no one cares. Worse off is that Shinako is even hinted to get together with him at the end. How? After 11 episodes of Shinaki claiming he\'s nothing more than family? What sort of bullshit? The main character, Uozomi, has one of the least inspiring developments. Sure, he goes from working part-time in a convenience store to working full time in a studio. But why was he working in 7-11 in the first place? ""He was scared."" What a crappy reason, sure if the anime managed to express that fear of commitment or lack of faith in his work in an intriguing way, that simplistic reason could still manage to be thought-provoking. But the studio fails to deliver. Why did he change and start taking photography again? ""It\'ll help you be more confident when dealing with relationships."" Holy fuck was it easy to convince him. I guess that was really what was most disappointing to me, with a premise that hinted at resolving past traumas, the show did little to showcase that in-depth with all of the characters, and the underdeveloped romance seems to overtrump every life decision. How is it that Haru meets Uozomi once 5 years ago and is still in love with him? I fuckin\' love Haru, best girl for sure, but DAMN is there no better backstory?If i had to really critique this show, I could go on forever. But honestly it isn\'t as bad as i put it out to be, the director made certain mistakes that just didn\'t sit well with me, and maybe i was too caught up in my expectations.That said, seeing people rate the show 2\'s and 3\'s is pretty ridiculous. The show is disappointing for sure, but it doesn\'t take away the fact that it was engaging enough to binge all 12 episodes. I might have said that the studio doesn\'t really develop on character motives as much as I might have hoped, but at no point was I seriously questioning why people did what they did. Everything was believable and plot developments were gripping. Overall, a potential 9 that only achieved a 6. she changed from a shy schoolgirl to a delinquent (all we know is she got ""tired of people"").

The story is non-existent, just a bad unrealistic romantic story, full of dialogues who make each episode uninteresting to watch. The animation is decent, nothing more. The Main Character is such a bitch, hated him especially in the last 2 eps. I hate every single character apart from Haru, she single-handedly made this show a 6 instead of a 5/10, but both Shinako and Rou are shit characters. The whole show was quite boring, and the ending was unrealistic. It's a 5.5/10 for me, as I said, it's a 6 because of Haru, amazing character, the only...good thing about the show... good thing about the show..."", 'Yesterday wo Utatte is delightfully deceptive, an anomaly that seems to break every preconception thrown at it. It doesn’t fit in with most of Doga Kobo’s catalogue (Himouto! Umaru-chan, Gabriel DropOut, New Game!), bearing little resemblance to the studio’s penchant for showing cute girls doing cute things. It has baffled countless viewers who are confused at the lack of romantic progression in its love rectangle, even though a closer look reveals that it never intended to play out like a bog-standard harem. It’s not a show where I could turn my brain off and let it run in the background, instead being a subject for...serious thought that had me pacing around my room as I tried to untangle its complex threads. So, just what is Yesterday and why do I believe it’s the most thoughtful show of the season? I hope you’ll indulge me as I try to unpack all this here. I tried to keep this piece as spoiler-free as possible, but feel free to skip ahead to my Tl;Dr below if you wish to go in completely blind.The first thing you would notice about Yesterday is that it’s simple on purpose. In appearance and presentation, the show never attempts to bombard your senses. Any modicum of fictitious “magic” begins and ends with the pet crow you see on the shoulder of our poster girl, Haru. From there the show commits fully to the ordinary. There is no escapism or distractions. With this deliberate approach Yesterday tells you to take in the world and its characters, who themselves are forced to reflect on their respective paths in life.Rikuo Uozumi is a college graduate who, unlike his peers, has no discernible career plans for himself and works a part-time job at a convenience store. Haru Nonaka is an elusive high school dropout who uses her charisma as a means of keeping herself from getting hurt in relationships; she is self-sufficient and lives away from her parents. Shinako Morinome is a teacher who just moved into the city in an attempt to start her life afresh. Rou Hayakawa is an aspiring artist who’s afraid that he’ll never live up to the expectations of his loved ones. Each of these four characters feel caged in the present, constantly held back by their past and uncertain of how to get on with their lives. Yesterday’s sole focus is that of exploring how these individuals grow over time as their paths intertwine. Their experiences and conflict feel human and make for an enriching watch.This character study is well-crafted, despite its simple appearance. Careful thought and passion throughout this project turn the seemingly mundane into something truly special. Director Yoshiyuki Fujiwara’s work here is subtle and purposeful. His use of focus and POV shots stand out and elevates climaxes, and the intimacy he captures is impressive. The background art is beautiful, accentuating the grounded nature of its story. Use of sound is restrained and complements the show. I’m really happy that the show seemingly never compromised on its production, even amidst the Covid outbreak. These supporting elements do contribute a lot to the experience, but personally they mean a lot less if the writing fails to deliver. Rest assured, Yesterday passes on that front with flying colors! A strong first half gets you thinking early on and introduces the roadmap for our cast – their situations, conflict and goals. Day-to-day interactions between our cast feel equally natural and charming, with golden lines of cutting dialogue about the human condition popping up and surprising me. I love how the show doesn’t shy from its depiction of adults and adolescents; the two main adults, Rikuo and Shinako, are framed as unsure of themselves as the youths, Haru and Rou. The adults’ decision-making is flawed just like the teens’, exemplifying how life is complicated no matter what age you’re at. Adding to this fascinating aspect is how much these characters are alike while being distinct individuals. I could spend ages drawing similarities between these four, yet I can’t say that any of them is a clone or lesser image of another. Those parallels allow me to ponder and view each character’s perspective more clearly. And boy, are these characters fun to crack open! (that came out wrong, I didn’t mean it in a gruesome way) The most interesting quality of it all is how much freedom the audience gets in arriving at their own conclusions about its cast. Yesterday is a Rorschach test of sorts, leaving it up to us to decide for ourselves which of our characters are headed on the right track in their journeys. To me this is essential to the success of the show and why it speaks to me so much. These complex individuals are brought to life in a genuine way that allows me to hold them up against my own worldview and ponder on the ideas they represent. I found it all to easy to fall into a rabbit hole every so often with Yesterday, lost in my thoughts as I examine what it is to live my life and accept change as a growing adult. And I doubt that I’m alone in my fascination for this world (or at least, that’s what I tell myself :s) I haven’t seen many shows with such engaging discussions on its characters, with the community presenting valid perspectives on their feelings for Rikuo, Haru, Shinako, and Rou. And with that, I think it’s time to finally address the elephant in the room…Look, if you believe that Yesterday is nowhere near as deep as my pretentious self has made it out to be, that’s totally fine. Time and time again I’ve seen people share some big grievances with this show, mainly around the fact that it’s just a boring soap opera with your typical tropes thrown out. The characters are tiresome, the romance never progresses, the plot is non-existent and god-awfully boooring! I’m not here to mock you or disprove these opinions, if anything I found myself agreeing with you at times! That being said, allow me to tackle why I feel that these perceived faults in Yesterday are not only intended, but also instrumental to its success. We’ll start things off with the most infuriating aspect: the romance. Typically with most stories of that genre, we as audience members have been conformed to shipping love interests based on their admirable qualities and waiting with bated breath to see who gets the girl/boy/non-binary/etc. Yesterday, on the other hand, chooses to portray a series of character studies whilst incorporating a love rectangle. Yesterday is a piece capturing the internal and interpersonal struggles one experiences on a daily basis, choosing to forgo stylized genre trappings of a more idyllic romance story. I view the characters’ respective romantic entanglements as representations of the journeys that they take (here’s my in-depth take in the spoiler-filled “Stray Ramblings”*.) Each individual is motivated by his/her peers to do better for themselves. The decisions they make in their relationships are directly in-line with how they choose to live out their lives. The love rectangle itself, while prominent throughout the show, isn’t the focus of the story; but rather a neutral ground for these friends to put into action what they’ve learnt. Viewing this show from this perspective does make me appreciate it a ton for what it does, although I can see how the lack of progression in the story bogs down the experience in places. Which brings me to the next topic I wanna touch on – the plot, or rather the lack thereof. At first glance, nothing of importance happens in this narrative. One may assume that Yesterday is underwritten, but a closer look does reveal that a lot of thought went into the makeup of the characters. The conflict in the show is internal and brings up familiar existential questions I have yet to really come to grasp IRL. Cathartic moments and understanding comes from watching these down-in-the-dumps, down-to earth individuals slowly work these ideas out for themselves. And sure, these characters might be kinda boring to watch at times, and even frustrating as all hell. But again, that’s the beauty of it! Me overanalyzing and mulling over how flawed these guys are has occasionally made my blood boil, but this short cour invoking such a reaction from me speaks to just how effective and intimate the whole experience is. Of course, I’ve also enjoyed cheering for these awkward idiots fumble and grow; there’s a strange comfort in knowing that these realistic individuals can move on from their pasts, and it instills me with a faint hope that I’ll experience this for myself soon down the line. In summary, disinterest in the story’s intent can be unavoidable for some, but I believe that the trade-off with more traditional story beats for character introspection is justified in its comprehensive writing and purposeful execution. To those who have dropped the show or came out of it dissatisfied, I hope that my input at least allows you to see Yesterday in a different light.I do have a couple of slight criticisms about the show, so let’s cover them real quick. Episodes can kind of blend together (ala-Endless Eight), with many scenes and setups that are virtually identical. For an animated show you’re kinda hoping that there would be greater variety in terms of how scenes are structured, but Yesterday episodes play out in a predictable fashion. (Random encounters on the street, Rikuo walking someone home, characters constantly backing away from certain decisions, etc.) Personally I don’t think it’s a mistake, but this repetitive nature of the show may play into your overall enjoyment of the show. Next, I feel the second half of Yesterday is more drawn-out than the first. Payoff is stretched pretty thin and minimal changes are made to the status quo. As such, the moments of introspection that I praised so highly for the first half might come a tad less frequently for you. One more thing, we have to talk about the weakest link in our main four, but it’s just a tiny nitpick really. Rou is mostly sidelined for a lot of Yesterday, and the screentime he does get seems less in service of his own development and more for that of Shinako. For me he’s the hardest to root for**, but here’s hoping he gets more of the spotlight further down in the narrative.Tl;Dr: Yesterday wo Utatte is an innately personal experience. Thoughtful, subtle and well-crafted production elevates this oddity into something truly special. Its characters and slow-burning narrative is all-too-good at making me feel a medley of emotions and thoughts. The depictions of Rikuo, Shinako, Haru and Rou may not be 100% true to life, but the beliefs and ideas they represent certainly are. Yesterday isn’t afraid to give up entertaining and familiar tropes in favor of showcasing what it’s like to grow and change as an individual.With something as intimate and atypical as Yesterday, I feel that it’s necessary to take emotional impact and personal subjective experience into account. And coming from a mildly-jaded adolescent who himself is going through big transitions in life, Yesterday and its cast spoke to me in a profound way. Sure, you might just call me out for being an impressionable child and suggest that I watch “Welcome to the NHK” – both points I fully agree with, BTW. But I have a great respect for this frustrating, heart-warming, cringy, thoughtful and beautiful mess of a show. And I’d be pretty sad for someone who hasn’t yet given Yesterday a chance to sing for you. 8/10~STRAY RAMBLINGS (SPOILERS):-\t*Way I see it, the characters’ respective romantic entanglements are representations of the journeys each character is taking. Rikuo asking Shinako out in the first episode is a sign of him jump-starting his life and having ambitions for himself. Shinako’s initial rejection and eventual acceptance of Rikuo in her life marks the change in how she chooses to move forward with her life; she first goes about cutting all ties to her past (and her hair), and then understands that not everything in her history is holding her back. Haru’s stubborn resolve with Rikuo is her way of deciding to open up to other people, even though she runs the risk of getting hurt. Rou’s desire to prove himself to Shinako is centered around the goal of breaking free from the comparisons between him and his brother, thereby becoming his own man.-\t**Maybe Rou is my least favorite character because I project my self-hatred onto him. I would totally be the kind of head-strong idiot who sees too little of himself because of the expectations he perceives other people have for him. I respect and root for Haru because she knows she can and probably will live without Rikuo, only going the lengths that she does because she finds enjoyment in the act itself. Whereas Rou comes off as stupid for not seeing his self-worth and stubbornly forcing his improbable ideals for life in an unhealthy way while seeing problems that literally don’t exist and - OH MY GOD I’m falling down that rabbit hole again…-\tI love Episode 3 to bits. Call me a sucker for a good ‘ol underdog story! Getting a look into Haru’s life was a fresh change of pace from the Rikuo/Shinako angst. Love the motifs and themes in this episode. In this episode you knew for certain that Haru was gonna lose her self-declared war, and yet the real victory was watching her say “F*ck it” and charge forward anyway. One of my Top 5 eps of the season [unless Great Pretender counts as a Spring show? Ah well, that’s a discussion for another time ;) ]-\tJeez, all this talk about the main characters, and I almost forgot to shout out these gems! The supporting cast are a real treat. Kinoshita and Fukuda are such bros. Morita-sensei was a real godsend for calling Shinako out on her BS in Episode 8; I laughed a bunch as she single-handedly yoinked Shinako out of running in the circles she’s been caught in since she moved to Tokyo. We deserve a lot more Chika Yuzuhara though, it’s a shame she left as quickly as she burst into the scene.-\tI don’t think I ever got over how the VA for Legosi talks to a girl named Haru two seasons in a row. Good thing the similarities with Beastars end there; Yesterday would be a very different show if Miss Nonaka took her clothes off in front of Rikuo OwO-\tTaking place before the age of smartphones and social media, the setting adds to that feeling of isolation some of us know all too well. Scenes with Shinako staring out of a window as she’s washing the dishes or Haru lying in bed at ungodly hours hit me in a different way then what I’ve gotten used to. Thank goodness for the Internet!-\tBit of a wholesome tale I dug up while prepping this review. Back in 2015 when the manga completed its final chapter, freelance artist Ilya Kuvshinov made a video tribute for Yesterday out of hand-drawn stills and uploaded it to YouTube. The vid garnered plenty of praise, most notably from the author himself, Kei Toume! Just under 5 years later, Ilya had his artwork featured in the ED for Episode 9 of the anime! Go check out his video and some of his other artwork for characters like Haru and the like. Fantastic stuff!-\tBEST GIRL: We stan Haru. The bird has good taste.-\tWhoo, this mess was tough to put together. We finally made it to the end, thanks so much for stickin’ around! If you somehow like my verbose overanalysis (or have masochistic tendencies), feel free to check out the other stuff I’ve covered this season. ‘Till then, stay safe, stay woke, peace! serious thought that had me pacing around my room as I tried to untangle its complex threads.

We deserve a lot more Chika Yuzuhara though, it’s a shame she left as quickly as she burst into the scene.-\tI don’t think I ever got over how the VA for Legosi talks to a girl named Haru two seasons in a row. Good thing the similarities with Beastars end there; Yesterday would be a very different show if Miss Nonaka took her clothes off in front of Rikuo OwO-\tTaking place before the age of smartphones and social media, the setting adds to that feeling of isolation some of us know all too well. Scenes with Shinako staring out of a window as she’s washing the dishes or Haru lying in bed at ungodly hours hit me in a different way then what I’ve gotten used to. Thank goodness for the Internet!-\tBit of a wholesome tale I dug up while prepping this review. Back in 2015 when the manga completed its final chapter, freelance artist Ilya Kuvshinov made a video tribute for Yesterday out of hand-drawn stills and uploaded it to YouTube. The vid garnered plenty of praise, most notably from the author himself, Kei Toume! Just under 5 years later, Ilya had his artwork featured in the ED for Episode 9 of the anime! Go check out his video and some of his other artwork for characters like Haru and the like. Fantastic stuff!-\tBEST GIRL: We stan Haru. The bird has good taste.-\tWhoo, this mess was tough to put together. We finally made it to the end, thanks so much for stickin’ around! If you somehow like my verbose overanalysis (or have masochistic tendencies), feel free to check out the other stuff I’ve covered this season. ‘Till then, stay safe, stay woke, peace!', ""it's easy to go on and say some characters are bad or toxic, but i think this anime is one of the few i've seen that represents love so realistically.as people, we are complex. and when faced with love, we get even worse. we don't know what to do, we can't let go of the past and we can't decipher our own feelings. yesterday wo utatte is great representation of that. of how hard it is to become a mature person and how it becomes harder when love is in the mix.yes, shinako was immature and hurt people on the way. rikuo was the same....rou and haru were blinded by love. but we've been through that. i've been through that. and watching and anime that represents how terrible we can sometimes be when we haven't figured ourselves out helped me. rou and haru were blinded by love. but we've been through that. i've been through that. and watching and anime that represents how terrible we can sometimes be when we haven't figured ourselves out helped me."", 'I had so many conflicting emotions while watching this anime. I started off loving it because they featured a lot of my favorite seiyuu, and the animation was great, as well as the music. I love a slice of life that features adults! (Spoilers ahead).However, once I hit episode 7, my feelings toward the show changed. Funnily enough, it felt like I was being played. Why would they present Haru as the main love interest, if they were going to treat her that way? I kept asking myself, ""Am I being led on too?"" I think they spent too much time on the ""relationship"" between...Rikuo and Shinako. At one point I hated the couple for how they were treating their admirers, especially Haru.Also, I don\'t think the show did a good job of /showing/ their developing feelings toward their admirers. So when the ending came about, it was underdeveloped. It felt like they quickly wrapped everything up, and the viewer was supposed to accept it.It\'s wild how I went from loving the show, to absolutely hating the storyline, to feeling something akin to ""Well.. okay"". Regardless of that, I think the show was alright and I don\'t know, since I had such a strong reaction, perhaps that\'s good sign? Perhaps not. Rikuo and Shinako.

It is not overly dramatic, it has pauses and inconsistent character motivations. You know, like real life.This anime is pleasant to watch, has some inspiring moments and can entertain you. So go watch it and dont pay attention to dramatic keyboard crusaders who feel like Haru deserves them instead of that terrible protagonist who dares to...have his own feelings and aspirations :D have his own feelings and aspirations :D"", ""The show was building really nicely and it would have sat at a 9/10 for me. Unfortunately, i didn't realise that the show was only 12 episodes long and thus the final episode felt really disappointing the way it ended. Had the show been 18 episodes long like i first thought it was; the relationships between the characters could've been tied together in a neat bow. However, it sucks that it ended the way it did. For that reason, I've dropped the score to an 8 and perhaps an eight as i felt the last episode was the worst of the 12. I didn't feel...it fair to score the show any lower given how much i loved the first 11 episodes it fair to score the show any lower given how much i loved the first 11 episodes"", ""I found something endearing about this show at the very first episode. Not something I could put my finger on. I ended up realizing the level of work the show put into creating a depiction of relationships confined by people's innate inability to say what they think. For some this can be a struggle to bear through, but for the sake of creating believable and flawed human relationships, it was a bold but necessary decision.For me, a strength that shines through is the animation's ability to convey character emotions through small ques given to the audience through facial and body language. While the level of...animation quality itself is not anything to ride home about, it is acceptable and has its own uniqueness, which distinguishes it enough from its genre counterparts.The characters are generally well written, though this does not mean you will necessarily like all of them. Real people aren't always very likable. Each has their own back story and grounding for their own narrative decisions. Some of those stories are more empathetic than others though. These stories are meant to direct the viewer towards understanding why the show ends the way it does and why the characters end up where they do, without implicating exactly what decisions they will make.I suppose this is where I start to have issues with the narrative decisions of the show. Firstly, there seems to be some dragging of the feet, so to speak, in terms of important events happening throughout the run time. Often it feels like character interactions repeat themselves as some of them continue to wallow in their ways. This is kind of the point of the show, but I won't go into that as not to spoil anything. The ending also takes a bit of a leap in terms of audience expectation. Based on people's reception to the last episode it doesn't seem its just me who feels this way. The ending will still make many people happy I think, but it did in a way feel undeserved and kind of out of left field because of some character's decisions.Overall, I feel that the themes of losing direction in life and being tied down by the past will resonate with a lot of viewers. The down to earth portrayal of characters also adds to their believability. Some weird narrative and pacing choices do bring the show down for me though.

Nothing really happens in the 12 episodes of run time and the ending feels rushed and nonsensical.Art: So... There is no denying this looks very...good. Not astonishing, but very solid, liked it a lot.Sound: Eh. It was good I guess, the endings are all bangers and the OST is fine I guess, gets the job done even though it's a little forgettable.Characters: Loveable and relatable, which is nice, but... The development is almost none and they kinda feel like one-trick ponies (in the sense they only have one character trait). I enjoyed them but I am aware they aren't great.Enjoyement: I liked this show, I was ready to get really into it, I was waiting for things to get in motion and enjoy an amazing story... And then it ended, just like that. I won't say it's bad because I liked it, but it was disappointing. good. Not astonishing, but very solid, liked it a lot.Sound: Eh.

For that weird girl ? Sure, but hey that\'s an easy one right ? That alone doesn\'t deserve a 9 in my books.May we dig a bit deeper then ?As for the story, well it\'s a story about love, sentiments, shared or not or yet unkown.I probably was more touched by the story than many, because I personally...fell in love for someone who never saw me that way, and ofc it was one of those ""fake"" friendship for around 5 long years, wher I was a friend for a girl I was in love with. One who told me about her love stories, her hartbreaks etc... ofc it was painful for me, so I very much can identify myself and understand the feelings of some of the protagonists. You can call me pathethic, but in my real life it was as pathethic as what you may discover in the story here. So yeah, many could see that as ""unreal"" but it may well be more real and happening more often than you think of.Sometimes love fall on you without any warning, and sometimes it can also grow on you, needing more time to recognise what you may like in someone else that may not have been a possible match. And as time passes, you may slowly realize that that person grew on you quietly, and maybe that\'s the one, but you were too dumb to realize it, as your heart, mind, eyes, were occupied by that other one way love.So to me, overall the story is fine. Great ? Deserving that 9 ? Hell nope 7 it is for me.So wait, I give that anime a 9 ? but neither the story nor the character deserve that note ?Well an anime is a FULL experience. If I just want a story, I read a book. If I want art I watch any kind of art (pictures, drawing, sculpture, etc) I listen to music, etc.What many seems to forget in an anime, is that it\'s a whole experience, just like a movie. You can enjoy a good story in a movie, while it\'s poorly done artistically, but on the opposite, an average story can be a nice movie due to the art involved into making that movie, like the acting, how it\'s filmed, etc. But ofc if you are here only for the story, then the movie will be bad.And that\'s then where this anime gets better than many of the seinen – romance – slice of life anime I saw.I don\'t know how many realised that the manga started in the late 90\'s, And as thus many objetcs in that anime then are obsolete nowadays. It could have been very easy to get over it, and ""rejuvenate"" it, but nope... the animation studio stuck with that era and to the original manga, and it works, as the story itself is intemporal. So as an older person who actually grew up with all those mechanic phones and their twisted wires, walkman and tapes, VHR, I ofc recognise all of them in the animation, and I like the fact it gives this ""older"" feeling, while it has truely no impact on the story.And that\'s truely where this anime shines. Not in the character animation, as I would say it\'s almost sub par, but damn... the backgrounds of this anime are just astonishing. There are so many details all over the place, each minutes of the 12 episodes are filled with details. So detailed that sometimes I felt like it was a picture, reworked to get the drawing feeling. The shadows are greatly done, all the old phones, faxes, etc.That is a simple 10 in my books. I rewinded so many times just to take time to appreciate what this anime was giving me as far as details goes. And it\'s very rare that I do that.I watch most of my anime with a headset. And damn here again the level of details of all the sounds is great. I honnestly can\'t recall having seen an anime season with that level of work on sounds. A movie ? maybe, but not a season. 10 again here.Then the ending of the first 6 episodes is simply so poetic that I watched every one of them, while in most anime I simply skip 1:30 every single episodes just to get (if there is) the teaser for the next episode. I was very disapointed of the last 6 episodes ending, but oh well... let it go.Oh wait, this anime has NO opening, hey that\'s also a 10 in my book, as usually openings are just full alert spoilers showing you all the characters you may discover only later in the story. Again that\'s 1:30 less filler in that anime as well, and 1:30 I don\'t have to skip.I liked the original voice acting. No annoying voices, nothing overdone, so here again, it\'s a good 9.Finally, the anime has a true ending. Like it or not, but at least it\'s not ending in a way you feel that there is something missing.I enjoyed every minute of this anime, and if you are looking for a bit more in an anime than ""just"" a story to kill time, and you are truely involved into actually appreciating the artwork, then it\'s probably one you should give a chance, despite it\'s trashed score.Now if you are looking for a revolutionary story, or a time killer, you may simply pass your way.

I think it\'s worth pointing that out, because it\'s largely because of that initial impression that I think I ended up liking it as much as I did.The purpose of this review is to hopefully help YOU, reader, enjoy this show. I certainly have no intention of...discrediting the opinions/experiences of anyone who was dissatisfied by it... BUUUUT... I DO think that expectations can go a long way insofar as how much you like this story, and I wonder if the people who are (at the time of writing this) pretty upset over the ending might just have had some unhelpful expectations. So let me tell you what I think this story ISN\'T about.This is not a love story, this is not about romance, this is not about ""coming of age"" (well I mean maybe it is, but kind of most stories can be, so let\'s just distance ourselves from that idea for now), this is not about finding characters likable or rooting for your favorite ship or whatever. Well ok, it CAN be. Maybe it\'s still fun if you view that that way, but I\'m not the one telling you so. But to paraphrase some less-than-positive takes I\'ve seen floating around, certain characters in this show don\'t really feel ""developed."" If you are watching this anime in hopes that a really sweet romance will blossom and everything will feel ""right"" with a happily-ever-after, you\'ll probably feel like this story is pointless, or that it doesn\'t earn what it tries to have, and particularly in the case of the ending, you might even say it was rushed. And let me tell you - I am NOT the person to talk to about whether something was rushed or not, because apparently I have an extraordinarily high tolerance for fast pacing, so maybe my opinion on that won\'t be helpful to anyone but me (I mean, the pacing felt fine to me tho).Anyway, to anyone who finishes this show with feelings like that, I hear you. You\'re probably right, honestly. But somehow I made it through without feeling that way at all, so surely there must be some valid alternative approach?Let me describe to you what this show was to me, and hopefully I can convey why it\'s pretty good (uh oh, is this where the ""review"" starts? Wasn\'t this supposed to be brief? What\'s wrong with me? Are you really ok with reading this kind of a review?). And as one final preface (ugh), I\'ll just say that I have no idea what the original manga is like, and maybe what I think of this story would be really untrue for that, in which case, perhaps this simply isn\'t a good adaptation? But this anime, man... This is a show about a handful of characters, each with a handful of insecurities and social hangups, and they all pretty consistently just kind of flounder about awkwardly in an attempt to achieve 3 broad goals. First goal: Understand each other. Second goal: Understand themselves. Third goal: Relationship???Listen, if you\'re gonna claim that this is a ""romance"" anime, I hope you realize that everyone in this story pretty explicitly DOES NOT understand what romance is, they don\'t know what it really means to be in a relationship, they all second-guess themselves and are constantly casting all of their feelings into doubt. Relatable. But this isn\'t really a cute ""aww they don\'t even KNOW that they\'re madly in love"" kind of confusion. This is like, actual confusion. Like dumb confusion. These people are kind of dumb, and it\'s a little frustrating, and I didn\'t really like any of them for a while because no one seems to know what they\'re doing. BUT THEREIN LIES THE HEART OF THIS DANG STORY, READER.A great feeling was when I realized that I had started to like everyone involved, they\'re all so *bad* at like, stuff, but it\'s always a good time to see someone brute force their way into the coveted ""being a slightly more mature person"" zone, and that\'s what I think just about everyone does in this story. Time spent watching this anime feels quiet and introspective. Dialogue is written in this weird way where characters can muster the conviction to simply call out each others\' insecurities with pinpoint accuracy like it\'s NOTHING. They do this CASUALLY in that way that you can only really sigh and nod in response. There is virtually no music, most of the time, so you\'re just left with these stinging acknowledgments that whatever given character has to come to terms with, in the quiet of your own mind. There\'s kind of a melancholic vibe to this sorta thing and I do think I dig it. And all this time in quiet reflection was time well-spent for the characters, because they follow it up with little life decisions that reveal genuine effort to self-improve.The magic of this show is kind of exemplified by the ending, so RIGHT NOW is when spoilers might start. Personally, I wouldn\'t shy away though - at least for this show, if knowing the ""outcome"" is what will spoil your experience, I\'d hazard an assumption that your view of what this show is about is already deviating too far from my own for me to expect you to have that good of a time with it anyway (maybe that\'s assuming too much though).SPOILERSPOILERSPOILERSPOILERSPOILERSPOILERSPOILERIt\'s exhilarating to use the apparently-controversial final episode to illustrate what I liked about this show, honestly. Not that I have much to say about it either way (this is a ""brief"" review, after all), but there\'s a sweetness to the nectar that is ""revealing a dissenting opinion."" But let\'s sum it up: The relationship that, for the duration of just about the entire story, has been built up: ends. After a short talk, everyone involved realizes that they didn\'t really know what they were doing, they were just kinda confused and wrong about what they thought they wanted or were comfortable with in the first place. The relationship that, for the duration of just about the entire story, has been ignored and downplayed: FULL SPEED AHEAD LET\'S GOOOOOOO the end! Listen. I just tried to explain that in a way that feels accurate to the pacing, and also accurate to how VERY FRUSTRATING I imagine it is to the people who disliked it. But I think it\'s pretty appropriate, really!What is key to appreciating the ending, in my opinion, is acknowledging that there isn\'t really a guaranteed happy-ever-after. Everyone involved admits to themselves and everyone else that they STILL don\'t know what the best thing to do is, and they have no idea if even this is what they really want. Very, very true to form. But they DID learn that that one relationship? The one that was built up over the show, particularly in the previous few episodes? That relationship really isn\'t what anyone wanted. Sure, it could have been ok, but come on. This entire story has been about all of these people not knowing what they should do, but taking action anyway. They specifically all approach their problems with an attitude of ""you can\'t know if you don\'t try,"" and hey, they tried, and they\'re gonna keep trying. You can SEE the progress made since the beginning, everyone is steadily improving. No one in this story is truly satisfied with a half-assed solution that only technically works, that\'s why their struggles will never end. That relationship ending the way it did was the product of everything this show has built up, I\'d like to think. Everyone has been confused, everyone has been doubtful, everyone wants *something* but they can\'t really grasp it, no one wants to settle for less than this intangible desire they have, so they think in silence, they talk directly and frankly, and they make mistakes until something finally sticks. Finally, after something stuck, they are treated to a moment of genuine clarity: this ain\'t it. No doubt about it. Let\'s try something else!OK SPOILERS ARE DONE YOU CAN COME BACK NOW IF YOU LEFT THANKS I MISSED YOUTo me, this is not a story about finding love, as you may expect from a romance. To me, it\'s more of a story of like... Becoming the type of person who CAN find love. Which is neat! And whether I\'m right about that or just talking out my butt, I was able to really enjoy this show as I thought of it in this way. Maybe you can too!TO SUMMARIZE:Awkward, introspective show about some confused people, watch them as they become slightly less confused over time! Character design is likable, characters grew on me in a weird way, music is(n\'t), voice acting is pleasant, honestly I\'m surprised I was into this but honestly the more I mull it over, the more I think I like the dang thing. 7/10 from me, and it\'d be kinda funny if I rewatched it someday and gave it like a 9/10 but I guess we\'ll have to see. OR MAYBE IT SUCKS IDK BYE discrediting the opinions/experiences of anyone who was dissatisfied by it... BUUUUT... I DO think that expectations can go a long way insofar as how much you like this story, and I wonder if the people who are (at the time of writing this) pretty upset over the ending might just have had some unhelpful expectations. So let me tell you what I think this story ISN\'T about.This is not a love story, this is not about romance, this is not about ""coming of age"" (well I mean maybe it is, but kind of most stories can be, so let\'s just distance ourselves from that idea for now), this is not about finding characters likable or rooting for your favorite ship or whatever. Well ok, it CAN be. Maybe it\'s still fun if you view that that way, but I\'m not the one telling you so. But to paraphrase some less-than-positive takes I\'ve seen floating around, certain characters in this show don\'t really feel ""developed."" If you are watching this anime in hopes that a really sweet romance will blossom and everything will feel ""right"" with a happily-ever-after, you\'ll probably feel like this story is pointless, or that it doesn\'t earn what it tries to have, and particularly in the case of the ending, you might even say it was rushed. And let me tell you - I am NOT the person to talk to about whether something was rushed or not, because apparently I have an extraordinarily high tolerance for fast pacing, so maybe my opinion on that won\'t be helpful to anyone but me (I mean, the pacing felt fine to me tho).Anyway, to anyone who finishes this show with feelings like that, I hear you. You\'re probably right, honestly. But somehow I made it through without feeling that way at all, so surely there must be some valid alternative approach?Let me describe to you what this show was to me, and hopefully I can convey why it\'s pretty good (uh oh, is this where the ""review"" starts? Wasn\'t this supposed to be brief? What\'s wrong with me? Are you really ok with reading this kind of a review?). And as one final preface (ugh), I\'ll just say that I have no idea what the original manga is like, and maybe what I think of this story would be really untrue for that, in which case, perhaps this simply isn\'t a good adaptation? But this anime, man... This is a show about a handful of characters, each with a handful of insecurities and social hangups, and they all pretty consistently just kind of flounder about awkwardly in an attempt to achieve 3 broad goals. First goal: Understand each other. Second goal: Understand themselves. Third goal: Relationship???Listen, if you\'re gonna claim that this is a ""romance"" anime, I hope you realize that everyone in this story pretty explicitly DOES NOT understand what romance is, they don\'t know what it really means to be in a relationship, they all second-guess themselves and are constantly casting all of their feelings into doubt.

However, from the 9 episodes that have been aired, i still can't give score more than 7 to this anime. The anime is good enough but it still can't be said very good or even great, because i think that this anime is lacking certain point.Well, we may already knew that the art of this anime is above average which can be said as a good point of this anime. Then, we have this pretty rare theme in drama/romance anime which is another good point of...this anime. Yes, the adult/mature characters and vibes. Usually or to be precise, most of the drama/romance revolves around highschool students and doesn't give any mature/adult vibes. What else? Well, no opening song and just ending song which actually increase the vibes of this anime.Despite those good points, i just can't sit back and watch this anime with full enjoyment the way i watch the other 8-rated anime because of that certain point. I know that this anime can be considered as slow pace one, but that's not the reason why. That certain point is probably the trademark of this anime. I just can't find a trademark which can make me or probably others viewers to really looking forward for the next eps. The mature vibes? Not strong enough. The link among the characters? Nope, not strong enough. The no op just ed thing? Out of question, because it doesn't relate much with the main story.As i have stated before, this anime has many good points and probably more than what i have stated.

We have to remember that its not another highschool love story. Mc realised that his feelings to Shinako were nothing more than puppy love from his university years. Why he suddenly returned to Haru? He called himself a selfish bastard that craves the attention of a cute girl who is nice to him. Dont blame the story. Blame the character who you dont like.Tbh as I am almost the same age as mc I would call this outcome as pretty realistic. ', 'What do you usually look for when you pick up a romance anime? Intimacy? Introspection? Decadence? Catharsis? While I\'m sure there are many more romances out there, chances are high that you probably haven\'t run into anime that chooses to do ""realistic"" romance. This is not surprising, as the medium ends up wanting to satisfy younger audiences with dramatic stories and relatable yet inspiring characters. There are few who would like to be amazed at the incompetence of Ikari Shinji or the likes. We would rather prefer reading an Adachi Mitsuru work or watching Hachimitsu to Clover.The charm of ""Yesterday wo Uttate"" could be encapsulated...in saying that it is an anime that chooses to strongly ground itself in real-life characters with the purpose of exploring adolescent ennui, the resulting incompetence all in the context of understanding male-female relationships.With a stellar voice-acting cast and some remarkable animators who were willing to produce an anime by giving it the right amount of time, introspection and love, ""Yesterday wo Uttate"" is an excellent example of a good production.Striving for realistic aesthetics in anime is a tough thing to do. ""Yesterday wo Uttate"" does this by developing unique mannerisms for each character and pairing it up with seiyuu\'s, hand-picked for emulating just the right mood and emotions. What are we talking about here? Imagine something as simple as one\'s countenance or speaking habits - the way in which we nod gently while listening to someone speak, or how we might hunch over a little a stroke our hair while waiting for someone. All this and so much more! The human world is full of an intricate system of movements. ""Yesterday wo Uttate"" gives a special attention to these movements - animates them with the right frames and pacing.This gives the anime a very slick visual feeling - neatly drawn water-colour like backgrounds on which some extremely realistic characters and movement is juxtaposed. Yesterday is not alone in this respect - Tsuki ga Kirei, Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai, Just Because, Koe no Katachi come to mind.Pretty much every thing in this show has been given a appropriate time and thought - the ending songs by yourness and Sayuri - lyrics and accompanying animation, voice actors, photography, panelling and even the camera angles - from close-ups to shaky pov\'s to smooth pans and some excellent body shots. (Ah Shinako\'s finger movements!!!)Kobayashi Chikahiro\'s work in Beastars and Yesterday have been exceptional. The way in which he incorporates natural pauses and deliberation into his accent is an excellent fit for your typical self introspecting seinen MC who finds themselves brooding over stuff. And I can\'t begin to describe why HanaKana was THE choice for Shinako! The insecurities of an otherwise alluring late twenties female who is confused about her interpersonal relationships couldn\'t have possible received a better voice than hers!!Having said all that, let\'s come back to what this anime is about - confusion, procrastination and the illusion of love. What do I want to do in my life? Why should I work hard? How do I make a satisfactory living for myself? Why do I want to fall in love? Why do I like someone? Why does someone like me?Yesterday takes the above mass of questions (and many others) and implements the above techniques to explore emotions that all of us have but are in fact scared to admit to. As a consequence, we look at characters who aren\'t very inspiring, but they are very real and beautiful. Yesterday does not mean to preach HOW YOU SHOULD LIVE, it\'s about just another set of humans struggling to make sense of life. in saying that it is an anime that chooses to strongly ground itself in real-life characters with the purpose of exploring adolescent ennui, the resulting incompetence all in the context of understanding male-female relationships.With a stellar voice-acting cast and some remarkable animators who were willing to produce an anime by giving it the right amount of time, introspection and love, ""Yesterday wo Uttate"" is an excellent example of a good production.Striving for realistic aesthetics in anime is a tough thing to do.

The cinematic art and the amazing introduction to the characters, partnered with a great delivery of background at the beginning was all it took for me to love the anime. Sadly, all of it slowly degraded to the point where I want a refund for my initial optimism. My first impressions on the characters were overturned by their unexpectedly uninteresting decisions. My expectations for surprising yet delightful events served only to disappoint. So here's a tip to lessen your frustration, expect not romance, but a sort of recovery-story from the past. This show isn't to satisfy me, it's meant to show...me. I learned that the hard way. Could've been a 10 in my book if it had a better story and was purely romance. The art is a 10 for me though, it was the saving grace that kept me from being completely and utterly dissatisfied. me. I learned that the hard way.

However, this particular series fell drastically short of expectations.The narrative's pace was agonizingly sluggish, and the vacillation among potential relationships became tiresome. Frankly, it felt like adolescent turmoil trapped within adult frames.The art presented nothing extraordinary, merely serviceable.Sound echoed the same sentiment—nothing to write home about....Characterization lacked the depth and development crucial for a serious romantic anime, rendering it less believable in its attempt at realism.My personal enjoyment? A conundrum, truly. I struggled through each episode, hoping for a miraculous turnaround that never arrived.Overall, some might unearth joy within this series, and I commend the effort invested.

Yet, regretfully, it stands as an anime I wish I hadn't ventured into."", ""Review of Yesterday wo UtatteEpisode Two(Attention to detail with in frames and colors)In the opening part of episode Two. brings us Shinako getting her hair done cutting it short, which is most of the time symbolized a woman moving on, I mean who wouldn't after that awkward rejection back in episode one, and looked upon the vibrant cherry blossoms as if she is looking back reminiscing a memory. Then the stylist told her “You looked great with a short hair.”  Shinako did not reply and just looks away as if saying she’s just doing what she needs to do.an aspect ratio is...formed to create a similar screen captured picture, or a camera lens giving us a picture of a school while the cherry blossom is wilting , filtered by a dark purple tone symbolizing loneliness (which is vital in this episode because they used it allot), this is foreshadowing of this episode could lead to a throw back of Shinako and Rikou with their school memories.We later on found Shinako in a cold empty park sitting on a swing while the cherry blossoms are wilting symbolizing that right now she does not have a piece of mind,maybe she needs a piece of mind that is why she wanted to to have some time for her self.In her memory the color of the setting is very important everything right now is set to be cold and lonely but in her memory its warm and inviting and the cherry blossom are blown by the wind as if its dancing, which is a memory that she treasures and wants to remember every time there are cherry blossomsthen our main guy Mr. Pessimist(Rikuo) shows up, these scene right here makes this episode very effective and creative at the same time.And as Mr Pessimist talk to her the wilting of the cherry blossoms stops falling, making this a moment for her to calm. And this shot right here is spectacular, the Light pole and the Swing bars creates a barrier between Shinako and Rikuo representing the wall that they mutually build after that awkward rejection, in episode one.Also the light pole symbolize as Rikuo a comfort light for that lonely night, the Isolation with in framing makes the scene more impact full.This is a comparison when Shinako is alone in the park and when Rikuo arrives, Rikuo never entered Shinako’s personal space even though they are friends, this bold visual story telling makes this anime have that Cinematic feel.As this scene goes on about them reminiscing their School days, then Rikou mentioned that “You are a moving forward person.”then Point of view is now on Rikuo staring at Shinako in a tilted way interpreting a sense of doubt, because she answered back with a phrase “I’m not that forward thinking.”As there little conversation comes to and end Rikuo ask to walk her back home hoping that this barrier, this separation between them could disappear but No.Again this frame is well made the big tree right in the middle isolates both of them but now this is created by Shinako, by addressing the elephant in the room and as we can see Shinako has the larger space, claiming that she has more power upon the situation.Then she tells him that, She wants to go back on what they once were close friends, while she’s telling her that the camera slowly pan’s away her moving to Rikuo near the dark purple cherry blossoms which symbolize loneliness (I think we already established that by now), as that melodrama is about to put an end, Haru suddenly comes in and breaks the ice, asked them what are they doing this late at night. Again a closure for Shinako, but Rikuo did not have a say to it.Then we cut on a Scene where Rikuo asks Kinoshta’ Do you think Men and women can be friends? A very opinionated question, but this question leads to Rikuo’s mindset over what he think is more important, the person he likes or the friendship they have, he think of it as a childish emotion, other people think of it as gamble, a risk if they truly like or loved that person they are willing to give up that friendship that they built, maybe this will be further develop as the series goes by. At the same time Hayakawa enters the store demanding answers from Rikuo, of what is his relatioship with Shinako.This brings us to the reveal of Shinako’s back story narrated by Hayakawa a fallen loved one, and generates a sentimental value of cherry trees because every time cherry blossom season comes around, it serves a reminder for Shinako to reminisce her beloved, maybe this is the reason why Shinako cuts her hair back at the opening part, not because of the awkward rejection in episode one, but maybe it’s about time to move on, to stop loving whats not here anymore to be fair among the living, and give a chance to be happy in life.This episode pretty much tells us about the pain of Shinako, and she trying to move on about it and a really bad timing for a love confession on Rikuo’s side this is only episode 2 and there are still characters that are needed to be fleshed out. I’m really looking forward for episode 3 maybe a Haru or Rikuo back story to tell us more about their characters. Or a designated episode for Rikuo and Shinoka back when there College students to know the bond they have back then.I just want to point out that the visual story telling in this episode was really spot on the symbolism of the Cherry blossom is carefully manipulated by filtering its colors to amplify the tone and mood of the situation and the foreshadowing is also impressive to use cherry trees through all out the episode and making it not boring but intriguing. formed to create a similar screen captured picture, or a camera lens giving us a picture of a school while the cherry blossom is wilting , filtered by a dark purple tone symbolizing loneliness (which is vital in this episode because they used it allot), this is foreshadowing of this episode could lead to a throw back of Shinako and Rikou with their school memories.We later on found Shinako in a cold empty park sitting on a swing while the cherry blossoms are wilting symbolizing that right now she does not have a piece of mind,maybe she needs a piece of mind that is why she wanted to to have some time for her self.In her memory the color of the setting is very important everything right now is set to be cold and lonely but in her memory its warm and inviting and the cherry blossom are blown by the wind as if its dancing, which is a memory that she treasures and wants to remember every time there are cherry blossomsthen our main guy Mr. Pessimist(Rikuo) shows up, these scene right here makes this episode very effective and creative at the same time.And as Mr Pessimist talk to her the wilting of the cherry blossoms stops falling, making this a moment for her to calm. And this shot right here is spectacular, the Light pole and the Swing bars creates a barrier between Shinako and Rikuo representing the wall that they mutually build after that awkward rejection, in episode one.Also the light pole symbolize as Rikuo a comfort light for that lonely night, the Isolation with in framing makes the scene more impact full.This is a comparison when Shinako is alone in the park and when Rikuo arrives, Rikuo never entered Shinako’s personal space even though they are friends, this bold visual story telling makes this anime have that Cinematic feel.As this scene goes on about them reminiscing their School days, then Rikou mentioned that “You are a moving forward person.”then Point of view is now on Rikuo staring at Shinako in a tilted way interpreting a sense of doubt, because she answered back with a phrase “I’m not that forward thinking.”As there little conversation comes to and end Rikuo ask to walk her back home hoping that this barrier, this separation between them could disappear but No.Again this frame is well made the big tree right in the middle isolates both of them but now this is created by Shinako, by addressing the elephant in the room and as we can see Shinako has the larger space, claiming that she has more power upon the situation.Then she tells him that, She wants to go back on what they once were close friends, while she’s telling her that the camera slowly pan’s away her moving to Rikuo near the dark purple cherry blossoms which symbolize loneliness (I think we already established that by now), as that melodrama is about to put an end, Haru suddenly comes in and breaks the ice, asked them what are they doing this late at night. Again a closure for Shinako, but Rikuo did not have a say to it.Then we cut on a Scene where Rikuo asks Kinoshta’ Do you think Men and women can be friends? A very opinionated question, but this question leads to Rikuo’s mindset over what he think is more important, the person he likes or the friendship they have, he think of it as a childish emotion, other people think of it as gamble, a risk if they truly like or loved that person they are willing to give up that friendship that they built, maybe this will be further develop as the series goes by. At the same time Hayakawa enters the store demanding answers from Rikuo, of what is his relatioship with Shinako.This brings us to the reveal of Shinako’s back story narrated by Hayakawa a fallen loved one, and generates a sentimental value of cherry trees because every time cherry blossom season comes around, it serves a reminder for Shinako to reminisce her beloved, maybe this is the reason why Shinako cuts her hair back at the opening part, not because of the awkward rejection in episode one, but maybe it’s about time to move on, to stop loving whats not here anymore to be fair among the living, and give a chance to be happy in life.This episode pretty much tells us about the pain of Shinako, and she trying to move on about it and a really bad timing for a love confession on Rikuo’s side this is only episode 2 and there are still characters that are needed to be fleshed out. I’m really looking forward for episode 3 maybe a Haru or Rikuo back story to tell us more about their characters. Or a designated episode for Rikuo and Shinoka back when there College students to know the bond they have back then.I just want to point out that the visual story telling in this episode was really spot on the symbolism of the Cherry blossom is carefully manipulated by filtering its colors to amplify the tone and mood of the situation and the foreshadowing is also impressive to use cherry trees through all out the episode and making it not boring but intriguing."", 'I hate with all my heart the protagonist and the one he likes. By God they are linings they do not deserve to be happy ever in their fucking life. How anime bothers you. The only good character is haru is a fucking sweetheart. The only thing you want to see is his happiness for god everything else does not matter. You empathize a lot with her and how she does everything possible in their relationship. I suppose that the vast majority are projected onto her in an unrequited love and that she will never reciprocate. To see it you need patience but anime is...good since it seeks to generate that frustration by seeing the characters but it seriously hurts you.En español:Odio con todo mi corazón al protagonista y la que le gusta. Por dios son unos forros no se merecen ser feliz nunca en la puta vida. Como te molesta el anime. El único buen personaje es haru es un puto amor de persona. Lo único que quieres ver es su felicidad por dios todo lo demás no importa. Empatizas mucho con ella y como hace todo lo posible en su relación. Supongo que la gran mayoría se proyecta en ella en un amor no correspondió y que nunca te va a corresponder.

I found the moment cute, liked the art and was like ''hey, i can give it a shot, i can appreciate it even more knowing the context and the characters''. The problem is that the opposite happened: having watched all 12 episodes, it made me dislike the scene, even though the couple i wanted to see together happened.In truth, Sing ''Yesterday'' For Me is an anime about the romance between Rikuo and Shinako, something that...makes the ending couple Rikuo-Haru shallow and totally out of the blue. We get twelve episodes of Rikuo not giving into Haru's advances and making it clear that he doesn't reciprocrate her feelings while trying to get closer to his actual crush, Shinako. After managing to do that, the two of them break-up when they were finally starting to grow-up, for no apparent reason. At the ending scene, we see that Rikuo says that the way he is approaching Haru looks like he is ''just going for her because Shinako dumped him'', but it doesn't ''just looks like it'' it is literally it. His feelings for Haru appeared out of nowhere except for a single scene of jealousy in the middle of the anime. Literally what was supposed to be a cute scene about Rikuo finally being the one to reach out to her instead of the opposite, with sparkles on top, became just plain fake romance.As the story is merely the characters developing relationships between them, i wouldn't judge it differently from the characters themselves... the problem is, the characters doens't develop any relationship at all. Rikuo and Haru don't leave the ground they stood in the first episode until the very last minute of the finale, to the point it, like i said before, looks like Rikuo liking her back seems plain false.Rikuo's relationship with Shinako gives the illusion of development, but in the end they behaved literally the same way they did even before the story started, in their days of college, with Shinako using him so she doens't get lonely and Rikuo being the blank slate that he is and just nervously going troughAnd the relationship between Rou and Shinako shouldn't even be of note. They don't change at any moment, Rou continues to be infatuated by her from beginning to end, and she continues to let the cycle of ''QUO-fight-separation-reconciliation-QUO'' go on, without any of the two moving forward from anythingI really expected to like the characters after seeing episode 1 and, until Rikuo stood her up, i actually liked Haru. After she simply forgives him (even tho he literally did nothing) i simply stopped caring about her, that was the only character in the show that i liked. None of them are really captivating nor anything that would make them likeable. Rikuo is a boring blank slate that only does what he likes to get a girl, suddenly knowing what he wants in the last episode. Shinako is literally the same character from her backstory to the point where we left her, meaning she is a broken girl who ends up hurting others because of her indecisiveness. Haru goes from interesting to a side character that Rikuo just puts up to within a few episodes, whom the viewer (me included) just get sad for because her love is doomed to be platonic (until would you look at that, it's not). Last and least, the only thing that i manage to say about Rou is that i like the musics that play when he is on the sceneFor some reason, I enjoyed the show until the 2-3 last episodes. I didn't cared about the side characters that were just appearing and disappearing or being thrown away without any deeper connection with the main cast and I didn't found awful how the ''love triangle'' happened, mainly because i knew that Haru was going to end up with Rikuo. The problem arose when, three episodes left to end the anime, Rikuo still didn't see Haru as more than a nuisance. I started to say to myself ''maybe we will get some backstory for Haru, maybe we will get an arc of her and Rikuo getting closer to one another, maybe...''. Of course, none of that happened, and at that point was where i thought to myself that the anime was actually... bad. And it pretty much is.

But why? It\'s the idea that none of them have had previous relationships even though they\'re in their adult ages.We\'re pulled into a setting where our protagonist Rikuo is at a crossroad(it is quite the theme for this anime) between his long time crush from college and this eccentric girl that has just barged into his life. There\'s a lot of back and forth and the introduction of new characters which seamlessly blend into the plot. However, the series never...felt like watching episodes, it was more like a movie that actually concluded. The theme of heartbreak, learning, realisation and discovery of one\'s thoughts of love and companionship was the main driving point behind this and even at the end when our protagonist did finally decide, it hinted at the idea of not wanting to be lonely because it\'s dull and unexcitable.Many reviews seem to paint this piece quite negatively and some reasoning makes sense, but I feel like that\'s the point of it; it\'s a slow piece that doesn\'t leave things out and adds a hint of drama(which I also disliked but was needed to make it more interesting(?)).We\'ve all seen the cliched story and I really do believe this was something new and extraordinary. I don\'t want to be the type of person to say ""If you\'re not A you won\'t enjoy B"", but I really do think that this is one of those.And finally, I am always a sucker for the production quality and this was pure joy to watch. The art and sound was superb, but what would have been nicer was to have a greater variety of tunes.And with that, as I always believe, give it a try and if it isn\'t for you then drop it.

But that\'s the only positive thing I have to say. The story itself was driven by pure stupidity half the time which is a shame. I understand that the story needs *something* because of the slice of life nature, but this is not it.The art was okay at best, fits this bad anime if you ask me.---...SPOLER ---The ending is just soooooo bad. I\'m fine with the idea of Shinako and Rikuo are not meant to be, their ""relationship"" was honestly awkward so I didn\'t mind them backing off and agreeing to be friends. But tell me why it was necessary to then pair them with their obsessive counterparts in the last minutes of the show? Even the show made it clear that Rikuo is only taking Haru out of selfishness and just wants to feel loved, and Shinako only takes Rou because she sees his dead older brother in him. Both are horrible relationships and there\'s no ""punishment"" for that, the show just ends right there. There should\'ve been 1-2 more episodes showing how these 2 relationships inevitably fall apart so at least there\'s a takeaway, but that doesn\'t happen.

I cried at the end of the first episode, hardly believing that the formative manga that helped me through my early 20's had finally reached the big screen.I wish it hadn't.It's just a... blasphemous mockery of everything that made the manga what it is.

Without spoiling too much, I think this would feel exhausting to someone who hasn\'t experienced loss. I don\'t blame anyone for it BUT if you have experienced loss of love, try this out. Or try it again with a new perspective.That said, some tropes are a little frustrating. Like, yes, there is definitely a ""manic pixie dream girl"" who isn\'t even necessary for the story they want to tell but she\'s not a...bad character, she also just doesn\'t feel human, unlike the two big main characters. She feels like she was written to be a fantasy. And then there\'s the younger brother who is aggressively trying to pry his way into an older woman\'s heart. Also feels very unreal, which is out of place with the journeys we are focusing on. But they also aren\'t the focus of the story.On one side, we have the story of a young adult who feels directionless and doesn\'t know how to push forward because he doesn\'t believe he can go anywhere. My favorite part of his story is that the support he gets to change comes from his own decisions with a little push from a friend we see in a couple episodes. His life isn\'t changed by some heroic woman and he\'s not a pity project for a girlfriend. He works hard and finds a passion and, along the way, he juggles some emotions.The other side is the story of someone who has never processed her grief. She apparently has very few friends or family members she can share her pain with and she comes from a culture that is still struggling to embrace counseling as normal. I can only imagine how long I would have been weighed down by the same feelings of loss as day 1 of his death if I hadn\'t had a network of support and years of therapy. She is doing surprisingly amazing for trudging through her life only afraid to branch out because it feels like severing him from her life. She is afraid to lose the family she has made through him, which also means losing the only tie she has left to those memories. We see her try to take steps but this sweet baby girl isn\'t ready to move forward because we only see her become ready to process her grief. I thought it was a beautiful choice to let her grieve and process instead of deciding she had to be ""queen love interest"" and make it work. She wasn\'t ready and now we know that she\'s going to do her best to come to terms with what happened as well as her emotions. Beautiful.I thought this show made incredibly bold choices that, yes, would feel frustrating but they are so much more honest to the characters and end up feeling more like what people need in their current state, rather than what we wish they could have.

If it had even a few more it would have been really good. I haven\'t read it but I\'m assuming the manga it was adapted from executed the story much better since the author could have paced certain events in a more structured manner.First off I want to acknowledge the other reviews stating that this is about adults who are complaining about things they shouldn\'t be. I have to disagree on that one. Subjective and objective view points can drastically change the way we perceive things. From the outside looking...in it may seem like the characters are making stupid decisions, but try to put yourself in their shoes. Then it doesn\'t seem so dumb the way they are acting. Emotions don\'t have logic or reason, they make you act certain ways that you wouldn\'t normally. I believe the mistakes the characters make, results in a more relatable anime, since life isn\'t linear and curveballs are thrown at us all the time. Thoughts linger, and before we know it we change our minds all the time.The animation is delicate and in all honesty, the more neutral color tones add to the feeling of the anime. The character design (specifically for Haru) is really good in my opinion. Simple yet very recognizable.The one thing that I dislike about this anime is the pacing. Like I said, if it had only a few more episodes to showcase more characters, it would have been incredible.This really is a nice change of pace and gives similar vibes to re-life, (haven\'t seen it but I\'ve seen many people recommending Welcome to the NHK as a similar anime).Overall, definitely give it a few episodes and see if it catches your attention, I know it\'s not for everyone, but a 6.5 is really selling it short, at the least on MAL I think it should have a 7.2, but in my personal opinion it borders 7.8 - 8 in my book.(OH AND P.S.)There\'s no shot that ""Love Is Hard For Otaku"" should have a higher rating than this, that anime is stale af, this is eons better. in it may seem like the characters are making stupid decisions, but try to put yourself in their shoes.

I'll give a brief overview of characters with spoiling as little as possible. It's up to you whether you watch it or not.We all go through slumps in life. A period where we don't feel like doing anything worthwhile and just try to get by as little as possible. The protagonist Rikuo is also going through such a phase and people going through similar situations like him can easily relate to him.Then there's  Haru. Haru's a textbook example of  someone being hopelessly crushed over someone. Against...all odds she tries to be with her crush but at the end comes to terms with this feelings.We all had crushes before and you can relate to Haru as well.Another important character is Shinako. She's chained down by an incident of the past which renders her unable to move forward and get stuck in a stasis of sort. She is  the most selfish among the characters  which viewers will understand as they watch.the point is the show has such a diverse and relatable characters that you will surely be pleased to watch. The characters capture the essence of what being a young adult means in this day and age.I won't go through the other characters as the review is getting too long haha. Lastly i have to say it is a truly good slice of life which I can recommend to everyone. My only criticism is  the ending seems a bit rushed and too good to be true. Still the overall experience overshadows it. So what are you waiting for?

At the end they make it as if...we're supposed to care about Rou and Shinako, hoping for a resolution to both stories but I assure you that I didn't care about Rou as with most people because he is an arrogant little piece of garbage.

Looking through other reviews on other websites and rethink about the show, I felt a lot more appreciation for the show.The show is not a typical romcom. There were very little tropes, which surprised me quite a bit. Most of the time I felt like there was not any tension or moments that made me woah or hit me.Instead, the show is a character study where the two main characters...found out what they really wanted in their life. The theme is that life doesn't always go they way you want, but you still have to move on and look to the future, even if it is not always known.I think that in addition to my expectation, the fact that I didn't relate to the characters made me miss out on the character aspect, which was unfortunate for me.In the end, I did enjoy the show, but I should not have set and focus on my expectation too much. found out what they really wanted in their life.

Yeah watching 11 episodes of melodrama about Rikuo trying to persuade himself into confessing or pursuing Shinako is really ok or it might not be e.t.c. is incredibly frustrating but the grounding and relatability of a lot of the situations makes it somehow watchable. Every episode has these moments which freeze you and...makes you think. There are these single lines which let you realise perhaps things you yourself have done wrong, or haven't thought about in your own life, and not many shows can do that to you.Nonetheless, the finale where the characters finally gain the self-awareness trait is an immense payoff. Even though the characters (again, Haru is the sanity-saving exception here) don't necessarily deserve the endings they get, the show has a pleasing and warm conclusion.Overall, I would say watch the first couple of episodes, and if you can get behind watching 8 more episodes of frustrating melodrama, then absolutely it's worth the watch. makes you think.

If I could only have one word to describe this show\'s biggest strength, that would be it.It\'s a show aimed for an audience of adults, and it treats you as such. It understands its targeted demographic, and doesn\'t do almost any hand-holding. There\'s a lot to be found in the more nuanced details of the show, whether it be dialogue, body language, or even a detail as small as a hand trembling while pulling out a cigarette.If you\'re not receptive to it or just not paying attention, it can go unnoticed. I think this plays a large part in the frequency of complaints about...it being slow, boring, or characters making decisions the viewers don\'t understand the motivation behind.The characters often make terrible decisions, they do and say things that make you ask ""why are you being such an idiot?"", and it\'s all very intentionally written into the show.There is nothing in this world that can cause us to become more fickle, stubborn, and stupid than love can, and Sing Yesterday for Me does a wonderful job of reflecting that.This show tackles that concept head-on, but not unrealistically. They lie to each other, they lie to themselves, they get jealous, they make brash and impulsive decisions, they fail to keep their promises, and convince themselves that they (do, or don\'t) feel things that deep down they know is the opposite.If you were to sit in front of a TV and watch yourself doing all the stupid things you\'ve done because of love or infatuation, you\'d probably want to yell at the screen or even step through it just to slap some sense into yourself.Everyone, at some point in their lives, in one regard or another, has no idea where they\'re going, what they\'re doing, or what they really want. This is another of such topics that Yesterday wo Utatte doesn\'t shy away from.Some people are unsure of their choice of occupation or schooling, some are just pursuing the things that their peers told them they should, some are damaged and fearful yet can\'t help but take chances that might result in a repeated cycle, and some people endlessly search for the thing that will make them content, even when it\'s been right in front of them for far too long.We all face one or many of these things at some point in our lives, and so do the characters this show revolves around. Just like our protagonists throughout the show, over time we grow and adapt, occasionally going in the wrong directions first.This show gets a lot of hate for being ""too slow"", ""too frustrating"", or having characters that are ""too indecisive and whiny"". It\'s my belief that the majority of the people that feel this way have either forgotten, or (maybe fortunately) have yet to experience how slow and frustrating complicated relationships can be, and just how indecisive and whiny they can make you. Or, perhaps they were simply hoping for something more lighthearted and not as realistic.A show that so directly addresses such things is prone to be disliked by people who have yet to experience them, or don\'t want to ruminate on (or have yet to realize) such bleak parts of the human experience.These concepts aren\'t portrayed ""just because they happen"". A lot of the show focuses on the growth we can gain by coming to terms with such things, and the beauty that can come out of it in the long-run. A flower needs rain in order to bloom.Closing thoughts:Is it a perfect show? No, it has its weaknesses, but so do we. Sure, the plot isn\'t groundbreaking, but I wouldn\'t call it a painful cliche.There are a few parts of the manga\'s side stories that are drastically shortened or completely cut out, but that\'s to be expected from a 12 episode show.My own biggest gripe is with the timeline. The entirety of the show takes place roughly over the course of a year, and there are moments where the show will jump a couple days, weeks, or even months without explicitly saying so. That being said, it\'s usually pretty easy to catch these jumps from dialogue, clothing, or scenery.Personally, I think the show is visually beautiful. I\'m a huge fan of styles that give the feeling of hand-drawn, and I think it\'s executed quite well. There\'s a lot of attention to detail where other shows might leave said detail out.The soundtrack is very fitting, utilized when it should be but quiet when it needs to be, and it never feels like any track is overused. It\'s refreshing to hear individual theme tracks for each main character as well.There was barely any comedy, and I seriously preferred it that way.This was the first romance anime I\'ve watched, and the ""frustratingly"" realistic outlook of the show combined with the mature themes and settings have spoiled my expectations for almost every other that I\'ve attempted to enjoy.Who this show is for:If you\'re looking for a mature show that dives head-first into the reality of how stupid, varying, and difficult things such as love, infatuation, and jealousy can be, this is definitely a show for you.If you\'re looking for a lighthearted or upbeat romance, you\'re probably not going to enjoy it very much. it being slow, boring, or characters making decisions the viewers don\'t understand the motivation behind.The characters often make terrible decisions, they do and say things that make you ask ""why are you being such an idiot?"", and it\'s all very intentionally written into the show.There is nothing in this world that can cause us to become more fickle, stubborn, and stupid than love can, and Sing Yesterday for Me does a wonderful job of reflecting that.This show tackles that concept head-on, but not unrealistically.

The two main side characters are Haru, who is the most normal out of the bunch, and Rou who wants to replace his brother not knowing that it cant be done. Haru has a crush on Uozumi, Uozumi and Rou on Shinako, which makes it really hard for Haru and Rou to do anything, because even tho Shinako rejected Uozumi it doesn't end there, how it should. Basically they say they move on, wont be friends anymore, this-that and all kinds of bullshit you can't even think of. Noone is in a relationship with noone, but they still act like it, and when there is a third girl in the picture they both sulk that Uozumi didnt choose them, not knowing the truth.At the first few episodes you think that Shinako has it the worst, but she dug her own grave, by not accepting the death of Rou's brother, and still has feelings for him more than 10 years after, which is so sick you will want to stop watching the series altogether.Uozumi gets his crap together so that he can be with Shinako, not realizing that any romance related to Shinako is dead from the start, which even Shinako doesnt realize in time, making all of her relationships with men super awkward and bad, for example at first she doesn't even realize what Rou is after, and when Rou confesses, she doesn't really act in any way because he is like family to her, but doesn't realize not acting will make things far worse, Rou is beating a dead horse, and thinks he'll cross the finish line on it, he is so determined to be with her he does anything to get just a little closer, moving 2 times, transferring schools, trying all he can, while ignoring Shinako, thinking that he is the only good match for her.Big spoilers Ahead!!!In the end Shinako and Uozumi FINALLY wake up that they aren't the right match for each other, one of the reasons being Shinako, who is still underground, while Uozumi pretty much figured himself out.The last episode is the best episode in the series, probably the deepest, and most certainly the happiest. You finally get what you wanted, because Uozumi discovers she had feelings for Haru, and confesses, and that scene is truly the most wanted from the series.The Shinako-Rou line doesn't get such an obvious followup, because Rou is pretty mad at her that she didn't choose him, but Shinako shows up at his house-warming party have some pretty bad problems: Shinako is stuck in her childhood because of the guy he loved died, and Uozumi doesn't find motivation in life, has a part-time job and is doing nothing to improve that, while having a crush on Shinako since they were in college.

I eventually realized I was wrong. It traps you within the inner conflict of the main characters and in turn, gives an attachment towards their struggle. Honestly, I wished that it didn't loop around as it did. I generally like the slice of life genre but this just feels like an overcomplicated way of pushing growth. The main character...suddenly finds his passion after reconnecting with his old crush but is that really a good indicator of when to change? A lot of shows in this genre can even make the typical romance genre work but this show just tries so hard to throw a curveball it absolutely misses the mark for me. Uozumi Rikuo was such a good representation of the struggle of trying to find what you want to do in life but in his own indecisiveness just hurt different people by being too passive. They clearly kept reiterating how passive he is and at a point, you'd wish he'd chase after one person, but he doesn't he continues to half-ass the commitment. He is making the type of decisions that the main character from a high school slice of life anime would make. They honestly did Haru dirty throughout the show, she constantly tries to show her affection and depicts desperation towards love. She deserved better as a character who just charms the audience with an innate kindness and drive, sure it ended up in her favor but honestly speaking she didn't have to go through that much bullshit. This will generally feel like a hit or miss anime towards you.It will push your feelings around and give you a sense of wow they all grew together and the ending will just make the series as a whole better. I was honestly naive to think that since this felt worse than Subaru saying I love Emilia to Ren or when Hiro chose Zero Two over Ichigo. It felt like the anime that the girl who went the extra mile for the MC would finally find happiness and it would have been a great ending but no they took a convoluted route that just her and then suddenly changed their mind as if they just realized Haru was the best girl all along. It's more frustrating that she didn't even lash out or show any sort of resentment towards it.Thank you for reading my rant or review! suddenly finds his passion after reconnecting with his old crush but is that really a good indicator of when to change?

This will generally feel like a hit or miss anime towards you.It will push your feelings around and give you a sense of wow they all grew together and the ending will just make the series as a whole better. I was honestly naive to think that since this felt worse than Subaru saying I love Emilia to Ren or when Hiro chose Zero Two over Ichigo. It felt like the anime that the girl who went the extra mile for the MC would finally find happiness and it would have been a great ending but no they took a convoluted route that just her and then suddenly changed their mind as if they just realized Haru was the best girl all along. It's more frustrating that she didn't even lash out or show any sort of resentment towards it.Thank you for reading my rant or review!"", 'Someone who aren\'t a fan of Drama would have probably ignored Yesterday wo Utatte just by seing the cover, or won\'t even noticed it in the first place. I\'m one of those people who aren\'t fond of Romance genre, but I do give a chance if there\'s going to be POVs, people\'s perspective on things and interesting storylines. So, when I was looking for new animes to watch and read YWU\'s synopsis, I gave it a shot, assuming that it would focus more on Character\'s personal/emotional struggles than just being a typical love story. It got me with the first episode, made it 1 of...my weekly animes, was really invested in the first half... Then slowly felt dismayed every episode with the ending disappointing me badly.At first, the story focused on Uozumi, a college graduate with a talent on Photography who works part-time at a convinient store and is unable to find a job that suits him due to him lacking motivation and direction in life. Basically Mid-life crisis. He was invited to a Class reunion but was reluctant to come thinking that people might just feel bad for him. One of his classmates were Shinako, his College friend that he also secretly admires, who just came back half a year after they graduated. She\'s now a Highschool Teacher, and that made Uozumi feel more insecure thinking he\'s far from Shinako\'s league, even calling himself a ""failure"". But after a talk with his friend Kinoshita about him being ""Self-deprecating"", he realized that in both his career-life and feelings for Shinako, he was just afraid of trying in fear of what the results might be. So he decided to go for it and confess to Shinako, aaaaand... FRIENDZONED!!! He got dumped spectacularly, and it ended with a bang when he crashed his bike into a dumpster.But it\'s not all bad for Uozumi, there still a Haru happily waiting for him! An energetic, eccentric, matured teenage chick who\'s carrying a pet Crow. Yup, that\'s some leading lady right there!Coming out of nowhere, Haru barged in to Uozumi\'s life. Visiting the Convinient store everyday, seemingly ""obsess"" with him and openly showing his interest in Uozumi. Soon it\'s revealed that they have already met before, but only Haru remembers, and cherish, that moment.Now, I won\'t go through all of the things to avoid spoilers and make this look like a recap. But if you\'ve noticed, most of the things I wrote are about Uozumi. And I admit, that was mostly the reason why I got reeled by the show, Relatability.But that\'s not to say that I wasn\'t interested in the other aspects of the show, No.Seeing the pair of a relateble Uozumi and a unique and deep maturity-phase character Haru made me expect something a lot more different. I wasn\'t expecting a Slice of Life drama, nor any kind of romantic moments. I was expecting some kind of Mutual Understanding between an Adult whose lost in life and a Mature teenager who might be confusing ""Attention"" for"" Love"". It might be shallow, and honestly, I don\'t really know much about ""Love"". But I do greatly appreciate completely different minds with different ways of thinking being able to understand each other.It might be my fault that I expected such storytelling, but that was my impression of the first episode, and the few others that came after.Characters:Didn\'t really get much from ROU. SHINAKO is kind of all over the place. I also felt like her character suddenly changed from a chill, relaxed, boyish to a very ladylike, demure, modest. I\'m assuming that has to do with her being a teacher? But it was very noticeable to me.Her character seems to be passed on to a support character MORITA-sensei, who was good at pointing out obvious things that Shinako should be realizing on her own.Speaking of support characters, I really thought KINOSHITA would be playing a larger part than he did. He was a great voice of reason for Uozumi. I guess he was replaced by FUKUDA, who did just fine delivering hard cold truths to Uozumi\'s face.With KYOUKA, I didn\'t really notice her much. But I guess she\'s there to be Haru\'s Motivator.ART for Character design is great, but bacgrounds such as scenery and buildings are often flat and too straight lined.Didn\'t notice the BGMs that much, but EDs are good.OVERALL, It showed promised but failed to deliver. Not sure wether the current situation of our world affected the production of this anime, but the quality and subtance of the story really got lost somewhere. It started very promising, and ended being a typical, basic romance.Still worth the watching for those who doesn\'t have to split their time between different genres of anime, and are only looking for romance/drama.

I had to take a small rest at episode 5 because I felt that I would enjoy it more that way because it was getting extremely deep.I had this review in mind since then, it was going to go on about what being hurt means, how people heal and how, despite our best efforts people will still get hurt or we will get hurt.This anime takes one of my favorite ideas for storytelling. Don't tell the actual story that people would normally go for. Go for the story after those events and how people deal with...the aftermath of it.Dealing with loss, dealing with failure, dealing with family. No one handles it the same, and that's entirely right, no one should do so.By episode 10 I was completely convinced that this anime was a masterpiece. It was showing people how characters actually develop, how they deal with their set of issues in completely plausible ways and it was exquisitely written and paced.But then the final 2 episodes happened. I was stunned, in awe watching the episodes. Everything that happened simply destroyed the great pacing and growth that had led to that moment, simply to revert to a status quo in the end.It honestly destroyed the entire plot for me, the entire adventure and enjoyment I'd had with this series fell off a cliff and never recovered.It's extremely sad for me, I thought I'd found the greatest new favorite on my list, wondering why the hell people were giving it a 7 in total score. I was jugglging the idea of people hating the pacing because that's the only problem that might have come to mind if you were expecting another type of rom-com pacing, but now... I see why it's scored this way.I'm horribly dissapointed. The production value is through the roof and hanazawa kana delivered one of her best performances ever just to be dealt a bad plot like this. the aftermath of it.Dealing with loss, dealing with failure, dealing with family.

I liked the characters and all the little arcs and growth they go through. The art was pretty and the soundtrack was really enjoyable. The only issue is that it was 12 episodes. Definitely needed 24 or 18 at the least. So I will be going to look for the manga to get that extra time. Otherwise it was great. My favorite thing about the show is how realistic it is.  It isn't overly dramatic or really corny. Each character feels real. With how they act, react and perceive their surroundings. No character is ignorant to how they or otherwise...really feel. No one drags out how they feel through the whole show. All their emotions and the way they express them is the way people do irl. Which is a breath of fresh air in slice of life romance (don't get me wrong i enjoy the typical SOL troupes). And the situations they are put in are very hard-hitting. At least for me, personally. Things that i have dealt with and seen. And so it was very easy to relate to.If you enjoy slice of lifes about romance.

I just muddled through the last bit because I really thought it was going a different direction then how I wanted it to go.This giant dope of a male main character (Rikuo), I will not say protagonist, can\'t see that his entire life is stuck in the past. For that matter, nor can female antagonist (Shinako). They are both holding so tightly to the past they can\'t see anything infront of them. Like a large rock in a river, with time just flowing around it....While the female protagonist(Haru) and male antagonist(Rō), who barely fits that role, both are pushing forward in life. Trying to reach a goal, no matter what life throws in their way, no matter how hurt they become, they take it in stride and still step forward.Rikuo fails to see that it is not Shinako pushing him forward, rather Haru and the secondary male protagonist(Fukuda, Rikuo\'s best friend). Both are trying so desperately to pull Rikuo out of the shade and into the light. Without Haru(to give him the drive) and Fukuda(to provide an opportunity) then Rikuo would be still stuck in the stupid convince store with a part-time job.I am so happy, but angry, that in the end the idiot makes the correct choice and chooses Haru! I do literally mean ""in the end"" like last 5 minutes including credits. The whole time you can\'t help but love Haru with her plucky and in your face attitude, while you just kind of tolerate Rikuo.It absolutely came down to the final episode to see if I liked the show or not, I actually told a friend before the last episode ""Time to find out if this show sucks! Last episode"". I would much rather have been given a few episodes with Haru completely in the picture, or maybe like a 5 years later single episode?I feel as if the time was semi stolen from me after coming all this way to just finally see Rikuo getting serious and going to take Haru on a date...and FIN!(that means end) YEP! Just like that it\'s over and you\'re stuck wanting more, which probably will never happen. Originally it was for 18 episodes and was cut to just 12. However I believe the other 6 were essentially just more in between episodes, so still wouldn\'t be satiated.I did enjoy the ride, mainly due to Haru, so it is hard for me to fully recommend it? Then again I have watched an anime that had 8 episodes that were almost the same identical day, with one or two minor things changed. Not lying it was PAINFUL! If you want a bit of a love story with some characters you can REALLY hate in it, give it a try. You\'ll know in the first 2 or 3 episodes if you want to put in the time.Oh yeah I think Shinako and Rō end up happy? Or at least it seems that way? But again you\'ll just feel bad for Rō and honestly who cares about Shinako? Could have been so much easier if she had be truly honest from the get go.That\'s my two cents anyway!

The transition to adulthood is a treacherous journey with plenty of roadblocks and slippery slopes. At first, two of our main characters seem on a parallel path. Rikuo firmly planted in the seat of self-consciousness and denying any value or merit to his capabilities. Shinako stuck in her past life in Kanazawa. Two driving forces, Haru and Rou find their way into the fold and make it difficult for Rikuo and Shinako to keep standing still.A scene...in episode four, as an example of a highlight of this series, was when Shinako viewed the cherry blossom tree from the back of the house. The surreal feeling of death lingering over the memories of someone is that you have this sense they are there with you and you look again and realize that you expect them to be there, to be somewhere. The scene captured this feeling so well. Another moment was when Minato says ""I thought I\'d never see her again"". This moment of relief accompanied by bittersweet heartache burned deeply and in a subjective sense spoke to me as a viewer. It\'s clear that the writers have done an amazing job of adapting emotional appeal into this show.The characters are all very realistic, in some ways maybe a little dauntingly so. Their hearts are on full display for us as the viewer and I personally found it difficult to approach the painful moments without being affected. The depictions get messier as the season progresses, about episode 5 or 6 is when it feels they start to unravel a bit. Their motivations, their personality, their interpersonal connections are clearly defined, whether that\'s through implicit or explicit means. Dialogue and monologue are both delivered exceptionally well.If I could think of anything that holds this series back, there are a couple things. First may be the quieter moments. They are abundant, but I think in a way these moments are necessary because there is a lot that is unpacked through this series. Four episodes in and I had already felt like these characters were not only fully realized, but that I had been with them for much longer than that. This is not to say that the pacing is necessarily slow either, considering that there is quite a bit of exposition for each of the main characters. It all comes together naturally for the most part. The second would be the latter half\'s pacing and direction. We got numerous episodes where the main characters seem to stagnate in a situation that neither of them are particularly fond of. This arc would seem, by far, to be the weakest. While I understand the tension is building for the finish, it is painful. Maybe that pain was intended to be part of the experience of this show. To some degree it feels masochistic to enjoy such emotional pressure, but at the end of the day the adeptness of this show at driving these emotional beats can\'t be ignored. The characters start to lose their initial appeal in the process, making this approach a double-edged sword. While it may have done a great job of tension, it also risked the integrity of the characters. That being said in terms of romance, I find this show to actually focus more on the dramatic aspects than the romantic. I actually enjoy this approach. It does its best to place proper value and realism on the bonds of the characters.I give the show a strong 8, I can\'t quite give it a 9 as there are some pacing issues that hold it back and direction towards the back half that could probably play a little less risky. I can definitely say if you\'re looking for a good sob, you will find a couple watching this. in episode four, as an example of a highlight of this series, was when Shinako viewed the cherry blossom tree from the back of the house.

Although I do understand that the point of the show is about regular people worrying about love and going around in circles in their heads... that doesn't make them likable.Cowardice and idleness, even if it's realistic or well-written, is not necessarily entertaining; especially when there is no memorable soundtrack nor good dialogue to even accompany it.Having realism is something worthy of praise, but it's not...worth having if your characters aren't also engaging to the audience.When I watch a romance anime, I'm looking for wholesome doki-doki moments that make your heart skip a beat from the bittersweet feelings of the main characters seen inside your screen.

Most of what I have to say is about the story so I'll get all the other categories out of the way as quickly as I can.Art: 9/10 - I really like the art style of this series. It goes very well with the feel of the rest of the show and it's what initially drew me to it. I especially enjoy Haru's character design.Sound: 7/10 - Nothing particularly significant about the sound. I didn't notice it often, but when I did, I thought it pleasantly complemented the...scene. The voice acting usually solid and occasionally brilliant. I thought the EDs were good enough.Character: 8/10 - The characters of the series as well as the distribution of their screen time in my opinion were very good. They felt real, enjoyable, and relatable. They aren't perfect people, far from it, but that's part of what makes them more watchable. There will likely be characters you dislike and choices which are made that you disagree with, but that again is part of what makes the story feel real. It makes it interesting and keeps you captivated and invested.Enjoyment: 8/10 I quite liked the show as a whole for all the reasons I've listed above above. If the story didn't have the issues that I'm about to talk about, I probably would have rated it an 8.The line between a 7 and an 8 for me, personally, is whether or not I felt profoundly impacted in some way by the show. I feel like the show had the potential to be very meaningful and memorable which is why it's such a shame that I believe that the storytelling gets in the way of the viewer being able to be moved.Story: 5/10 - In one word, pacing. There were so many times in the show that felt I felt like something was either happening too quickly or too slowly and by the end of the twelfth episode I didn't even feel dissatisfied, I just felt bewildered by the whole experience. While most individual events or episodes felt like they happened too soon or occurred too quickly, by the end of the series I felt like very little had actually happened in terms of the plot, though a lot literally did happen. I find the feeling very hard to describe or explain, which is part of why I decided to write this review.The main characters and even the side characters are all set up to work very well together in ways that have the potential to evoke special emotions in the viewer. The dynamics that they all have together are, on paper, interesting and touching. I very much enjoyed the concept and the core of the show but I feel like I was blocked from getting a valuable message from it because of the pacing alone. This story ABSOLUTELY NEEDED either 24 episodes or more planning to be told meaningfully and it's such a shame that it didn't get the delivery it deserved.In the end, I do think this show is worth watching. While I felt the storytelling got in the way of my overall experience, you may feel otherwise, and if the storytelling indeed is not a barrier for you, you have a beautiful concept waiting for you to enjoy in Yesterday wo Utatte. scene.

I feel like the show had the potential to be very meaningful and memorable which is why it's such a shame that I believe that the storytelling gets in the way of the viewer being able to be moved.Story: 5/10 - In one word, pacing. There were so many times in the show that felt I felt like something was either happening too quickly or too slowly and by the end of the twelfth episode I didn't even feel dissatisfied, I just felt bewildered by the whole experience. While most individual events or episodes felt like they happened too soon or occurred too quickly, by the end of the series I felt like very little had actually happened in terms of the plot, though a lot literally did happen. I find the feeling very hard to describe or explain, which is part of why I decided to write this review.The main characters and even the side characters are all set up to work very well together in ways that have the potential to evoke special emotions in the viewer. The dynamics that they all have together are, on paper, interesting and touching. I very much enjoyed the concept and the core of the show but I feel like I was blocked from getting a valuable message from it because of the pacing alone. This story ABSOLUTELY NEEDED either 24 episodes or more planning to be told meaningfully and it's such a shame that it didn't get the delivery it deserved.In the end, I do think this show is worth watching. While I felt the storytelling got in the way of my overall experience, you may feel otherwise, and if the storytelling indeed is not a barrier for you, you have a beautiful concept waiting for you to enjoy in Yesterday wo Utatte."", 'This series is almost on par with School Days when it comes to being a negative example on how to deal with romantic relationships. The whole story is just lesson after lesson of ""how to f*ck up your romantic life""Almost every single character in the love quadrangle have no idea how to handle romantic relationships or deal with their own feelings like mature adults, and the sad part is, TWO out of four of these STUPID characters are CLEARLY adults.The only reason this show is getting a 7 and not something lower is because the art is really not that bad and the OPs and...EDs are not bad as well. The story, well, I guess it\'s interesting like how a trainwreck is interesting? You know, like if you have that one friend who keeps f*cking up his/her romantic relationships and coming to you to talk about how he/she had f*cked it up, yet again?

How a show can be ever so stationary and end up rushing an ending is beyond me. Checking out the manga, it bothers me how specific storylines were left out in order to cram this show into a single 2-episode series. As a graduate student, these characters all had something had reminded me of myself. Haru reminds me of the youth we all have, rushing into situations with blind confidence and walking down a thorny path to achieve an outcome she desired. Rikuo reminds...me of the uncertainty we all have for the next step in life, finding every excuse possible to avoid conflict until the problem is forced in his face. And Shinako, someone who is tethered to the ground by her past and unfortunately dragging others down with her. Each of these characters are afraid of something: Haru the present, Shinako the past, and Rikuo the future. It's refreshing to see a story that is dialogue heavily and relies on their character's ideals butting heads every episode for any progress to be made. The ED to this show made me even more emotional and eager to watch the next episode every week. But something happened around 2/3 of the way through. The show came to a halt. Plot from the manga that was omitted came back to bite the show in the butt. The choices the characters kept making began to annoy me. But most of all, the show had an ending that was not fulfilling in the slightest.Doga Kobo is a studio that doesn't have that immediate recognition, but has been in charge of some fun shows in the past that I have enjoyed.

More than anything this show has the struggles of relationships as it\'s core principle.To be honest the show kind of blew my mind. It was the most slice of lify show I\'ve probably watched. It wasn\'t good because there was somethings deep, relatable or a special scene. It was just a story about the daily life of some characters who weren\'t bad, but actually kind of decent. It\'s...not hard to find characters you don\'t like nowadays after all.If you are interested in this, the first episode should probably be enough for you to decide whether or not you will enjoy this, it won\'t get insanely better but It still doesn\'t get worse, until the last episode...Basically it was rushed ending which ruined the slow pace of the whole show. I\'ve read from somewhere that this anime was supposed to have 18 episodes, but it now only has 12 and I can clearly see it in the last episode, it\'s not even that the last 3 episodes were rushed, it was just the last episode and it was very confusing and bad. But still just somehow it was a decent show overall. More of a refreshing one than a good one but still it was good. not hard to find characters you don\'t like nowadays after all.If you are interested in this, the first episode should probably be enough for you to decide whether or not you will enjoy this, it won\'t get insanely better but It still doesn\'t get worse, until the last episode...Basically it was rushed ending which ruined the slow pace of the whole show.

Just a tiny tiny spoiler but they actually don\'t sing the song \'Yesterday\' by The Beatles.Starto Starto yo, gonna speako some Spoilor warning yo. You have been warned yo.Alright, let\'s get on with the review. So Sing ""Yesterday"" for Me is a Slice of Life/Romance/Love Triangle Shenanigan kind of show, we start off by following our main character Rikuo. We later get to know he\'s in love with this girl Shinako but he\'s too shy or does not have enough courage to tell her. ̶S̶h̶a̶m̶e̶  Same. Relatable definitely. Later we got to know that his crush was...moving to his area, a confirm Red Alert in his mind but he too is struggling with a purpose in life as well. So with that cleared up, let\'s move on to the description.I mean when I first saw Rikuo and probably this thought went through your mind as well, I think we all thought of him as a virgin loser. But in a relatable way, it\'s no shame to hide the fact that boys in school get rejected or just doesn\'t get enough courage to get a girlfriend and slowly watches her slip away. That I certainly can dig with and I feel it\'s a good start for the story. I must say, one thing I love about this show is the character development. Initially, Rikuo was a loser (to put it) but little did we know he became a certified chad. Honestly watching his development was truly a joy, it\'s like watching your failed efforts slowly succeeding. My man Rikuo even got multiple girls in his past, damn. And he even manages to attract a chick without even trying, no challenge, this dude\'s a chad. Talking about that chick.Haru is the best girl, she is cute looking but her positive look on her position despite her being on the losing end is something to behold. Her perseverance and determination are really intriguing and she really gets me in the feels when she loses. She\'s a great character that makes us feel pity for her despite not forcing it down our throat. On the other spectrum, we have Shinako. Haru\'s challenger to say. We later get to know she\'s a weak-hearted but kind person that can\'t let go of her previous lover that past. As we get to know more about the characters, the pieces of the puzzle start to fall in line and we get to know why despite all Rikuo\'s efforts, she is still hesitant.Then there\'s Rou. To be frank I think he\'s one factor that contributes to the downfall of the show. While there are great character moments among the 3 main ones, Rou seriously feels like a pain in the ass and it\'s always a burden when things get involved with him. Plus he literally can\'t control his urges but to hug Shinako without her consent? Straight to jail. But don\'t get me wrong, not all the supporting characters are shit. We have my personal favourite, Kinoshita the dude that worked with Rikuo. I really wanted to see more of this dude. Sadly only like, 5 episodes he got snapped by Thanos.Alright alright, enough about characters, story-wise. I feel it\'s half baked, to be frank. Like only until the last quarter of the show do we get to see progress being made with Rikuo and Shinako. Other than that or worse some episodes even, are straight up pointless. Moreover, it\'s directionless. There isn\'t really any point or goal of some parts/episodes and it feels like filler content. I do want to point out how there is no intro, that\'s actually quite cool and interesting as we don\'t feel any pause at the beginning of every episode. We a straight up just going into the episode which I do like.  Pacing-wise, I am impressed. How this show manages to capture this down to earth pace of slow. it\'s really cool.-SCORES-Character- 7/10: While I do want to point out how annoying it might seem as if Rikuo and Shinako, both adults, still act and handles situations like kids. It can be both ways, one that adults are still kids deep down or it\'s just they suck at being adults. Like how Rou just controls a ton of Shinako but Shinako keeps teasing him. Apart from that I still feel that the characters are well built, just not all of them. The high parts of the show are really good, like Haru wanting to cry but holds it back in episode 11. Oof big size.Art- 8/10: Really good actually, somewhat unique and has a lovely vibe to it. I feel the colour template as well fits the mood of the show.Writing- 5/10: Really the biggest downfall, like a big chunk of the episodes listing feels pointless or contributes little to the progress of the show. Only to rush everything at the last episode and ruin the best part honestly, the aftermath of what happened. I really wanted to see more of the few minutes we have of the last episode, shame, I really wanted more man. Disappointed.Sound- 7/10: Intro, there is no intro. Outros are good though. OST I think fits.Overall, I wasn\'t too disappointed, there were certainly high moments on this show. More than the low but the low aren\'t super low as well, more like lukewarm.Strong 6 to a Light 7 moving to his area, a confirm Red Alert in his mind but he too is struggling with a purpose in life as well.

I just felt like that there was no way that the ending could be good. If Uozumi broke up with Shinako and admitted his feelings for Haru, it would be cliche, which the ending was (I still enjoyed tho). If he had stayed with Shinako, It would have been the expected unexpected twist in the story. Either way, the ending was predictable and it was just ok. I would have liked to see an ending where Haru realizes that she had a superficial crush (Which is what it felt like the...whole series) and moves on, Shinako ends up with Rou (I think that the story was set up perfectly for that realization), and Uozumi was left all alone. I liked Uozumi as a character but I feel like this would have been a better way to leave the character, a little bit open ended. I liked all of the characters overall, and there wasn't anything particularly stellar about this anime but it just feel special despite the predictable ending it had. whole series) and moves on, Shinako ends up with Rou (I think that the story was set up perfectly for that realization), and Uozumi was left all alone.

I am no professional critic or someone who has a large catalog underneath their belt. Although, I still feel the need to write this review.""Sing Yesterday For Me"" came at an interesting time in my life. It started airing during the last few months of high school. I was wrapping up my time despite the quarantine. This show made me really reflect on the past four years of high school and think of my future in college and beyond. The main character, Rikuo, isn\'t anyone spectacular. He\'s a more realistic character going through life at his part time job. Its his growth through...the story of progressing himself forward. This might\'ve directly influenced me to start growing myself as a person as well. As a result, the last few months have had their learning curve and led to some growth as a person.Importantly, the story made me think about my time after college the most. Who will I be? How will I look back upon now in 4 years? Will I reflect similarly to how Rikuo does? Could I be taking it slow after college or rush myself out there for a career?In my opinion, both the premise and art style was refreshing among other titles this season. It certainly is a story stuck in the past, but can break past that barrier to deliver a compelling story. The 1990s were 20-30 years ago. (Depending on the year you refer to) Yet, I can\'t describe my exact feelings towards the story. However, I can express my overall experience.I enjoyed each character. They didn\'t feel terrible, or absurd. They were just people. Each growing in their own ways along the progressing passage of time. I don\'t really have much else to say besides that. This wasn\'t in my top favorite anime, but it is up there. The lasting impression is there and will be looking forward to rewatching this series 4 years from now.Thank you for reading this review, I bet its kinda formatted weirdly and all over the place. the story of progressing himself forward.

I thought that watching a romance anime in the adult world would be nice in order to avoid some usual boring and basic stuff of this genre, just like Wotakoi did. Well, i was in mid of chapter 12 thinking that there would be at least 6-7 more episodes and then, the plot exploded and rushed to a kinda good ending for the only good main character of the show. This happened to me in many other animes but this is the first time that i completely blame...the writing.Instead of reviewing the plot, i´ll go straight to the cast.Rikuo: Our protagonist has a nice setup, but her developement is so dull. I can´t believe how a guy so close to me in many aspects of her life and personality (trapped in a first love, pointless life at the beginning of the story...) felt so distant to me. Dude is just empty af. He only manages to get some courage to get another job more appropiate to him while already having a job that guarantees safety and a hot girl simping for him. In the end, he just ""realizes"" that he is in love because Haru is the only giving attention to him.Shinako: I despise her. I kinda understand her being trapped in her past and wanted to feel something as authentic and big as her tragic first love, but her developement is close to zero, she  ""unintentionally"" plays with Rikuo and she crosses all the lines in chastity even for a japanese show. But the worst part of her is the next character.Rou: This clown is a predator, has a twisted mind and is an awful human being. Ok, you have a crush on your dead older brother GF but ruining her relantionship with you and your father just because u want her is stupid af. Bro is 17-18 and wanna smash a 23-24yo girl that sees him as family. Worst part is that it´s implied that he was gonna keep his strategy and being noticed as a man, when he should be noticed as a rapist by the closest police station. MF almost assaulted her two times.Yuzuhara: The most interesting character in the series appears in two chapters then she dissappears bc her mission is being a mini boss for the two female protagonist.Haru: She gets way less character developement than expected, but at least she is an honest girl that fights for what she wants.This was just that bad. the writing.Instead of reviewing the plot, i´ll go straight to the cast.Rikuo: Our protagonist has a nice setup, but her developement is so dull.

I'm gonna paste an english translation made by myself, sorry if something is not clear enough or understandable.ENGLISHStory: 4/20From the beginning the series shows you love problems, and interests among the characters of whom you know absolutely nothing. Yes, then they fill that gap as the story progresses, but ...In the first place, it is not that much progress. Shinako stops any advance in the story-line too much because of her personality and trauma. Come on!, i understand losing someone could be very painful, and can lead you to be very insecure...about your decisions and try new things, but it is not enough argument to allow this to influence the progress of the story so much.And in the second, the fact that they give us romantic interest from the first chapter without knowing the characters at all is like being forced to eat Maruchan / Spaghetti with a spoon; it feels bad, it doesn't fit, that shouldn't be like that. Or you use a fork or chopsticks, but not a spoon. If you want to rush the romance into a series, at least start by giving the characters more depth from the first chapter.SpoilerAnd please, we all wanted him to stay with Haru, but come on, there was no development in that relationship, there was nothing interesting, striking. I consider it almost an insult from the creator towards Haru fans. He gave us what we want, but the drink was bitter, and it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that doesn't go away, either by listening to Haru's voice or seeing her smile.Art: 16/20Not much to say about this topic, good animation, good drawings, good scenes, good lighting. Nothing spectacular, but not bad either. No complains.Sound: 16/20Here's the reason I watched this anime all the way: Haru's voice actress. A very nice voice, well acted, according to the character, and I have no complaints from the rest of the actors that appeared, nor from the soundtrack. Good music for the genre that makes you enter the anime environment very well, although not spectacular either.Characters: 5/20Again, Shinako, her personality and her lack of security, as well as the obsession of the protagonist delay the progress of the series. Neither the protagonist nor the secondary characters show much depth in their personality or way of acting. If anything, they only gave importance to this topic to Shinako and Haru. But I insist, in general, Shinako was a failure, and the work on Haru went from acceptable to good, but I think it could have been much better, a character with great potential was wasted.Enjoy: 10/20As I mentioned earlier, for me this anime was Haru. Without it, I would have abandoned it after Chapter 1. Still, there were some interesting scenes, and the setting, drawings, soundtracks, made me take the time I watched the anime as relaxing, but this doesn't exactly mean I enjoyed it. Of course, watching it a second time is not in my plans, not at all.Overall: 51/100Are you looking for a romantic anime in which you watch yourself falling in love with the characters, feel immersed in the story, and do not care much about the animation or setting?Well, in this anime you will find the exact opposite. Good animation and setting, good sounds, but a bad story and mediocre character work. That means... the animation studio had to choose another romantic story to animate. Almost all of my qualification is for the art itself.SPANISHHistoria : 4 / 20Desde un principio la serie te muestra problemas amorosos, e intereses entre los personajes de quienes no sabes absolutamente nada. Sí, después van llenando ese vacío conforme la historia avanza, pero...En primera, tampoco es que esta avance mucho. Shinako detiene demasiado cualquier avance de la historia por su personalidad y sus traumas. Va, yo lo comprendo, perder a alguien puede ser muy doloroso, y te puede llevar a tener mucha inseguridad con respecto a tus decisiones y a probar cosas nuevas, pero tampoco es argumento suficiente para permitir que esto influya tanto en el avance de la historia.Y en segunda, el hecho de que nos den interés romántico desde el primer capítulo sin conocer a los personajes es como que te obliguen a comer Maruchan / Spaghetti con cuchara; se siente mal, que no encaja, que así no debería ser el asunto. O utilizas tenedor o palillos, pero no cuchara. Si quieres apurar el romance en una serie, al menos comienza dándole más profundidad a los personajes desde el primer capítulo.SPOILERY ¡por favor!, todos queríamos que se quedara con Haru, pero vamos, no hubo desarrollo en esa relación, no hubo algo interesante, llamativo. Lo considero casi un insulto del creador hacia los fans de Haru. Nos dió lo que queremos, pero el trago fue amargo, y deja un mal sabor de boca que no se quita ni por escuchar la voz de Haru ni verla sonreír.Arte : 16 / 20No mucho qué decir al respecto de este tema, una buena animación, buenos dibujos, buenos escenarios, buena iluminación. Nada espectacular, pero tampoco está mal. Sin quejas.Sonido : 16 / 20Aquí la razón por la que vi este anime hasta el final : La actriz de voz de Haru. Una voz muy linda, bien actuada, acorde al personaje, y tampoco tengo quejas del resto de los actores que se presentaron, tampoco del soundtrack. Buena música para el género que te hace entrar muy bien en el ambiente del anime, aunque tampoco espectacular.Personajes : 5 / 20Repito lo de Shinako, su personalidad y su falta de seguridad, así como la obsesión del protagonista retrasan el avance de la serie. Ni el protagonista, ni los personajes secundarios muestran mucha profundidad en su personalidad ni forma de actuar. Si acaso solo se limitaron a darle importancia en este tema a Shinako y Haru. Pero insisto, en general, Shinako fue un fracaso, y el trabajo en Haru fue de aceptable a bueno, pero pienso que pudo haber sido mucho mejor, un personaje con un gran potencial desperdiciado.Disfrute : 10 / 20Como mencioné anteriormente, para mí este anime fue Haru. Sin ella, lo hubiese abandonado después del capítulo 1. Aún así, hubo algunas escenas interesantes, y la ambientación, dibujos, soundtracks, me hicieron tomarme el tiempo en el que veía el anime como de relajación, pero esto no significa precisamente que lo haya disfrutado mucho. Eso sí, verlo una segunda vez no está en mis planes, para nada.General : 51 / 100¿Buscas un anime romántico en el que tú mismo caigas enamorado por los personajes, te sientas inmerso en la historia, y no te importa mucho la animación ni ambientación?Pues en este anime encontrarás exactamente lo contrario. Buena animación y ambientación, buenos sonidos, pero una mala historia y un trabajo de personajes mediocre. Es decir, el estudio de animación debió elegir otra historia romántica para animar. Casi toda mi calificación es para el arte en sí. about your decisions and try new things, but it is not enough argument to allow this to influence the progress of the story so much.And in the second, the fact that they give us romantic interest from the first chapter without knowing the characters at all is like being forced to eat Maruchan / Spaghetti with a spoon; it feels bad, it doesn't fit, that shouldn't be like that. Or you use a fork or chopsticks, but not a spoon. If you want to rush the romance into a series, at least start by giving the characters more depth from the first chapter.SpoilerAnd please, we all wanted him to stay with Haru, but come on, there was no development in that relationship, there was nothing interesting, striking. I consider it almost an insult from the creator towards Haru fans. He gave us what we want, but the drink was bitter, and it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that doesn't go away, either by listening to Haru's voice or seeing her smile.Art: 16/20Not much to say about this topic, good animation, good drawings, good scenes, good lighting. Nothing spectacular, but not bad either. No complains.Sound: 16/20Here's the reason I watched this anime all the way: Haru's voice actress. A very nice voice, well acted, according to the character, and I have no complaints from the rest of the actors that appeared, nor from the soundtrack. Good music for the genre that makes you enter the anime environment very well, although not spectacular either.Characters: 5/20Again, Shinako, her personality and her lack of security, as well as the obsession of the protagonist delay the progress of the series. Neither the protagonist nor the secondary characters show much depth in their personality or way of acting. If anything, they only gave importance to this topic to Shinako and Haru. But I insist, in general, Shinako was a failure, and the work on Haru went from acceptable to good, but I think it could have been much better, a character with great potential was wasted.Enjoy: 10/20As I mentioned earlier, for me this anime was Haru. Without it, I would have abandoned it after Chapter 1. Still, there were some interesting scenes, and the setting, drawings, soundtracks, made me take the time I watched the anime as relaxing, but this doesn't exactly mean I enjoyed it.

Not ever.Beatles music aside, check some of the other reviews. You\'ll see that this is a very polarizing anime. Love. Hate. Not much in between. That\'s life.But that\'s the point being made in Sing Yesterday. In life, we don\'t always know where we are going. We don\'t always make the right decisions. We don\'t know how the story ends or even understand the plot. So we muddle through making the best decisions we can. Sometimes they\'re based on the heart. Sometimes the...mind. But they always seem right at the time.I generalize because I try to keep my reviews as spoiler-free as possible. The general feel for this anime is confusion. That scares some people. I found myself at times shaking my fist at the screen cursing both Rikuo and Shinako for their choices. I cursed Ruo for being the way he is and I cursed Haru for not thinking she deserved better. Why can they not see what they\'re doing? But in the end, that\'s what kept me coming back week after week. How badly were they gonna eff things up this time?If your anime is all about swords and magic and fantasy creatures, this is an anime you will despise. It\'s real. It\'s emotions.

One of those anime series is Yesterday wo Utatte (Sing “Yesterday” for Me).It’s refreshing for me to watch a show that focuses more on human drama, or drama in general, one of my favorite genres. The first couple of episodes were particularly noteworthy, mostly because of the protagonist who I somehow empathize with despite still being a student. The plot was interesting and I wondered how a Seinen type of anime would handle...it. The way the characters of this world were introduced was great. I kind of like the rough-ish art style and the soundtrack was good. I also appreciate the show’s quiet, minimalist approach when characters are talking with each other as to give emphasis on what they are saying.Speaking of characters, I thought they were quite good. That is, until we reached the last couple of episodes. When I found out that this show only has 12 instead of 18, I thought to myself: “How will this show end?” I had no idea how the anime will have a good conclusion to a plot that takes it time to build up. There were some good dramatic interactions and some bad interactions with the main cast as the show comes to an end. What I thought was a good show that tackles relationships between friends and lovers, ended with a sudden conclusion that would have paid off were it not for the fact that it felt rushed and could have been better if it had more episodes to develop the plot and the characters more. Seeing the extras did lighten me up about the show a little bit.I may read the manga soon, since I have heard that the ending is different. However, at the end of the day, what started as a great show, turned out to be kind of rushed in the end.6.5/10 it. The way the characters of this world were introduced was great.

Starting with Rikuo stuck in his dead end part time job he\'s resigned himself to, the conflict most of the story resolves around starts when he chances upon his old college crush Shinako and another girl, Haru, who is interested in him. The story follows the relationships of this often awkward love triangle as each character struggles with both romantic and personal issues.Story:The story is in a slow burn style with...episodes giving small hints of progress for both the personal issues of each character and the ""main plot"" of the love triangle. The characters make realistic decisions that are sometimes frustrating but give a solid impression of how they feel in their life. The biggest problem is the ending, where the first half of episode 12 feels very much in line with the rest of the series but the second half seemingly comes out of nowhere and could have used a less sudden decision by Rikuo. This may be partly influenced by the false impression that there were going to be 18 episodes (later determined to mean 12 actual episodes and 6 extra scenes), so perhaps it will grow on me.Art:Not much to say here, but in a good way. The whole show has a more mature vibe and the art matches. The characters have simplistic art designs that fit in with the world and never look out of place. I won\'t pretend to be an expert art critic or anything so I\'ll just say it looks nice and doesn\'t clash with the story or take me out of the experience.Sound:The episodes are very quiet in terms of music, and that\'s only exemplified by the lack of an OP for the show, replaced by a simple camera shot of an in universe object and an episode number. Surprisingly it doesn\'t subtract from the anime, and the few times the music does come in help set the mood very well. The ending themes are also great, with number 3 being my favorite.Characters:The characters are the foundation of the anime, so it\'s a good thing that 3/4 of our main characters are good. Shinako is often frustrating but I can\'t say I didn\'t relate to her and her fear of moving forward at moments. The same goes with Rikuo\'s hesitation to put himself out there and actively pursue a career or his love interest. Haru doesn\'t have as obvious a mental block as those two, so she often is the one moving the plot forward, and her dedication to Rikuo is admirable, if not perhaps a little misguided.  Rou on the other hand is the theoretical 4th main character, but it\'s hard to like him for most of the series. He gives off a constant air of feeling entitled to Shinako\'s attention. He has one, maybe two episodes where his problems are on par with the rest of the cast, with the rest having him being almost annoying whenever he\'s on screen. The other side characters work well within the plot. There are two episodes back to back that introduce a side character and then dismiss them by the end of that same episode, but they work because of how they influence the main characters, forcing further development of both the plot and the main characters emotions.Overall: 8/10I was lost on how to rate this show for most of my watch time with it, so the overall score may change as I mull the show over more. If you enjoy stories about characters and the slow burn of some plots i could definitely recommend this show; but it would be tough for me to recommend it to someone who doesn\'t already have an interest in one of those two things. episodes giving small hints of progress for both the personal issues of each character and the ""main plot"" of the love triangle.

For anybody who has been or still is in a similar situation, it...might hit a little too close to home. If you\'re looking for a motivator to overcome your hurdles and inhibitions, I would recommend something like ""Kaze ga tsuyoku fuiteiru"" instead, because you will only get very little mileage out of Yesterday in that regard. As I mentioned, the main character Rikuo makes very little progress over the course of the series. So at best, he might serve as a bad example and make you realize that you definitely don\'t want to appear as an indecisive wishy-washy loser like him.His romantic misadventures on the other hand - and this is the main focus of the story! - are probably a lot less relatable to a Western audience, or even a modern day Japanese audience. I already figured that the story must be set in the late 90s due to some clunky product designs featured in the backgrounds. Looking up the original manga\'s debut date did confirm that it\'s set in 1997. And I would say that societal conventions have changed a bit since then, if they ever were as bad as they are depicted in Yesterday. Characters of the opposite sex always keep their distance, act awkward and evasive with each other, let alone make any sexual allusions. The show does end on a kiss, but until then the highest forms of physical affection were two weird hugs and one person tugging on another person\'s jacket. Two of the four main characters who are involved in the love triangle(s) are relatively open about their romantic intentions, but even they limit themselves on how much they will push the topic, usually out of consideration for their love interest\'s circumstances. So most of the time, you\'ll only watch two characters walking each other home at night and then awkwardly saying goodbye while holding back what they actually want to say. It\'s just frustrating when these people get nowhere, or when nothing of consequence or significance happens in an episode.That\'s not to say that this extremely mundane drama is entirely anachronistic. I\'m sure that a lot of awkward people will still find these relationships very relatable. It\'s just not what I watch animes for. And in this specific case, it felt like a huge waste of time.Maybe the fact that it IS an anime instead of a live action drama is Yesterday\'s biggest raison d\'être. As a live action drama it would become even more obvious how boring the plot is, while the artstyle and animation quality of the anime are often way more elaborate than they have any right to be. Like sometimes, someone will turn around and take off their coat and that motion alone has more keyframes than an entire fight scene in an action show. That alone shouldn\'t justify the creation of a show where this little happens. In a way, that makes it stand out from all the regular stupid romcoms that come out these days.Though that still doesn\'t make Yesterday an entertaining show.Things that I did enjoy:- The minor side-characters who were way more colorful and interesting than the four main characters- The fact that Rikuo and Haruo got together in the end because the alternative was just annoying- The 2nd ED being an 8-bit shmup might hit a little too close to home.

Is it only possible? Well yes, it is, but nobody ever said it was going to work ...Story: 6/10As I said just above, having a romance between adults is relaxing in the world of anime, dominated by love affairs between adolescents, mixing unnecessary drama, abundant tears and an obsessive omnipresence of the school settingSo, does it hold up? Yes and no. Indeed, this anime is freed from the usual clichés that can be found in low-level shoujo, and we feel that the characters are indeed adults and behave as such (which, honestly, is very relaxing)However,...this love story has a big flaw: it drags on. It\'s slow.Of course, we are not in a combat anime where everything has to be flashy so as not to lose the attention of Tim, 11, who wants to see explosions of light everywhere.But that doesn\'t mean either that the story should go as slowly as my internet connection.A love story that could have been resolved in 30 minutes of sincere discussion between the characters will ultimately have held 12 episodesI will hardly speak of the rushed ending that confused me even moreThe story may be realistic, but it is boring.Art: 9/10This is the big highlight of the anime!The art style is really beautiful, Doga Kobo has really outdone themselves for this adaptation. The features of the characters and the backgrounds are really special and give a certain personality, a certain cachet to the anime.We will also note that the animation is also neat (which is surprising for a slice of life which is not produced by A-1 Pictures), and also accentuates the very special atmosphere of this animeSound: 7/10Not much to say about it. Most of the OST are very discreet, none is memorable but the general soundtrack, very calm, fits well with the atmosphere of the animeThere is no opening, and the endings are nice but nothing moreCharacter: 4/10And that\'s where the shoe pinches. I will be direct: Uozumi and Haru are to be kept, Kou and especially Shinako are to be thrown away.Uozumi is a little lost emotionally speaking man, but he is realistic in his actions without ever being annoying (even if sometimes his inaction is frustrating, but it remains understandable)Haru is definitely the best character in this anime. Endearing, sincere in her feelings, she is the character who stands out the most and is by far the friendliestKou, what about him? He is a little cliché in his role ""I am a teenager so my emotions are STRONG and POWERFUL"" and I go ahead without thinking. Fortunately, he does not have the cliché side of this description, his character is relatively well written but not very appreciable. He is possessive towards Shinako, and gives the impression of being embedded in a story where he is not supposed to be.And finally, time for the boss fight, let\'s talk about Shinako. Shinako is the reason for this note, and the general note for the anime. I can\'t say what is most annoying about her between her indecisive personality or the decisions that go with it. Absolutely the whole drama of this anime rests on it. All the complicated things that are happening happen because of it. Her chronic indecision causes the suffering of 3 people.She is unable to let go of a one-sided love past, and feels guilty because the person in question is dead. This kind of behavior can only lead to drama. And 3 people got involved.The whole story would have been more interesting if Shinako hadn\'t existed.Enjoyment: 6/10I had enjoyed the beginnings of the anime, but my interest declined as the episodes progressed, while my boredom and frustration gradually increasedOverall: 6/10Just as a French music group sang: ""love stories end badly"".This anime demonstrates it perfectly.The story is unnecessarily complicated because it revolves entirely around a character without flavor and the source of all the problems. The result is a boring story and characters held hostage by the script.Adult romance is a good idea, but throwing in a character like Shinako has ruined everything. this love story has a big flaw: it drags on.

It seems like the author only really tried to write a good character when writing her.And then we have the most important scenes. And are they are just... lackluster.

I won't give any spoilers or anything but instead cut to the chase. If you like to watch things that resonate with yourself, you might like one of these characters.

If you like romance and drama,...this is also for you in a way, though I'm not sure you'll be happy with the outcome.

All the characters are seem to be introverted, besides the art boy.  #1 all the characters lack any sort of relationship experience so i think all there actions are somewhat justified.  You can\'t expect people who lack relationship experience to act the right way.  Shinako for example, she was in love with someone who died, so she never got a proper sense of closure, she only over had what could have been....So I somewhat understand why she acts the way she does.  Rikou, oh rikou, man this guy only had one previous relationship, I can\'t blame him for the way he acts.  He is who he is, and despite the ending I don\'t hate him, honestly I might be biased because I relate to this story way to much, like i feel like a lived it.  But i digress, this show feels unsatisfying because it is ""real"" its messy, it feels incomplete and that\'s the feeling it gives off.  I think that was what the author wanted to convey.  I want to say this show is a 10/10 but I can\'t.  And I don\'t if it is because of that gut wrenching feeling that i felt while watching it or because of something else.  Anyways i still recommend people give it a watch, i give it a final 9/10.  Its great and I hope that people in the future will look back on it as a breath of fresh air.

It gets your psychology ready to relate with the story more. Same goes for the sounds. Everything is very natural. The character\'s awkward interactions. Not overportrayed or underportrayed. VERY relateable. Such that this anime can actually be food for the Spirit. Something can be learned here .Only read below if youhave seen the ending.Mypatchwork take (spoilers)The entire anime is a testament to the fact that people\'s feelings do cahnge in unexpected ways. It can be a tossup how they develop. This simply isn\'t your run of the mill romance anime...where what you expect to happen happens, because in real life, sometimes things don\'t go that way. I myself experienced a similar situation to Uozomi. Where the girl I wanted couldn;t be more than just friends with me, and the whole time I was heartbroken at the end of that relationship, another girl was causing me to develop feelings I kept trying to deny.. because of her persistence in expressing her feelings for me. I had a fling with her and it was honestly just finding comfort from my heartbreak, because all I could focus on was my previous love. Yet some years later I seriously dated this persistent girl for a long time, actually eventually loved her. My feelings changed.. (after 3 years of serious dating we parted, her feelings changed, and later mine caught up..so I didn;t actually find my ""Haru""..so indeed, peoples\' feelings can change and change again)""Sing yesterday for me"". the very title of the anime envelopes the lesson here. People cling to the past, yet change is inevitable. And people keep playing the past over because thats what humans do. Sing yesterday for me, is a fancy eloquent way of saying ""Can\'t we just keep things how they were?"". And the anime shows how whether you accept it at first or not, the past cannot be held onto forever, as people change. Shinako is the best example of this because she has it THE worst. SHe is the most reluctant to change, even to the point of near neurosis and she is herself ashamed of it. But that even she herself , the hardest nut to crack, finally changes. I think everyone in the world can relate with that. I believe Shinako here is the main protagonist to relate with. ""Sing Yesterday"" is Shinako\'s anthem.Shinako\'s inner battles around Ruo are pretty realistic. She keeps zoning him as kid brother when in fact she has been unconsciously forming feelings for him. He catalyzes this change when he confesses to her and then keeps trying to proclaim his love several more x. Yet, due to the controversy she thinks he just reminds her of his dead brother and feels shame and guilt for being attracted to him for that. At the end she begins to budge and accept her feelings for him are more than she thought. She simply couldn never write him off. The show hints at Shinako valueing Ruo\'s feelings over Uozomi\'s- multiple times - sometimes several times per episode. This shows that by default, Shinako actually lvoes Ruo more in practice, by prioritizing his feelings over Uozomi\'s every single time- even if Shinako doesn;t realize this at first. It goes to show you may think you love one person, but if you\'re constantly putting another\'s feelings first, you love them more in practice. What a beautiful transformation.It\'s basically a more in your face and disturbing rendition of how Uozomi\'s feeling changed and he admits he develops feels for Haru. Uozomi does eventually begin to think more about Haru\'s feelings - as shown in his outward demeanor and feeling pain for seeing Haru go through her difficult sidelined situation.As for why Uozomi does, sure the plot doesnt explain it perfectly, but it at least alludes to it is definitely happening. Why does anyone get feelings for someone? Do those feelings need to come from an obvious place? Are there rules? The anime utilizes Haru for this during an earliy episode - to pose tthat question to the audience: ""What is it to love another?"" Uozoimi asks her. ""I don\'t know either"" she says with a sort of humility - she implies it simply doesn\'t matter.. It doesn;t need to make sense.What matters is the feelings themselves. You just enjoy that person, like spending time with them. Even before He breaks up with Shinako, Uozomi finds himself looking for Haru at the cafe. Because he enjoys sharing attention with her in a way he cant let go of.I think another beautiful thing about this anime is; in the end, Shinako and Uozomi are able to utilize their talents of clinging to the past, to go back to just being friends instead of it being a forever goodbye when they breakup. What beautiful irony. Hence the eloquence in the phrase ""Sing Yesterday for me"" it was finally time to cling onto the past in a beautiful way, with permission to do so.The way the anime made me feel is this (prepare for some twists and turns): it\'s not whether your feelings for another person are real or not, it\'s whether the other person can reciprocate them (do they feel the same?). And, are your feelings just friendly but you think you need to rush to do something with them - because you dont yet know the difference between feelings that are just friendly and feelings that are more than that. It all makes me feel like none of that matters. You just got to figure it out in the moment. But once you figurte out one relationship is just friends, I think you can save yourself from the awkward mistake in other relationships where it\'s obvious the other person , or you yourself just aren\'t passionate to be intimate in the relationship. but again, the overarching lesson is tthat people\'s feelings change over time, so none of the above is concrete. be ready for anything.At the very end, Haru tells Uozomi-kun to redo his apology letter to her because he is too focussed on the past in his apology and doesn\'t include any forward thought on her and his *future*. Haru symbolizes the future for Uozomi, and he is finally moving into a place where he is in the present and forward looking by acknowledging Haru\'s feelings, and being honest that he likes her back. Where as Shinako was more of a safety net the whole time... b/c he knew Shinako might not love him back. Even though he had already found someone who already understands him and loves him for real (Haru), he chose not to face that exciting new start and instead kept running to the safety net of Shinako, where subconsciously he already knew he was not liked back - this gave him an escape from his future still, though he probably doesn\'t realize this himself - it is definitely playing out in his shadow and the viwer can come to this conclusion. He had to sort his feelings out and realize that the way Shinako understood him wasn\'t the same way Haru understood him. Haru could relate with him much more, while Shinako was too dissimilar and her understanding of Uozomi kept him at a distance.Again, Haru symbolizes Uozomi\'s finally facing the present and the future and the great unknown, instead of hanging onto the past and hiding in the safety nets of other people as an excuse where he already knows he wont get what he want.As a concluding aside; I find it enjoyable that they made Uozomi and Shinako as awkward, unexperienced, and shy as possible - because it allows the audience to relate and not feel like they need to catch up. But as well; that\'s how everyone starts out, and not all anime do as great of a job as Sing Yesterday does of portraying that reality. Other anime just dont touch on it as gracefully while keeping it real.This anime is one of the few true masterpieces.PS. I like Haru x Uozomi the most anyways@everyone DOn\'t listen to the noobs saying this is is a bad ending. I think it\'s perfect. RealisticI recommend everyone watch the bonus episodes. unlike most extras, these actually add value to the stopry. where what you expect to happen happens, because in real life, sometimes things don\'t go that way. I myself experienced a similar situation to Uozomi. Where the girl I wanted couldn;t be more than just friends with me, and the whole time I was heartbroken at the end of that relationship, another girl was causing me to develop feelings I kept trying to deny.. because of her persistence in expressing her feelings for me.

""I don\'t know either"" she says with a sort of humility - she implies it simply doesn\'t matter.. It doesn;t need to make sense.What matters is the feelings themselves. You just enjoy that person, like spending time with them. Even before He breaks up with Shinako, Uozomi finds himself looking for Haru at the cafe. Because he enjoys sharing attention with her in a way he cant let go of.I think another beautiful thing about this anime is; in the end, Shinako and Uozomi are able to utilize their talents of clinging to the past, to go back to just being friends instead of it being a forever goodbye when they breakup. What beautiful irony. Hence the eloquence in the phrase ""Sing Yesterday for me"" it was finally time to cling onto the past in a beautiful way, with permission to do so.The way the anime made me feel is this (prepare for some twists and turns): it\'s not whether your feelings for another person are real or not, it\'s whether the other person can reciprocate them (do they feel the same?). And, are your feelings just friendly but you think you need to rush to do something with them - because you dont yet know the difference between feelings that are just friendly and feelings that are more than that. It all makes me feel like none of that matters. You just got to figure it out in the moment. But once you figurte out one relationship is just friends, I think you can save yourself from the awkward mistake in other relationships where it\'s obvious the other person , or you yourself just aren\'t passionate to be intimate in the relationship. but again, the overarching lesson is tthat people\'s feelings change over time, so none of the above is concrete. be ready for anything.At the very end, Haru tells Uozomi-kun to redo his apology letter to her because he is too focussed on the past in his apology and doesn\'t include any forward thought on her and his *future*. Haru symbolizes the future for Uozomi, and he is finally moving into a place where he is in the present and forward looking by acknowledging Haru\'s feelings, and being honest that he likes her back. Where as Shinako was more of a safety net the whole time... b/c he knew Shinako might not love him back. Even though he had already found someone who already understands him and loves him for real (Haru), he chose not to face that exciting new start and instead kept running to the safety net of Shinako, where subconsciously he already knew he was not liked back - this gave him an escape from his future still, though he probably doesn\'t realize this himself - it is definitely playing out in his shadow and the viwer can come to this conclusion. He had to sort his feelings out and realize that the way Shinako understood him wasn\'t the same way Haru understood him. Haru could relate with him much more, while Shinako was too dissimilar and her understanding of Uozomi kept him at a distance.Again, Haru symbolizes Uozomi\'s finally facing the present and the future and the great unknown, instead of hanging onto the past and hiding in the safety nets of other people as an excuse where he already knows he wont get what he want.As a concluding aside; I find it enjoyable that they made Uozomi and Shinako as awkward, unexperienced, and shy as possible - because it allows the audience to relate and not feel like they need to catch up. But as well; that\'s how everyone starts out, and not all anime do as great of a job as Sing Yesterday does of portraying that reality. Other anime just dont touch on it as gracefully while keeping it real.This anime is one of the few true masterpieces.PS. I like Haru x Uozomi the most anyways@everyone DOn\'t listen to the noobs saying this is is a bad ending. I think it\'s perfect. RealisticI recommend everyone watch the bonus episodes. unlike most extras, these actually add value to the stopry.', ""*spoilers*Under most circumstances I'd probably rate this a 9, but given my current mental state and predicament, this easily won me over with how hard I related to it. While not a bad rating, I feel as 7 is a bit harsh for a show like this. Maybe across most genres it doesn't do anything unique, but within its own genre it perfectly encaptulates longing, regret, and looking into the past. That's what most characters in this show inhabit, constantly looking backwards, never able to move past the past. That's where I feel like this show shines.Both the Shinako and Rikuo are stuck, running in...circles, not moving forward. The show slowly pushes them towards their futures, but still leaves traces of their past that they can't get over. Rikuo has moved towards a more meaningful job for him, and is now looking towards building up his career rather than messing around in his own mundanity. Despite this, he can't get over his love for Shinako, but more so a love for his past. Life is mundane as an adult, and often times we look at highschool as the peak of our lives as we struggle to deal with being young adults. We often can't find what we want to do in life, nor can maintain old friendships or relationships, often people leave us behind as we bury ourselves deep in regret and longing. Some say that them breaking up made no sense, that it was sudden, rushed, forced, but to me it made too much sense. While the ending could of been fleshed out, the 3 month time skip and the words spoken at that park bench gives us a look into what is underneath. Shinako is Rikuo's mentality, constantly stuck in the past, reminiscing. He decided to go after her because that's what he's always done... He's always gone after his past. Even after being rejected, provided with Haru as another option, he kept sinking himself further into a reality once gone. Shinako doesn't help with her uncertainty of what she wants.Shinako loves Rou, not just as someone she wants to date, but as someone she deeply cares about. It doesn't show much towards the ending with them, only showing her to end up at his apartment, startled by the girl that opens the door. Obviously this shows that she wants to start a relationship with him, but not for the reasons people might think. This is more so on the writers end, instead of the characters. The writer here is expressing Shinako moving on from her past, getting over her love for Rou's dead brother, and taking what is in front of her. Deep down she cares about Rikuo, but even after 3 months of dating, they didn't even kiss... This shows her reluctancy to move on from being friends... Realistically, she only started dating him because it felt like what she should do. Constantly being egged on by friends to date him, as well as Rikuo's friends doing the same with him... The relationship felt forced, because it was. When blinded by false realities, we often find ourselves falling for mirages, and that's exactly what their relationship was. Deep down they knew that it wouldn't work.Rikuo loves Haru, and if this was any other show, it would of had a bunch of flashbacks to show how that makes sense... Rikuo always looked after Haru, even to the detrement of himself. To him he didn't know what love was, to him it was simple, he liked when a woman was nice to him, and he wanted to continue that reality. This is often how young guys feel, we fall for anyone who shows us an ounce of kindness. Not to say this is bad, but we often forget that love runs deeper than that. Continuing kindness is a sweet thought, but continuing deep care for someone is a lot more meaningful. Haru is someone he cares about, and even when spending time with Shinako, when she brings up Haru he instantly gets confused. He is confused emotionally, sprinting forward with the girl he scored, not looking at anything around him. Then when Haru finally leaves the city, his heart sinks deep, the feeling of not seeing her again hurts. Even towards the end once they start dating it shows him looking through the window of her workplace, the exact behaviour she showed at the start of the show with him at the convenience store. It's cute, wholesome, and it shows how now he sees eye to eye with her. He is no longer chasing dreams, but instead is now actualizing reality. Same with Shinako, yet she isn't the main focus of the show, so it leaves her ending up to intepretation.Shinako I'd say is a bad character, but in the best way possible. She is bad because she needs to be, she needs to lead Rikuo on, she needs to then stuff up their relationship, hurt Haru, hurt Rou... It is by design, she is the catalyst for the moments that push our main character forward, but as we follow her story we realize that her and the main character are one and the same. She is a reflection of Rikuo, vice versa, and that is why they don't work together. Their flaws drag eachother down, and because they share the same flaws, they revel in each others mess. Only once they break up can they truely move forward. I can understand those who dislike this, maybe those that felt as if it was unorganic, some that express the main characters as being dumb and foolish, but if they were smart from the beginning we wouldn't get a story quite like this. This story is for young adults alike, people stuck in the past, unable to move, foolish, stupid, depressed. Life sucks, but not striving to make it better doesn't help.The anime definitely needed time to express these simple, yet complex dynamics, but I think that if you truely got wound up in this show like I did, it all made sense. I don't casually give a show a 10, for me a 10 is a feeling more so than an analyses. As a foolish young adult barely able to move forward, I thank the author for creating a show that gave me some self-reflection for once. It's truely what I needed. circles, not moving forward.

It's truely what I needed."", ""Spoiler free article: A short description that's just a bit longer than normal synopsis to give you rough idea what to expect from this anime. Conclusion for TL;DR at the end of the articles.Reading time: 3 minutes readReview:The story are delivered to be as realistic as possible due to it's targeted audience (seinen), so it's a grounded somber slow story for the most of the time, some people might dislike it, but that's the charm of the show for me. They build up slowly, along with the occasional flashback that's timed precisely so that viewers not confused with the timeline of back and forth. The...characters are well developed, even the side characters are given a decent exploration (albeit not as broad as the manga, mainly due to the short 12 episode constraint). The 4 main characters are painfully realistic human being, this might make someone unconsciously dislike them as they represent not only the good side, but also the bad side such as frailty, stupidity, ignorant among many. But I must agree that among this 4 there's one that's a sore thumb pain in the ass, and like it or not, there's always people like this in real life, an adult body with a child mind inside...Now for the flaw that I really really need to point out, they skipped a lot of things, for the first half of the show, a couple of characters are not introduced, so I thought, oh, maybe then in the latter half or in season 2, but no, they decided, let's rush the last episode, and make it a happy ending somehow. I gave it a solid 8 for the first 11 episodes, then it dropped due to this stupid decision for the last episode. Even if I didn't read the manga, I won't be able to accept such ending, it's so rushed, time skipped a lot, left many details mentioned unexplained. I know they just want to not let any loose end by rush ending it, but me personally would love it keep going as usual and left us hanging without 2nd season.The visuals are just breathtaking, they made the characters even more beautiful than what they are in the manga, the usage of panels to emphasize a certain scenes are just genius, with a soft color palette it's able to visualize all kind of atmosphere in a somewhat somber serious tone. The animation are surprisingly smooth for anime with this genre. Another thing to add is the details to the facial expression, even the subtle change are visible to the face, the small frown, the small smirk, every single muscles of faces moves subtly, not a lot of anime made this subtle change and instead they just changed the whole expression since it's easier.The music are just great, as one of the few anime that have no opening song, the job then carried by the ending, and the ending couldn't be better in conveying the message of the anime, 3 different ending songs with a consistently high quality is very rare, but this anime successfully pulled this feat. The voice actors are right on point, just from looking at the character designs I imagined, ah this character should have voices like this, and they nailed it, and just like the theme songs, the quality never dropped! The sound effects are the dark horse, it seems so mediocre at first, but god knows when, it's suddenly becoming the key player in many important scenes, the wind howl, the fluttering petals, the ripples of water, ambient background noises, and many other things, it's so far behind, yet so close, perfect score for this department!Conclusion:Reasons to watch:-High quality of both visuals and audio (despite the lack of opening)-Decent story with wide cast of characters that matter, slow and realisticReasons NOT to watch:-Rushed ending and a lot of things skipped, might be better to just read the manga characters are well developed, even the side characters are given a decent exploration (albeit not as broad as the manga, mainly due to the short 12 episode constraint).

In the beginning the story has this sense of self worth with a nice theme of finding yourself- BUT in the end what we get is a train wreck  of a story with highly unlikable characters besides maybe Haru, but jeez they cut down 90% of the manga just to get the ending that they see is most profitable and although in the manga its not like all the issues are fixed it...seems more genuine if not drawn out a bit too long instead of the horribly pandering nature of the anime, the kid with the paperclip earring is honestly the worst character i have ever seen period. he is nothing more than filler content that honestly should have been sent to the trash as that his ONLY GOAL is to bang his DEAD BROTHER'S GIRLFRIEND. what a joke no wants, needs, or dreams besides- i REALLLLLLLLLLLY want to fuck her.

Relationships are complicated, especially when you are a reserved person (our MC) If you don\'t change, if you don\'t step forward, you keep walking in the same circle over and over. I really liked how this topic was treated in the series, apart of the ""choice"" of who the protagonist would stay with. The characters had complex feelings, some were direct, others...were serious, but no one wanted to lose the relationship they had built with another person and I found the decisions of each one quite mature, for their own well-being.

Something that not all of us dare to do. It was pretty good.', '""We overthink things and look back at yesterday, but still, our silly lives go on""STORY: 7Yesterday wo Utatte is about growing up.And here\'s the thing: growing up takes guts. Being an adult is about VOLUNTARILY taking up more and more responsibility. For example, when you get a better job, that means your decisions have a greater impact on yourself, on your workplace and on the lives of those around you. Same for a relationship: in a way, you end up becoming responsible for the other person\'s feelings (not in the sense that you can control them, but simply that your actions may deeply impact...them. Please don\'t get me wrong).Unfortunately, most people nowadays are simply afraid to take up that kind of responsibility. Because its really kind of a burden. You have to bust your ass, work hard, take risks, spend a LOT of time, and you\'ll probably still fuck up more than once along the way. And those fuck ups hurt, not only you but also those around you. And its kind of scary.But, as it turns out, that\'s what makes life meaningful after all. Its not your mistakes, your past or your feelings that define you, but the decision to try and do your best with what you have and know right now.Its that simple, but we seem to keep overthinking it and making things more complicated than they should be.That simple realization is what drives this show\'s plot.  And I LOVE that idea. I just have the impression that we could\'ve received a lot more out of it.- MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD -Rikuo, the main character, is basically stuck. That\'s the best way to describe him. His love life, his career, his emotional maturity... he doesn\'t have much going for him. Mostly because he\'s not trying at all. With some help from his work colleagues and his friends, he realizes that if he tries hard enough, he can maybe do something about it and find some meaning in life.First, he tries confessing to his college crush, Shinako, but that doesn\'t end well. Turns out she\'s also stuck to some shit in her past. And, to make everything even more of a mess, this crazy girl Haru shows up, and guess what: she has been in love with our MC since when she first saw him, and she\'s not shy about that at all.So that\'s the plot: this guy who\'s basically a manchild decides to grow up, but quickly finds himself in a pretty complex emotional situation, this weird and unconfortable love triangle.And, of course, he handles everything like the adolescent that he still is: VERY, VERY POORLY. Although he\'s clearly not over Shinako (who\'s a pretty big mess just by herself), he also can\'t reject Haru. At first glance, because of her (borderline creepy) persistance. But as things progress we notice that he\'s also selfish and actually enjoys the attention.I really found the premise really interesting, and the ending was also pleasing. But, I had some problems with what\'s in between. The pacing is kind of slow, and although the premise is good, lack of depht and development on the supporting characters make the story feel way unrealistic and unrelatable.CHARACTERS: 6Rikuo for me is the best character of this series. Although he is a purposeless manchild in the begining, I feel like he gets some real development, starts facing his lazyness and searching for some real meaning in life.For some reason that I can\'t really comprehend, I feel like there was a general expectation that he\'d be a perfectly reasonable and mature guy from the get go. People seemed surprised to see him handle everything immaturely. But I think that\'s what the show\'s about. Showing how cringy, unbearable and destructive an immature grown up can be, to himself and to those around him. If you start paying attention, you\'ll be surprised at how many Rikuos are around you, or maybe you\'ll even find out that there\'s some of him still inside you. That deep part of you that is still childishly selfish and insecure...But finally, after a lot of try and error, he has some really deep and mature insights and ends up taking some actions wich finally resembles that of an adult.I really don\'t know how to feel about Shinako and all that delaing with her past thing. I mean, I don\'t want to be insensitive. Losing a childhood sweethart who was also pretty much family must be tough. But the author makes it feel so fresh, like she has just started trying to deal with it, you know? Maybe its me, but I couldn\'t really relate to that. I guess his younger brother always being around and also being blatantly obsessed with her doesn\'t help either. But man, its just a bit too much for me, idk.Same thing for Haru. Her unconditional love at first sight and her stalking habits are creepy, at best. But also, her persistent and strong personality is what keeps pushing Rikuo to confront his feelings toward Shinako, and sometimes even second guess them.I just feel like they could\'ve taken a more real and relatable approach towards our two female MC\'s, while still maintaining their role in pushing the plot and making our main guy grow some balls.CONCLUSION: 7Even with all those flaws, I really think Sing ""Yesterday"" for me still does a nice job overall in conveying their message and being enjoyable. Its a show about growing up, and learning about maturity and responsibility in relationships even amidst all the confusion and pressure of early adulthood. And things can go south really quick, speacially if you still have the mindset of a teenager.Although sometimes the characters sometimes seem generic and fail to connect with the viewer, the smart plotline played out by an atypical and flawed MC is enough to get you involved and to keep you interested for those 12 eps.Thank you for reading. them.

I mean, I don\'t want to be insensitive. Losing a childhood sweethart who was also pretty much family must be tough. But the author makes it feel so fresh, like she has just started trying to deal with it, you know? Maybe its me, but I couldn\'t really relate to that. I guess his younger brother always being around and also being blatantly obsessed with her doesn\'t help either. But man, its just a bit too much for me, idk.Same thing for Haru. Her unconditional love at first sight and her stalking habits are creepy, at best. But also, her persistent and strong personality is what keeps pushing Rikuo to confront his feelings toward Shinako, and sometimes even second guess them.I just feel like they could\'ve taken a more real and relatable approach towards our two female MC\'s, while still maintaining their role in pushing the plot and making our main guy grow some balls.CONCLUSION: 7Even with all those flaws, I really think Sing ""Yesterday"" for me still does a nice job overall in conveying their message and being enjoyable. Its a show about growing up, and learning about maturity and responsibility in relationships even amidst all the confusion and pressure of early adulthood. And things can go south really quick, speacially if you still have the mindset of a teenager.Although sometimes the characters sometimes seem generic and fail to connect with the viewer, the smart plotline played out by an atypical and flawed MC is enough to get you involved and to keep you interested for those 12 eps.Thank you for reading.', ""Honestly enjoyed it quite a bit, might be because Haru definitely hard carried the whole thing for me. Probably gave a higher overall score than I should have compared to other shows that I've given the same score, but Haru bias is going really strong. Pretty good if you like slow burn kind of stories like I do. A bit too many time skips where it wasn't made obvious made me have to rewatch some parts though so the show's flow definitely wasn't it's strong point I think. I really like how a lot of the characters' feelings were more so implied a lot through...body language than just spelling it out, especially in the final episode. Sound was just okay, nothing outstanding. The story and enjoyment you get out of it can be a little tough to get through at some points. Give it a shot if you have some time to kill, and if this seems like it's right up your alley. body language than just spelling it out, especially in the final episode.

The protagonist is a loser, no much more than this, he doesn\'t realize what he has, and what he deserves, but about the girl ... i\'ts, agh, repugnant, she is so confused and inmature, even if is not her intention, she play with the heart of the loser protagonist and other...boy.

Spoilers included, b/c honestly knowing how it ends is the only thing to keep you watching.The negative reviews aren't wrong, there are epic gaping flaws with this show; biggest in my opinion being pacing.  It either needed to be a 24 episode run or cut out a lot of fat from what's there.It ends the way you want it to, hero gets with best girl and all that. Problem is that the entire final arc of hero realizing...he's with the wrong girl and trying to win back best girl GETS NO SCREEN TIME.A full 1/3 or so of the entire narrative arc is compressed into the FINAL EPISODE.  It's an abysmal, embarrassing trainwreck.  It's like they were planning on 24 episodes but learned halfway through production there would only be 12.Anyways best girl carries the show and is the only reason to watch.Rival girl makes you angry, but that's what she's supposed to do.  Protagonist isn't terrible but ends up seeming like a bad person at the end, but I think that's mainly because of the massive amount of narrative missing.  If you imagine he spent much more time and effort trying to win back best girl, learning lessons about life and her background, the ending would feel justified.It's a pity, this could have been a romance classic.  Still recommend for love triangle fans. he's with the wrong girl and trying to win back best girl GETS NO SCREEN TIME.A full 1/3 or so of the entire narrative arc is compressed into the FINAL EPISODE.

They are typically slower paced, but I appreciate the subtlety of the characters, themes, and interactions. I liked the honesty with which they dealt with the themes of moving...on, unrequited love, and grief.For long stretches it felt like nothing was happening, but these characters were growing, learning, and trying to put one foot in front of the other and this was impressive.

With the hook of a college graduate struggling to make it through post-grad job hunting, finding his own passion, and finding love, I had high hopes.  I also love the aesthetic.  The art style is great and the music can get me emotional all by itself.  If I just listened to the music and watched clips of the anime w/o subs (I don't speak Japanese), that would've literally been a better experience than watching it for the plot.The plot is trash.  You have adults unwilling to make meaningful romantic...decisions for themselves despite being constantly told they're doing everything wrong, you have little brother/student figures going after older sister/teacher figures and practically WINNING, which feels super out of place in what originally seemed like an anime grounded in real life as opposed to anime memes (think, Domestic na Kanojo lmao), and you have one of the worst and contrived pay-offs you can ask for by the end.

It's different from ordinary romance animes, as it doesn't have fanservice and many tropes. The reason why this anime is so good is the intricate story and deep characters, which is what you should expect from a seinen.The anime is about this guy, Rikuo who is stuck in life and is still in love with his friend from college, Shinako. Meanwhile, there's this new girl, Haru, who is in love with him. The story focuses on the relationship of those 3 characters, where Shinako denotes Rikuo's past and being stuck,...while Haru denotes the future and moving on, as well as other characters who get entangled in the love polygon throughout the anime.The four main characters are well-written. Each one of them has their own struggles and complex personalities. It feels like each of them has their own stories, instead of just being tools for the protagonist. Rikuo is the main character, who can't move on with his life and is stuck in the past. He is a simple person with mundane problems, to whom many people will relate. Since it's so common to be indecisive and uncertain during this period in life. So, the anime tackles a relatable topic in this regard. Haru is a cheerful girl who loves rikuo. She is a lovable and endearing character, and the main reason why many people like the anime. Every scene with her brights the mood of the anime, so it's easy to like her. She is more straightforward and bold, contrasting with the other adult characters. The fact she is so pushy and persistent is essential in helping Rikuo's growth.Shinako is the girl who Rikuo has always been in love with and it's easy to understand why from the first the very first scene with her, since she is such a charming girl. She is indecisive about keeping him as a friend or dating him, and even though many people dislike her for that, I think her indecisiveness is understandable. She knows she has to move on with her life and get over her lover's death, but still, she doesn't feel the same thing for Rikuo that she felt with her deceased lover, as it's evinced in one of the extra episodes. Shinako is the best girl in the anime. Her tender personality along with her maturity are what makes her such a lovable character, she is the kind of girl anyone would want as a wife. The fact she was indecisive is not a bad thing for me, as it shows she kept loyal to her feelings for her first love, it's commendable. And finally, Rou, easily the worst character in the anime. It's a good thing he just disappears for some episodes, despite being portrayed as one of the protagonists along with the other 3. It's absurd the fact he wants to force Shinako to forget about his brother, and not only that but dating him. I just can't get my head around this no matter what, and the fact he is so pushy and aggressive just makes it worse. This character is irredeemable.This anime has a very distinguishable art. It looks pretty simple at first with simplistic characters' design but the animation was astounding, especially the backgrounds that were really detailed, creating some beautiful scenes. Even though there's no opening , the ending themes make up for it. All the 3 ending songs are amazing, and are songs that you keep listening to after you finish the anime. Even though all the seiyuus were great, Hanazawa Kana voicing Shinako was remarkable, and definitely one of the reasons this character was so endearing.This is a mature slow burn romance with great production value. There are a couple of caveats I can point out that prevent it from being perfect, but it doesn't really hinder the enjoyment. while Haru denotes the future and moving on, as well as other characters who get entangled in the love polygon throughout the anime.The four main characters are well-written.

The music just right. Very minimal but comes on in scenes that require emphasis.As for the art, the semi old school style fits well with how average the characters are.The one thing that infuriated me in this series is that it seems to be targeted to teenagers but has adult characters. Their behaviors were childish in terms of not...being able to deal with their confusion and indecisiveness.They purposefully made the 4 main characters dumb as fuck to make their boring lives more turbulent.The reason why I said it's not a good example of how adults should act is because teenagers shouldn't learn how to lead people on. If you're confused with your feelings towards a person, do not make them wait if they said they'd wait, force them to quit because you have to deal with your own issues yourself and not let others fix it for you.For Shinako, she's made Yu her whole world and never developed a personality of her own that's why she's at a loss for more than 6 freaking years after he died. People should be saving up for themselves and not giving everything they got for one person. Super indecisive and insensitive to other's feelings. Such pick me energy.For Rikuo, he's trash. Can't make up his mind and is too nice to turn Nonako down.

At 18, you think you know what you want but there are other things in life that can still be explored. They seem to not get hints that they're being rejected. I know for Shinako that Rikuo doesn't openly say to stop pursuing him but she's just so persistent and blind to hints that girl, he don't want you + she borderline stalked him after just one interaction.

People saying I\'d fall in love at first sight and notice every hint she drops... fine, think what you want, maybe I\'d fall in love at first sight too, but I sure wouldn\'t pick up many hints or cues, which IMO is true for a lot of people. But personally I fell for Haru after a few episodes and after seeing her adorable interactions with the whole cast she interacts with.The anime is good, you just can\'t look through the lenses that you use for the classic cutesy sparkle romance anime, like Dress up darling, where we watch every single episode where Marin fanboys over Gojo, or Gojo accidentally makes her blush by saying something etc. picking up cues that Haru is leaving him, which even the characters in the anime tell him, but he writes it off as nothing as he is lost in his own thoughts after the denial of his crush and the depression of working only part time to survive.

Zettai Shounen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/308/Zettai_Shounen,"[""I don't write reviews, but this show only has one short review so I feel inclined to do my part.Zettai Shonen is an anime that stays away from a lot of the normal  conventions found in anime with the label of supernatural. The pace is much slower and more heavily focuses on the characters than the supernatural event itself.Ultimately I would say that the focus is on how each character internalizes and acts on the odd things that are going on around them.The story is broken down into two arcs. The first arc is the summer arc and the main character is a...middle school boy named Aizawa Ayumu who is visiting the tiny town of Tana for the summer. The second arc called the winter arc,takes place in Yokohama and the story shifts ahead a year and a half. Also a new main character is introduced, Tanigawa Kisa. A girl who is considered an outsider among her peers. In both halves of the show, weird creatures have begun to show up and cause confusion and mild chaos.STORY: 8This story is heavily driven by character development, however the plot is there pushing the character's in a general direction. If you're looking for a story that delves deeply into the occult or the science of aliens than this is not the series for you. All of the supernatural events are shrouded in mystery and give off a feeling of long ago fairytale or folklore. Nothing is ever concretely explained what you are handed by the director is all that you will get.The story moves slowly and things take awhile to develop. It doesn't necessarily take long for weird events to start occurring in the show, it's just that the development and progression of these events is not rushed. To find enjoyment in this show you have to like these characters, because outside of the characters there isn't much else for the viewer to grip onto. The upside is their are plenty of characters all of them vastly different from each other and playing out a different roll in the show.It's not the most complicated or quickly paced story I've ever experienced, but if you give it enough time it grips you. With time you'll find yourself caring more for what is happening around the awesome cast, the story amps up the supernatural eventually until the plot seems nearly as important as the turmoil that the characters are facing.CHARACTER: 9The characters are the driving force of the show they are the breath by which this show breathes. Yes this is a story about odd occurences, but the important part of Zettai Shonen  is how the individual characters react  and change in concurrence with the strange things happening around them.The characters in this show are strong and dynamic, they all change and grow and learn. The development of the individuals in this show feels more slice of life than anything. In fact it wouldn't be ridiculous to call this show a slice of life with a little mystery and supernatural events thrown in. There are many different people in both arcs and none of them completely abide by the typical anime stereotypes. The characters are the heart of this anime and where this story shines. You can see the motives and reasons for all of the characters actions, they don't do unnecessary things, and they react as you would expect normal people too.I found myself falling in-love with many of the characters, especially with the residents of Tana, like Miyama Miku and Unno Shione. They were interesting and dynamic, so even as the plot dragged by slowly I could count on the interactions between the characters to keep me interested.This is the show's strongest aspect by far, at least in the summer arc. In the winter arc I found that I was slightly more drawn to the supernatural events occurring around the cast.ART: 7The art style isn't exactly typical, but it isn't radical either. The way the characters are drawn is hard to put into words exactly, but it's very child like even kiddy, however I thought the style suited the show. The background scenes were nice, but didn't dwarf the characters or whatever events were occurring in the story. My only complaint is the CGI used for the creatures, it stuck out a lot in certain scenes where it was used. It could possibly have been done on purpose to highlight the other worldliness of the creatures that disrupt the town of Tana and Yokohama, but for me I would be engrossed in some scene when suddenly I'm pulled from the moment by a very harsh CGI image thrown into the mix. With time though it grew on me.SOUND: 7The music used for this show was appropriate, I really like the ending theme song too. They had this one repeating chorus that they used throughout the show, it helped build up a sense of familiarity and was usually placed in situations that were similar to each other or reminiscent to something else that had happened. As if the music is helping connect all the interrelated dots. The reused chorus is really light and unobtrusive so it doesn't get annoying after repeated use. At times I didn't even realize it was playing till it ended.The music isn't epic, but then again neither is the show however it worked perfectly and never took away from the rest of the anime.ENJOYMENT: 9I enjoyed this show immensely by the time I finished it. However when I started I was only mildly interested, I had to keep going despite the slow pace, and eventually the characters caught my interest, and shortly afterward the plot did too. I loved the slow and dreamy pace and the overall lack of urgency despite the events that were occurring. It vaguely gives me the same feeling that Natsume Yuujinchou gives me, except it's not as melancholy and doesn't emphasize nature or the elements.OVERALL: 8I give this show a solid eight, I really liked it from top to bottom, the art style is a little young-looking, if I can describe it as such. At first glance it doesn't look like much, but it really delivers if you're willing to give it a real chance.You have to be willing to sit down and watch three or four episodes before you can even begin to understand or appreciate this anime. It's not a show for those looking for action or even romance. Really I want to compare it to Haibane Renmei, in that there is a story, but the nitty gritty of the story isn't the most important aspect.If you have time on your hands and want something that is very character driven almost slice of life like, but with a little more flesh, then Zettai Shonen is a great anime to pick up. middle school boy named Aizawa Ayumu who is visiting the tiny town of Tana for the summer.

Zettai Shonen is in my opinion a masterpiece of storytelling and is my favorite anime/tv show of all time.The guidelines say not to summarize, but I\'ll give my take in this paragraph if anyone is interested: The story is split into two halves. The first deals with a city boy spending a summer in a small, somewhat boring town, quiet but for the constant, tremulous calls of cicadas, but the summer becomes more interesting when supernatural occurrences begin to take place. In the second half,...we are taken to a city in the winter to follow a reclusive girl who has stopped going to school, whose life also changes due to similar supernatural events. The two arcs are related but loosely.The story is not ambitious or complex, and it is actually this simplicity that lends it such strength. The conflicts are small, perhaps even microscopic; but in the attention to minutiae I perceive such a deep love for the characters that I\'ve rarely if ever seen matched in another visual storytelling work of art. I actually do not like supernatural events in animes I watch and prefer slice-of-life; however, the supernatural blends so well with the day-to-day that it doesn\'t feel like a gimmick or a ploy to keep you interested. Instead, the characters interact authentically with these happenings in a way that deepens your perception of them, rather than distracting you from them for the sake of a showy plot.The story-telling is slow. Don\'t watch if you are looking for revelatory twists, sabotage, or some slow build-up leading to a fantastic climax where all the questions are answered. The twists are more ""hmm"" than ""aha!"", there are no grand schemes, and the climaxes come, but again, they are focused more on the characters than on the universal ramifications. We\'re not here to scientifically chart out something new but to just spend some time with some individuals.With that said, I will state that the characters are somehow a bit simple in their depth. They are SO un-distracted in pursuing their personal truths that they don\'t seem like people you would actually run into on the street. Watching I felt almost as if I was getting to see humans who were more human than actual humans, due to the busy chaos of how life goes. But that\'s more of a pleasure than a complaint.The art and sound are somewhat marked by the time the anime was made, though I personally like it that way. They seem old-fashioned but still beautiful. Even though the rural setting of the first arc is more naturally arresting in my opinion than the city setting, the team has a way of making even the crowded metropolis seem humanized and rightful in its existence.I feel there really isn\'t a drop of hate, fear, or outlandishness in this anime. I suppose the closest it comes to outlandish are the supernatural child characters, which I forgive them for. As for hatred, the characters can be quite cruel--don\'t get me wrong. But it is the patience the anime has for these characters, somehow even supporting these cruelties, and its inclusiveness of them as a part of life, that make me feel as though the anime reveres the human experience like no other I\'ve seen.I\'m sure I haven\'t done the anime justice, or perhaps I\'ve soured its qualities by speaking too highly of them. If I\'ve exaggerated what it is, that\'s my mistake. But I truly believe it is an anime worth watching--certainly not for everyone, but perhaps for some, even worth watching again and again. If you are in the market for a slow-paced anime to chill you out or perhaps get you to think about things you don\'t always have time to think about, I recommend Zettai Shonen. In its embrace of the mundane, it is a character-driven powerhouse. we are taken to a city in the winter to follow a reclusive girl who has stopped going to school, whose life also changes due to similar supernatural events.

In its embrace of the mundane, it is a character-driven powerhouse.', 'Once in a while, we see Slice of Life shows that are incredibly slow paced and are heavily atmospheric. These shows have a pretty static setting and allow you to dive into their world. I like to call these shows Slice of Nothing shows, simply because there\'s not a lot happening that actually contributes to the plot\'s development. Zettai Shonen is a slice of nothing show that slipped under the radar when it aired and never really saw the light of day. Which is a shame really, because it was a breath of fresh air and off the beaten track.Zettai Shonen is an anime...about Ayumu, a guy who moves to his Dad\'s (yes, the mythical species known as normal fathers exist in this anime) house in Tana. He spends his days exploring the countryside and meeting the local residents. However, he soon realizes that things aren\'t quite as normal as they seem. Mysterious objects that look like tiny UFOs start to appear all over the place and seem to have a special affinity for Ayumu. There is also a second arc, which focuses on another protagonist, this time a girl called Kisa. She too attracts these UFOs. Slowly, the two teenagers start to wonder what these things are and why they\'re attracted ti them. All they know is that it has something to do with their dark and murky past.First and foremost, I have to warn you. This anime is slow. Incredibly slow. Its buildup is even slower than Goku charging a Spirit Bomb...and trust me, that is slow. There\'s almost no action and hardly any movement. Generally, it may be a bad thing in case of other anime, but it works out really well in the case of Zettai Shonen. The plot isn\'t really moving forward, but the atmosphere feels so...atmospheric! It just has these melancholic undertones with an air of mystery around - an experience not too unlike Haibane Renmei or Ghost Hound. It\'s one of the most unique features of the anime.And I say most because this anime stands out from the rest for many of the quirky little things it does. Let\'s start with the realistic and down-to-earth characters.Despite what the title of the anime says, this anime isn\'t really much of a shonen. The guy doesn\'t have any superpowers, the women don\'t give him any (neither are they cliched tsunderes) and the side characters don\'t fit into any particular TVTrope either. The supporting cast is bland, but hey, rather bland than annoying (read: Any random Hana Kanazawa character), right?Ayumu, the main character of the first arc isn\'t really the most charismatic or lively guy you\'re going to see. To be frank, he has the emotional range of a tea-spoon. But again, he fits well into the Zettai Shonen niche of being a low key and mellow anime. Kisa is a pleasantly creepy girl whose anti-social side has gotten the better of her. And no, she is not his childhood friend. Her character is something like a mix of Yuki Nagato (of Haruhi Suzumiya franchise) and Moeka (of Stein;s Gate). The thing is, all these characters have this rustic charm to them and seem to grow on you.One of the things I really liked was how the interactions between the characters shaped the story moving forward. The conversations were normal and weren\'t blown up or exaggerated. For example, most anime contain this scene where the protagonist is talking intimately with the female lead and suddenly an adult walks in and they jump, scream and fumble all about ""I-It\'s all a misunderstanding!"". See how neatly Zettai Shonen does it (video at 4:20).The animation too, is funky. It\'s drawn like a childish cartoon, with very little detailing. You\'ll also notice immediately the heavy usage of still frames. They\'re gonna have one picture and move slowly across it and probably repeat the footage in another episode as well. The studio probably knew this anime wasn\'t gonna sell a lot of DVDs...and they were right. This anime comes from Genco, the studio that\'s produced some of the best Slice of Life anime in the past decade such as Nodame Cantable, Kino\'s Journey and Honey & Clover.Zettai Shonen is a mystery and supernatural blend that works out really well. The two arcs come together nicely and while the show doesn\'t really explain much, it hardly matters, because it\'s a case where the journey matters more than the destination. Although I described this anime as a Slice of Nothing anime, it\'s not that there\'s completely nothing in terms of plot, it\'s just that there\'s relatively less action even by a SoL anime\'s standards.Overall, this is an anime you have to be patient with. And if you are, it rewards with you some of the most gripping story telling you\'ll ever see. If you\'re looking for an anime that\'s off the beaten track with a really spellbinding atmosphere, then this show\'s the real deal. It\'s calm, yet compelling. A definite recommendation for fans of Haibane Renmei, Dennou Coil and Ghost Hound. about Ayumu, a guy who moves to his Dad\'s (yes, the mythical species known as normal fathers exist in this anime) house in Tana.

Otherwise if you pick this title with the same level of expectation you would have for your favorite anime then you might be in for a let-down. Still, it's pretty far from what I would call un-watchable or a “bad anime.” Zettai Shonen is a quirky, slow-paced, sci-fi/fantasy anime series that's a little bit off the beaten path. If you are in the mood for something quirky and different then pick this show,...if not then stick to safer territory and the titles you normally like.Simplistic, Children-style art. It has a very Pokemon/Digimon look except the color palette is different and a bit more sophisticated...tho, not much. Most children's shows tend to use overly bright, explosive colors which can be a bit distracting so I can understand the choice of colors! Still, Zettai Shonen does very much has a very simple aesthetic appearance overall, everything had a very bold outline and there was not a lot of detail is given to any particular object except the “Material Fairies” and “Material Evils” which have a lot of little lights and such. The art isn't cheap-looking or anything and it's not like it's an older anime series or that they didn't have any money. I have a feeling this was a deliberately chosen style which does work for this show.Both the OP and ED music were good, the ED might have been a little better since it was just as unusual as the series. I watched this show in the original Japanese since it was a fansub version...I don't think I would have watched this show in English though because it has to do with Japanese superstitions and such. And I've started to discover that a lot of the shows that deal with superstition and cultural folklore are better off in their original languages, This show is no different. Also the voice acting was great just as it is in the original Japanese language, if this was dubbed in English I think that they might have ruined it with voices that are too high pitched and overly emotional. Zettai Shonen isn't supposed to be like that.This is a very slow-paced story that doesn't ever fully unfold.....ever. Do not look for extreme action, do not look for overt explanations and plot lines, do not look for logical conclusions. I don't think Zettai Shonen intended to define whether it's all about aliens, monsters, fairies or spirits so there was not special focus on any of that, it's more about the human interaction between the characters and also how they each reacted to as well as interpreted the increasingly recurring phenomena.My favorite character would be the main guy name Ayumu, a soft-spoken, introspective sort of fellow.  He doesn't really like a lot of attention or drama and often prefers to be by himself [very much like me in that way.] Although he's not the first character to witness the weird occurrences in the rural Japanese town when he visits his father, he's the only one that pursues the investigation with a reserved, self-reliance that does not bring any undue attention to himself. I love Wakkun because of his voice, Sakakura I love because he has very intense eyes and he may be a beefy jock-type but he's very perceptive and devoted. Lastly I love Kisa, the girl in the 2nd half of the series that loves reptiles. She is like Ayumu in that she is also a loner, though I guess the correct term for her would be outcast, she also doesn't have the same kind of quiet strength that Ayumu has. She is rather fragile, but not as fragile as people think.Overall not a bad show. Again, I would recommend this only as a break from the norm. This series is like reading a book, there's a lot of attention to detail for things other shows would have found inconsequential. But the things that you want pointed out to you or the things that require a more detailed explanation are only mildly inferred or subtly defined so therefore, you are more or less left to draw your own conclusions. if not then stick to safer territory and the titles you normally like.Simplistic, Children-style art. It has a very Pokemon/Digimon look except the color palette is different and a bit more sophisticated...tho, not much. Most children's shows tend to use overly bright, explosive colors which can be a bit distracting so I can understand the choice of colors! Still, Zettai Shonen does very much has a very simple aesthetic appearance overall, everything had a very bold outline and there was not a lot of detail is given to any particular object except the “Material Fairies” and “Material Evils” which have a lot of little lights and such. The art isn't cheap-looking or anything and it's not like it's an older anime series or that they didn't have any money. I have a feeling this was a deliberately chosen style which does work for this show.Both the OP and ED music were good, the ED might have been a little better since it was just as unusual as the series.

This is a surreal show, not in the sense that it is dreamlike, but because it portrays a humanity not confined by the limits of our reality. The characters and dialogue are reminiscent of Dostoevsky’s writing, they are not life-like, but they feel much realer than anything. There is a large variety in the cast, but all of the characters are memorable. Some have a large influence in the story, and others whose arcs are more self-contained. But all of them contribute to the overall atmosphere created by the story, an atmosphere of loneliness.This is a show about communication and isolation,...which is why cell phones take such a prominent symbolic role in the story. Following in the footsteps of Evangelion, the major conflicts in this show derive from the characters’ failure to express themselves and to understand each other. Characters attempt to find themselves, some purpose, or some truth in the world.As a contemplative show, it is slowly paced with most of the time characters talking and plenty of atmospheric shots. The character interactions are a highlight, dialogue is engaging and fun which makes the slow pace enjoyable. At times the show gives a relaxed comfort, like the comfort found in being alone, and at others it transfers the warmth of companionship.With the other driving force of conflict in the show being characters’ search for truth and understanding surrounding the central mystery, this is quite the epistemological anime as the show questions reality, truth, and our understanding of it. With Kazunori Itō of Production I.G fame (Patlabor, Ghost in the Shell) at the head of its writing, it is no surprise that the show breaks out the philosophy textbook and gives an intriguing mystery with lots to digest.Another recognizable name, Tobe Sunaho the character designer for Humanity has Declined, has her only other anime work here. Her art style is distinct and gives a unique character to the show. The backgrounds and overall style are pretty. While the directing is competent and gives some interesting shots at times.There seems to be somewhat of a consensus towards the second half of the show’s story that it is non-sequitur and of lower quality to the first. While there is a large shift in the literal textual events, the story is a clear continuation and follows similar ideas introduced in the first half. The second half is different but is just as great as it introduces new characters with new problems and advances the story.

Agatha Christie no Meitantei Poirot to Marple,https://myanimelist.net/anime/244/Agatha_Christie_no_Meitantei_Poirot_to_Marple,"[""In 1841, when Edgar Allen Poe wrote “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” and introduced readers to the detective C. Auguste Dupin he helped create a genre of fiction that has endured and thrived in the decades since, and I’m glad he did.  I do love detective stories.  It’s the reason I watch Law & Order reruns every night as well as being part of the reason I’ve watched over 200 episodes of Detective Conan to date.  The thrill of the hunt for the killer, the match of wits and intellect between detective, murderer, and perhaps even reader are hallmarks of a...good detective story.  Among my favorite writers in the genre is Agatha Christie and consequently one of my favorite detectives is her charming Belgian dandy Hercule Poirot.  Having read Poirot novels and seen the superb Granada television series starring David Suchet it was only a matter of time before I dove into the Poirot anime.  Indeed, I did just that this past autumn with mixed results.Before any conclusions can be reached it is best to always lay the facts out in front of us as they are.  Agatha Christie no Meitante Poirot to Marple is a thirty-nine episode long television series that adapts various novels and short stories featuring Christie’s detectives Hercule Poirot and Jane Marple.  Some mysteries are solved in the space of a single episode while others take significantly longer with novel adaptations usually running for four episodes at the most.  It sounds like a good setup and could potentially work very well but problems arise at the start of the very first episode where it is revealed that while the names Poirot and Marple are prominently featured in the title and while both detectives are characterized fairly well this isn’t really their story.  No, this is the story of young Mabel West and her pet duck Oliver as they (yes they) learn about detective work from these two thoroughly qualified mentors.Mabel desires independence, to find her own path in life free from her father’s overbearing influence and expectations, a desire that eventually leads her to seek a position as an assistant to Poirot.  That’s all well and good I suppose but the problem is that her father’s supposed controlling nature is never properly established.  The height of his onscreen tyranny is when he quite understandably chastises Mabel for bringing her pet duck into a crowded ballroom in the first episode.  Beyond that there is the point that he insists on her going to a supposedly unpleasant boarding school, a potentially good line to follow up on.  The creators would have done well to open the story at the boarding school, showing the viewer what a stultifying environment it really is in order to make Mabel’s perspective more readily understandable.  Unfortunately they don’t and the only reason Mr. West is overbearing is because Mabel says he is.However, while Mabel is indeed a poor character I can’t entirely dismiss her.  While she is an obvious ploy by the creators to draw in a younger audience through the experiences of a similarly aged original character she spends most of her time in the background, never becoming intrusive and getting in the way of the story.  Indeed, the most valueable role Mabel plays is that of a plot device to connect the worlds of Poirot and Marple.  In the end the worst the creators have done by introducing the Mabel character is merely to take the Watson role of Captain Hastings and divide it up between two characters.No, the worst transgression that the creators of this television program committed is related to another character entirely.  This is a character so utterly useless in the context of a murder/mystery program, so cynically placed that the sheer gall of the creators is mind-boggling.  I am of course talking about Mabel’s damned pet duck Oliver, a pseudo-anthropomorphized little yellow duck who looks, for all intents and purposes, like he wandered into the murder/mystery show out of a Walt Disney film.  Oliver’s sole function, his singular purpose in being inserted into the world of Agatha Christie is to be a cute little duck that the viewers can look at and marvel at how cute he is to the point that he actually gets in the way.  There are moments where the mystery that the show is supposed to be about is shelved so Oliver can pop out of the wicker basket Mabel carries him around in like an all too cute jack-in-the-box so he can sit in the lap of and be fawned over by whichever character happens to be around at the time.  The height of his hideousness comes when during one particular case Oliver actually finds the murder weapon, receives credit for it, and tears off the murderer's disguise.  It all gives the impression of a production process where the creators had their priorities terribly confused.On the story front the best I can say is that the adaptations of Christie found in Poirot to Marple are adequate and that’s all.  While various blunders hinder the production (among them a rather pointless escape from a French port under gunfire) and a good deal of the mystery has been drained out of these mysteries the essential quality of Christie’s writing does manage to somehow work its way through in the end making these acceptable but nonetheless flawed adaptations.  The animation is similarly adequate but a good deal more bland.  Character designs are as generic as they come with a minimum of detail accompanied by a flat color scheme all around.  The only area where Poirot to Marple truly succeeds is in its soundtrack which can be often quite effective.However, despite a well utilized soundtrack I can only recommend this show as a potential child’s diversion (in which case it has the unfortunate potential to ruin the experience of Christie for future readers) or as a curious oddity for Christie fans as it was for me.  If you’ve already seen the Granada Poirot television series, or better still actually read Christie yourself, rest assured you’ve already had the superior experience as both are far superior in terms of characterization, wit, suspense, and most importantly mystery. good detective story.

Truth smiles upon me!""I feel it very necessary to say, I have not yet read anything written by Agatha Christie. I have no doubt that the original books were superior to this adaptation, and I can tell just from watching the show that the stories had an excellent source material. The main question for Christie fans will probably be, ""How much adaptation decay is there?"" I cannot answer this, only talk about how I felt as someone who was experiencing everything in this show as fresh and new.In part to provide a common link between Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot, the...lead detectives of our story, and also in part to give children a character with which to relate, we are introduced to Maybelle West, a 16-year old girl who is learning how to become a detective. Maybelle also comes along with the unfortunate companion of Oliver the duckling. Maybelle, when she\'s not being a horrible brat to her father, is mostly smiling and friendly and vapid. Fortunately, she doesn\'t intrude on the established stories very much. She assists Poirot and Marple, but I often times forget she is there. Oliver is harder to ignore, because when he pops his head out of his basket, the camera is squarely on him until he disappears. Oliver gets far too much screentime for a creature with zero purpose other than to be adorable.If like me you haven\'t read these stories before, don\'t think you won\'t be fooled just because this is a ""kid\'s show."" Yes, sometimes they add in extra clues, but for the most part these are riddles that will challenge an adult mind. Sometimes I correctly guessed a culprit and reasoned through it, and sometimes I didn\'t. That\'s probably the genius of Agatha Christie shining through.At the heart and despite all the trimmings, this show is classic ""whodunnit,"" with an ample side dish of ""howdunnit."" Marple and Poirot are both the kind of people who prefer to solve a crime with deduction than following breadcrumbs. So, instead of a crime story where breaks and new leads in the case are handed to us, we as viewers have to slowly gather facts and read suspects. There is almost zero action in this show, and that is just fine, because it kept my brain chugging along. The suspense is good enough to cut with a knife.While the animation screams ""low budget,"" it doesn\'t really hamper the show as there\'s no action to be animated anyway. A positive and surprising tip of the hat should go to the soundtrack, which I felt heightened the show quite a bit, including the OP. It\'s more than I would have expected for a show of this type.Despite the simplicity of all the main characters, Marple and Poirot included, and the younger audience wrapping, there is a distinct satisfaction that I got from watching this show and trying to figure out how the bad guy did it, whether I\'m right or wrong. Some of the cases are brilliant, and it\'s easier to watch four episodes than it is to read a novel (if you\'re the lazy type). You do not need a background of reading Christie stories to appreciate the mystery. The show actually has made me want to go to the bookstore and check out some of Agatha Christie\'s other work. So while certainly not perfect in translation, the core of this anime was solid enough for a fully grown adult like myself to enjoy watching it. lead detectives of our story, and also in part to give children a character with which to relate, we are introduced to Maybelle West, a 16-year old girl who is learning how to become a detective.

However, it is also a kids show. The connecting and central character of this show, Maybelle West, is a young wannabe sleuth who, along with her pet duck Oliver, go around assisting the two titular detectives in solving their mysteries.The show\'s strong points are also where they lucked out, Agatha Christie\'s mysteries and characters are just as enjoyable in Anime form as anywhere else. Poirot is the eccentric dandy who relies upon...""the little grey cells"" to solve his cases while the down to earth Ms. Marple is the country woman who uses ""human nature"" to resolve the mysteries that come her way. Each are a little reigned in, but nevertheless still very accurate versions of their book selves. Same for the plots, each a little simplified but still get to the core of the piece they\'re adapting.The art is bright, simple, and colorful. Keeps things cheerful while everyone in the room is looking at a dead body. Y\'know, for the kids? Also, the voice acting is terrific. As a big Hercule Poirot fan, I especially enjoyed the performance by Kōtarō Satomi as the Belgian super sleuth. He fits the character very well. Kaoru Yachigusa as Miss Marple does equally well and together really are the anchors of the show (as they should be) No English dub available, but it would be hard to compete with the performances of David Suchet and the late Joan Hickson, who owned the roles in their respected, live-action, adaptations.A series like this tough to rate. The watered down nature of the show is to make it as kid friendly as possible, but the purist in me wanted something a bit more mature and accurate. But, I liked it nonetheless. It doesn\'t cover every one of Poirot and Marple\'s works, that would be very difficult given some of the subject matter and the target audience, but that also gives viewers something to seek out on their own and start reading. You get so many Anime shows as bait to read the Manga, (there is one for this show, btw.) here is one that might inspire kids to pick up a classic book. And that\'s admirable. It\'s like mystery candy. Marketed to kids, but still just as enjoyable for grown-ups. Cheers!

Battle Athletess Daiundoukai (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/1186/Battle_Athletess_Daiundoukai_TV,"['Good title about sport and desire to win. Anime begins quite skin-deep, but after 4 episodes it gathers momentum developing characters, showing their motivations and fears as well as the skeletons in the clothets.What is this anime about?Anime turns from light comedy into quite serious spokon with drama about girls who try to overdo their own abilities, with blood, jealousy, broken bones and rivalry until the end. Sometimes serious scenes are mixed with slice of lifecomedy parts.Anime pays particular attention to such kinds of sport as running and swimming, and also pole vaulting, tennis, air hockey and so on.Also near to the end you...will be surprised by some entertaining  plot twist.PlotMankind was nearly destroyed 3000 years ago, but then  Earth was recovered and humanity colonized Solar system. Sport became important part of people`s everyday life. Sport academies were founded on each planet to find the best athletes  to attend  the University Satellite.There the best sport girls can  take part in The Big Competition to become a Cosmo Beauty - the best athlet in the universe. Why only girls can attend this university you will find out when that plot twist happen.CharactersMain heroine is cute and gentle Akari Kanzaki. Her mother was the legendary Cosmo Beauty who set lots of records.

It later turned into a longer television series both with the same basic story. I'll be looking at the longer series from AIC, the eclectic studio with works ranging pretty widely in quality with Oreimo on the low end and Sasameki Koto on the high end. My biggest concern is simply that it's a sport anime and most sport anime are as dull and monotonous as the games they're based on. But who knows, maybe this is one...of those rare exceptions that  does something unique and/or has really compelling characters. Or it could be your typical story of a group of one-dimensional underdogs pulling together and managing to grasp victory. Let's take a look and find out.Our story opens in a training ground in Antarctica where a bunch of young female athletes are racing across an obstacle course while dragging giant steamrollers. It urns out that after an event that wiped out most of humanity, humans rebuilt and set up training schools to try and get the top athletes. The best students go to a satellite University to compete for the coveted “Cosmo Beauty” title. What I like about this series is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It uses all the regular elements of a sport anime, but it uses them in a tongue in cheek way, mixes in sci-fi elements and just plays up their absurdity in general. So, while it is predictable, the comedic elements  keep the viewer invested and keep the action interesting. That being said, the series has its problems too. The biggest being that it's pretty racist. For most of the athletes, the series will give some specific country or place of origin: China, Osaka, Russia, the United States, a specific encampment on the moon and so on. There's one character, however, whose area of origin is a continent. Her name is Tanya and her area of origin is “Africa.” Not like that's a huge continent or anything. To make it worse, she's a very... “primitive,” is unfortunately the most apt term, character. She's superstitious, she runs on all fours, she's simple minded to an absurd degree, she even howls at one point. Who knows, maybe the nations of Africa were too busy making artistic and scientific advancements, but they didn't want to offend the rest of the world so they found the dumbest, but most athletic girl they could, made up a bunch of superstitions to teach her and sent her on her way. They bet on the rest of the world being too clueless to notice that Africa has multiple countries. Another issue is that the het romance, although there's very little of it, is really creepy and involves major age and power imbalances. On the positive side, the yuri romance, which there's a lot more of, is pretty cute and well handled. Was Hideyuki trying to actively encourage lesbianism or did he just figure people would accept the het regardless of how screwed up it was and, consequently, he didn't bother trying to make it good? The world may never know but this is the writer behind Read or Die, so the former seems likely.The major characters are, for the most part, decently fleshed out and developed. The major exception being the aforementioned racist stereotype. One nice little touch is that Akari's development arc is pretty realistic. She goes through both good and difficult times with certain elements becoming prominent based on which end of the spectrum she's on. Each cycle she goes through becomes demonstrative of her growth. She becomes better at handling both extremes with maturity and grace as things progress. I also really liked Akari's love interest, Kris. She's just amazing.The art is nothing special. It's pretty standard late 90s fare. About the most visually interesting it gets is towards the end when certain elements are introduced that I can't really go into without giving spoilers. That being said, it is competent artwork.The voice acting in this is really good. You have some really great actresses like Hisakawa Aya, Kawakami Tomoko and Itou Miki being among the biggest names. The music is pretty nice as well.The ho-yay factor is a 6/10. Primarily because of Akari and Kris. Although Akari and Ichino have their moments as well. There's also the dynamic between Lahrii and Mylandah.And that's Battle Athletes. To be honest, I rather liked it, in spite of its racism. It's a fun series with some good characters, and one really bad one. The jokes are usually very effective, Akari and Kris have a lot of cute moments and it is an entertaining watch, if you can ignore or forgive its issues. Final rating: 7/10.

Next week I'll look at Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge."", ""The year is 4999 AD.  A very long time ago, the planet was knocked off of it’s axis by a devastating event that left mankind teetering on the brink of extinction, and the full nature of which has been lost to history.  In their efforts to rebuild society from the ground up, mankind has decided to abandon war and instead settle their differences through athletic competition.  This may sound like the Olympics to you, but the nature of their Great Competition is almost nothing like the gladiatorial events that we know today.  For just over 1000 years, young women from all...over the world have been flocking to a special school in Antarctica, to train and compete against each other, with the the top three students from each year being sent to the University Satellite!  But that’s not all, because over the millennia, mankind has finally expanded into outer space, and every single planet(including some of their moons) sending their own athletes to compete at the Satellite!  This intense, harrowing tournament will separate the tough from the timid, the hardcore from the soft, and the naturals from the dreamers as the best and the strongest athletes from the entire universe will battle it out for the title of Cosmo Beauty!One of these young hopefuls is Akari Kanzaki, who...  Let’s just face it, is completely hopeless.  She’s slow, fragile, and is just as clueless as to what she’s doing at the Antarctic training site as we are.  Being the daughter of Tomoe Midoh, the greatest Cosmo Beauty in the history of the Great competition, she has the genetic make-up that any other competitor would kill for, but her athletic abilities, and her attitude towards training, make her long-lasting lock on last place feel even more painful to watch.  While some of her fellow students may have a soft spot for the doe-eyed lump, others see her as an insult to everything they’ve dedicated their lives towards, and aren’t shy about letting her know it.  But could the apathetic Akari be more than meets the eye?  Could her exterior, which is about as threatening as a rag doll, be hiding an untapped well of talent that’s just begging to be discovered?  And even going beyond that, is there some darker truth hiding behind the Great competition itself?  As the competition heats up, and the champs rise above the chumps, the 1003’rd Cosmo Beauty may turn out to be the most important one of all.For Battle Athletes victory, we return to AIC, or Anime International company, only this time we’re looking at one of their earliest works, which came out in the late nineties.  The series will be 20 years old this October, and as such, it looks extremely dated.  This was a time when the moe style was nowhere to be seen, anime had to work harder to look good regardless of budget, and character designs ranged from cartoony to realistic, while rarely ever straying away from believable human anatomy.  Artwork was a lot less polished, and physiques were exaggerated a lot more than they are today.  For the time it came out in, Battle Athletes victory looks really good...  When it wants to.  The animation in this title is heavily inconsistent, and it works for the most part.  For athletic competitions that can’t be written off with cheap budget saving tricks(And a few of them definitely are), the animation can be straight up gorgeous.  I’ve heard it said that one of the most difficult things to animate is character’s legs when they’re walking and running, and yeah, I’ve seen enough failed attempts to understand this.A lot of work goes into the simple visual of feet hitting and pressing back off of the ground, which is why a lot of animation tends to focus on above the feet, if they’re not just resorting to bouncing the image of the character’s face.  In spite of this, I’m not exaggerating when I say that Battle Athletes Victory makes running animation look easy.  They can pull it off at any speed, from fast running that doesn’t give you time to analyze it, to slow-motion running that perfectly captures every single movement of the body to the point that I have to wonder just how much live action research they must have done beforehand.  A lot of money clearly got poured into these scenes, because most of the other sports featured in this show aren’t really as impressive.  That’s not to say they look bad, but there’s a lot of close-ups, a lot of short bursts of action, and occasionally even repeated animation cycles that are meant to give the illusion of physical activity, and thanks to some smart editing, it almost always works.  About half of the action in this series is running, of course, so it’s still an impressive looking series.Well, for the most part, at least.  The budget gets spread too thin at times, and when they run into trouble with it, the quality just abruptly tanks.  There are sequences, and a couple of entire episodes, that look less like a high budget show from the late nineties and more like a low budget show from the early nineties.  A lot of the material between competitions is just characters talking, interacting and having the camera freeze on them during internal monologues, and this does worlds of good for the budget, but at it’s worst, even scenes like those wind up looking like ass.  The character designs, while imaginative, don’t follow the most attractive color palette, making the artwork look kinda grungy at times, and since the characters are mostly designed to carry realistic human anatomy, there are only a few of them that can get away with deformed anime expressions...  Some of the more serious characters, such as Akari’s rival Jessie, just look terrifying when attempting to do the same.  The color saturation and use of lighting are beautiful, but there are too many instances where the artwork looks rough, and over-all unfinished.The music, while pretty repetitive, is unbelievable.  As with any good sports-related media, the story has a deeply emotional feel to it, and the music composed by Yoshikazu Suo was clearly designed to augment these emotions.  Some of the happier moments between competitions will be played alongside the upbeat “There’s no Point Unless You Goal,” actual competition will be accompanied by the intense pounding beat of Battle Program, and for those more devastating and heart-breaking moments...  Of which there is a surprising amount...  We’ll get the violin track Adagio of Despair.  Character themes were very thoughtfully put together and instantly reminiscent of the characters they’re attached to...  Even when that’s primarily because they’re based on the races of extremely stereotypical characters, which i’m going to get to in a minute...  But the highlight is Wings, the opening to the series, and easily on of my favorite of all time.  Joyful and inspirational, and full of imagery that gives each character a fair dose of screen time while throwing in subtle hints about the series.  Too bad you only get to see it once per disk...  No, I’m not kidding.  The same can be said for the sweet Honeybee, the closing theme.The English dub is a bit hit or miss, but I still prefer it over the Japanese by a great deal, even if the writers made a few embarrassing mistakes in it, such as mistakenly writing a flashback scene as a current scene, or having Akari say another character’s name before actually learning it.  I can kind of imagine mistakes like those happening in the old days, but it would be unheard of today.  Hey, at least they didn’t try to crowbar in any pointless references to obscure current events, am I right?  Anyway, the cast is full of Geneon actors from the late nineties, including the legendary Lia Sargent as the main character Akari, whom she plays very straightforward, innocent and full of heart, even as she grows from a spoiled and co-dependent slacker into a stronger, more confidant idealist, constantly changing while still sounding like the same person at heart.  Wendee Lee plays the gruff Osakan native Itchino, in what’s probably one of my favorite roles of hers, as she balances the characters softer and tougher sides fluidly.  Steve Blum also gets a small role as the University Satellite headmaster, Grant Oldman, although it’s not a very demanding role, his presence is still appreciated.Bridget Hoffman pulls double duty as both the Chinese stereotype character Ling Pha, which she performs in a comedically exaggerated accent, and then in a much more dignified role as Anna, who...  Like one of her more recent characters...  Is a sweet, diminutive girl with a dark, potentially dangerous side that’s hiding beneath the surface.  As a treat to any Trigun fans that happen to be reading this, Dorothy Elias-Fahn plays Kris Christopher, a strange but strong-willed girl who has a deep, unrequited crush on Akari.  So it’s basically the Milly and Meryl pairing you thought would never happen.  Also, as an interesting for Ghost in the Shell fans, two different Motoko Kusanagi actors...  Mary Elizabeth McGlynn from the anime and Mimi Woods from the video game, play characters that never actually meet or speak to each other.  They’re both good, but McGlynn is phenomenal at how she plays an emotionless character who finds emotion through competition.  Julie Maddalena probably had the only bad performance, but I don’t really blame her, because she was playing an annoying and entirely problematic character, so she was probably doing the best she could with what she was given.  Finally, we get Jamieson Price, and as much as I’d like to go into detail about why he’s so amazing in this, his character is unfortunately mired in spoilers.So if you haven’t realized by now, this show is really freaking weird.  It’s possibly even one of the weirdest anime I’ve ever seen.  There are a ton of strange anime out there that just shove weirdness into your face until it hits diminishing returns and becomes passé, such as Hare + Guu and Excel Saga, but with victory, the weirdness is paced in a way that it can keep consistently shocking you, as each strange detail that gets added to the story makes it’s impact and then settles neatly into the reality of the series’ universe, becoming commonplace for both the viewer and the characters...  Until the next kooky detail comes along.  So what if one of the main characters has a pet cow that’s allowed to live in her dorm with her?  That’s just Gyuube, don’t mind her.  So what if an alien turns a girl into a car?  those aliens are just like that. So what if one of the show’s only male characters needs a constant supply of chocolate to survive?  So what if some characters have unexplained jewels embedded in the foreheads, while other girls don’t?  This series takes place in a strange world, with a strange premise, and it seems to revel in the idea of completely ignoring your expectations.To it’s credit, though, it’s not like it tries to trick you into letting your guard down for it.  Victory lets you know right off the bat how weird it’s going to be right from the first shot of episode 1, where the athletes at the Antarctica Training Center are in the middle of an important assessment test, racing while pulling gigantic rolling weights behind them.  They’re not just pulling these multi-ton items behind them unhindered, however...  They’re moving over rough terrain, avoiding booby traps, and even using their weights as weapons against each other.  The results are of course catastrophic, as them main character(Whose been in dead last nearly the entire race) accidentally launches into the air and takes out a media reporter’s hot air balloon.  And if that’s not enough, right in the second episode, there’s a biking competition where the contestants are riding on a roller-coaster track, which is designed not only to go up and down, around curves and loop-de-loop like a real roller coaster, but which can even be moved and rearranged DURING THE RACE from a control room overlooking the action.If you can get through episode 2 without picking up on the fact that this series will leave no shark unjumped, you must have been fiddling with your phone the entire time.  Not everything got the sci-fi treatment, of course...  We get more normal sports like racing, soccer, tennis and the like.  But when it came to making up weird sports, this series goes balls to the wall with it’s level of creativity and imagination.  Like a game of pool where the balls are huge, and you have to break them by bowling.  Or zero-gravity lacrosse that adds several new dimensions to the game.  Then there’s my personal favorite, when they play air hockey, but the puck is as big as a dinner plate, and it’s literally hovering in mid-air.  There are others, of course, but in most of these events, the human limit is constantly being pushed and broken, even before we see runners that can accelerate fast enough to create shock waves, and there’s seemingly no rule against injuring your opponent in the middle of battle, as people being taken out with grueling injuries is seen as little other than an elimination.I’d normally be tearing apart a show like this over how ridiculous it is, how little sense it makes, and how almost none of it could feasibly happen in the real world, even in a dystopian future.  Hell, there ARE some plot details I can’t get over, but that’s just the thing...  They’re plot details, not connected to the weird pieces of sports logic throughout the series.  What ultimately saves this show from being too stupid to excuse is just how sincere it all is.  Yeah, the featured sporting events may be ridiculously  beyond human capabilities,but to it’s credit, the athletes performing them are constantly TRAINING themselves beyond human capabilities, and the final story arc gives us an actual solid reason(albeit still just as ridiculous) for why they need to train to surpass conceivable human limits.  It never feels like their abilities are undeserved, either...  The characters train their asses off, and even when you don’t get to see them do so, you can easily tell from their attitudes what their approach is to training as well as just how serious they are about it.  Those that don’t are considered ‘naturals,’ and are treated as anomalies.So, ultimately, what saves this series from being laughable is it’s mastery over character writing.  Every single character who gets even a mild level of importance is given a distinct arc, full of development and memorable moments.  Akari easily gets the most of it, because in a way that’s almost reminiscent of Goku, every time she breaks into a new level of ability, there’s another major lesson she has to learn, and another serious challenge for her to overcome, and they all seem to make sense, despite rarely being predictable and once or twice relying on some shaky logic.  I went into some detail about this in my review of Gunbuster last year, but throughout the course of the story, Akari is forced to evolve and grow as a character, from a whiny, spoiled little doll to a fierce competitor who can shave significant time off of her running speed just by reading a tip in a book.  She has to overcome limits and challenges that are really more psychological than physical, and she’s not the only one.  Everyone in this show has demons they have to deal with in order to grow and develop.There’s a lot of ways to bring depth to your writing, and one of those ways is to have your story be about something.  It can be a theme, it can be an idea, but it has to be consistent.  Battle Athletes victory is a story about Truth.  I don’t mean abstractly, like learning how not to lie, I mean deep, complex truth.  The truths we hide from others, the truths we hide from ourselves, and even the truths that get buried throughout history.  I said before that there’s a lot of character development in this series, but more specifically, every character has a hidden truth...  Sometimes multiple...  They they need to uncover within themselves in order to grow.  An emotionless girl who’s been trained to be an athletic machine will be forced to realize that the only thing she truly cares about is beating her rival.  A prideful overachiever will be devastated to realize there’s another plane of greatness she’ll never be able to reach.  The goofball will realize just how much winning the competition meant to her, when she no longer has food or friends around to comfort her.  You may train your best friend, only to be forced to acknowledge how much being better than them means to you when she starts to close in on you.  Hell, the most dishonest character in the cast, Ling Pha, is arguably the only one who never really develops.But the most important truth in the series, to me, is the one that rang true to me a few years ago.  I’ve seen this series multiple times, and one of those rewatches happened when I was having trouble at work.  I was slowing down, not really giving it my all, and after a while of it, I got called into the office.  They asked me what was wrong, why I wasn’t producing results, and I said I didn’t know, claiming that I was busting my ass...  Words I almost choked on, because even I knew they were bullshit.  This all changed when I realized that I was doing the same thing Akari was doing.  Whenever I was faced with a task that looked too difficult, I’d automatically accept that it was impossible, and I’d use that excuse to not try.  I didn’t have a friend like Itchan to wake me up to this fact, but it was true, I was sabotaging myself, making excuses for failures that hadn’t happened yet.  As soon as I realized this, I put a stop to it.  I decided that no job was impossible, no matter how unreasonable.  Ever since that day, I’ve never given up, I’ve never made excuses for myself, and I’ve continued to be employed as a result.  It’s easy for a story to teach life lessons to kids, but when you can change the life and outlook of an adult viewer, there’s something special there.Having said that, this series isn’t perfect.  It has some flaws, and they go deep.  There are constant logical derps...  The true nature of the character Eric might have you pulling your hair out...  But it’s biggest problem is it’s over-use of harmful and insulting stereotypes.  The Russian girl is an emotionless machine, the Chinese girl is a dishonest cheater who’s always trying to sell stuff to people, the lesbian is a predatory lech who pays no regard to consent or mutual attraction(think the black girl from Pitch Perfect but not quite as bad), and the black girl...  Holy shit, the black girl.  Yeah, there’s a character here who’s from Africa, and her character is so racist that even Paula Dean would be insulted.  She’s likeable, don’t get me wrong, but if this were an American cartoon, it would be one of the Censored 11.  She runs around  on all fours, uses her nose like a blood hound, is a “Natural runner,” and there’s an entire episode dedicated to her running around school in a tribal uniform, worshipping a totem god and painting everyone’s faces.  There’s also a lot of lame jokes, such as the gimmick of a trio of hijackers, and...  Okay, honestly, the whole episode that began the University Satellite arc kinda sucked.It’s second biggest problem, right behind the racism issue, is the availability of the series.  I mean, the lack thereof.  Battle Athletes victory was available from Pioneer, which would eventually become Geneon, which would eventually go out of business.  It’s been out of print for almost 20 years, and I can’t find any information about anybody trying to rescue it.  If that’s not bad enough, the DVDs that it’s actually available on are pieces of shit, dated in all the worst ways.  First of all, as I mentioned before, you only get the opening once per disk.  That’s because it uses Dragonball Z’s marathon feature, only it’s not a feature, you don’t have a choice.  Opening, three to four back-to-back episodes, closing.  And the dubbers plastered white text over the opening instead of trying to avoid blocking the visuals.  You can find these DVDs for fairly cheap online, and if you’re trying to get all 8 of them, you may even get lucky with a fifty dollar bundle on Ebay.  The original OVA is also available stateside, but the manga is not.  but seriously, if you’re reading this and actually have the right connections, PLEASE get this series rereleased.  Discotek's been into that kind of thing lately.It’s not often that you hear about an anime changing someone’s life.  They can turn you off from violence, help you to overcome prejudices, change your attitude towards your own life, make you appreciate your loved ones in new ways...  Battle Athletes victory is a series that literally, tangibly changed my life, and I’m pretty sure I’d have lost my job and a significant portion of my livelihood without it.  I won’t BS you by calling it a masterpiece, that’s not true...  The visual quality is inconsistent, the logic isn’t always sound, it’s only black character is too much like Rob Schneider from The Animal, but if you’re able to get past all of that, this series is beautiful.  It’s full of heart, has an undeniable passion for athletics and competition, and it’s always finding new ways to make you cry, without having to rely on any cliché modern day tragedy porn.  There’s nothing manipulative about it, just genuine emotion and sincere sportsmanship.  The sci-fi elements are also a blast, and while the final stretch may have jumped the shark a little too far...  Even I’ll admit that...  It’s very rarely unenjoyable, even then.  It’s an obscure title, but it’s well worth the effort it’ll take to find it.  I give Battle Athletes Victory an 8/10. over the world have been flocking to a special school in Antarctica, to train and compete against each other, with the the top three students from each year being sent to the University Satellite!  But that’s not all, because over the millennia, mankind has finally expanded into outer space, and every single planet(including some of their moons) sending their own athletes to compete at the Satellite!  This intense, harrowing tournament will separate the tough from the timid, the hardcore from the soft, and the naturals from the dreamers as the best and the strongest athletes from the entire universe will battle it out for the title of Cosmo Beauty!One of these young hopefuls is Akari Kanzaki, who...  Let’s just face it, is completely hopeless.  She’s slow, fragile, and is just as clueless as to what she’s doing at the Antarctic training site as we are.  Being the daughter of Tomoe Midoh, the greatest Cosmo Beauty in the history of the Great competition, she has the genetic make-up that any other competitor would kill for, but her athletic abilities, and her attitude towards training, make her long-lasting lock on last place feel even more painful to watch.  While some of her fellow students may have a soft spot for the doe-eyed lump, others see her as an insult to everything they’ve dedicated their lives towards, and aren’t shy about letting her know it.  But could the apathetic Akari be more than meets the eye?  Could her exterior, which is about as threatening as a rag doll, be hiding an untapped well of talent that’s just begging to be discovered?  And even going beyond that, is there some darker truth hiding behind the Great competition itself?  As the competition heats up, and the champs rise above the chumps, the 1003’rd Cosmo Beauty may turn out to be the most important one of all.For Battle Athletes victory, we return to AIC, or Anime International company, only this time we’re looking at one of their earliest works, which came out in the late nineties.  The series will be 20 years old this October, and as such, it looks extremely dated.  This was a time when the moe style was nowhere to be seen, anime had to work harder to look good regardless of budget, and character designs ranged from cartoony to realistic, while rarely ever straying away from believable human anatomy.  Artwork was a lot less polished, and physiques were exaggerated a lot more than they are today.  For the time it came out in, Battle Athletes victory looks really good...  When it wants to.  The animation in this title is heavily inconsistent, and it works for the most part.  For athletic competitions that can’t be written off with cheap budget saving tricks(And a few of them definitely are), the animation can be straight up gorgeous.  I’ve heard it said that one of the most difficult things to animate is character’s legs when they’re walking and running, and yeah, I’ve seen enough failed attempts to understand this.A lot of work goes into the simple visual of feet hitting and pressing back off of the ground, which is why a lot of animation tends to focus on above the feet, if they’re not just resorting to bouncing the image of the character’s face.  In spite of this, I’m not exaggerating when I say that Battle Athletes Victory makes running animation look easy.  They can pull it off at any speed, from fast running that doesn’t give you time to analyze it, to slow-motion running that perfectly captures every single movement of the body to the point that I have to wonder just how much live action research they must have done beforehand.  A lot of money clearly got poured into these scenes, because most of the other sports featured in this show aren’t really as impressive.  That’s not to say they look bad, but there’s a lot of close-ups, a lot of short bursts of action, and occasionally even repeated animation cycles that are meant to give the illusion of physical activity, and thanks to some smart editing, it almost always works.  About half of the action in this series is running, of course, so it’s still an impressive looking series.Well, for the most part, at least.  The budget gets spread too thin at times, and when they run into trouble with it, the quality just abruptly tanks.  There are sequences, and a couple of entire episodes, that look less like a high budget show from the late nineties and more like a low budget show from the early nineties.  A lot of the material between competitions is just characters talking, interacting and having the camera freeze on them during internal monologues, and this does worlds of good for the budget, but at it’s worst, even scenes like those wind up looking like ass.  The character designs, while imaginative, don’t follow the most attractive color palette, making the artwork look kinda grungy at times, and since the characters are mostly designed to carry realistic human anatomy, there are only a few of them that can get away with deformed anime expressions...  Some of the more serious characters, such as Akari’s rival Jessie, just look terrifying when attempting to do the same.  The color saturation and use of lighting are beautiful, but there are too many instances where the artwork looks rough, and over-all unfinished.The music, while pretty repetitive, is unbelievable.  As with any good sports-related media, the story has a deeply emotional feel to it, and the music composed by Yoshikazu Suo was clearly designed to augment these emotions.  Some of the happier moments between competitions will be played alongside the upbeat “There’s no Point Unless You Goal,” actual competition will be accompanied by the intense pounding beat of Battle Program, and for those more devastating and heart-breaking moments...  Of which there is a surprising amount...  We’ll get the violin track Adagio of Despair.  Character themes were very thoughtfully put together and instantly reminiscent of the characters they’re attached to...  Even when that’s primarily because they’re based on the races of extremely stereotypical characters, which i’m going to get to in a minute...  But the highlight is Wings, the opening to the series, and easily on of my favorite of all time.  Joyful and inspirational, and full of imagery that gives each character a fair dose of screen time while throwing in subtle hints about the series.  Too bad you only get to see it once per disk...  No, I’m not kidding.  The same can be said for the sweet Honeybee, the closing theme.The English dub is a bit hit or miss, but I still prefer it over the Japanese by a great deal, even if the writers made a few embarrassing mistakes in it, such as mistakenly writing a flashback scene as a current scene, or having Akari say another character’s name before actually learning it.  I can kind of imagine mistakes like those happening in the old days, but it would be unheard of today.  Hey, at least they didn’t try to crowbar in any pointless references to obscure current events, am I right?  Anyway, the cast is full of Geneon actors from the late nineties, including the legendary Lia Sargent as the main character Akari, whom she plays very straightforward, innocent and full of heart, even as she grows from a spoiled and co-dependent slacker into a stronger, more confidant idealist, constantly changing while still sounding like the same person at heart.  Wendee Lee plays the gruff Osakan native Itchino, in what’s probably one of my favorite roles of hers, as she balances the characters softer and tougher sides fluidly.  Steve Blum also gets a small role as the University Satellite headmaster, Grant Oldman, although it’s not a very demanding role, his presence is still appreciated.Bridget Hoffman pulls double duty as both the Chinese stereotype character Ling Pha, which she performs in a comedically exaggerated accent, and then in a much more dignified role as Anna, who...  Like one of her more recent characters...  Is a sweet, diminutive girl with a dark, potentially dangerous side that’s hiding beneath the surface.  As a treat to any Trigun fans that happen to be reading this, Dorothy Elias-Fahn plays Kris Christopher, a strange but strong-willed girl who has a deep, unrequited crush on Akari.  So it’s basically the Milly and Meryl pairing you thought would never happen.  Also, as an interesting for Ghost in the Shell fans, two different Motoko Kusanagi actors...  Mary Elizabeth McGlynn from the anime and Mimi Woods from the video game, play characters that never actually meet or speak to each other.  They’re both good, but McGlynn is phenomenal at how she plays an emotionless character who finds emotion through competition.  Julie Maddalena probably had the only bad performance, but I don’t really blame her, because she was playing an annoying and entirely problematic character, so she was probably doing the best she could with what she was given.  Finally, we get Jamieson Price, and as much as I’d like to go into detail about why he’s so amazing in this, his character is unfortunately mired in spoilers.So if you haven’t realized by now, this show is really freaking weird.  It’s possibly even one of the weirdest anime I’ve ever seen.  There are a ton of strange anime out there that just shove weirdness into your face until it hits diminishing returns and becomes passé, such as Hare + Guu and Excel Saga, but with victory, the weirdness is paced in a way that it can keep consistently shocking you, as each strange detail that gets added to the story makes it’s impact and then settles neatly into the reality of the series’ universe, becoming commonplace for both the viewer and the characters...  Until the next kooky detail comes along.  So what if one of the main characters has a pet cow that’s allowed to live in her dorm with her?  That’s just Gyuube, don’t mind her.  So what if an alien turns a girl into a car?  those aliens are just like that. So what if one of the show’s only male characters needs a constant supply of chocolate to survive?  So what if some characters have unexplained jewels embedded in the foreheads, while other girls don’t?  This series takes place in a strange world, with a strange premise, and it seems to revel in the idea of completely ignoring your expectations.To it’s credit, though, it’s not like it tries to trick you into letting your guard down for it.  Victory lets you know right off the bat how weird it’s going to be right from the first shot of episode 1, where the athletes at the Antarctica Training Center are in the middle of an important assessment test, racing while pulling gigantic rolling weights behind them.  They’re not just pulling these multi-ton items behind them unhindered, however...  They’re moving over rough terrain, avoiding booby traps, and even using their weights as weapons against each other.  The results are of course catastrophic, as them main character(Whose been in dead last nearly the entire race) accidentally launches into the air and takes out a media reporter’s hot air balloon.  And if that’s not enough, right in the second episode, there’s a biking competition where the contestants are riding on a roller-coaster track, which is designed not only to go up and down, around curves and loop-de-loop like a real roller coaster, but which can even be moved and rearranged DURING THE RACE from a control room overlooking the action.If you can get through episode 2 without picking up on the fact that this series will leave no shark unjumped, you must have been fiddling with your phone the entire time.  Not everything got the sci-fi treatment, of course...  We get more normal sports like racing, soccer, tennis and the like.  But when it came to making up weird sports, this series goes balls to the wall with it’s level of creativity and imagination.  Like a game of pool where the balls are huge, and you have to break them by bowling.  Or zero-gravity lacrosse that adds several new dimensions to the game.  Then there’s my personal favorite, when they play air hockey, but the puck is as big as a dinner plate, and it’s literally hovering in mid-air.  There are others, of course, but in most of these events, the human limit is constantly being pushed and broken, even before we see runners that can accelerate fast enough to create shock waves, and there’s seemingly no rule against injuring your opponent in the middle of battle, as people being taken out with grueling injuries is seen as little other than an elimination.I’d normally be tearing apart a show like this over how ridiculous it is, how little sense it makes, and how almost none of it could feasibly happen in the real world, even in a dystopian future.  Hell, there ARE some plot details I can’t get over, but that’s just the thing...  They’re plot details, not connected to the weird pieces of sports logic throughout the series.  What ultimately saves this show from being too stupid to excuse is just how sincere it all is.  Yeah, the featured sporting events may be ridiculously  beyond human capabilities,but to it’s credit, the athletes performing them are constantly TRAINING themselves beyond human capabilities, and the final story arc gives us an actual solid reason(albeit still just as ridiculous) for why they need to train to surpass conceivable human limits.  It never feels like their abilities are undeserved, either...  The characters train their asses off, and even when you don’t get to see them do so, you can easily tell from their attitudes what their approach is to training as well as just how serious they are about it.  Those that don’t are considered ‘naturals,’ and are treated as anomalies.So, ultimately, what saves this series from being laughable is it’s mastery over character writing.  Every single character who gets even a mild level of importance is given a distinct arc, full of development and memorable moments.  Akari easily gets the most of it, because in a way that’s almost reminiscent of Goku, every time she breaks into a new level of ability, there’s another major lesson she has to learn, and another serious challenge for her to overcome, and they all seem to make sense, despite rarely being predictable and once or twice relying on some shaky logic.  I went into some detail about this in my review of Gunbuster last year, but throughout the course of the story, Akari is forced to evolve and grow as a character, from a whiny, spoiled little doll to a fierce competitor who can shave significant time off of her running speed just by reading a tip in a book.  She has to overcome limits and challenges that are really more psychological than physical, and she’s not the only one.  Everyone in this show has demons they have to deal with in order to grow and develop.There’s a lot of ways to bring depth to your writing, and one of those ways is to have your story be about something.  It can be a theme, it can be an idea, but it has to be consistent.  Battle Athletes victory is a story about Truth.  I don’t mean abstractly, like learning how not to lie, I mean deep, complex truth.  The truths we hide from others, the truths we hide from ourselves, and even the truths that get buried throughout history.  I said before that there’s a lot of character development in this series, but more specifically, every character has a hidden truth...  Sometimes multiple...  They they need to uncover within themselves in order to grow.  An emotionless girl who’s been trained to be an athletic machine will be forced to realize that the only thing she truly cares about is beating her rival.  A prideful overachiever will be devastated to realize there’s another plane of greatness she’ll never be able to reach.  The goofball will realize just how much winning the competition meant to her, when she no longer has food or friends around to comfort her.  You may train your best friend, only to be forced to acknowledge how much being better than them means to you when she starts to close in on you.  Hell, the most dishonest character in the cast, Ling Pha, is arguably the only one who never really develops.But the most important truth in the series, to me, is the one that rang true to me a few years ago.  I’ve seen this series multiple times, and one of those rewatches happened when I was having trouble at work.  I was slowing down, not really giving it my all, and after a while of it, I got called into the office.  They asked me what was wrong, why I wasn’t producing results, and I said I didn’t know, claiming that I was busting my ass...  Words I almost choked on, because even I knew they were bullshit.  This all changed when I realized that I was doing the same thing Akari was doing.  Whenever I was faced with a task that looked too difficult, I’d automatically accept that it was impossible, and I’d use that excuse to not try.  I didn’t have a friend like Itchan to wake me up to this fact, but it was true, I was sabotaging myself, making excuses for failures that hadn’t happened yet.  As soon as I realized this, I put a stop to it.  I decided that no job was impossible, no matter how unreasonable.  Ever since that day, I’ve never given up, I’ve never made excuses for myself, and I’ve continued to be employed as a result.  It’s easy for a story to teach life lessons to kids, but when you can change the life and outlook of an adult viewer, there’s something special there.Having said that, this series isn’t perfect.  It has some flaws, and they go deep.  There are constant logical derps...  The true nature of the character Eric might have you pulling your hair out...  But it’s biggest problem is it’s over-use of harmful and insulting stereotypes.  The Russian girl is an emotionless machine, the Chinese girl is a dishonest cheater who’s always trying to sell stuff to people, the lesbian is a predatory lech who pays no regard to consent or mutual attraction(think the black girl from Pitch Perfect but not quite as bad), and the black girl...  Holy shit, the black girl.  Yeah, there’s a character here who’s from Africa, and her character is so racist that even Paula Dean would be insulted.  She’s likeable, don’t get me wrong, but if this were an American cartoon, it would be one of the Censored 11.  She runs around  on all fours, uses her nose like a blood hound, is a “Natural runner,” and there’s an entire episode dedicated to her running around school in a tribal uniform, worshipping a totem god and painting everyone’s faces.  There’s also a lot of lame jokes, such as the gimmick of a trio of hijackers, and...  Okay, honestly, the whole episode that began the University Satellite arc kinda sucked.It’s second biggest problem, right behind the racism issue, is the availability of the series.  I mean, the lack thereof.  Battle Athletes victory was available from Pioneer, which would eventually become Geneon, which would eventually go out of business.  It’s been out of print for almost 20 years, and I can’t find any information about anybody trying to rescue it.  If that’s not bad enough, the DVDs that it’s actually available on are pieces of shit, dated in all the worst ways.  First of all, as I mentioned before, you only get the opening once per disk.  That’s because it uses Dragonball Z’s marathon feature, only it’s not a feature, you don’t have a choice.  Opening, three to four back-to-back episodes, closing.  And the dubbers plastered white text over the opening instead of trying to avoid blocking the visuals.  You can find these DVDs for fairly cheap online, and if you’re trying to get all 8 of them, you may even get lucky with a fifty dollar bundle on Ebay.  The original OVA is also available stateside, but the manga is not.  but seriously, if you’re reading this and actually have the right connections, PLEASE get this series rereleased.  Discotek's been into that kind of thing lately.It’s not often that you hear about an anime changing someone’s life.  They can turn you off from violence, help you to overcome prejudices, change your attitude towards your own life, make you appreciate your loved ones in new ways...  Battle Athletes victory is a series that literally, tangibly changed my life, and I’m pretty sure I’d have lost my job and a significant portion of my livelihood without it.  I won’t BS you by calling it a masterpiece, that’s not true...  The visual quality is inconsistent, the logic isn’t always sound, it’s only black character is too much like Rob Schneider from The Animal, but if you’re able to get past all of that, this series is beautiful.  It’s full of heart, has an undeniable passion for athletics and competition, and it’s always finding new ways to make you cry, without having to rely on any cliché modern day tragedy porn.  There’s nothing manipulative about it, just genuine emotion and sincere sportsmanship.  The sci-fi elements are also a blast, and while the final stretch may have jumped the shark a little too far...  Even I’ll admit that...  It’s very rarely unenjoyable, even then.  It’s an obscure title, but it’s well worth the effort it’ll take to find it.  I give Battle Athletes Victory an 8/10."", 'I discovered Battle Athletes Victory when I asked a guy at an anime convention “Do you know any good anime that are really obscure?” and he responded “Have you seen Battle Athletes?”  I want to dedicate this to that guy.Every so often one might choose to watch a random anime that you have never heard of before and know next to nothing about.  Sometimes you will discover a hidden gem, sometimes its a huge piece of crap, but more often than not it’s something serviceable but fairly unremarkable.  I am pleased to say, that for me, Battle Athletes Victory was the first...option.There are two anime productions in the original Battle Athletes franchise, a 6 episode OVA and a 26 episode television series.  For my part I prefer Victory, the television series, to its OVA counterpart.  Not only are the characters more fleshed out but I find the choices made by Victory to be more interesting than those in the OVA.  Battle Athletes Victory uses its extra time to great effect to enhance the story.  At the same time Battle Athletes does not over stay its welcome or belabor itself to pump out more episodes.  Its 26 episodes contain 3 different arcs, and each wraps up cleanly and in a satisfying manner.   The most typically viewed type of shonen is the battle shonen and these typically drag out for quite a long time with training and tournament arcs that often over stay their welcome and feel repetitive.  Ironically Battle Athletes, which is all training and tournaments, manages to avoid this feeling of repetition and clears up in timely manner.  This isn’t to say that Battle Athletes contains nothing but fresh ideas and presentations, it has many tried and worn cliches, but I am of the opinion that cliches, if done right, can be quite enjoyable.  For those interested I will attempt to summarize the three arcs while avoiding any major spoilersOverview:Battle Athletes takes place in the year 4999 and focuses on Akari Kanzaki as she strives to improve herself in all things athletic and aim for the title of Cosmo Beauty, the highest honor in the sports world.  Akari is the daughter of the most legendary Cosmo Beauty of all time, Tomoe Midou.  Despite this pedigree Akari does not seem to possess her mother’s abilities for all things athletic and is actually quite bad.  Tomoe Midou herself has been killed by anime parentitus and her dying wish was for Akari to attend University Satellite as she did in her youth.  The first arc focuses on Akari’s time at the training school, which is a school that girls go to so that they can train in intense future athletic events so that the best of them may go to the satellite school where they may then compete for the title of Cosmo Beauty.  In the training school we are introduced to the other students such as Ichino Yanigida (Akari’s best friend), Jessie Gurtland (the immensely talented American), Ayla V. Roznovsky (the almost equally talented Russian), Ling Pha Wong(the comic relief), and Tanya Natdhipytadd (who is a kinda racist African character).  The first arc despite being the most comedy focused of the three, deals with some pretty serious themes such as jealousy and expectations.  The core message of the arc, and the series as a whole though is on friendship.  Throughout the entire series the focus is generally set on the relationships between the various girls.  Kindhearted Akari wishes to be friends with everyone, but it’s not always that easy.  There are those like Jessie who are laser focused on excellence and competition, and who like any true shonen rival, respect only power.  This arc can go from silly things like dawning face paint to try and gain the favor of the god of running, to serious moments of intense jealousy over raw talent similar to those in the film Amadeus.  It is also in this arc we see the first hints of Akari’s natural athleticism, which she is eventually able to tap into and propel herself to a spot in University Satellite which is where the second arc begins.In University Satellite Akari is separated from her training school companions and assigned two new teammates, Kris Christopher and Anna Respighi.  This is also the same Arc covered in the OVA series.  Like in the first arc Akari, and her team, do not perform well at the beginning.  Their trainer is a man named Mr. Miracle(not the super hero).  He is a man who has trained 7 Cosmo Beauties in his time, but since he spends most the entire series doing nothing for the girls I’m practically convinced this was sheer luck.  Differing from the first arc the initial failure comes from the girls inability to perform as a team.  Akari becomes too focused on winning and is unable to utilize the talents that Anna and Kris bring to the table, choosing instead to trust only in herself.  Like I said friendship is a big theme.  Another major theme is lesbians.  Battle Athletes provides viewers with a choice of ships, you can either pair Akari with Ichino or Kris.  The first arc is littered with hints that the relationship between Akari and Ichino might be more than just platonic.  The second arc is a little less subtle.  Upon meeting Akari for the very first time Kris Christopher exclaims “I’m in love!”  Kris wastes no time in conveying her feelings to Akari, immediately expressing her romantic interest.  Akari is shocked and often runs from Kris’ affections however the two become incredibly close friends and when confronted Akari is reticent to say that she and Ichino are anything more than just friends.  And without spoiling anything I would say that Akari and Kris have a level of connection that rivals that of fellow 90s anime LGBT icons Utena and Anthy.  Like in the first arc they manage to claw their way up out of defeat and make it past the prelims.  At this point they are split up and must compete individually for the title of Cosmo Beauty.  This arc also features two antagonists, Larrhi Feldnaut (which for some reason seems to be pronounced Fernando) a two time Cosmo Beauty winner who has trained herself to become a record breaking athletics robot, and Mylandah Akar Walder who is an over the top villain that is carted out to her matches in chains which she then immediately breaks and kept in a cell for the rest of the time because she likes to physically beat her competition.  In fact during one match Mylandah crashes down into the stadium creating a crater around her, then slaps a girl so hard she breaks through a wall.  If I were playing charades and the category were anime bad guy this is exactly what I would act out.  After the Cosmo Beauty title is claimed on episode 22 the show begins its third and final arc.This 4 episode arc is the shortest in the series and can at first feel unnecessary because the end of the Cosmo Beauty arc felt final and like good end to the series, it was even where the OVA ended. However, there was one loose end that needed to be tied up.  Without going into any spoilers something happens before the Cosmo Beauty competition and this arc addresses that event and what the entire Cosmo Beauty title had been about.  There are some hints buried in the series about the reveal but most people won’t really absorb them on their first time though.  This 4 episode arc is mostly a showcase of the “best of” of Battle Athletes characters.  Most all major girls return for a final team match that the will impact the whole world.  At times it seems like a lot to pack into 4 episodes but Battle Athletes ability to trim the fat really shows here.  The training portion of the arc took up only half an episode and I myself wondered why they hadn’t done more before realizing that it would have accomplished nothing.  All these girls were at the end of their personal character arcs and any future development between them (which should be the only reason extended periods of training episodes) was not necessary.  There is are a few final emotional hurdles for Akari to overcome in this arc but I’ll leave what those are a secret for those who wish to watch the series.Overall Battle Athletes Victory is fun, exciting, and surprisingly deep series.  It’s not going to be winning any awards for high art, but there are many, many worse ways to spend your time and I will definitely be returning to this series in the future multiple times.8/10 option.There are two anime productions in the original Battle Athletes franchise, a 6 episode OVA and a 26 episode television series.

It’s not going to be winning any awards for high art, but there are many, many worse ways to spend your time and I will definitely be returning to this series in the future multiple times.8/10', ""If you're reading this, I'd dare to assume you're planning to watch this anime or are still deciding whether you should watch it or not.I'm going to give my opinion, though I'm not a professional reviewer.PlotIn this (almost) 27 years old anime we are unfolded the history of Akari and her efforts to reach her dream, her goal, achieved previously by her mother. Shy, honest and caring Akari isn't your average op character. You could even say she's mid in terms of power, agility, speed etc. But she makes up for it with her heart. Despite that, she does grow in the anime, both as...an athlete and as a character, together with the other participants who inhabit the same dormitory as her. Together they go through mischievous mishappenings, where they redefine friendship, struggling to be better and so on.In my opinion, the plot was good, but didn't really deliver. Perhaps it's because I'm not into this genre.CharactersAs you can imagine, here we have the usual bunch: The angry, the deceiver, the energetic, the stoic and so on. They do go through personal growth, although it's not very noticeable. The main character doesn't over-occupy the screen, leaving space for the other characters to shine, so that the viewer can get familiar with them. I really liked the designs of the characters, but more than that I loved the voice acting. It's really well done.AnimationAs I previously mentioned, the anime is 27 years old. But despite the age, the art is  good. It's not the best, but it gives that nostalgic feeling. Personally, I'm into retro and that's why I mostly watched this. The voice acting got me hooked to it. And that's about it.SummaryI'd like to say that this show is for you if you're into sport and classical troupe. It's not the best , but it's further from being the worst. Even if you're not, it can be enjoyable. an athlete and as a character, together with the other participants who inhabit the same dormitory as her.

.hack//Roots,https://myanimelist.net/anime/873/hack__Roots,"["".hack//Roots is a fine sequel that's kind of bashed because of the plug-in-nature relationship to the .hack//G.U.  And it's sad it's kind of bashed, because Roots was a really good installment in the .hack// Series.  My favorite has and probably will always be SIGN but I found roots to be very enjoyable at the least.In terms of the story it struck a fine balance of keeping in the nature of .hack in general with out going over the SAME OLD STORY.  While it re-introduced the story of the mystic &quot;Key of the Twilight&quot; as explored in .hack//SIGN and it's...sequel quartet.  Bringing in all new characters, giving the classic 'The World' a make over with all new classes was the change needed.  Of course the story of the .hackers was great and so was the story and drama of Tsukasa in .hack//SIGN and that was good for those, but it was time for a change..hack//Roots goes back to the darker more somber story line after it's campy epilogue-like predecessor  .hack//Legend of the Twilight (aka .hack//DUSK) which was refreshing change.  I can't say I liked Legend straying so far from it's roots (heh no pun intended)  of it's predecessor of SIGN, though it's certainly understandable why.  But again I felt it was far better to keep on the darker side of the story line, which is why SIGN captivated me in the first place.The story dwells much more into the dark human psyche of our personal demons, and can show every character has a purpose for playing &quot;The World&quot; that to me is the darker end of why people like to play games for hours on end.  (namely me).   Like with SIGN I felt captivated and relatable to every character.  I was able to care about them on such personal levels.   It's amazing to see the changes all the characters go through, as the series progresses, which made them much more dynamic foil characters.  I recall in SIGN the only one who really changed was Tsukasa.  So it was a new direction that worked.You'll notice a big difference between Haseo and Tsukasa, which is something I found worked well.  Again if you are going to do a sequel you have to make it original, otherwise you just get Pokemon all over again.   I thought the idea of Haseo's power-binge to avenge the the PKing of Shino was a brilliant concept, and added to sympathy for his character or otherwise maybe more antagonizing concepts.   Haseo's journey into the black abyss of PKKing actually really contributes to the GU storyline.The overall storytelling didn't stay as strong as SIGN.  It started off pretty typically, with the set up and the world-of-the-play but soon dissolved into a pretty weak middle, and picked up slightly at the end.   The middle episodes that don't involve Haseo feel much like cheap fillers that simply aren't that needed.  It could have stood to be a little shorter in length even though it stands at 26 episodes.   That's not to say the entire middle is weak, there are some great episodes in the middle such as &quot;The Forest of Pain&quot; arc, and Haseo's ever growing into the &quot;Terror of Death.&quot;  Other than that, episodes that show attempts by Tabby and others to form a Medic Union or any episode that features Tabby alone, pretty much fall right away.As I mentioned earlier Roots is a plug-in story to .hack//G.U. for the PS2, so in the end you will want to play the games to continue the story line. (or you can read the novels).  Again it's kind of sad Roots takes a lot of flak for that, because I think it's a clever and very unique way to extend a story line.  SIGN in some ways was like that as it all lead into .hack//Infection.Music, was fair.  I mean no disrespect to Ali Project I am coming to like their work quite a bit, but it was a strange direction and style compared to Kajiura's score for SIGN. I was taken aback by it, but it has grown on me enough that I find it okay but still not good as I've come to expect when Mashimo is the director.     It's almost deceptive at first because one of the first after-theme piece you hear is very well composed and orchestrated, but after that it's pretty dull, inattentive, and flat.   You will also hear a few pieces that sound eerily similar to works by Danny Elfman which doesn't help the case of the music get any better.  It's also at times poorly place and orchestrated.  Ali Project has provided a good original score, this I know with Avenger, but Roots is considerably dull in comparison to SIGN's musical score.   On the otherhand Kajiura's opening theme with FictionJunction YUUKA is a really unique theme, much different than Obsession almost more like a melancholy and &quot;searching for&quot; or &quot;yearning for&quot; theme.In the end ROOTS is good but not great.  The introduction of more action and more tension helped the story but still I think SIGN will have the stronger storyline.   I can't speak for all fans because some might hate it, others might love it, or some will find it in-between.  Absolutely there are aspects about it that could have been better.  Not likely Roots will go down as the greatest chapter of .hack especially with it's relationship to GU which by the way is a rather fun game for the story experience. sequel quartet.

It is based on the worldwide hit game, .hack. That said, though, the anime falls flat on its face, because of far too many factors that should been taken care of.The storyline is so weak, the viewer often feels as if he's watching a documentary of something. There's no connectivity in the episodes, and the fractal appearance of the whole series will put everyone (except the most devoted .hack otaku) off. The story doesn't have heads or tails; it just plods on, like an excrutiating torture session.The character design's very weak as well. Though the lead...character, Haseo, is created well, flaws in his conceptualization leave him with a schizophrenic character set. Shino and O-van, the other two lead characters, are far better in their conception. O-van, particularly, is a great character, sort of like Hatake Kakashi in Naruto or like Urahara Kisuke in Bleach. Besides these two exceptions, everyone else is useless as characters. Tabby is too smarmy, Sakisaka too vacillatory, Ender too non-violent, and Filo too plodding.The one high point of the show is the music, produced by Ali Project. The OP (Silly-go-Round by FictionJunction YUUKA) and ED (Boukoku Kakusei Catharsis by Ali Project) are awesome, to say the least, and the INs never fail to enthrall either. IMO, do look out for God Diva; it's a superlative track. Silly-Go-Round, thanks to its catchy tune structure and fine alterations between the violin and modern instruments such as the guitar or drums, makes for a great listen.Sadly, the music is the only thing we reviewer otaku can rave about. The idea behind the characters is good, and as in the case of Tryedge, almost exquisite. But there is no clarity, no Ichigo-esque madness, no Naruto-style idealism in this story. One misses the clear objective reality of Bleach or Ghost in the Shell (or maybe even the earlier .hack iterations?). There is virtually no action, no drama, no flesh and blood; in short, there's no juice to this baby.Who do I recommend it to? No one. This anime (as much as it pains me to say it) is simply unwatchable. Don't watch it at all, except maybe the first episode and towards the end. The rest will simply bore you, and make you regret the time you spent downloading the episode. .hack//Roots is a total failure for me. character, Haseo, is created well, flaws in his conceptualization leave him with a schizophrenic character set.

I forced myself to finish the series after the fourteenth episode only because I was already so far in and I\'m someone who likes to get things done and when I criticize something I want a full understanding of what I\'m going to bash.The story wasn\'t ""so"" bad because it\'s got the base and foundation of the .Hack//Series. Which you all know by now because of the previous anime\'s and the synopsis above. What I had...a problem with is the way they had told it.The main issue is that all of the characters behave unrealistically. And there\'s no character in this entire series who I could relate to. Which is VERY important to any show because you want someone to root for (pun intended) and build a relationship with.Haseo didn\'t give two shits about anything or anyone and didn\'t even care much for the Twilight Brigade or anyone in it until Ovan ordered him to take good care of Shino, and abruptly they began a ""relationship"" after his sudden disappearance after the gathering of all the Virus Cores. Which is hard to identify because it happened so quickly. They get hitched supposedly, but it wasn\'t amplified properly since they only showed one scene that gave you the hint. I mean, yeah, they obviously felt something for each other but it seemed almost as platonic as her relationship with Ovan.She kicks the bucket immediately after these shortly lived events and Haseo reacts strongly. Which is odd, because it didn\'t even seem like such a big deal when I sat and watched but Haseo\'s expression made me think otherwise. It just seemed so quick to actually feel anything for either of them. I just didn\'t care, which means there\'s something seriously wrong with this series.There also isn\'t one central character. Sure, in the start they focus upon Haseo, but when shit hits the fan they switch to numerous different people. Tabby, Phyllo, and the supposed villains Pi and Yata who were Ender and Naobi previously but had their characters permanently disabled in the earlier episodes. Tawalaya who soon became Tohta. The two cat people and a bunch of others I didn\'t care much about.When there\'s so many characters it\'s hard to keep up, and to feel anything for either of them. It\'s just an overall mess, an anomaly to story lines. It\'s probably one of the reasons why I didn\'t give a fuck about Haseo\'s ""desperate"" struggle towards insanity.Tabby is as gutless as a guppy and doesn\'t think twice before she acts. She just does stupid things and is an idiot. Why she did some of the stuff in the series is beyond me. I don\'t mind very happy characters with not so strong intelligence outside of the ""serious"" bits, but yeah, she\'s stupid everywhere and in every situation.The music was sub-par. Ali Project is a really good artist, but it didn\'t seem to fit well as an ending theme in my own personal opinion. Just seemed a little too wacky for something like this show. Yeah, it\'s dark, but it seemed more wacky Halloween than dark.The opening of the opening\'s nice but everything following it is bitter and tasteless like lettuce. The animation\'s fine, I guess, but it didn\'t wow me. Anime openings are just a very recycled process. Run sideways, slash slash, stare up at the bright light above you with a solemn expression.

How generic.If you\'re a fan of .Hack I wouldn\'t watch this show, and if you\'re not I would try and forget it ever even existed.', ""To start off, .hack is well-known by fans as a game within a game. With the online game, &quot;The World&quot; as your setting, you play as a character who interacts with other characters who are all aware that this is all but a game they're facing, from beginning to end. Twists and turns soon crash on the protagonist and his allies as they encounter different obstacles that usually do not play by the game's rules. Most of these rule-breakers are usually rendered as bugs, viruses, glitches, hacked entities and more anomalies that can be defined within the branch...of computer ethics.As a fan of the series(more on the games),  I appreciated .hack for being a story that most people today can relate. The series also inspired me to play online games which in time, I grew tired to continue due to the fact that it wastes my wallet, time and ego.The first series, //SIGN made an impact on me by being emotional, mysterious and sharing a piece of action overall but mostly, it was just fantasy with suspense. The second, &quot;The legend of the Twilight&quot;, a.k.a. //Dusk, was mediocre for me though, it was good for the series to have a livelier side for a change but the sad fact was that they didn't complete the anime series or at least portrayed it completely from the manga which had a touching(yet surprising) ending.Here, //Roots now has it's changes for its own respect to the series.Now, on to the review:Story:For the sake of the part of the audience who didn't really seem to get why &quot;The World&quot; has began its new revision, the company of the game, CC(Cyber Connect) Corp. had its main building, set on fire by an unknown cause, thus, deleting most of the original online game. The developers then made an idea to make a new &quot;The World&quot; where more people could enjoy. The ratings soon grew rapidly after debut with the help of interested new players though old members seemed to grow tired and quit the game.The story begins with a player named, &quot;Haseo&quot; who was back stabbed by his party members during his first try on the game. These players are branded as &quot;Player-Killers&quot; or &quot;PK&quot; for short. Another player, Ovan took care of them and revived the crushed Haseo, thus begins their friendship.Now, the story more so revolves around Haseo as he copes through his life, in-game. Regularly, you would see him in dilemmas as every decision he makes can affect his friends and enemies. Sometimes, both. The story's pace is rather slow and describes Haseo's life before the events of //G.U., the main plot and climax of Haseo's story.But there's more to the show than just the life of a misguided player. There are other more things where the online game seems to have trouble with. Soon, Haseo these problems will soon make a drastic impact on the protagonist, changing his shy and dependent attitude into a fierce vengeful vigilante.The story overall is absolutely more than decent as it combines mystery and drama with fantasy and gaming though the main plot slows down as different characters have their own story, pausing the plot's pace which is sometimes a drag to some part of the audiences who have little interest with those specific characters.The story ends with a cliffhanger wherein we have to buy the game, .hack//G.U.(all 3 volumes) in order to finalize its story. Now, most people would call this some kind of marketing trickery although the story is appreciable to its own extent, making it a good experience for those audience members who would want a taste of a story about online games which are click in today's society.Art:Animation isn't that much different with //SIGN's though you'd have to agree that it has improved in different aspects. The only problems are usually that they are frequently recycled, making it a less remarkable as the show continues on. Clips often repeat here and there though at different times throughout the story which is like budget-saving in terms of business so there's nothing much to say when it comes to the show's art though the digital effects when the characters draw their weapons never become much of a yawn.Costume and weapon designing can be pleasing to look at, especially when you compare Ovan's look to Haseo's which is an important interpretation to their background. Almost all characters wear the usual part-ethnic, part-medieval attire with a good touch of designing that greatly expresses their form of character. Another not to add is that there are now anthropomorphic characters which are a fresh idea to the franchise since there were limited of those kind in the earlier series.Guns and swords have their fair share of love and war. You would just really want to hold them..... well, most of them.... at times...Sound:The sound effects are good to hear though aren't all that fresh in the world of special effects. The intense blade-bashing and the flickering sounds of weapons drawn are used less than needed which is a real downer although there are some cuteness effects like tail-wags to boot which can really be a reliever at times before and after the action.Soundtracks are frequently used to fill-in the usual silence and some same tracks are played in every episode. Some people might call it a drag though the ethnic genre can really give a good feel in &quot;The World&quot;. It just so happens, that you might get annoyed, hearing the same song over and over again within a span of 26 episodes.Character:This is probably one of the most interesting aspects of the story; the characters' personalities vary a lot and you can't exactly tell which character can be like the other. Earlier, Haseo has this introverted persona and later events convert him into a cruel beast which is an amazing change with a little psychology in there while Ovan is the cool-headed and mysterious character. We see a cute, tiny, fuzzy character named Phyllo who is actually a wise old man behind the mask. Shino, the usual kindhearted, nature-loving damsel, Tabby, your cute cheerful catgirl and others more with some returning characters for fanservice.Overall, they're not too dull to look upon and they can be interesting from time to time.Enjoyment:Honestly, you'd love the game more than the anime itself. Delays are usually bound to happen at times. You'd frequently see a long pause after a short conversation/fight where there will come a time where you just want to fast-forward to the juicy parts. This was where I was really disappointed about the show - only a handful of action is present. If you were less of an action-person and more of a talker and in for the soap opera-like drama, this is more for you but if your in it for the sword-fights and the usual &quot;Saving the world while kicking some ass&quot; thing, don't set your hopes too high or you might just end up pulling your hair or glancing through the window rather than the TV screen.Overall:This show was merely born for the sake of //G.U.  If you played the game but you wanted to know the &quot;why&quot;? You better watch the series. If you haven't played the game yet but you still finished the series, better grab the //G.U. Trilogy movie instead. Saves a lot of money for those who only want to watch rather than play.The show didn't really swept me off my feet but it was fair enough to be engaging so a forgivable lucky 7 should do nicely. of computer ethics.As a fan of the series(more on the games),  I appreciated .hack for being a story that most people today can relate.

Soon, Haseo these problems will soon make a drastic impact on the protagonist, changing his shy and dependent attitude into a fierce vengeful vigilante.The story overall is absolutely more than decent as it combines mystery and drama with fantasy and gaming though the main plot slows down as different characters have their own story, pausing the plot's pace which is sometimes a drag to some part of the audiences who have little interest with those specific characters.The story ends with a cliffhanger wherein we have to buy the game, .hack//G.U.(all 3 volumes) in order to finalize its story. Now, most people would call this some kind of marketing trickery although the story is appreciable to its own extent, making it a good experience for those audience members who would want a taste of a story about online games which are click in today's society.Art:Animation isn't that much different with //SIGN's though you'd have to agree that it has improved in different aspects. The only problems are usually that they are frequently recycled, making it a less remarkable as the show continues on. Clips often repeat here and there though at different times throughout the story which is like budget-saving in terms of business so there's nothing much to say when it comes to the show's art though the digital effects when the characters draw their weapons never become much of a yawn.Costume and weapon designing can be pleasing to look at, especially when you compare Ovan's look to Haseo's which is an important interpretation to their background. Almost all characters wear the usual part-ethnic, part-medieval attire with a good touch of designing that greatly expresses their form of character. Another not to add is that there are now anthropomorphic characters which are a fresh idea to the franchise since there were limited of those kind in the earlier series.Guns and swords have their fair share of love and war. You would just really want to hold them..... well, most of them.... at times...Sound:The sound effects are good to hear though aren't all that fresh in the world of special effects. The intense blade-bashing and the flickering sounds of weapons drawn are used less than needed which is a real downer although there are some cuteness effects like tail-wags to boot which can really be a reliever at times before and after the action.Soundtracks are frequently used to fill-in the usual silence and some same tracks are played in every episode. Some people might call it a drag though the ethnic genre can really give a good feel in &quot;The World&quot;. It just so happens, that you might get annoyed, hearing the same song over and over again within a span of 26 episodes.Character:This is probably one of the most interesting aspects of the story; the characters' personalities vary a lot and you can't exactly tell which character can be like the other. Earlier, Haseo has this introverted persona and later events convert him into a cruel beast which is an amazing change with a little psychology in there while Ovan is the cool-headed and mysterious character. We see a cute, tiny, fuzzy character named Phyllo who is actually a wise old man behind the mask. Shino, the usual kindhearted, nature-loving damsel, Tabby, your cute cheerful catgirl and others more with some returning characters for fanservice.Overall, they're not too dull to look upon and they can be interesting from time to time.Enjoyment:Honestly, you'd love the game more than the anime itself. Delays are usually bound to happen at times. You'd frequently see a long pause after a short conversation/fight where there will come a time where you just want to fast-forward to the juicy parts. This was where I was really disappointed about the show - only a handful of action is present. If you were less of an action-person and more of a talker and in for the soap opera-like drama, this is more for you but if your in it for the sword-fights and the usual &quot;Saving the world while kicking some ass&quot; thing, don't set your hopes too high or you might just end up pulling your hair or glancing through the window rather than the TV screen.Overall:This show was merely born for the sake of //G.U.  If you played the game but you wanted to know the &quot;why&quot;? You better watch the series. If you haven't played the game yet but you still finished the series, better grab the //G.U. Trilogy movie instead. Saves a lot of money for those who only want to watch rather than play.The show didn't really swept me off my feet but it was fair enough to be engaging so a forgivable lucky 7 should do nicely."", ""Okay so if you haven't seen any of the .Hack series or played the game you will be confused.....very confused. Yes the con you on buying the games to know more of the story...so it goes.... .Hack//Sign, .Hack//Dusk, The Games -&gt; .Hack//Infection, .Hack//Mutation, .Hack//Outbreak, .Hack//Quarantine, .Hack//Fragment (Not released in the US), Then .Hack//Roots...then after .Hack//Roots comes the other GU games if you want to know more X3.StoryThe story is what you could call a continuation when i first saw .Hack//roots i was a bit confused on what was going on until i ran into spoilers then it kind of all made sense. So yeah reading...the manga's and playing the games can help you understand  the story. What i love about the .Hack series is it all connects together as a whole so  .Hack//roots is just another chapter added to the story. The plot is seireus and interesting it just makes you want to know more on the Twilight about Haseo and everything. It has a mysterious feel you just want more but with all .Hack series there all have that feel.ArtI love the art in .Hack//Roots its very detailed in the backgrounds and the structure of the characters. I didn't really feel anything unique about it just that it was structured and the animation was very nice. Just in love with the overly created character design and the overall flow of it is very nice.SoundI have to say that this is one of the rare anime's that has a great dub i really loved the English and the Japanese both i think there both great. The music~ Its not as great as the .Hack//Sign OST but it still has great music. See-Saw does the ending song and Ali Project does the beginning~ they do most the songs in .Hack//Roots i love them all &lt;3. If your a fan of See-Saw or Ali Project you'll deafently love the OST to .Hack//Roots.Character'sI love love love the characters in .Hack//roots it makes you of course want to know more about them outside there character they play in the game. They have this mysterious feel about all of them that makes you want to know more about them which i love! And of course you don't get to know much about them in .Hack//Roots since it continues off in GU. But just the overall feel of the characters i love. Tabby and Felo is probably the most you'll know about a character in .Hack//roots which is interesting still overall the characters are great once you know more about them in the manga's and games. Overall i like the uniqueness of the characters personality's, Haseo is probably the first iv seen of a character like  him.EnjoymentI personally really enjoyed watching this series  i really had allot of fun watching to see what would happen next you kind of get suck in with the relationships which there are a few and the mysterious of the anime that never gets solved...unless like iv said you play the games or read the continuation of the manga.OverallOverall i gave this anime a 10~ I think you have to be a real .Hack fan to enjoy this series and understand what its all about.

The main character is a new player named Haseo and...everything pretty much revolves around him, he gets recruited to this guild which is dedicated on finding this secret item by their guild master ""Ovan"". I do like this kind of story compared to the rest, maybe because I can relate somewhat to their situation, whenever I start to play a video game there\'s always rumors about a certain item or something that not all players can obtain, and that itself already gives me the drive to try and look for it, and I\'m sure many of you experienced the same. The story gets a bit complicated as new characters are introduced as well as familiar ones. Overall the story is quite interesting but still not enough for me to be totally ""hooked on""ArtThe art was really good, I\'m not surprised though because it was made in 2006, so there was bound to be some 3D graphics placed in it. But they did a good job in placed them though, there are some animes out there that totally fail at combining 2D artwork to 3D artwork and it just makes them look awkward, the fact that the setting is in a video game it\'s understandable as to why there would be 3D stuff once in a while.CharacterThe characters were really great, I personally liked Haseo because he had the most growth out of everyone and that\'s what the main role is for the protagonist. You can truly see from Episode one to twenty six the experience and situations that he\'s gone through, and final result at the last episode. Ovan was a character that emitted mystery and myth, and that already gave him that cool suave kind of aura around him, which I\'m not surprised since his character design was pretty cool, I mean come on a giant lock on some kind of mechanism as a left arm? How awesome is that.Overall, the whole anime wasn\'t as bad as I thought it would be, it was the first .hack series that I watched out of all of them and thinking back now it\'s definitely my favourite. From what I heard from friends, Haseo is a really badass character in the games and when I have the chance to play, I can\'t wait to see what all the hype was about.cheers. everything pretty much revolves around him, he gets recruited to this guild which is dedicated on finding this secret item by their guild master ""Ovan"".

You meet the characters, the mysterious Ovan, who saves Haseo and thus makes him the root of gossip. The first ten episodes are actually fairly enjoyable. They are all looking for the virus cores, and the mysterious key of the twilight. Meanwhile they are being watched and attacked by the group TaN.

This is going to be short cause honestly I can\'t find much to say about this series.STORY:It was okay. It had the potential to be so good; at one point I was very intrigued...but it fell short a bit. For one, the ending isn\'t even an ending...nothing is resolved! The only thing that could be called ""resolved"" is that the characters finally know what they ""have to do"". But...it\'s never revealed to the viewer as to what that exactly is.

It has astoundish storytelling, great soundtracks and likeable charakters. I have to warn you though: If you are not a fan of long dialogs and little action, or didn't like SIGN, you should stay away from roots.Story 9:Like its predecessor, roots has a well written story. While it is nothing completly unique, it still manages to draw the viewer in and makes them want to unravel the mysteries behind it.

And it\'s sad it\'s kind of bashed, because Roots was a really good installment in the .hack// Series. My favorite has and probably will always be SIGN but I found Roots to be very enjoyable at the least.In terms of the story it struck a fine balance of keeping in the nature of .hack in general with out going over the SAME OLD STORY. While it re-introduced the story of the mystic ""Key of the Twilight"" as explored in .hack//SIGN and it\'s sequel quartet. Bringing in all...new characters, giving the classic \'The World\' a make over with all new classes was the change needed. Of course the story of the .hackers was great and so was the story and drama of Tsukasa in .hack//SIGN and that was good for those, but it was time for a change..hack//Roots goes back to the darker more somber story line after it\'s campy epilogue-like predecessor .hack//Legend of the Twilight (aka .hack//DUSK) which was refreshing change. I can\'t say I liked Legend straying so far from it\'s roots (no pun intended) of it\'s predecessor of SIGN, though it\'s certainly understandable why. But again I felt it was far better to keep on the darker side of the story line, which is why SIGN captivated me in the first place.The story dwells much more into the dark human psyche of our personal demons, and can show every character has a purpose for playing ""The World"" that to me is the darker end of why people like to play games for hours on end. Like with SIGN I felt captivated and relatable to every character. I was able to care about them on such personal levels. It\'s amazing to see the changes all the characters go through, as the series progresses, which made them much more dynamic foil characters. I recall in SIGN the only one who really changed was Tsukasa. So it was a new direction that worked.You\'ll notice a big difference between Haseo and Tsukasa, which is something I found worked well. I thought the idea of Haseo\'s power-binge to avenge the the PKing of Shino was a brilliant concept, and added to sympathy for his character or otherwise maybe more antagonizing concepts. Haseo\'s journey into the black abyss of PKKing actually really contributes to the GU storyline.The overall storytelling didn\'t stay as strong as SIGN. It started off pretty typically, with the set up and the world-of-the-play but soon dissolved into a pretty weak middle, and picked up slightly at the end. The middle episodes that don\'t involve Haseo feel much like cheap fillers that simply aren\'t that needed. It could have stood to be a little shorter in length even though it stands at 26 episodes. That\'s not to say the entire middle is weak, there are some great episodes in the middle such as ""The Forest of Pain"" arc, and Haseo\'s ever growing into the ""Terror of Death."" Other than that, episodes that show attempts by Tabby and others to form a Medic Union or any episode that features Tabby alone, pretty much fall right away.As I mentioned earlier Roots is a plug-in story to .hack//G.U. for the PS2, so in the end you will want to play the games to continue the story line. (or you can read the novels). Again it\'s kind of sad Roots takes a lot of flak for that, because I think it\'s a clever and very unique way to extend a story line. SIGN in some ways was like that as it all lead into .hack//Infection.Ali Project\'s music, was fair to mostly mediocre. Project I am coming to like their work quite a bit, but it was a strange direction and style compared to Kajiura\'s score for SIGN. I was taken aback by it, but it has grown on me enough that I find it okay but still not good as I\'ve come to expect when Mashimo is the director. It\'s almost deceptive at first because one of the first after-theme piece you hear is very well composed and orchestrated, but after that it\'s pretty dull, inattentive, and flat. You will also hear a few pieces that sound eerily similar to works by Danny Elfman which doesn\'t help the case of the music get any better. It\'s also at times poorly place and orchestrated. Ali Project has provided a good original score with Avenger, but Roots is considerably dull in comparison to SIGN\'s musical score. On the other hand Kajiura\'s opening theme with FictionJunction YUUKA is a really unique theme, much different than Obsession almost more like a melancholy and ""searching for"" or ""yearning for"" theme.In the end ROOTS is good but not great. The introduction of more action and more tension helped the story but still I think SIGN will have the stronger storyline. I can\'t speak for all fans because some might hate it, others might love it, or some will find it in-between. Absolutely there are aspects about it that could have been better. Not likely Roots will go down as the greatest chapter of .hack especially with it\'s relationship to GU which by the way is a rather fun game for the story experience. It\'s both a pro and a con at the same time being directly tied into GU so if you want the full experience of the story it is vital to play GU or otherwise get a grasp of the story in another way. new characters, giving the classic \'The World\' a make over with all new classes was the change needed.

The middle episodes that don\'t involve Haseo feel much like cheap fillers that simply aren\'t that needed. It could have stood to be a little shorter in length even though it stands at 26 episodes. That\'s not to say the entire middle is weak, there are some great episodes in the middle such as ""The Forest of Pain"" arc, and Haseo\'s ever growing into the ""Terror of Death."" Other than that, episodes that show attempts by Tabby and others to form a Medic Union or any episode that features Tabby alone, pretty much fall right away.As I mentioned earlier Roots is a plug-in story to .hack//G.U. for the PS2, so in the end you will want to play the games to continue the story line. (or you can read the novels). Again it\'s kind of sad Roots takes a lot of flak for that, because I think it\'s a clever and very unique way to extend a story line. SIGN in some ways was like that as it all lead into .hack//Infection.Ali Project\'s music, was fair to mostly mediocre. Project I am coming to like their work quite a bit, but it was a strange direction and style compared to Kajiura\'s score for SIGN. I was taken aback by it, but it has grown on me enough that I find it okay but still not good as I\'ve come to expect when Mashimo is the director. It\'s almost deceptive at first because one of the first after-theme piece you hear is very well composed and orchestrated, but after that it\'s pretty dull, inattentive, and flat. You will also hear a few pieces that sound eerily similar to works by Danny Elfman which doesn\'t help the case of the music get any better. It\'s also at times poorly place and orchestrated. Ali Project has provided a good original score with Avenger, but Roots is considerably dull in comparison to SIGN\'s musical score. On the other hand Kajiura\'s opening theme with FictionJunction YUUKA is a really unique theme, much different than Obsession almost more like a melancholy and ""searching for"" or ""yearning for"" theme.In the end ROOTS is good but not great. The introduction of more action and more tension helped the story but still I think SIGN will have the stronger storyline. I can\'t speak for all fans because some might hate it, others might love it, or some will find it in-between. Absolutely there are aspects about it that could have been better. Not likely Roots will go down as the greatest chapter of .hack especially with it\'s relationship to GU which by the way is a rather fun game for the story experience. It\'s both a pro and a con at the same time being directly tied into GU so if you want the full experience of the story it is vital to play GU or otherwise get a grasp of the story in another way.', ""I finished the series and I really loved the plot but the producers didn't really carry is out right.Okay, good animation does not include focusing on someone's face for over 5 minutes. Shino and Haseo were hugging at the waterfall for like 10 minutes. =.= Seriously, someone's gonna get bored sooner or later. The producers should of at least show them in different angles of something. If the producers were trying to burn off some time in the episodes, this is probably the worst way of doing it.The art was pretty horrendous. At every scene there's something wrong with a character's face. At the...begining it wasn't that bad but toward the middle, the art went down another level.The sound was one of the higher points in this anime. Most of it was made by Ali Project which fit the story pretty well.I rather liked Haseo's personality in the begining of the series but when they changed him to be a nice guy, I started to hate him. There was barely any development in the characters, okay besides Haseo's personality doing a complete U turn and that was it. begining it wasn't that bad but toward the middle, the art went down another level.The sound was one of the higher points in this anime.

As I must be semi-professional, I should hurry and talk about the important stuff. Roots' biggest triumph, in my opinion, is it's characters. While I feel this had a much darker tone than Twilight, other than the depressing sister in a coma thing, Roots' character made the dark tone by their drama and interactions that inevitably either end...in pain or false hope. I can't lie the fact that this one only lets up on it's dark tone a few times usually thanks to a select few of characters. Next, it's music was something that gained my fondness and was quickly added to my vast playlist. All and all I loved the anime because of how deep I felt it was and it's art to me was inspiring to see. Sadly I feel like I've been rambling, and should probably leave before I get PK'd. Well so long everybody! in pain or false hope. I can't lie the fact that this one only lets up on it's dark tone a few times usually thanks to a select few of characters.

This time around tho I enjoyed the story part much more than most of the .hack Anime. I could follow it in more of an enjoyable way, had more intrigue and interesting points. I felt it had nice progression and memorable moments.For the most part it wasn\'t as serious and dark as previous seasons, but nevertheless it went darker.✦Art & SoundIt was good, some cool fights as well, cool powers and very superb MMORPG game feel. Hence comes the music,...which was absolutely fun. Lot of memorable and catchy OST. Probably 1 of my favorite soundtrack was the town music. Really gave a great old-school mmo feel.✦CharacterHigh score because of interesting variety, various characters importance and growing into them as well their development. Biggest complaint would be the main character. He was a really annoying t***. Got tired and annoyed of him fair amount of times. Quite annoying personality. Some sort of pseudo-delinquent.✦Enjoyment & OverallApparently it\'s kinda prequel to the game .hack//GU , now I did watch the gu as well, but that is another review. But will quite surely play the game since it\'s on the steam.Anyhow, the most enjoyable .hack so far I\'ve seen. which was absolutely fun. Lot of memorable and catchy OST.

Now continue reading on if you want to know why.I watched .hack//SIGN over a decade ago, so I can\'t compare it with that anime in a very detailed matter. However, I can definitely say the music took a nosedive. The music in .hack//SIGN is simply one of the best ever made and leagues above the music in ROOTS because Kaijura was the main person behind it. But in ROOTS, Kaijura only did the OP music.In ROOTS, the music felt off in many scenes. For example, when something serious...is happening, you hear some comedic opera singer bull**** that just doesn\'t match the mood at all. I can go on and on about how mediocre the music was for this show. Simply, the music was horrible.The story was chockfull of filler. Related to filler is the catgirl character named Tabi. Everytime she appeared, I just wanted to kill myself and became more frustrated with this show. She is the most cringey example of stereotypical NYAA NYAA anime cat girl stereotype. It became apparent this show was going to be bad the moment the ""Guild"" scenes started to pop up a bit too much. I can only assume it\'s setting up the viewer for the games that come after. Still, the repetitive, formulaic way of cutting from the important scenes back to Tabi scenes was really what killed this show for me. And that leads to my next point. Whenever an interesting fight or an interesting conversation is about to start, they cut away to something else happening in another area for what I could only guess are budget reasons. Also, there was a lot of unnecessary flashbacks (DBZ syndrome) and lots of static shots which made it even more obvious this was cheaply made anime. The fights were not that interesting and again, whenever the fights would get intense, they cut away to another scene. I always found myself asking myself ""What just happened?"" because the story moves around so much and way too many trivial things happen and before you know it, they\'re already talking about something else.Regarding the other characters, most of them don\'t matter. The only ones that mattered in my opinion are Haseo, Shino, Ovan, and some mysterious observers that pulls the strings in the background. This should have just been a movie or a few episode OVA focused on those characters only, not 26 episodes. This had me thinking the whole time that this show was a cheap way to make something a 26 episode boxset price. Well, I\'m here to tell you that that is exactly why this show is so bad. Whoever produced this thought they could rip off the consumers by adding in bunch of filler to make it an expensive buy. So I\'m writing this review to tell you it\'s not worth your time unless you are a hardcore .hack collector or a completionist. I\'m a completionist. That is the only reason I watched it, and I want to play the games just to see the rest of the story the way it was intended to be ingested. So unfortunately, I forced myself to sit through this mediocrity. I\'ve never, EVER, upped the playback speed for an anime, but this was the first anime to ever make me play it at x1.5 speed. The characters talk ridiculously slow, everything happens at a ridiculous slow pace (back to my point about the flashbacks) to make it 26 episodes. It almost makes me not want to play the games, and I\'m dreading having to deal with that catgirl again.This is one of those rare times where I will say I\'d watch this English dubbed. I\'m not saying the subbed version is worse. I just couldn\'t bear reading the subtitles because I felt like I was reading dialogue for the stupidest show ever, so listening to it in English at least gave me a break.So to sum everything up, yes, this show was horrible enough to make me watch it in English.

Corrector Yui,https://myanimelist.net/anime/111/Corrector_Yui,"['Initially airing in 1999 to 2000, Corrector Yui has only very recently been fully translated to English, which is why there hasn\'t been much discussion or reviews for it.[Theme and tone]Despite being of the magical girl genre, this series\' thematic probably has a lot more in common with something like Mega Man Battle Network and even .Hack//Sign, rather than the typical magical girl anime. Its thematic similarities to .Hack//Sign extend to some of Sign\'s darker themes as well. Notably, the uploading of one\'s consciousness to a virtual world (and the potential consequences that could arise from that) is a major theme in both series.While this...series is pretty light, humorous, and upbeat most of the time, it occasionally has surprisingly dark moments in the story that can range from serious to grim or unsettling. These moments create a nice tonal contrast when they pop up. Much of the story and interactions between characters can also often be surprisingly thoughtful, particularly how side characters interact with Yui and how they develop as characters as a result.[Plot]There are two ""arcs"" in Corrector Yui that are essentially halved up like a ""season 1/season 2"" kind of deal. The structure of each half of the anime follows that the introduction starts off with a bang that sets the overall plot in motion, then for about the first half of the arc it focuses on introducing and interacting with new characters while the plot partially progresses in the background of each episode, occasionally with some well-executed foreshadowing of plot elements that you likely won\'t see coming. Characters introduced in the first half of each arc continue to be relevant later on.In the second half of each arc, the series directly focuses on the main plot and its major characters. A healthy helping of character development occurs in general, though the first halves of each arc in particular serve as nice build ups to the plot and character developments in the second half of each arc (rather than otherwise feeling rushed).It\'s worth pointing out that the series has a nice sense of subtlety when foreshadowing major plot elements, this sense of subtlety also typically reflects onto how the characters act. It doesn\'t quite hit you over the head with how characters really feel in regards to more serious moments. I found this nuance to be refreshing, and it helps make things more tonally consistent in these serious moments.Overall, I\'d say Corrector Yui has a more complex plot than most magical girl series, along with a pretty good build-up to major plot events. Its sense of subtlety will likely ensure that the twists in the story stay surprising. Prior to watching all of it, I had read claims that it had virtually no real plot or backstory. Thankfully those claims would appear to have been a straight-up lie, or perhaps the result of rather poor media literacy.[Characters]The protagonist is the titular Yui. She is very kind-hearted, but can be childish and clumsy. Amusingly, given the setting of this anime, she is extremely inept at using computers. She isn\'t a flawless combatant either, and there are many times she gets overpowered or needs help to overcome obstacles. Yui\'s character develops really satisfyingly, and she actually proves to be very perceptive and sensible as the story goes on. When things get tough, she is persistently kind-hearted almost to a fault, willing to take significant risks to herself if it means a happier outcome for others. I found her character to be very endearing, and I think she fits the role of protagonist in this kind of story perfectly.The cast of characters are likeable and have a diverse range of personalities that work well together, particularly since Yui\'s interactions with each of them are quite entertaining. The interaction between Yui and a certain antagonist (to be vague for the sake of keeping this spoiler free) is particularly interesting and I feel should be noted. They\'re both great foil characters to each other, and she is the primary factor for his character growth. It\'s one of my favourite character dynamics in general.The primary antagonist of the first arc creates a nice sense of mystery regarding his motives, and I feel he served to be a pretty great antagonist in general. The second arc\'s antagonist doesn\'t have motives that are quite as engrossing, but the circumstances surrounding them are quite interesting, managing to make good use of a primary theme of the series.[Comedy]Comedy is fairly prevalent in Corrector Yui, often taking on a light-hearted humorous tone. It\'s also my personal favourite genre of anime, and this got a lot of laughs out of me to the point that I\'d say the comedic aspect is one of the better parts of the show. Of course, comedy is subjective to some extent, so feel free to disagree. An important part of the execution of comedy lies in the quality of voice acting, which I\'d say was done rather well.Thankfully the comedic aspects are placed and blended in sensibly; without at all interfering with the tone and pacing of more serious moments. Which I\'d say is worth mentioning since this does have important portions of the plot that are genuinely dark and/or serious.[Art/animation]90\'s anime typically have my favourite artistic styles, and Corrector Yui provides as such. The linework, shades of colours, and overall style are quite likeable for me, and it\'s all pretty consistently drawn as well. I very much enjoyed the visuals in general.I found the animation to be pretty solid, and the fight scenes are usually quite dynamic. Like other anime of its kind, it has transformation and special attack sequences that are reused when appropriate.[Music]The soundtrack is sincere, cute, bubbly, and somewhat adventurous. I enjoy it to the point that I\'ve found myself looking it up just to listen to it randomly. It kind of gives me the vibe of a nostalgic video game\'s soundtrack (though I\'ve only watched this in 2021). I particularly adore the opening of the first half of the series, the singer of which has a rather elegant, soulful, jazzy voice. Easily one of my favourite openings ever.[Enjoyment/Conclusion]Corrector Yui is among the best hidden gems of anime I\'ve had the pleasure of experiencing. I enjoyed just about every aspect of it more than I was expecting to, ranging from the story, characters, voice acting, music, and overall style and visuals. I imagine that it\'s rather obscure simply because it has only been fully translated recently (from the time of this review). Had it been given the translation and marketing it deserved, I\'d be surprised if it wouldn\'t have been held in the same high regard as other major series of its kind. series is pretty light, humorous, and upbeat most of the time, it occasionally has surprisingly dark moments in the story that can range from serious to grim or unsettling.

Which I\'d say is worth mentioning since this does have important portions of the plot that are genuinely dark and/or serious.[Art/animation]90\'s anime typically have my favourite artistic styles, and Corrector Yui provides as such. The linework, shades of colours, and overall style are quite likeable for me, and it\'s all pretty consistently drawn as well. I very much enjoyed the visuals in general.I found the animation to be pretty solid, and the fight scenes are usually quite dynamic. Like other anime of its kind, it has transformation and special attack sequences that are reused when appropriate.[Music]The soundtrack is sincere, cute, bubbly, and somewhat adventurous. I enjoy it to the point that I\'ve found myself looking it up just to listen to it randomly. It kind of gives me the vibe of a nostalgic video game\'s soundtrack (though I\'ve only watched this in 2021). I particularly adore the opening of the first half of the series, the singer of which has a rather elegant, soulful, jazzy voice. Easily one of my favourite openings ever.[Enjoyment/Conclusion]Corrector Yui is among the best hidden gems of anime I\'ve had the pleasure of experiencing. I enjoyed just about every aspect of it more than I was expecting to, ranging from the story, characters, voice acting, music, and overall style and visuals. I imagine that it\'s rather obscure simply because it has only been fully translated recently (from the time of this review). Had it been given the translation and marketing it deserved, I\'d be surprised if it wouldn\'t have been held in the same high regard as other major series of its kind.', 'Finally! I\'ve been wanting to give my review on this anime ever since i began watching this wonderful anime and finish it. And now that i\'ve done thoses, i\'m ready to give my thoughts on this anime.But first things first, here\'s the rundown:Corrector Yui is an anime series that aired in 1999 and ended in 2000 and made by noneother than Nippon Animation. I have already mentioned about Nippon Animation multiple times already, so there\'s no need to introduce them again.The show was created by Kia Asamiya, who has been involved in the anime industry since the 80s. As he\'s usually known as one of...the key animation for Fist Of The North Star. But he\'s also known for creating other series such as Silent Mobius and Compiler.The show had a huge cult following ever since it\'s airing in other countries like Mexico or Brazil.So what do i have to say about this one? Here\'s my full thoughts on it:First, the story:The story takes place somewhere in the 2000s. Where the world is dominated with computers and it\'s massive central network known as ""ComNet"". Which is linked to each computers all over the world to become a single global computer system and designed to be served as a interest to mankind. However, Grosser, the one supercomputer who manages all of this, decided to take over ComNet and corrupt the entire world with viruses.That\'s where we are introduced to our main heroine of the show: Yui Kasuga. An highschool girl who wasn\'t too good at handling computers. One day, she met an corrector software named ""IR"" who chosen her to become the one who will fix all the wrong doings of Grosser. Now it\'s up to her to become ""Corrector Yui"" to find out why Grosser\'s doing all of this wrong doings and put a stop to his evil schemes and his henchmen.There\'s also a second part/half of the show that continues the story of the anime after the Grosser Saga, but i won\'t go into the spoiler territory. The rest is up to you to see for yourselves.Anyway, this anime is absolutely awesome! What i love about the anime is it\'s worldbuilding surrounding ComNet. We are given more time to see a great variety of networks that Yui and the other correctors visit. Such as the Western Net, the Mystery net, the Adventure Net, the Ocean Net, the Space net and so much more.Not to mention the fact that the story is awesome in it\'s own right. As the series progesses, we get to learn more about why Grosser and his henchmen would try to take over ComNet and then when we reach to the second half of the show, things starts to get more interesting as we get to know more about the mystery surrounding a certain character that will play a role for the Ai Saga.Also, after the commercial breaks, there\'s a small section called ""Yui\'s Comic Strip Theatre"" which tells a small story in four panels. Which serves a cute way to give us some funny and really adorable small stories to see before getting back to the show.And then we have the characters themselves. Well i can safely say that every single one of them are great. You have some that are serious and others not so much, but they all serve a purpose to the story as the series progresses.There\'s far too many characters that i know that would take forever to introduce, so i\'ll just give my thoughts on the main character herself.First you have Yui Kasuga (I call her Yui-chan because she\'s so cute). What i really love about Yui-chan so much is her looks and her personality. She\'s such an adorable sweetheart that shows how funny she can be, but at the same time how empathetic she can be for the A.I. programs and does anything she can to help them. She\'s also quite a charming person who has a will to cheer people up even if people are at their lowest. Also, she\'s so adorable when she tries so hard to do something as simple as trying to type on the computer which made me smile and giggle.There are also the correctors themselves who also help out Yui in certain situations where she needs the powers to Initialize the bugs. Some would give her water powers, one would give her earth ones and the other gives the fire one.There are also a few differences that makes the correctors standout from each others. For example, Rescue has the power to heal people, while Follow can transform into each people.And then you have the villains themselves. Grosser, as i said before, is one of the main villains of the show and the one who\'s tired of taking care of ComNet so he decided to take over the world. But then you have his four henchmen. War Wolf, who\'s one snarky son of bitch who keeps his snarky personality towards his companions, Jaggy, who despite being one by strong man, he\'s quite knowledgeable one who knows how to prepare himself to fight, Virus, who\'s the most intelligent one of the group, is armed with light sabers and computer viruses and finally you have Freeze, who\'s the only female in the group, can use her ice powers to freeze her opponents.each and every characters have their own powers and distinctive personalities on them. Making them all stand out from each others.So what about the animation? The animation here is spectacular even for 1999 ajd 2000. The character designs look really cool, giving each and every characters their own unique style of designs and dresses that they wear. The animation is also pretty great as well. very smooth and gorgeous to look at. Even the worldbuilding in ComNet looks amazing as well. very detailed, basically, the animators took the time to draw certain areas very well.So basically, i barely even seen any errors or goofs in the animation. Even if some episodes don\'t look as good as the others, still looks good enough to make it watchable. So Nippon Animation really did outdone themselves with the animation here.The sound is also great as well. The music is also pretty great to listen to. Especially the opening and ending theme song of the first half of the show. Which are the most memorable to me. Eien To In Basho is easily one of my favourite opening theme songs of all time. Unlike most of opening theme songs for anime that are given a more upbeat and energetic opening to keep you pumped for what you\'re about to see, this song is more calm and relaxing to listen. It also helps the fact that the opening animation is pretty good as well.The second opening and ending theme songs are pretty good as well, but nowhere near as catchy as the first and ending theme songs.I only watched the Japanese dub of the anime since i\'m more confortable with it than i\'d do with any Portuguese dubs. And as far as the voice acting goes, it\'s pretty great as well. Everyone did a great job giving more life to the characters\' voices. Including Makiko Oomoto (Nintendo\'s Kirby\'s seiyuu) as Yui-chan. She gave such an adorable voice for her and her performance is very well done. The same can be said with other seiyuus like Kotono Mitsuishi (Sailor Moon\'s seiyuu) voicing Freeze, Tomohiro Nishimura voicing IR and more.So overall, guys, after finishing the entire anime all the way through, i can safely say that this Nippon Animation\'s best anime they have ever created and the most original they created.The characters are amazing, the story is awesome and epic, the animation is great, the voice acting is outstanding, the music is awesome and overall, this was a great anime to watch up til the end of the show.Sadly, only 18 episodes has been officially translated by Viz Media and finding the DVDs for theses episodes are very rare to find. But luckily, Old Castle Fansubs did picked up the rest of the show and translated the entire anime for all of us. So you\'ll just have to torrent theses episodes and watch them for yourselves.But seriously, though, go watch this anime. It\'s an anime that can easily entertain you through out your time. You won\'t regret it.And i give this anime an perfect score of 10 out of 10. I think it\'s an epic masterpiece that i cannot forget!Anyway, this has been my review of Corrector Yui. My name\'s José Diogo and i\'ll see you next time. the key animation for Fist Of The North Star.

My name\'s José Diogo and i\'ll see you next time.', ""As of the time of writing this review, the craze in the anime scene is isekai. As of the time of this title's release date, (one of) the craze(s) was the success of massive genre defining titles like Sailor Moon and Cardcaptors -- the mahou shoujo genre.This anime original is pretty much exactly a cashgrab akin to today's filler isekai titles that get an anime adaptation. The show's episode and plot structure is episodic with little to no continuity between one episode and the next. The show is effectively a computer virus take on the battle-mahou-shoujo with the same ditzy heroine tropes and other...90s comedy tropes. There is virtually little to no backstory or even plot besides transforming every episode to fight monster-of-the-episode about 50+ times.Characterization-wise, there are pretty much nothing but caricatures of the memorable characters of genre.I suppose a child of maybe age 12 or lower may enjoy this anime but for the most part, this show offers nothing that another title of the same genre cannot offer. Moreover it's take on the year 2020's scene of computers is pretty inaccurate (not that the low score had anything to do with this, for more details, see my profile page for the exact rating criteria) and for anyone watching as of the time of this review, you will have a good cringe at what the anime's idea of a computer or advanced AI/technology is. 90s comedy tropes.

Vampire Knight,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3457/Vampire_Knight,"['StorySome aspects of the setup I liked, like the school divided into day class human students and night class vampire students.  I would have loved the human heroine who patrols the grounds and night, making sure the vampires are  in line, except...Yuki was TOTALLY lame. Episode after episode was her chasing after Zero, stupidly getting herself into danger, being saved by a male lead, and then feeling guilty.  Really weak story, with few redeeming features.  The characters didn\'t grow, events didn\'t build up into a climax, and the resolution was contrived and lukewarn.  It was very much one of those...animes annoyingly full of longing, melodramatic gazes and characters saying each others\' names in quiet, tortured voices.ArtThe art was all right.  Yuki was cute, Zero was handsome, and Kaname was gorgeous.  The other vampires were pretty lame though, just a bunch of generic bishounen who were totally loyal to Kaname cuz the mangaka said so.  I found Yuki\'s absolutely massive eyes irritating.  I\'ve seen a lot of anime by now so I\'m used to the huge eyes, but hers actually distracted me at times, maybe because the story had so little pull.SoundGood soundtrack.  Lots of classical, which I enjoyed, and I like both the intro and ending songs.CharacterThe characters are what I disliked the most, especially Yuki.  She was an extremely boring protagonist.  She carried around a cool-looking staff that seemed to have magical properties, but never once used it well.  Usually, she\'d just bring it out only to drop it when someone said something upsetting or when she tripped.  She was then promptly rescued by Kaname or Zero.  Maybe the next season will explain why she is in the middle of all of this, but I think season 1 should give the heroine SOME value.  Sure, she was very generous with Zero, but I hate shoujo heroines who only stand out because they\'re SO good at being martyrs.  As for the other characters, they weren\'t much better.  Zero spent most of his time wanting to die.  Kaname constantly rescued Yuki, yet never explained her importance to him.  A little mystery is good, but too much ""she\'s so precious to me but I won\'t say why"" gets boring and annoying.  The ""villain"" only appeared at the very, very end, and I found their behavior inconsistent and what happened to them way too abrupt and anticlimactic.EnjoymentI don\'t have high standards.  I might\'ve adored this show, if Yuki hadn\'t been such a weakling.  What I usually enjoy in anime shows is watching the protagonist learn and grow.  It\'s okay if the protagonist starts out ordinary or weak or with a massive crush, so long as they become stronger.  Yuki really didn\'t, though.  Kaname kept protecting her without explaining anything.  Zero usually pushed her away and also refused to share things.  She had a big heart, but I like heroines who\'re genuinely strong, not just good at sacrificing themselves.  Sorry, but anyone can say, ""Bite me.""OverallMaybe this is a good show for teenage girls, but I think anyone who just finished Ouran Host Club or Hana Yori Dango or other such shows will be disappointed by the heroine.  Most shoujo is so entertaining because the heroines are so intelligent, or plucky, or independent.  Yuki was none of those things.

Keywords for VK are drama, emotional struggles and tragic pasts. Throw in a dash of vampire, and there you have Vampire Knight in all its glory.The story revolves around the students of the Cross Academy, which is divided into the Day Class for humans, and the Night Class for Vampires. The main characters, Zero and Yuki, both have very sad pasts; Zero had his family killed by a vampire, and Yuki's first memory was a vampire attacking her. These...pasts, which are revealed fairly early in the series, make a good base for their relationship and their emotional struggles.During the course of the story, the characters face one event/experience after another, which makes room for emotional struggles, lots of character development and, of course, some romance (hey, this is a shojo series after all), though the latter is overshadowed by the other stuff.The artwork is both standard shojo and something else at the same time. We have the pretty bishonen boys in place, complete with all the fallen-head-over-heels girls, and there's also the standard shojo eyes; large, with pupils that are almost larger than the actual eyes. But since the series has a darker, sadder tone to it, there's no lack on that end either. The coloring is often very dark, and the occasional lighting effect helps on this aspect of the series.The soundtrack is good, with sad pieces helping the sad mood, and overall good quality. There's nothing spectacular about the soundtrack though, and while the OP theme is very good, the ED theme isn't very cool, though it fits with the dark mood of the series. Voice acting is perfect; the moods are portrayed very well and there's an overall good quality.One of the things I love about this series is the characters. I mean, I really love them. They're very deep, with their pasts and emotional struggles. Off course, there's superficial characters as well, but they're mostly supporting characters; the main characters are mostly deep and they have a lot of character development for such a short series. Their relationships with eachother are very deep too, and a pleasure to watch.Overall, I enjoyed the series very much; this is a candidate for the best Spring 2008 anime. It's a bit open at the end, but I just read that there's a second season coming in October, so I'll accept that, and look forward to it.To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =) pasts, which are revealed fairly early in the series, make a good base for their relationship and their emotional struggles.During the course of the story, the characters face one event/experience after another, which makes room for emotional struggles, lots of character development and, of course, some romance (hey, this is a shojo series after all), though the latter is overshadowed by the other stuff.The artwork is both standard shojo and something else at the same time.

This time, it's Vampire Knight. I've only seen 3 episodes and read some manga chapters, even through I can't consider myself as the VK-girl that knows everything, I know quite alot about the story and the characters. Anyway, here we go!Story - 100% [10]If you haven't read the manga or saw some episodes of the anime, you'll probably already have an idea what this is about... Vampires. I say that you're right, but if you watch or read Vampire Knight, you'll find out that it's more than only ''vampires''. Let's start...with the beginning.Vampire Knight revolves between Yuki, Zero and Kaname. Yuki and Zero are Cross-Academy's prefects (guardians). It's their duty to prevent the contact between the Day and the Night-class, even through it's very hard for them because all the girls from the Day-class have a big crush on the guys from the Night-class, that's not very rare because everyone in the Night-class looks gorgeous. Why are prefects needed? To prevent the Day-class of finding out the secret from the Night-class, in reality, all of them are vampires. The ''leader'' of the Night-class is Kaname Kuran, the one who saved Yuki's life when she was little. Ofcourse he's a vampire too and the most powerful of all, a pureblood. Yuki and Zero both live with the chairmain of Cross-Academy, Cross Kaien. Yuki doesn't have any memories from when she was a kid, her memories begin on the day that Kaname saved her from a vampire. Kaname asked the chairman to look after her, and he did. The same goes of Zero, a couple of years later he comes to live with Yuki and the chairmain to, after his parents where killed by a vampire.What is so loveable about all this? Both the anime and the manga have a mysterious feeling to it, that you know that something is going on but you don't know what. You'll also notice and the story gets ''darker'' each time, and that the characters change. It takes a while until you really understand everything because they tell you the story bit by bit, you may also expect some big changes, I warn you. I wish that I could tell you more, but I don't want to spoil it for you guys. I really recommend you guys both the manga and the anime.Animation - 80% [8]Well, the animation. I must say that it's alot better than I expected. Still, I know that alot of manga-fans might be dissapointed. The manga might have better art, but I think that the anime is really well made. They put alot of effort in this, and with succes. If the manga didn't excist, the anime would probably get higher ratings. Well, my opinion is that that the Vampire Knight anime is a good adaptation to the manga, I really think so.Sound -  90% [9]The sound, or better said, the music. The songs that the picked for both the opening and ending where really the right choice for this anime. Futatsu no Kodou to Akai Tsumi is the opening-song, sung by ON/OFF, and I really love it. It really matches the anime and gives you the Vampire Knight-feeling. I really like it. Then, for the ending-song, Still Doll sung by Wakeshima Kanon, was the biggest plus-point for me. I just loved it the first time that I heard it! How come? It's mysterious and matches Vampire Knight perfectly. When you listen to it, I'm sure that you'll also get the feeling that there's something that you don't know yet. For the soundeffects in this anime, I have nothing to complain. When you needed one, you got one, just how it is in real life. The good sound in Vampire Knight made it realistic.Character - 100% [10]Ha, this was a easy one. The characters, you'll absolutely love them when you get to know them! What is good about this is that you don't only get to know Yuki, Zero and Kaname, but also the other people from the Night-Class and other random characters. Let's take Aidou as an example, he's not a main character, still, you know exactly who he is! I'll tell you something about the 3 main characters now.Yuki - I think that you all know her type of character, but Yuki is not the typical ''shoujo'' heroine. No, she's different. You can see that she tries her best to help Zero and get a place in his heart, she really cares alot for others, which might also be her weakness. To save Zero from turning into a Level E, she let him drink her blood. Yuki was attacked as a little girl by a vampire who was fallen to a Level E, and than was saved by Kaname. She has no memories of her parents or who she really is. Because Kaname saved her, she has a great affection for him, and she trusts the vampires in the Night-Class.Zero - He might look like a cold-hearted guy in the beginning, but he really isn't. Zero's family where killed by a vampire, that's why he really hates vampires, all of them. Anyway, in the beginning of the series you'll see him in pain a couple of times, I think alot of you got the picture back then. Yes, when he was attacked he was biten by a vampire, a pureblood. Since he didn't die he will slowly turn into a vampire himself. Since his huge hate for vampires, she fights against the progress with all his might. Zero always has a gun with him, he can use it to kill vampires. He also has a younger twin-brother named Ichiru, but he was not as healthy as Zero (no, he didn't die).Kaname - A pureblood vampire who's respected by everyone in the Night-Class, no, better said, he's the leader. When he gives an order, it's final. Other vampires fear him and he's loved by alot of girls from the Day-Class. Even through he doesn't really care about them, he does care alot for Yuki, which you'll notice right away. You'll understand later why a vampire with so much power as Kaname cares so much for a normal girl like Yuki.I think I told you enough, the point is, the characters WIN!Enjoyment - 100% [10]Enjoyment? Do you even need to ask? I REALLY enjoy this. It's a burden to wait for the episodes to air, but we have no other choice but wait, have we? If you like a mysterious story, vampires and some scary moments, watch Vampire Knight. I'll probably recommend this to everyone because this is something that everyone would like.Overall - 90% [9]What? Miss ''I enjoy-it-so-much'', you didn't gave it a 10!Yes, people, I know what you're thinking. But you guys must remember, that I'd also like to see this from another point of view. Since I have also read a part of the manga, I know how it could have been. I really think that the people who made the Vampire Knight-anime did an awesome job! If you see the original when reading the manga, you might understand why I gave this a 9. Don't forget to watch it now, I'll hunt you!Conclusion: Vampire Knight is an awesome anime/manga with very enjoyable characters and a story! It might be one of the ''must-see's''. Judge for yourself.Okay, minna! This was my review! I hope you didn't dislike it that much, I tried my best in writing it! Love, Erisu... with the beginning.Vampire Knight revolves between Yuki, Zero and Kaname. Yuki and Zero are Cross-Academy's prefects (guardians). It's their duty to prevent the contact between the Day and the Night-class, even through it's very hard for them because all the girls from the Day-class have a big crush on the guys from the Night-class, that's not very rare because everyone in the Night-class looks gorgeous. Why are prefects needed? To prevent the Day-class of finding out the secret from the Night-class, in reality, all of them are vampires. The ''leader'' of the Night-class is Kaname Kuran, the one who saved Yuki's life when she was little. Ofcourse he's a vampire too and the most powerful of all, a pureblood. Yuki and Zero both live with the chairmain of Cross-Academy, Cross Kaien. Yuki doesn't have any memories from when she was a kid, her memories begin on the day that Kaname saved her from a vampire. Kaname asked the chairman to look after her, and he did. The same goes of Zero, a couple of years later he comes to live with Yuki and the chairmain to, after his parents where killed by a vampire.What is so loveable about all this? Both the anime and the manga have a mysterious feeling to it, that you know that something is going on but you don't know what. You'll also notice and the story gets ''darker'' each time, and that the characters change. It takes a while until you really understand everything because they tell you the story bit by bit, you may also expect some big changes, I warn you. I wish that I could tell you more, but I don't want to spoil it for you guys. I really recommend you guys both the manga and the anime.Animation - 80% [8]Well, the animation. I must say that it's alot better than I expected. Still, I know that alot of manga-fans might be dissapointed. The manga might have better art, but I think that the anime is really well made. They put alot of effort in this, and with succes. If the manga didn't excist, the anime would probably get higher ratings. Well, my opinion is that that the Vampire Knight anime is a good adaptation to the manga, I really think so.Sound -  90% [9]The sound, or better said, the music. The songs that the picked for both the opening and ending where really the right choice for this anime. Futatsu no Kodou to Akai Tsumi is the opening-song, sung by ON/OFF, and I really love it. It really matches the anime and gives you the Vampire Knight-feeling. I really like it. Then, for the ending-song, Still Doll sung by Wakeshima Kanon, was the biggest plus-point for me. I just loved it the first time that I heard it! How come? It's mysterious and matches Vampire Knight perfectly. When you listen to it, I'm sure that you'll also get the feeling that there's something that you don't know yet. For the soundeffects in this anime, I have nothing to complain. When you needed one, you got one, just how it is in real life. The good sound in Vampire Knight made it realistic.Character - 100% [10]Ha, this was a easy one. The characters, you'll absolutely love them when you get to know them! What is good about this is that you don't only get to know Yuki, Zero and Kaname, but also the other people from the Night-Class and other random characters. Let's take Aidou as an example, he's not a main character, still, you know exactly who he is!

Judge for yourself.Okay, minna! This was my review! I hope you didn't dislike it that much, I tried my best in writing it! Love, Erisu..."", 'WARNING-- before reading this review, please take into account the fact that I disliked Vampire Knight. If that one statement offends you, please do not read onward. I do not assume any responsibilities for broken monitors, laptops, or mobile devices.Also, if you like dark romance or any romance dealing with vampires, I recommend this to you. See if you like it. Though, if you prefer adventures or are not a fan of things dark, or of soap operas, this is not recommended...:::..:::..No matter what anime it is, the very first question that ever comes to my mind when writing  review is this--...""Where do I start? What do I say?""With Vampire Knight, that question never occurred. I know instantly where to start. Since I\'m such a freak about certain things, when I write reviews I have to write them in this order-- Story, Art, Sound, Character, All in all. but with this anime-- JUST this one-- I\'m going to start with Character, because that is where I know to start and where I feel I need to.Character~Yes. Here we go. /deep breath/ Vampire Knight\'s characters are... awful. Hate me if you wish, but honestly, they\'re just annoying. This show isn\'t *insanely* popular, but it is well known, and I have a large share of romance anime-loving friends, and each one of them referred me to this. I don\'t see why. The characters all have their own tortured pasts and this makes it pretty much uninteresting. It\'s ok if people have a hard enough past to make them interesting-- and not to mention STRONGER-- but Vampire Knight does not do this. They just get weaker because of how hard their past is. I\'ll... show you.Yuki~The supposed heroine, an amnesiac with the only memory of when she was being attacked by a vampire when she was littler. Anything before that, she does not know. She carries around a weapon and is a night guard of sorts, keeping the Night Class and Day Class separate. Does she do a good job at this? ...No. Yuki must always be saved, and whenever she cries someone\'s name they will come. The plot and characters were all so predictable that, when Yuki fell over and dropped her weapon, the next thing she\'d do would be call someone\'s name. That person would then come and completely kick the butt of her attackers. Yay. I predicted this every time, and every time it happened just as it happened in my mind. Yuki was not a heroine, but was nothing more than a weak girl who supposedly wanted to help Zero by sacrificing some of her blood to him. People regenerate blood, vampire (...probably) or human, so it\'s not too much of a sacrifice. They\'ll just get it back later. Nothing special there. And in return for giving her red liquid to him, Zero would come save her. Her weapon\'s only purpose was to be flung around or dropped when she was surprised or something. She irritated me so much that-- ...No, I won\'t say.Zero~...Oh heck. He\'s just a suicidal guy who has a ""secret"". He\'s a vampire. Wooooo. Who knew that was coming? /sarcasm/ All he does is regret his past and be all pathetic over it, and instead of developing he just sits and sighs sadly. Oh, and when Yuki calls out, he rescues her. I think he\'s rather torn between liking Yuki or not, or maybe it\'s just his oh-so-pathetic-feel-bad-for-me past, but he just bugged the crap out of me. Perhaps I am being much too critical for anyone\'s taste, but I feel I need to agree with some of those that gave this a bad review, and point out why. There\'s really no character development here, and when the characters are supposed to develop, it actually just makes them more annoying. There are so many things to dislike about this overused type of personality that I won\'t even point them out, or nobody would read my review because I could make a book out of it. But I\'ll share a few-- as I\'ve stated earlier, he\'s suicidal, yes, but he\'s also a bit cold and unsociable and fights with his own emotions. Doesn\'t he have another side to him? He never really reveals one. At least not in this series. So far, I don\'t think even Vampire Knight: Guilty could bring to life this pathetic show, but I have high hopes for it...Kaname~Do I HAVE to talk about him? Auuugh... He\'s just your average super strong, top of the class, well-liked guy with a ""soft side"" for the protagonist, Yuki. It seems that Kaname and Zero\'s roles are equal-- to ""provide drama"" (yeah, great job at that.) and save Yuki all. the. freaking. time. Yes, he\'s a vampire, and all this other purely annoying stuff, so why does he like Yuki so much? She\'s cute? She\'s helpless? She\'s ""kind""? I don\'t know, I\'m hoping it will be revealed in Vampire Knight: Guilty, but I really don\'t know. Though, I\'m sure it will, because how could an anime go on like this? He seems so obsessed with Yuki (and Yuki so obsessed with him) that it\'s just stupid. Why? I want answers, and I want them in the next season. If I don\'t get them, this show will be in my list of ""Worst 5 anime I have ever seen"". So, yes, if they reveal some of their secrets, I\'ll be... uh, happy. I guess. But for the most part, Kaname is a guy who doesn\'t make sense, and he\'s too much of a mystery. Mysteries, yes. But I can only take so much of ""I\'m keeping everything to myself and acting cool yet obsessed with this girl for no reason"". Auuuugh. I just... no. Never mind. If I go further, I\'ll be ranting for the entire day, which I don\'t have time to do, so let\'s move on.Other characters~Wait, there were other characters? Wow! I hadn\'t even noticed! Oh, now that you say it, I do remember some of them. they were Kaname\'s followers, right? And they had such cliche personalities that I could die? Yeah, them! Right... If your brain is working properly, you should already know my opinion of the supporting cast by now.Story~It seemed to be just slightly unique, and it had many places it could have gone, but it decided to stay as a stupid soap opera. It never really got deeper or darker than that, and the bad guy was sort of non existent until the very end. Weird. I like to be introduced to my antagonist at the very beginning, if possible. This was just one of the thousands of things that disappointed me in this show. Why everyone loves this is just something my brain can\'t grasp. I dunno, maybe your brain can\'t grasp why the heck I love Higurashi or Death Note, so let\'s leave it at this-- it\'s an opinion. The end.Art~All in all, it was typical, yet with a darker sense of feeling. It really made me wonder how the heck the creator(s) did this. I mean, how do you take cliche art and give it a darker feeling to it? all in all, it was nice and enjoyable... but then the fight scenes came on. I mean, really? Just because it\'s a supposed romance doesn\'t mean the movement of the battles has to be completely awful. And trust me, ohhhh-- when mistakes in a frame are made, it was dang obvious. Most of the time in anime, I can tell when a mistake is made yet I can\'t always place it, but I know it\'s there. With Vampire Knight, that never happened once. I always knew where the mistakes were-- Yuki\'s face was too long. Her mouth was in the incorrect place. Zero\'s eye shape is wrong (and no, not because he\'s making a different expression, his eye shape is literally wrong). So many other things. So, when it is bad, it is very bad.Sound~I enjoyed the opening, and... I actually have the ending on my iPod. I loved it. I have no idea why. There was something creepy yet mysterious and beautiful about it. It\'s not super special, but I liked it, and that\'s my opinion. The overall soundtrack for the movie was actually very nice, and I noticed *most* of it. It kind of helped enhance the mood, but most of the time it made it cheesier and more annoying. On its own, though, it\'s a fairly good soundtrack. The voice acting for the Japanese isn\'t necessarily anything super special-- each voice actor fits their role. And you know my opinion on the characters, so sometimes the voice acting was really annoying too. They sulk in the darkness of their rooms, softly calling out the name of the other character, their heart aching-- yeah, yeah. It gets annoying. If there\'s an English version, I didn\'t watch it, so...All in all, Vampire Knight to me was very annoying and cliche in some of its parts. I hoped that it would go in a different direction since the overall setup of the plot was enthralling, but it went absolutely nowhere-- and I could only groan at the screen and slap my forehead.Depending on your taste in anime, you might or might not like this. I\'d say, just to be safe, read the other reviews and build an opinion of your own before you watch this anime. Mostly, read as many reviews that give it a bad score, then read a few that give it an 8 or above. Decide what you want to do, and watch or don\'t watch this. If you\'ve already seen it, then... good for you. Write your own review. If my review upset you in any way, please read the statement at the very top of this review. :POverall, I just disliked this anime, and I\'ll stick with what I usually like.

Ugh.', ""If you like pretty anime vampire boys, this might be right up your street. However, if you like something with a decent plot as well as the associated carnage and animalistic nature that vampires usually have, this will likely leave you somewhat disappointed (and that's me being rather kind..) and wishing it had delivered more for the time you put in.I began watching this on a friend's giddy recommendation and was intrigued somewhat by the first few episodes; although, all the way through near enough, it stayed at the same steady pace of mild intrigue and a general niggling wonder as to when the hell...the plot was going to kick in so that the story had some sort of point to it aside from a glorified love triangle. The plot itself, somewhere beneath the anime itself, has a lot of potential. The on-screen variation just doesn't seem to deliver.The characters, despite my 'fangirl-esque' fondness of a fair few of them, aren't particularly well mapped out and a lot of the character basis is shrouded in mystery, although not really in the right way - there are far too many vague bits and not enough explanation when it comes to motive and persona as well as situation. In fact, most of the characters seem not only 2D, but slight variations of the same 2D character. Also, most of the vampires you encounter in this series are rather fluffy aside from the pointy fangs, and the supporting cast are, to a fair extent, pretty forgettable.Visually, it was somewhat pleasing, although a lot of time seems to have been wasted on trivial matters while the potentially good bits have been glossed over or given a moment or two of screen time when they should have had a scene, or at the very least, *more* screen time.Overall, I'd say this series is probably worth a watch if you're just looking for an easy vampire related anime fix, but after spending a good few hours ploughing through this series, I am left wondering if I want to bother at all with its counterpart; leaning heavily towards the 'No' vote.Bear in mind that I've not read the manga, nor am I in the 'anime connoisseur' league, but I am a writer (of sorts) and would know a good story when it hit me in the face: sadly, this failed to deliver such a pleasant blow. the plot was going to kick in so that the story had some sort of point to it aside from a glorified love triangle.

It's quite obvious from the beginning that the love triangle is KanameYuukiZero, then why does Kaname present in YuukiZero scenes? In those scenes in the manga he wasn't even there at all O_o And there are more.The story of course is great, but the anime ruined it totally. Zero behaves like a wimp, he's not like himself, and Yuuki also. Since when Yuuki has been taking...Zero's insults seriously? I won't tell spoilers but the anime exposes things very fast. Things that were clear at chapter 34 in the manga were hintend at episode 5 for example and in the opening and ending as well.

Now, under the watchful eye of Chairman Cross, Yuki's foster father, both are students at the Cross Acedemy, where there's a Day Class for humans, and Night Class for vampires. There, Yuki, along with Kiryuu Zero, a childhood friend with a deep hatred for vampires, they attempt to prevent the secret of the vampires' identities from the student mass.STORYI was sorely disappointed with the anime. Hino Matsuri's manga version had a great story going for it, only for the...anime version to warp it really badly. I give the writers credit for trying, but one shouldn't change the story so drastically it affects the flow the mangaka created. It isn't bad for those that haven't read the manga, but for those that have, I highly doubt you'll like it.ARTAgain, to be fair to the producers, the art ain't that bad, but comparing to the manga, Zero doesn't really have a dark, sad look that he does in the manga, and Yuki looks far too cute that she almost has a Kanon style look.SOUNDI love the opening song. I really do. The sound thoughout the show really does give a good feeling too, and helps bring up the mood. But sound really doesn't help improve a storyline.CHARACTERYuki is the best character in the anime version, and the only reason I gave this a 7, because I actually liked her with comedy, which she lacks in the manga. However, the rest of the characters are either the same, or thrown out of character. Aidou, for example, wasn't really explored deeply, and he just does things that weren't explained in the anime, but was in the manga.ENJOYMENTI wasn't bored out of my wits, but I wasn't exactly jumping with joy at every episode of new release like I would with some anime. I had hoped it would be as enchanting as the manga was, but by the end of episode 2, I found it lacking.OVERALLI cannot say it is a bad anime in anyway possible, nor is it a good one either. I expected better of the company that did legends like Higurashi no Naku Koroni and Rurouni Kenshin, and good anime like Kyo Kara Maou and Marimite, but this was just a disappointment. If you liked the anime, I recommend the manga. Art's better, character's better, story's better, and of course, enjoyment's better. anime version to warp it really badly.

I could not stop watching it.When the anime did vary from the manga, I found it to be an enriching manner that made the story a little bit easier to understand. There were a few points in the manga when everything wasn't very clear, and the anime did a very good job of clarifying everything. And again, the music was perfectly chosen, with a well-chosen catchy...opening them and a chilling and haunting ending theme.However, there are definately significant weak spots to this anime. The art was okay at best, with a few even laughably horrible animation points, and one of the most important scenes in the manga was rushed through towards the end, completely ruining the effect the manga had given.As far as for the storyline of Vampire Knight in general, I have to give props to the writer for not trying to make obvious plot points some big surprise. When she knew the audience was going to find out something anyway, she embraced that fact and built upon it.I think this is something that should be watched and enjoyed for nothing else than the chilling sounds and high entertainment value. Just, if you've read the manga, don't expect the same beautiful work in this anime. opening them and a chilling and haunting ending theme.However, there are definately significant weak spots to this anime.

This will not stand.To breifly summarize, 90% of Vampire Knight\'s plot centres on a love triangle between heroine Yuki Cross and her childhood friend Zero along with school idol Kaname. Which all sounds pretty bland, only they are at a school full of vampires. Kaname is vampire God and Zero is a vampire hunter. And if you can\'t tell, yes, Twilight was a very big deal when this series was being released.In my opinion, Vampire Knight is...peak shojo and brilliantly executed. I was deeply obsessed with it when I first watched it in high school. Years later when I rewatched it as a more mature (?) person, I still found it very entertaining. Recently I watched it again with my partner and he enjoyed it thoroughly. Of course he offered many sarcastic remarks but he enjoyed it nevertheless. I think the score on MAL is quite unfair, but it\'s part of a very understanding phenomenon (like the hate on Twilight). Vampire Knight achieved exactly what it tried to do. We asked for a love triangle, a useless protagonist lacking personality for self-insert, handsome boys fawning all over her for inexplicable reasons, and Vampire Knight DELIVERED. Vampire Knight is a series designed to be enjoyed, not reflected upon. It gave me many of the things I wanted as a teenage girl, presenting a world I wanted to live in and a romantic situation that uh, let\'s just say would have been pretty great.I was trying to think of a shonen-equivalent series to illustrate my point, and the one I think parallels it is Food Wars. It literally has women who orgasm when they eat... and it consistently has a decent score (ranging from ~7.3 to ~8.1). Clearly there is no justice in the world. Ultimately, fantasy for boys is allowed but for not for girls.I understand though, I was for the longest time, trying to distance myself psychologically from the part of me that enjoys things like Vampire Knight, Fifty Shades of grey etc. And yes, as a teenager I was not aware of the toxicity, so the criticism on that front is valid. For example, Kaname is emotionally unavailable and patronizing, does not particularly respect consent, not to mention the 1000-year old age difference. He is more like a father figure than a viable romantic partner, but is explicitly spelled out as a main love interest. And my 14-year-old self who thought he was dreamy, shipped Yuki with Kaname. So for people criticizing ""it\'s toxic"", yes it absolutely is, it\'s what a 14-year old girl imagines healthy relationships look like. Just let them be happy. And if you are older, and need to indulge yourself every now and then, Vampire Knight is guaranteed to be a good time. And for people criticizing the plot... come on, as if we are watching it for the plot...The animation is good for a series of its era and budget, the voice acting fits all the characters, the music is well done, and the story moves along at a healthy pace episode to episode. There is no real reason it won\'t be enjoyed by shojo or romance fans. Overall, I think the low score for Vampire Knight reflects that people think a series so shamelessly designed to be wish fulfillment should not be rated high, and that in order to be ""good"", something must be profound. What Vampir Knight accomplishes is that it entertains you and keeps you interested, and going in expecting an intellectual experience is like going to McDonalds and getting upset they only serve hamburgers and not filet mignon. peak shojo and brilliantly executed.

Ja~ne."", 'Vampires in anime is nothing original and definitely nothing ground-breaking, in 2006, the idea of vampires had taken a back seat, Twilight didn\'t exist so there was a lack of screaming fangirls talking about what team they were, in fact, before there was Twilight....There was Vampire Knight.Many people, including me tend to think ""oh, vampires, meh"" and it takes a quality show such as Production IG\'s \'Blood: The Last Vampire\' to turn heads and make people think otherwise, only to be kicked in the teeth by god awful vampire anime such as Fortune Arterial, Vampire Knight was a step in the right direction, but its...far from perfect.We follow the story of Yuki Cross, who as a child, was attacked by a Vampire and saved by Kaname Kuran, a pureblood vampire (he\'s basically top of the vampire hierarchy).Time skip to high school because every anime seems to be set in bloody high school, she attends Cross Academy led by her father, Kaien who is determined to make Humans and Vampires live in harmony by having them attend the same school.The day class is for humans such as Yuki and her partner Zero as school guardian, and they are responsible for keeping the over-excited girls at bay when the night class strut their way into Cross Academy.The night class are (wait for it) THE VAMPIRES, and are, in my opinion the only set of characters that kept the entire series afloat during the more...dull time of the series. We have Kaname Kuran, Yuki\'s love interest and childhood hero and Aido Hanabusa, the comic relief antagonistic senior to Yuki who is presumably jealous of their relationship, the rest dont have much importance, but theyre all equally cool.Studio Deen took the reigns for this anime, well known for animating When They Cry (Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni) and, while they\'ve never been at the peak of animation quality, thankfully for this show it isnt utter shit either, the animation is mediocre at best and certain action scenes felt off to me, other than that, its bearable to watch, so, as of right now, Vampire Knight is a fairly solid anime.Now on to the good stuff, i\'ll quickly give my two cents on the opening and ending song before i get on to the \'dub or sub\' argument, the opening song took me around 9 episodes to get used to, and on occasion i actually skipped it as there is absolutely nothing noteworthy on it, the song actually starts before the characters in the preview of the episodes have finished speaking leading to a clusterf**k of different voices for a few seconds. The ending song titled \'Still Doll\' was more compelling, it didnt try to animate too much and it left a large sense of insecurity on me after it had finished, the voice of the singer Kanon Wakeshima was borderline perfect and the last few frames was very creepy.Dub or sub? Sub. I havent even watched it in japanese just yet, but the dub felt like it was just slapped on, the dialogue was poor for reasons i\'ll get onto in a moment, and i honestly think the dub is the primary reason i never enjoyed the show as much as i should have.Now its no spoiler to say that Zero\'s parents are dead as its explained pretty much right after he is introduced, their death is his motivation to keep fighting and the source of his hatred for vampires, Yuki is meant to be his bestfriend, just keep that in mind for the quote i\'m about to give you...""You think she\'s the vampire that brutally murdered your entire family?""WTF? Yes, all the characters that mention Zero\'s parents to Zero himself seem to love reminding him of how the series\' antagonist butchered his parents, which made me feel that either the characters were trying to make Zero cry or that they needed to remind him for the sake of having something to say.The voice actors do an outright poor job of expressing the feelings between the characters that the japanese dub apparently has which causes the whole romance/tragedy side of the show to be completely laughable, i honestly watched death scenes of the characters multiple times thinking ""Wait, was i supposed to care?""The dub has successfully made it onto a list of english dubs i flatout REFUSE to listen to ever again in my life, and i can count the amount of such dubs on one hand.The characters, to some extent make the rest of the show bearable, not a single character that matters in the story is a cliche stereotype of any anime archetype, and for that i can applaud the idea, however thanks to the dub, the characters came off as plain with no character growth whatsoever and when the story gets \'serious\' in the final 4 episodes, i felt myself struggling to even finish it, taking 30 minute breaks between episodes to cope with the inevitable cliffhanger ending.Oh, yes, normally i dont like talking about a show\'s ending to the point where i give it a whole section in the review, but in my belief the ending is what makes the show solid, and in this case...it wasnt, it ends on a god-awful cliffhanger which, if you were struggling to finish the first 13 episodes like i did, you are now forced to watch 13 MORE to get the full effect of the story, admittedly, however, the story is incredibly strong, making no room for your typical beach episodes or filler bullshit, everything is completely necessary and the plot twists are masterfully executed.This show is by no means for everyone, and if you want a vampire anime i would rather recommend Blood: The Last Vampire or Trinity Blood over this, but if you must, watch it, it ain\'t half bad, i have alot to say about it (mostly negative) but honestly i think its because i havent watched the japanese dub or even the second season, so my final opinions on the series as a whole is likely to change, but for now, the first season was a tad messy, leaving all of the explanations for the second season in typical Studio Deen fashion.I give this anime a 6/10 and the overall recommendation to stream it if you have absolutely nothing else to watch far from perfect.We follow the story of Yuki Cross, who as a child, was attacked by a Vampire and saved by Kaname Kuran, a pureblood vampire (he\'s basically top of the vampire hierarchy).Time skip to high school because every anime seems to be set in bloody high school, she attends Cross Academy led by her father, Kaien who is determined to make Humans and Vampires live in harmony by having them attend the same school.The day class is for humans such as Yuki and her partner Zero as school guardian, and they are responsible for keeping the over-excited girls at bay when the night class strut their way into Cross Academy.The night class are (wait for it) THE VAMPIRES, and are, in my opinion the only set of characters that kept the entire series afloat during the more...dull time of the series.

I didn\'t have high hopes for this anime and was pleasantly surprised at the strength of character development and some plot twists.Cross Academy is like 2 schools rolled into one. The normal day class students are all intrigued and have terrific crushes on members of the Night Class who look like Movie Stars. Of course they day class is completely unaware that the Night Class are vampires, and an uneasy peace is kept by 2 prefects (Yuki and Zero), obeying the Headmaster\'s ideals of ""let\'s all just get...along"".The night class looks like Ouran High School Host Club come to life. Every one of the men is handsome *sigh*, with the handsomest being Clan Kaname, the Pureblood Noble. He saved Yuki when she was a child, but Yuki\'s fellow prefect Zero hates him because he is a vampire.Therein is the crux of the love triangle! The plot twisted and turned enough to keep me interested. There was a lot of angst, staring and brooding. Parts of it were downright sexy. Even I who hate the sight of blood found myself intensely interested in some of the ... food scenes.Art was same as Ouran style, sound was just ok. Although the OP was very well done the rest of the soundtrack was very nondescript.The ending was a little unexpected (a cop out) or I would have scored it higher. However thanks to 1 scene of fanservice for females the overall score ended up as an 7. At the end of it, the series didn\'t feel complete hence the 7 overall score.

But little parts of the storyline had me intrigued, and on the advice of a friend, I sat down to watch it.As I said, little additions and quirks of the storyline (such as Yuuki being saved by a vampire as a young girl, Zero's *affliction* -I'll call it that so there are no spoilers- and vampires being a night class while mortals are a day class of a boarding school.) made me enjoy certain parts of this story.The first few episodes had me thoroughly enjoying it, the art a major bonus to the...story.

The story began to be brushed as what seemed to be filler episodes took up minute after minute. The true story and plot is only set into motion around episode 9.

Kaname is the most pretentious (I'm sorry to say), stuck up, arrogant and very, very cunning and sly. Not really the qualities you expect in a shoujo - do you? And while I'll admit it's refreshing, it's still not right.Yuuki is...utterly pathetic. One thing that puts me right off certain animes or mangas is weak female protagonists. And Yuuki is one of the worst. I'd like to hope it's because the mangaka needed filler chapters. Yuuki, never learning from her mistakes, constantly walking into trouble and always ends up being rescued by either Zero or Kaname.This does nothing to prevent the whole show falling into a downward spiral as it tries to explain every filler episode with chilling precision. Fair enough, but why not just call it what it is - an episode in which the base plot does not progress, and a chance to see Yuuki saved by some hot guy?The comedy was this anime's saving grace-the only reason I rated this anime as high as I did, for me, as I went completely off this anime the minute Yuuki batted her eyelashes and was saved by Kaname.

Honestly, I didn\'t plan on even watching this anime even though I heard great reviews about it and all because of the word ""Vampire"". Ever since Twilight came out, vampire books and movies have been a hit and...I personally find it overrated so I didn\'t even bother to look up for reviews about it.Until...one day, I you-tube hopped and spotted Vampire Knight and read the comments...The one that attracted me the most -> ""OMGGGGG the guys in vampire knight are soooooooooooooo hot""Since it\'s hard for me to get obsessed over an anime character (Okay, to be honest, it\'s quite easy, they just have to look pretty and good looking and I\'m hooked but then, I\'m being quite biased ain\'t I?) I went onto review sites and look up for the characters and dayum! One of the main characters attracted me just like that so I decided to give this series a try.I will be honest though - if the first episode doesn\'t get me hooked onto it, I will by no means watch a second episode - unless, I\'m TOO bored.The first episode did get me hooked because it was so deep and thrilling in a fun way ;)Story: 9/10I thought that the story was really interesting and the plot gets deeper as you dived more into the series. No filler episodes and that makes me really happy as they concentrated on the story more.You should wiki the story to know more about the Purebloods and the vampire families - that is really interesting. I find it really fascinating that Purebloods have so much power compared to the normal vampires and Level E and so on...I was really afraid the story is gonna be 24/7 scary and vampire-y (as in biting and licking and stuff) but thank goodness, there were funny moments and chibi-fied faces as well. I\'m surprised Kaname didn\'t have a chibi-face of himself!I guess he\'s too cool for it B)Art: 8/10Nothing much to rave about but it\'s pleasant to my eyes. At first, I get so annoyed with the female protagonist because her eyes are SO huge that it\'s crazy! I mean, I know that anime girls usually have huge eyes but her eyes are so huge that they look like they\'re gonna suck me in anytime - seriously.The male leads are of course - stunning and very, very hot. I have no objections of the character\'s art except for Yuuki\'s eyes. Other than that, the other characters looked pleasantly beautiful.The background was decent - I mostly see trees and lots of trees but they suit the mood just right because half of the series, the background plays quite a role because they were very dark and moody just like the series.Sound: 9/10OP and ED songs were alright although I find the ED song REEEEALLY creepy that I usually skip it most of the time. I get scared easily and hey, red eyes and broken mirrors? Nuh-uh. I\'m out.But what really impressed me was the voices of the characters. It suited them just right! I love Zero\'s tortured voice (heheh it\'s sexy) and Kaname\'s ""serious and mysterious"" voice as well. I particularly liked the Chairman\'s voice as well. He can sound so serious at times...and then......HAPPY at other times.Epic.Character: 9/10Character character character. I really love the characters in these series. Sure, they are all the same - love triangle, beautiful people T_T and all but what I\'m talking about is the character itself - the personality.I personally find Yuuki\'s character very weak and a little bit annoying because she doesn\'t do anything much and doesn\'t help much either other than giving her blood for Zero to drink. One good point about her: She\'s cute? And she\'s very optimistic.Kaname\'s character is very, very interesting. You never know what he\'s up to...and you wonder - is he a good guy or a bad guy? It\'s like he\'s never both of them or he could be both of them...He just leaves you confused.Zero\'s character - dude, could you blame him if he wants to kill himself? I\'m sick of people saying Zero\'s character is so weak and lame and all but can you actually imagine yourself in Zero\'s situation? Both parents killed by a vampire and yet, he turns into a vampire himself and is unable to control his thirst? Tell me, if you\'re like that - will you still find yourself weak?The supporting characters are really interesting as well. I loved it when slowly by slowly, their pasts are being depict to the viewers and it leaves us wanting more!Aidou is one of the supporting characters that impressed me. He can be so friendly and flirty yet...mean. Watch it to know what I mean :PEnjoyment: 8/10Some scenes were a bit draggy but they\'re not as draggy as Vampire Knight Guilty\'s, personally I find VKG verrrrrry slow but I shall save this review for later.Each episode leaves you a cliffhanger and makes you crave for more! An episode without a cliffhanger basically tells you - ""*Yawn* I shall watch this some other day...""I know the director was trying to picture Yuuki\'s thoughts but they were really too much that I can predict what she\'s gonna say even before she goes into her ""I\'m scared of Vampires"" mood...it\'s always...the same.But all I can say is, it\'s interesting yet at times, it can be draggy and annoying. The plot is what keeps me glued onto the laptop screen. Episode by episode, they slowly tells us about the relationship between the vampires and the vampire hunters and of course, Yuuki\'s past..Overall: 8/10The 8 is for the lovely characters and the really interesting story and of course the enjoyment.

I noticed some of the movement/fight sequences are really choppy, like they're missing frames or something.  Has anyone else noticed that Zero appears to be moon-walking? Ugh. If you're curious, check it out but honestly, I'm done watching the first season and don't intend to watch the 2nd season. I'll be focusing on the manga only. "", ""Disclaimer: I watched the full thing in the dub, so I can't say for sure about the voice acting, but just know that I genuinely loved it and I think it is the best dub I have ever watched in my life! The line delivery was on point, so expressive, and better, the characters sounded exactly like humans. Again, I won't say anything about the sub, because I have not watched that yet.Very good anime, a solid 10/10. I would say it surpasses that of Kimetsu no Yaiba, Hunter x Hunter, Boku no Hero Academia, or any other top ranking anime today, in sheer storytelling...alone.Characters (10/10): The main characters are very complex and have you thinking, 'what would I do if I were in that position?' the main character, Yuki, is a sweet, very kind, loveable protagonist, perfect for this genre of anime. She might seem useless at first, but she is actually a very strong, independent, and powerful woman, setting an example for all the females in this world. One of the love interests, Zero, is just as amazing, he is very kind and very ambitious. He is a bit rash and hotheaded at times, but in the end he just means well, and will do anything to protect Yuki. The second love interest, Kaname, is a very kind man and nice man. He loves Yuki (it's pretty obvious!) and even protects her from Zero, showing a bit of a selfish side from him. But this is overpowered by his kindness and love towards Yuki. The supporting cast even has interesting personalities as well! Normally they would be one dimensional characters, but Vampire Knight breaks this trend and creates an amazing, memorable cast with voice acting, in my opinion, better than most anime.Art (10/10): Aside from the story, I believe that this is the most important thing when it comes to anime! Now normally, good art usually means a bad story, and bad art could have a good story, but Vampire Knight exceeds in both! How awesome is that? Artists tend to have something called 'same face syndrome' which means you could do something as simple as putting a different style of hair over a character's face and it might look like a whole other character, and they do not have very recognizable silhouettes, but that is not the case for this anime. It has a very unique and distinct style, and you can tell their personality just from a simple glance! That's what I call good character design.Storytelling (10/10): The storytelling is definitely the highlight of the anime. I will not spoil too much, but the concept of vampires, though it may seem as if it has been done to death, is actually done very well if you watch the show. The day and night classes are a very unique concept as well; again, it may seem like it's not, but trust me, it definitely is. The day classes (and this might be considered a spoiler) are actually unaware that the night classes are vampires! The story is honestly the main reason I recommend it, with twists and turns and plots like you've never seen before. As I have said before I will not spoil it, so what are you doing reading this review!? Watch it for yourself!Soundtrack (10/10): Amazing. Memorable, catchy, and beautiful all at the same time. The ending and opening are really the best, they invoke deep emotions and get you pumped for what will happen next! You can tell they really thought it through, how they use certain tracks to emphasize the events of the show. It kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering if the characters would even make it! I loved it!Overall: This is definitely an anime you should watch. It's great, has one of, if not the best storyline of all time, great memorable characters, beautiful art and music. If you are wondering whether you should watch it or not, I say go for it! It's simply the best anime I have ever seen. It may not be for everyone but it's worth a shot. (B.T.W.

I'm 18 years old and I loved this anime.I'm very into romance with animes, and I always HAVE to have at least one or two kisses. Although Vampire Knight didn't really have one, I still loved it. It provided the right amount of romance, even if there wasn't much kissing.I like how it has different elements to it, there's some thriller scenes, romance, comedy and some action. I would have liked more action, but apart from that it was...perfect for me.The negatives? Like I said, lack of action, apart from that I can't really think of much else.The soundtrack was great, it made my heart pound and I loved that. I was constantly singing the theme music for weeks after watching.The art was better then average I'd say, sometimes Kaname could end up looking a bit odd, but apart from that it was nicely done.I gave it a 9, but it would have definitely gotten a 10 if there was more fighting.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did :) perfect for me.The negatives?

It could've been much better if the plot progressed quicker instead of having the same subject for many episodes in a row and also trying to explain things better and not leaving things in a open.Art (3/10)Absolutely disliked it. The only feature that could make the character noticeable were the different hair colors of each character, otherwise, distinguishing them and remembering them would be nearly impossible.Sound (2/10)This is merely my opinion but I hated the openings, endings and most of the background sound.Character (5/10)Some characters were boring, especially Yuki since she...didn't do anything special.

A bunch of more action and suspense and less drama could've made this a lot better."", ""Vampire knight was a welcome change for me in terms of the darker tone of the show, compared to the usual reverse harem, soujo anime. I loved the fact it was not the typical sweet and innocent cliche anime, it had at least a little more depth to it.I say a 'little' because to be honest it still is far from being a well, rounded, engaging, action packed and thought-provoking anime. It still is very much targeted at teenage girls with a thirst for 'twilighty' things..The story was not a bad one, compared with many other animes of a similar genre, as there...was the element of horror and mystery. The characters were fairly interesting. Kaname was my favorite, and Zero being a troubled soul also had his quirks and complexities. Sad to say our protagonist was rather weak and oh-so-obliging. I would be the first to say I hate an overly loud, domineering and arrogant protagonist, but seriously, Yuuki takes the feminist cause back about a decade.If you have been watching Earl and the Fairy, Hakuōki, Special A etc, I think you would enjoy a similar feel but change of scenery. Other than that i believe you would find Vampire Knight rather average and perhaps best to be avoided.. was the element of horror and mystery. The characters were fairly interesting.

The main character. Yuki, has no personality, and constantly needs to be saved by edgy vampire boys. But it was a quilty pleasure watch.I liked watching it alone in my room and giving live commentary to my invisible  audience. This anime was like a car crash; so horrible but you just can’t look away.But then, oh lord, the plot twist  is that the main love interest is actually HER BROTHER. Her own flesh and blood. I was immediately disgusted, and you’d think that...the characters would be as well right? Well, no. They just shrugg it off and they continue like nothing is wrong. I hate this anime so much because you get 1 season in, maybe even start to like the characters a little and then they drop this freaking A-bomb on your head. I don’t care that it’s technically a spoiler, everyone who starts this anime has the right to now that it has UNAPPOLOGETIC INCEST AS A MAIN STORY PLOT. Just why??? Why did the writer thought it was a good idea to make them brother and sister??Oh yeah, Yuki is also the product of incest. Her mother concieved her with her own brother. Maybe that explains why Yuki’s googly bug eyes are so big they look like they’ll explode out of her head. the characters would be as well right? Well, no.

Seriously, the amount of times I would just forget Kaname until he appeared on screen was borderline hilarious. The only times I remember him are when I am not watching the anime and I'm thinking about how I really hate him lolBut, I think what draws me into this anime till this day is Zero and Yuki's relationship, along with Ido's character development (especially later on in Vampire Knight: Guilty).Despite it being bad in my opinion, this anime is a HUGE guilty pleasure for...me anyway; Just like Vampire Knight: Guilty. Ahaha. Help me anyway; Just like Vampire Knight: Guilty. Ahaha. Help"", ""Vampire knight is an anime about vampires where a school exists to try and promote a peaceful coexistence between humans and vampires a.k.a. cross academy. It centers around the lives of zero and yuuki who both have had their lives affected by vampires in their past and have been in the care of the chairman of the academy since their encounters with vampires.The story is quite interesting and perhaps slightly different from your usual vampire anime. It is more of a highschool drama. And i must emphasize the word &quot;drama&quot; here because that is the main genre that this anime would fall under. There is...a lot of it throughout the anime. The anime also contains hints of romance though not very deep or romantic, you have a classical love triangle as well. In some ways the story can be said to be an action anime though there is not much serious fighting, more emphasis is placed on the characters' encounters and reactions, so violence is kept to the minimal. I found it a bit boring as a result, some say the manga had more action. However, unlike some of the other vampire animes, this one can be said to be more intricate and diverse in that there are more specifications and ideas about vampires as depicted by the writer. In my opinion, the anime is a an ok start to a longer series so hopefully the second season will be better. This anime can be a bit dark, but i think it has some meaning in it thatnks to this.The art is not bad, typical shuojo style of drawing characters with big eyes and stuff. But i did not find any exceptional quality.The sound again is nothing special though i took a liking to both the opening and closing songs which i thought were quite suited to this kind of dramati anime. However, there were no insert songs that brought out the atmosphere better.The main characters were deep but besides that most of the other characters have not a big part in this anime. Though i found Kananame a very dark character, this story is quite dark anyway. Had there been more development of the side characters as well i think the story would be more complete.I enjoyed the humourous scenes inserted in the anime which apparently is not as frequent in the manga. I think that the story can be quite gripping at the start because you are drawn straight into the story where the events are occuring quite fast. This helps to draw the attention of the watcher so if you do watch this anime you will probabbly be addicted to it becuase of all the suspense that ends each episode.Overall, i think the anime is only average, perhaps due to length of the series. The ending of the anime is open but there will be a second series so that's ok(just a warning), but i have seen better as short as this one. Also those who don't like animes that are quite dark i suggest you don't watch this because it contains some dark themes.

Why my first review had to be on an anime I hate? Cause my hatred for it is so strong I must write it down. :)Anyways..... Vampire Knight.. OMG. I think this is the only anime I truly despise..... I couldnt even finish watching the whole thing!!! And its only freaking 13 eps long! Thats just sad. I only managed to watch like... what? 5 episodes I think? Pfft. The first ep I was excited to watch... mostly cause all my friends kept talking about it... so I felt...the need to check it out. Hmm... Vampires, Hot guys, fighting.. This anime sounds pretty good. *add to list*... *begins to watch*.....*dies*THiS ANIME WAS A FAIL! The anime equivalent of Twilight (dont get me wrong... freaking twilight is better than this -__-) Vampire Knight was a fail. Why? Well, lets talk about the main character, Yuki. Can I say MARY SUE??? The freaking girl is utterly useless and pathetic! She cant do shit and always gets herself into trouble having to have help from either Zero or Kaname. Not only do I hate her cause she's just a freaking useless mary sue, but she's like a freaking puppy following Kaname all the time... Desperately seeking him and practically willing to throw her life away for him. Talk about sexist archetype... Useless pathetic chick in need of hot vampire (which by the way is a douche in my opinion.) He also pissed me off.Then theres zero.... aww.. My only favored character from this anime, despite his super emo-ness. Yea, his melodramatic suicidal emotions get annoying at times, but he actually cared for Yuki. And even though Yuki ''cared'' for him too, it seemed like she cared more for the douch bag Kaname than ever even though she met him a few days ago (compared to Zero who's been her childhood friend) I symphasize for Zero, he went through hell in the past... so I wouldnt blame him for acting emo.Despite the characters pissing me off... it just gets worse. Yuki continues to get into trouble, Kaname has to save her, Yuki ignores Zero for Kaname, and Kaname looks like he's gonna devour Yuki but is desperately trying to resist.I personally hated this anime. I even thought of giving it a second try and watching it.....then all the memories came back of those few eps I saw and my hate for it grew even more... lol. Watch it if you really want to... but I would NEVER recomment this anime to anyone personally. I heard the second season is better, but i honestly dont care. I know its still gonna be shitty. After hearing news from friends that she goes with Kaname and turns into a vampire herself and Zero goes his seperate way, I wasnt suprised.Word of advise, stay clear of this anime. I truly still do not understand why this anime is so popular... I really dont. Disagree with me all you want... I dont care.. I still stand with what I wrote.

During whole 13 episodes, they didn't fully explain what exactly are the differences between Pure-blooded Vampires - Aristocrat Vampires - Normal Vampires and Level E Vampires. Of course, basic knowledge was given, but I feel like they could have gone into more details. Moreover, one of the things in my opinion this show lacked was a good antagonist. The antagonist appears only at the end of the series, so until that moment you are confused so who's the bad guy? Is it Vampires or not... Nonetheless,  it was obvious...that all 3 main characters have had rather harsh past. However, only Zero's (one of the MC) past was explained further. Even though, there's still another season for VK, I am disappointed that 1st season wasn't used to introduce the characters so that I could get more into the story. On the other hand, this made the show mysterious and less predictable as you don't know what kind of persons they actually are (exception main heroine).Art 7/10Nothing special, but it wasn't bad either. The art in my opinion was decent and did have some unique traits. Eyes of Yuuki was really different from what I am used to see and I couldn't say I actually liked... but everything else was appealing. The Vampires as expected were showed as more beautiful than humans, however I wasn't really fond of the bishounen looks.Sound 10/10Now that was incredible soundtrack. Both opening and ending songs were so good that gave me chills while listening to them. Moreover, soundtracks fit very well with the rather dark mood of the series.Character 8/10My feelings towards the characters constantly kept changing. Sometimes they were very appealing. I loved to see how they have some inner thoughts and struggle to reach the answer they are looking for. All 3 MC's have a deep past, but none of them really feel like sharing the pain with anyone. And this is where comes the annoying/irritating part. The heroine Yuuki crosses the line, she goes too much into Zero's private life. Of course, that's rather normal for a protagonist, but that's what disappoints me the most - making a very typical heroine who always goes after the person who has some problems and ends up in some kind of trouble and getting saved by either Zero or the Pure-blooded Vampire Kaname. However, ignoring this go after-get into trouble-be saved part, the characters are very different from each other and that's what makes the story better. The ending gave me a hope that 2nd season will answer many questions about the characters and show more development of them.Enjoyment 9/10Even though, I wasn't really complimenting the show. I can honestly say it was still very enjoyable. The soundtrack makes up for many minor issues I have with this anime. Furthermore, I love to see when characters have some deep inner thoughts and are struggling to find the answer they are looking for. So the only real problem I have with VK is that Yuuki barely changed through whole series and was too much of a typical heroine.Overall 8/10I think it's a good rate for this anime. The lack of information about Vampires and MC's history + lack of character development (heroine) were the negative aspects. The OST was definitely the best part of the anime. I believe this a perfect show for teenage girls due to bishounen looks of Vampires, but as for the guys it's nothing that spectacular. Although, it is definitely interesting and worth watching.Thank you for reading :) that all 3 main characters have had rather harsh past.

Vampire Knight revolves around  its three main characters named Cross Yuuki, Kuran Kaname and Kiryuu Zero. Vampire Knight is just like your usual generic vampire novel delivered in a more romantic way.  While watching this anime, the viewers perspective on whom Cross Yuuki ( a girl who's saved by Kuran Kaname amidst of a vampire attack) should end up with is somewhat divided and is mostly considered by its fans as a love triangle between the three. The animation, as I have expected (since Studio...Deen, a well known crappy animation studio made the animation for this one)  is very poor.  The characters were drawn in a noticeable deformed way, the battle sequences were poor and lacks 3D perspective. However the background animation is passable , the environment is decipted very well. The sound of this anime gives off the expected Gothic feelling to it. From the romantic violin scores and up  to the mysterious gothic Ending theme. The seiyuus of this popular adaptation has some of the best line up ever. Mamoru Miyano and Horie Yui's performance is stunning.  This is definitely worth watching for if you're a fan of these two popular seiyuus.I enjoyed the story but hated the animation (as you can tell by now) Even though I haven't seen the manga yet, I'd say that the plot of this anime is at top notch, however Studio Deen caused the anime version of this one-of-a-kind masterpiece to meet its downfall. The second season of this anime will come out soon and how I wish to all of everything that is holy to redeem this anime's reputation. I hope that the animation would be okay for the second season and if not, knowing the anime version of Vampire Knight is an epic fail.

This review doesnt have any manga prespective as i have not yet read it.To start this story has a great concept and spin on the age old story of vampires. It is intresting that the creators came up w/ 3 diff levels of vampires which bascially break down into Noble vampire::Reg. vampires::Level E vampires. Essentially takes many diff historical typesof vamps and gives them a backstory in why they are that way. The Main story takes place at a school w/ a day class[humans] night...class[vamps] butday class doesnt know that the night class is in fact vampires. The &quot;perfects&quot; and main characters yuuki and Zero protect that secrect. Although its difficult  when all the vamps are hotties and all the girls in the school are constantly after them ;which helps for some comedic breaks. The school is used as a way to show the world that vamps and humans can coexsist as long as vampire take these fake blood tablets to substitue real blood..this is where my negetives come in.Negitives are this. While its a nice concept of tablets are nice.. it is evident its not feasable vamp wise. heres an analogy: lets say someone tellsyou --i want you to agree to take these food pills/appitite supressients instead of eating food for good of coexisting w/ the world. Oh see that tablefull of hamburgers.. you're not allowed to eat them! Thats a no no!--Eventually we're all going for those burgers! xD That part of the story was kinda just didnt work for me..i mean they dont have a blood bank ..a donation center something! :p Some situations were also very conveinant butmeh..i can deal with thatArt was great. loved the style and character designs. Comic relief scenes were just that and cute. but the genral dark mood was great.Many bishonen and bishoujo so im sure many ..including myself are happyw/ that. i know there some dispute of manga vs anime style but i think theylooks great. i like the way the eyes are drawn.Music matches the mood nicelyduring eps. i cant say i liked the intro too much,but the ending theme Still Doll is one of my fav songs now ^.^Characters  are well developed and still mysterious which i love.things are explained but all when it is apporiate. sometimes it can be a bit predictable [except for kaname] The only charac. that loses cool points with me the main girl of our story, yuuki. at first i thought shes pretty intresting,but they turned her into typical stupid anime girl who makes the worst desions..or make silly assumptions xP. very frustrating. i cant im rooting for zeroxyuuki be/c yuuki is well lame. but im rooting for Zero in a way.Overall this is a great watch and i cant wait the next season. sometimesit seems the story might be lacking but i hoping for more in the next season.if you love vampire stories, with some nice fansevice once n while and intresting story..be sure to give this a try yoosh! class[vamps] butday class doesnt know that the night class is in fact vampires.

I didn't expect it to be this good, or that I would get swept into an endless bliss every time I open the book.Though I've purchased every volume out so far I've taken to reading it online. It may not be 100% correct but it's close enough for me. The story is absolutely amazing and I've read the entire thing over and over again and I still cannot get enough of it.As for the anime, when I heard they were coming out with an actual visual for the manga...I was so overjoyed. Watching it with subtitles may not be the greatest by just to see the characters I fell in love with on pages become a visual with voices and movement is one of the best things I could ever ask for.If you love vampires or even if you don't and just love really thrilling romance and fantasy manga or anime, then this is the perfect story for you. If you're not captured after the first few chapters I can assure you it won't be long afterwards. This wonderfully written vampire, love triangle, suspense manga is enough to grab anyone's attention.You've got to believe me, just check it out. This is by far the best manga/anime I've ever seen or read. I hope you'll all love it as much as I do. I was so overjoyed.

I hope you'll all love it as much as I do."", ""Cross Academy is a school with a difference: in a unique and experimental setup designed by the headmaster, it has a Day Class consisting of ordinary humans and a Night Class filled with vampires. Yuki Cross and her friend Zero Kiryu are school prefects whose job it is to make sure the secret of the Night Class is always safe; they patrol the school grounds at night and supervise the switchover of classes at dawn and dusk to prevent any 'accidents' from happening. While Zero is suspicious of vampires and hates the idea of sharing the same space as them, Yuki admires the Night Class...for their beauty and sophistication; she is especially intrigued by their charming leader, Kaname, because he once saved her life. However, as Yuki quickly learns, not all vampires are amiable like the Night Class, and as terrible events unfold, Yuki must ask herself whether in a world where vampires are the hunters and humans are the prey, peaceful coexistence can really be achieved.Story (7/10)On the face of it, Vampire Knight appears to be just another hackneyed shoujo series designed to cater to sexually frustrated fangirls. Firstly, you have the exquisite beauty of the entire male cast; not to mention the relentless ‘sucking' and ‘biting' and ‘sinking' of teeth into soft, yielding flesh; and finally, the fact that the characters spend more time nuzzling each other's necks in hopeless abandon than they do talking sensibly about their problems.Ultimately, though, Vampire Knight will amuse male and female fans alike because, at its core, it provides an original plotline that's consistently good from start to finish. At its best, Vampire Knight teases out the various threads of its central mystery whilst never actually giving anything away. By this I mean the dynamic relationship between super-vampire, Kaname Kuran, and brave-but-vulnerable Yuki Cross. Amongst other things, Kaname commands a loyal gang of vampires and can shatter glass with nothing but a thought - why he would go out of his way to protect a human girl for no apparent reason is a question that instantly captures the imagination. Following that, Zero Kiryuu's tragic subplot provides extra emotional depth as well as an action-packed glimpse into the world of vampires, hunters, and humans.At only thirteen episodes, the only real flaw in the narrative is a general lack of complexity; although, with at least another season to go, there is more than enough scope for the dilemmas to get messier.Animation (7/10)As a series of still images, Vampire Knight admittedly looks good enough to bite; rich colour tones, clean lines, and some of the best-looking bishounen this side of Ouran High School Host Club combine for a wholly sensual experience. Unfortunately, the characters have to move around (sometimes, they even have to fight), which only makes Vampire Knight's technical faults all the more obvious - I haven't seen such mediocre action sequences since... well, for a very long time. Luckily, these are few and far between and don't detract from the overall pleasant animation.Sound (8/10)I find the opening theme fun and catchy but, as a single, also rather average; instead I'd recommend the ending theme, ‘Still Doll', a haunting piece with truly sumptuous vocals. Everything in between is about as memorable as last week's breakfast.Far more impressive is the voice acting, which is not just suitable at all times, but very, very good; the convincing performances are probably the main reason why the script doesn't come across as melodramatic as it should.Characters (7/10)Apart from the three protagonists, Vampire Knight is populated with a one-dimensional cast. However, taking into account that the vast majority are either unimportant or just make cameo appearances which doesn't require much depth, this isn't too big a problem. That said, even the central characters remain rather static across thirteen episodes, with only Zero displaying any noticeable changes in personality. What keeps them interesting despite this is that they are at heart entertaining stereotypes with little personal twists.Yuki Cross is the generic plucky lead who spends all her time confused about what's going on and generally being protected; even though she is portrayed as somewhat kick-arse in the beginning, this isn't a trait that's followed through in her development. On the other hand, she's an easy character to get attached to because of her giving nature and adorable comedic moments.Kaname Kuran, the most powerful vampire in town, also comes with a magnetic ‘wan' smile and a stunning arsenal of catalogue poses (like Family Guy's Captain Kirk, I don't think he holds the same position twice in the entire series). In all honesty, considering his sophistication and understated power, he's quite the cool cat - naturally, his main appeal is that nobody can figure out what exactly he wants i.e. why he's at Cross Academy looking out for Yuki despite obviously having better things to do.Lastly, Zero Kiryuu is a wishy-washy Dante (Devil May Cry) with an attitude problem; when he's not moping about with his shirt conspicuously undone, he's venting some emo rage down an angled camera. He's completely uninteresting for the first couple of episodes; however, once his subplot kicks in and his personal conflicts come to light, he becomes immediately likeable in that anti-hero way.Overall (7/10)With considerable emphasis upon pinning girls against walls and sucking their erogenous zones in every episode, Vampire Knight is easily a fangirl's dream anime; however, the quality of the storytelling should not be underestimated by anyone else for that matter. Any fan looking for a strong fantasy drama with an original take on vampires and a beautiful animation style should put this somewhere at the top of their list. for their beauty and sophistication; she is especially intrigued by their charming leader, Kaname, because he once saved her life.

Wasnt as bad as i remembered i remembered a horrible vampire drama that resembels the horror that is twighlight shudder but this one was ok. I will admit the plot kinda goes a little over board the characters support it. I love some characters but i hated others like how i thought zero was a respectable character with a tragic backstory who i felt for and then there is our leading lady i mean my god is she bland i mean wheat toast bland but i dont see how people can think she is like bella. Here is the...reason for one yuuki actualy fights kinda and she has a backstory that i liked kinda but the big difference is she has a heart unlike that she witch bella. But lets continue the opening song is fine but the ending is badass i love it the artwork is passible and the one of the few major flaws is the villians my god were they bad i mean the leader of the night dormatory killed her in seconds she must of been no threat if he could defeat her so why all this buildup. So those are my major problems so overall not as bad as i remembered. Hmm maybe that means the twilight movies are not that bad as i remembered im gonna go check. 2 hours later oh my god i was wrong i misjudged the twighlight films because THEY ARE WORSE THAN I REMEMBERED I HATE THESE MOVIES AND i dont mind this show well see ya reason for one yuuki actualy fights kinda and she has a backstory that i liked kinda but the big difference is she has a heart unlike that she witch bella.

And for the most part all of them have been met so far.I love the characters, I think they have been very well thought out and glide right into the entire theme of the story. The art is great, but not outstanding. Specifically Zero, I thought came out looking different than expected. However I have grown to like his image.Overall this anime never fails to entertain with each episode, it makes sense and the storyline never...gets boring. I think the hidden emotions are best fitted for the characters that they have been given to. Also, something important, I think the anime follows the story line of the manga pretty well. Not perfectly, and there are some things that have been changed but overall I would love the story even without reading the manga prior.Kudos VAMP KNIGHT! gets boring.

It's one of those shows that I'm not sure if it deserves a 6 or 7 (I give it a 7 just trying to be nice). The main problem I have with this show can be summarized into one sentence, that is, a character-driven story with not-so-good characters. Some argue that VK has done a great job at portraying the characters' emotional struggles and conflicts. I somewhat agree. I would agree more if &quot;struggles and conflicts&quot; were replaced with &quot;teenage angst and emo-ness&quot;, and if &quot;great&quot; were never used. It's...not like I don't believe why Zero wants to die so much, but the writer shouldn't spend every single second talking about that. Also I saw zero progression in the main characters and their love-triangle relationship. Frankly speaking, I think the writer is going to keep it like that until the last chapter (I'm reading a little bit of the manga myself too). It's a good way to attract teen readers because it's going to keep them guessing whom Yuki will end up with, with the help from traditional yuri-artstyle. The drawback, on the other hand, is that it makes the story pretty much pointless. But I think the most important question is whether I'm going to watch the second season? Yes I am. Am I going to recommend it to anyone? Of course not (unless that person is a fangirl). not like I don't believe why Zero wants to die so much, but the writer shouldn't spend every single second talking about that.

Vampire Knight is a bishounen lover's most lurid dream come true, to date. This is an irrefutable fact, however the question begs asking; does this show does have more to offer than beautiful people filled with angst? It's hard to judge these types of shows fairly because more often than not they are based on mangas [a lot of which I don't read]. Most of the time the smart thing to do is to just score based on the merits of the anime itself [which I intend to do here] but by doing so, the anime scores terribly because the...story score will suck because without the foundation of reading the manga the story seems like it's “lacking” or that the exposition is too slow and drawn out. Personally, I liked this show a lot this show [obviously] however objectively speaking, it does lack a certain universal appeal.~ ArtThe art style for this show definitely complies with my sense of aesthetics for anime. Bright, crisp colors for day scenes and a darker but similar color scheme for the night scenes. Lines are a bit thicker and noticeable but still neat and clean and the shading is smooth. There is also a good level of attention given to the small details as well as great representation of a number of textures and surfaces, like trees, broken glass, some of the walls in various scenes.The animation ranges from average to really good with some very subtle use of CGI. This is a shoujo series so there isn't much by way of fighting and action scenes but there are some weapons and special F/X used, most of which involve some sort of glow effect.~ SoundI don't think there was much music beyond the OP and ED...and if there was, the fact that I didn't notice, speaks volumes. The OP was OK enough. What I liked best about it was the flow and repetition of the words “Aka-ku, Aka-ku, Aka-ku/Yume-wo, Yume-wo Hate-e”. But it's the ED that's the better of the two, IMHO. It's very original, and I'm more  impressed by unique things and so i really like this deranged Gothic lullaby with it's unique melody and off-kilter waltzing rhythm.~ StoryVampire Knight is not a complex story. It's actually somewhat predictable and clichéd And the story is far from solid. Since this is another manga adaptation [I don't plan on reading the manga] to me, it's very noticeable how very “lacking” the story seems and so “light”. Vampire Knight fits squarely in the fantasy-drama category there's the fantasy element [vampires] and of course there is drama [angst]. There are some comedic elements punctuated throughout the series that offsets the overall angsty tone of the show...tho some times the comedy seemed ill-timed not to mention superfluous.One thing about this show that kept nagging at me is how it reminded me of two completely different shows. The first one is LOVELESS with all the bandages [bandage-fetish?] plus that whole sadomasochism thing [and let's not act like there was none in this show, OK?]  The second show VK reminds me of it Ouran High School Host Club with the elite school aspect, the comedy and the reverse-harem. I'm still not completely sure what a MOE anime is [if someone can give me a SIMPLE definition, hit me up] some say that it's an anime that caters to fetishes. If that's the case then, yes, Vampire Knight fits the bill because it seems to cater to all manner of fetishes from Gothic to twins to bandages to uniforms even a little suggestive Yaoi/Yuri action...and of course bishounen.~ CharactersWithout a doubt, it's the extensive cast of characters of Vampire Knight that made this show so appealing to many people. I can only speak for myself [and perhaps those of a similar inclination] that this show most definitely became a “top pick” as it presented a visually stunning cast of grade A, bona-fide bishounen. This seems to be what carries the weight of the purpose of this show. Extremely pretty boys all tormented and angst-ridden over some vague, mysterious issue. We have beautiful boys posing with each other [for those of us that like things risqué and slash-able] as well as beautiful boys all fawning over the female lead, Yuki [reverse-harem].Which brings me back to what I said about this show reminding me of Ouran...doesn't Yuki and Haruhi look similar? I know that a lot of anime heroines tend to have that vulnerable, waif-ish look with the big eyes and mousy brown hair but these two look similar [of course barring the fact that Yuuki is drawn more Gothic-looking.] and then combine that with the twins, the stoic tall guy, the hype, cute little blond guy along with the reverse-harem and the a private elite school and you can see why I find both shows similar.~ The VerdictGorgeous characters, beautiful set/scenes, decent animation however I would not say this show is for everyone. For example boys [or those who like “boyish” things] may not go for a show like this where beautiful boys lay on couches and fret over some seemingly banal issue.... this might be too EMO or whatever the new word is nowadays. ha-ha! Also from a continuity stand point the show may wind up incomplete.

The interactions are completely normal between them, but for some reason, the two main love interests can\'t keep their fangs off of her...flesh.Zero and Kaname both fall for her for no apparent reason, and the main character is so generic she\'s not even like a human anymore (Pun intended; though it wasn\'t very good). The plot falls into shambles, especially when vampires target Yuki out of lust for blood. Zero was a character with LOTS of potential, but even that was failed. To me, he became, unfortunately, the character with the most wasted capacity to do great things and make the storyline bearable.I could barely enjoy the anime because I cringed every 2 minutes. A new character that\'s even more cynical than the previous one appears, and it got tiring. I put it on hold for some time, trying to sort it out, and tried watching it again, but it was so cringeworthy I had to let it drop.If you value your intense and dramatic ""Hellsing"" life, then this anime is not for you. If you\'re one of those people who values their innocent sparkly ""Twilight"" life, then it\'s not for you, either. ANY vampire story lover should stay away.Overall 3/10 flesh.Zero and Kaname both fall for her for no apparent reason, and the main character is so generic she\'s not even like a human anymore (Pun intended; though it wasn\'t very good).

I personally loved watching Vampire Knight. The actual aspects of the anime such as the story and characters may not be up to par with other animes but I definitley did enjoy watching it.--STORY--The story in Vampire Knight probably got a bit repetitive as the anime went on. There were a few times that something new and interesting got brought into the story but that was short lived as something occured to stop that extra story to bring the anime back to the regular,...reptitive storyline it had going. Even with these reptitive story line I still enjoyed it. I actually loved it and I cannot really explain why. But, I will say the story was not very productive throughout the season.--ART--The art style in this anime was really pretty and some of the characters were GORGOUS! Zero is my absolute favourite, he just always looked AMAZING! Kaname was also very good looking and Yuki was very cute. The brightness in the eye's of vampires and the overall art style was really nice and easy to look at and I thought the constant dark colours of the anime also really worked.--SOUND--Sound was something I didn't really pay attention to whilst watching Vampire Knight but from what I did the sound was fine. That's all I can really say on that. Although I can say that I really liked the voice acting for each of the characters and Kaname's voice was very calming in the way he always spoke so calmly and seemed like every word was a word of understanding.--CHARACTER--So some of the characters in Vampire Knight were great (not naming any names...ZERO) and then there were some that seemed generic and boring. I was hoping that Yuki (main female heroine) would be more of a badass then always having Zero and Kaname or someone there to help her. She has a cool weapon that she never uses. Zero was a great character and I could go on for hours about him so I am just going to stop there and Kaname seemed to get more mysterious and interesting as the season went on. I will be very interested to see how he turns out in the next season. All the other charcters seemed pretty generic with no specifically interesting qualities though.--ENJOYMENT--As I have already said, I really enojoyed Vampire Knight. Even if it is not counted as one of the best crafted anime out there, if I enjoyed then that's what matters.--FINAL THOUGHTS--Vampire Knight is a bit of your cheesy, romance, action but not really, vampire anime. It may have not had the best story or characters but it was extremly enjoyable for myself to watch and I would recommended it to most people, probably to be met with a judgy look but that's ok because Zero. :)Zero is my bae <3 reptitive storyline it had going.

This is going to include spoilers. I\'ll try to keep the number down, but reviewing a series (or a movie or book or whatever) without spoiling anything is close to impossible.2. Everything in this review is my own opinion. You are free to state your own, but please don\'t try to force it onto me or someone else. Thanks.First, general information about the plot:The series mainly revolves around life at Cross Academy, a private school with a Day Class and a Night Class; the Day Class consist of normal students that sleep at night and study during the day;...the Night Class does it the other way around. Now, what only few people know (but what is actually painfully obvious), is that the Night Class consist solely of vampires.Yuuki, a girl from the Day Class of Cross Academy, was saved from a bad vampire by Kuran Kaname when she was 5 years old. Oddly enough, she also cannot remember anything from before that time. Kuran Kaname is a vampire and at the same time leader of the Night Class at Cross Academy. Yuuki was then adopted by Cross Kaien, chairman of Cross Academy and an acquaintance of Kaname\'s. Ever since then, Yuuki has admired Kaname, but also accepted that his saving her probably meant nothing to him. However, when Yuuki was 11 years old, Kaien, now her foster father, brought a boy home; he was covered in blood. The boy was Kiryuu Zero, and his family had been killed by vampires. He was the sole survivor. Understandably, he bears a deep-seated hatred for the entire vampire race - also for the pacifist group that is the Night Class. One day, Kaien asked him and Yuuki to become Prefects for the school, however, that was to be only a cover for their true task; guardians, to protect the secret of the Night Class from the outside world. Yuuki accepted for the sake of protecting and promoting the peace at Cross Academy, Zero did in order to keep the vampires in check. And thus, the love triangle is formed. Zero cares a lot about Yuuki, even though he doesn\'t show it; so does Kaname, even though Yuuki thinks otherwise.Characters & character development:There are a lot of characters in this series to know; in the beginning, you are likely to have trouble distinguishing some of them, especially Kain Akatsuki and Aidou Hanabusa, since they look almost like twins. That is probably the one trouble this anime has with its characters. Other than that, the main characters get a lot of spotlight, but somehow, there\'s always enough left for the others. I find that the love triangle Zero-Yuuki-Kaname is very interesting; Kaname and Zero are not simply rivals, nor do they want Yuuki\'s love; they simply wish to keep her away from the other. Both of them can\'t stand each other, Zero for obvious reasons and Kaname for reasons that have yet to be revealed at the beginning of the series.Plot development:I found that the plot in this series was rather easy to predict, however, that didn\'t bother me, as there were too many things happening between Zero, Yuuki and Kaname to think about the plot. However, there are a few revelations, but none of them are sudden; we always get hints, to the point where it is obvious. What is interesting about that is what it changes between the characters. Meaning that not the plot is interesting in this series, but the effect all those events have on the characters\' relationships.Buuuuuuut, all that changes in the second season, when Yuuki attempts to uncover her lost past. As usual, we get many hints over time, and at least for me, it was obvious what was going to happen. I\'m not going to spoil that big surprise here, find out for yourself. However, it is quite unfortunate that the anime quits at the (at least for me) most interesting point, the reason probably being that there wasn\'t enough manga material to continue the anime. But I can assure you, if a third season is coming, it will likely be soon.Comedy:Yes, even though Vampire Knight is a rather serious story, there are lots of funny bits, but the great thing is that they never seem misplaced. Especially funny is the scene where the chairman calls the Night Class his ""cute little vampires"" in front of Zero and Yuuki, and she almost literally reads Zero\'s mind on that subject for Kaien...Summary:Vampire Knight is an excellent anime for those who love vampire stories combined with romance; also for those who want to see how many hints they need to figure out a secret, even though that is rather secondary. It is one of my all-time favourites, and personally, I give it a 9,5/10, since it has pretty much everything I want... Except for a third season.The manga:Compared to the anime, the manga isn\'t much different. Drawing and storyline and such are almost exactly the same, save small details. However, if you hit the end of the second season for the anime and want to know how it goes on, go ahead and read the manga. It also has some (usually quite funny) ""bonus chapters"" that tell small sidestories that are unimportant to the main storyline, but usually show funny (and sometimes quite interesting) scenes that are not in the anime. The bonus chapters are usually quite pointless, but their simple pointlessness makes them so funny. For instance, Kaname randomly placing a bucket full of water on Aidou\'s head...Overall, I can only recommend this series. What are you waiting for? Go ahead and watch it! the Night Class does it the other way around.

Go ahead and watch it!', ""This anime gets an overall 7 by me, for many reasons.First, the story. Now I'm not saying the plot isn't good, but I didn't really care for it. I got bored. My friend is obsessed with Vampire Knight, but me, not so much. I don't know. I guess the whole vampire line.. I'm not sure. I just didn't care for the plot. There was comedy, and it was good humor. But it was one of those Animes that will get you cracking up, but you have one second before it gets serious again.Artwork was amazing. It had great style and I ADORED the uniforms....The animation was great too. Earns a 9 by me.Not much to base off of sound. The theme music for season 1 was great, but season 2's was just plain bad.The characters were given a 7 because I felt like they didn't show to much originality. Now I'm not saying there wasn't any, because there was, but I felt like not all the characters were as original as they COULD be.Enjoyment was a 7, because I enjoyed it, but didn't LOVE it. As in, I probably wouldn't watch it again.So overall it was given a 7. It isn't a must watch, but I would recommend it to many anime fans out there. The animation was great too.

The plot gradually grew, but I thought that they rushed the ending of it. Unlike many other anime, the story is quite similar to the manga, so if you if you read the manga as well, then you'll be glad.I'm personally a huge fan of romantic scenes and there were quite a few of them that just made me all mushy inside. There was a lot of action scenes as well so it isn't all just lovey dovey....so yeah, I think it's worth watching.This is my first review, I...tried to be broad so it doesn't give anything away but I'm not sure if it's any good....anyway yeah :) tried to be broad so it doesn't give anything away but I'm not sure if it's any good....anyway yeah :)"", 'I\'ve seen quite a few negative reviews about this series. You see, I\'m one of those people who reads reviews and takes them into serious consideration before watching an anime. If a series has unfavorable reviews, or some hiccup that I just can\'t deal with, I will refuse to watch the show. Vampire Knight is one of those shows that I would never have normally considered watching... that is, if I weighed reviews by the score at the top right.The majority of reviews ended up bashing the female lead, Yuuki Cross. They called her inept, stupid, slapped a martyr complex on her, and essentially said...that she\'s the worst female lead to come along since Shinji from Evangelion...Anyway, I read these after watching anime with exceedingly strong female leads (i.e. Maid Sama, Nodame Cantabile, etc.). Frankly, the idea of a feminine lead appealed to me, considering the disturbingly masculine leads I\'ve experienced up until now. I found Yuuki to be a breath of fresh air from the stereotypical shoujo lead. It\'s not that I felt she was more realistic than those other characters (though you have to admit a certain lack of realism in the characters of almost all romance plots. The characters are intended to appeal to a wide variety of audiences to increase ratings, not play at creating realistic characters), but rather that she seemed to turn a new page in that musty old book. She had her share of flaws, and her submissiveness did annoy me at some points, but they were bearable.Now, with that out of the way, allow me to explain exactly why I scored this show an eight. Some of you may cringe in horror at that. I don\'t really mind. My goal is to inform possible future viewers of whether or not they will enjoy the show.To be frank, if you don\'t like vampires, bishounens, or ""weak"" female leads, then you are going to hate this show. It will have nothing to offer you unless you\'re just doing it to blow a few hours. However, if you are into a darker romance plot than the usual ""girl meets guy, they fall in love with drama in between and live happily ever after,"" then you\'ll probably take a liking to this series. Furthermore, if you are getting sick of wondering exactly how many steroids your female lead is popping on an hourly basis, then you\'ll breathe a sigh of relief to know that Yuuki Cross has her fair share of estrogen and then some.The concept of the story is fairly nice: an academy where vampires and humans coexist (unknowingly on the humans\' behalf). The chairman\'s kids are the ""guardians,"" or the people who make sure that the human students don\'t learn of the existence of the vampire students. It\'s quite the task, considering that the vampires are your classic cast of bishies. They really played up on the ""vampires are hotter than the average person"" in this on. (While I\'m touching on art--albeit briefly--I\'d like to mention that Yuuki\'s eyes are indeed ridiculous. They are huge. You\'re probably thinking that they can\'t be that bad, and even if they are that you\'ve seen some pretty big eyes before. Even so, take my word for it. Yuuki\'s eyes take ""big"" to a whole new extreme.)Anyway, the story does take a few twists and turns as it goes, but it essentially revolves around the idea of humans and vampires coexisting peacefully. Everything else is mainly in the name of character development. That\'s not necessarily a bad thing, but it will definitely bore you if you wind up hating the characters.The characters were pretty good for the most part. There are a few cliches here and there, and some things go unexplained about the characters, but the interactions make sense for the most part, and they are handled in a way to fit the atmosphere of the show. At the same time, the interactions between the two male leads and Yuuki can get pretty tedious at times. It can be frustrating to watch all of that pent up angst an confusion. But that\'s pretty standard for romance anime in general.The sound was lovely. While I did not particularly care for the OP and ED, I found the music on a whole to suit the show perfectly. One minor problem would be how the music cuts off in the middle of the piece at a scene shift. I disliked that, as the pieces were quite nice from time to time, and the cut-off tended to occur while I was enjoying a particular piece...As a final note, since I\'ve made it clear that I thoroughly enjoyed this show, this review is exclusively for Vampire Knight. It does not extend to Vampire Knight guilty, which I do feel is worth a watch. In fact, I do not know how you can only watch the first installment. It ends with a bit of a cliffhanger (annoying, I know), with very few issues resolved. that she\'s the worst female lead to come along since Shinji from Evangelion...Anyway, I read these after watching anime with exceedingly strong female leads (i.e. Maid Sama, Nodame Cantabile, etc.).

From my rating, you can tell that I'm disappointed.Let's start of with the things I liked. I really liked the concept of a separation of classes at the academy: Night class and Day class. I also love the look of the uniforms. But sadly, that is where my Like List ends for Vampire Knight..Very dry and boring story. Repetitive and meaningless. Bland and useless characters. I don't even like the main character and that is really bad. I am actually surprised I finished both seasons. "", 'Story: 4The story was ordinary. Cliche. Not special in any way. First of all, why did all the vampires have to be ""gorgeous?"" Cliche. So cliche. And I found the fact that all the girls in the school clamored around the vampires and thought about them so much, the fact that they were so vapid and unintelligent, to be offensive. Females are NOT at all like the brainless mobsters in the school. It\'s like the freaking Twilight of anime.And the plot in general. Boy hates vampires -> girl who is friends with the boy runs around getting into danger due to extreme stupidity ->...girl being constantly saved by gorgeous boys time and time again. Don\'t give me that crap.Art: 7Yes, the art was good. The special effects, I have to admit, were pleasing, and the lighting gave certain scenes a great effect. The one thing that disturbs me about the art is Yuki\'s abnormally huge eyes.Sound: 9The sound complements the anime perfectly. It was perhaps the best part of watching Vampire Knight. The opening perfectly gets the intended feelings across, and the ending adds an eerie undertone to the anime, which is even more perfect, as it usually finishes with a cliffhanger.Character: 3It was bad. Unoriginal.Yuki is the typical good-girl protagonist, who is in the midst of a (of course) love triangle. She has no personality whatsoever besides her annoying optimism and is a complete crybaby. She want to protect the ones she loves, yet is not even capable of protecting herself, relying on others to save her from danger.Zero is the typical tortured, broody, hot guy who is meant to make fangirls with his good looks and heroism, along with a bad-boy attitude.Kaname is the typical dark, broody hot vampire (too much like Edward Cullen. Blech) and is all-powerful and all-chivalrous. He wows fangirls with his power and makes them squeal with his chivalry. Yet another stereotype.Enjoyment: 6I enjoyed it okay-ishly, but I would definitely not rewatch it. The constant cliff-hangers make the watcher want to find out what happens next, which actually does little to improve the anime.Overall: 5Mediocre, cliche, and unoriginal. That is all this anime is: average, and may even be a little less than average. girl being constantly saved by gorgeous boys time and time again. Don\'t give me that crap.Art: 7Yes, the art was good.

I also liked the idea of prefects having to keep the humans and vampires  in line when it comes to the classes. But the part I really didn't like was the fact that Yuki Cross was totally pathetic and couldn't really do anything for herself. Kaname and Zero always came to her rescue every time she messed up. There were also a lot of long romantic stares and soppy melodrama. The story never really comes to any climax.Art:The...art is okay. Nothing particularly special or worth talking about.Sound:The music is mainly classical in this series. It fits the anime, even if it's not the type of music I normally listen to.Character:This is probably the part of the anime I  disliked the most. Yuki was totally lame and relied on Kaname and Zero all the time.  She carries this staff thing around all the time and she doesn't do a very good job of using it because Kaname or Zero. She was just a really boring heroine. I have no problem with characters being really weak at the beginning but I expect them to grow and develop as a character. But no.

We also have Kaname who rescues Yuki all the time, but we have no real reason why he does. I mean it was kinda cute, but at the same time really creepy why he'd do that with no motivation or reason behind it.Enjoyment:To be perfectly honest, I didn't expect this anime to good. I only really watched it because I saw it on Chrunchyroll when I had nothing better to do. I just wanted to watch it casually and switch my brain off while watching it.Overall:Average. 4/10. art is okay. Nothing particularly special or worth talking about.Sound:The music is mainly classical in this series. It fits the anime, even if it's not the type of music I normally listen to.Character:This is probably the part of the anime I  disliked the most. Yuki was totally lame and relied on Kaname and Zero all the time.  She carries this staff thing around all the time and she doesn't do a very good job of using it because Kaname or Zero. She was just a really boring heroine. I have no problem with characters being really weak at the beginning but I expect them to grow and develop as a character. But no.

He was the only character I actually kind of cared what happened to.Yuki just seemed like an overly-obsessed fangirl, and both she and Kaname kind of screwed Zero over later on in the series.I really couldn\'t stand Kaname, either. He was just...a flat character who popped up at random moments to show his apparent displeasure at what was happening at any given time; it was just irritating, and for most of the characters, no growth occurred whatsoever. Yuki just got more annoying, but I\'m not sure if that counts as development or not.Another problem I had with Kaname, was the fact that the author seemed to have been trying to make him all mysterious, when in actuality, Kaname was merely some guy who the main character happened to be obsessed with for seemingly no reason. Even when they explained his backstory, it was quite under-developed. Kaname was treated like an important character, but as I previously stated, he never really showed up until it became oddly ""convenient"" to the story; he kind of just showed up whenever, and when he did, it was usually to show his unwarranted hostility towards Zero. a flat character who popped up at random moments to show his apparent displeasure at what was happening at any given time; it was just irritating, and for most of the characters, no growth occurred whatsoever.

I can see how people could enjoy it and I tried so hard to enjoy this, but it was just kind of meh.Story: 5/10 - There was story there, but it felt generically shoujo with the character development you would expect from a generic shonen anime. It wasn't unlikable, but it could have been much better.Art: I honestly don't care about the art. If a toddler drew it in crayon and it still had a good story, then count me in.Sound: 5/10  nothing memorable. The opening wasn't anything too amazing. Not bad, but not good.Character: 5/10 They had...such a good opportunity for characters here, but they ended up just being kind of stiff. generic girl gets in trouble and gets rescued.

I would recommend it though because it might be something someone else would like. It had redeeming qualities that just didn't appeal to me. I personally did not enjoy it too much but I would still recommend giving it a watch.BONUS: Watchability - This title was surprisingly tame as far as content goes. sure there is some blood and fighting but nothing too graphic. there was not much fanservice either that I remember and the language was also kept to a minimum. such a good opportunity for characters here, but they ended up just being kind of stiff. generic girl gets in trouble and gets rescued.

(I did my best to give an honest review of how I felt while watching)(for this part I won\'t include any spoilers but I\'ll put a special section at the end which include them)Characters.Yuki is a sorry excuse for a female lead. She does nothing of worth except apparently “smiling all the time” which is the reason many of the school\'s hottest guys have a crush on her. While she is supposed to be highly trained she doesn’t seem to be able to do anything...in combat situations (which becomes evident like 5 mins into episode 1 at least try a little). She\'s your classic damsel in distress. Her  main motivation is that she ""has to protect the school!"" but again she is incapable of this. Her main defense is being able to call for one of her vampire guys and they will come to the rescue. The guys\' characters are pretty bad too! Kaname literally grooms Yuki. He\'s like a thousand years old and she’s a teenager. I hate Yuki but that\'s awful (and I can\'t spoil anything here but things get so much worse in season 2 just trust me). Onto emo boy Zero, who I thought would be sensible. (slight spoiler for episode 1) His loss of identity, backstory, and struggle between human (vampire hunter) and devolution into vampire were really interesting and had they played this out right he could’ve been a top tier character. But let\'s not forget this is Vampire Knight we\'re talking about, so he stays a one dimensional emo character. Instead of focusing on this they turn to focus on his relationship with Yuki which is totally forced. Yuki\'s like “oh yea we always joke together” but I have never once seen this man joke around or smile at her before so I have no idea where she got that. The two have “zero” (see what I did) chemistry. They also decide to focus on his rivalry with Kaname. And no, it\'s not for any reasonable reason, maybe that he hates the pureblood lineage Kaname embodies, nope! It\'s because Kaname and Yuki have a thing going on! And he’s jealous!Instead of focusing on the characters themselves, the show tends to focus on the character dynamics and because the characters are structurally unsound, they end up in absurd situations.On to my least favorite character: the dad/headmaster. He’s supposed to be this legendary vampire hunter guy but I don\'t think this man is capable of anything at all. He\'s meant to be a comic relief character but he even fails at that. He condones Kaname and Yuki’s relationship even though he knows everything about Kaname’s age and background. He does nothing to keep the school safe because so many people die on school grounds and (spoiler for season 2) a literal war takes place there and he just goes along with it. Finally, he also is ok with the vampires drinking Yuki\'s blood and sends her out seemingly defenseless to be a guard. He does nothing to protect her or any of the other students.Bottom Line: Lots of wasted potential, characters are unhinged and extremely toxic to each other.Story (this section will contain some spoilers, I\'ll still leave a warning before hand)Moving on to the story. There are many, many problems. First: the vampires are supposed to learn to coexist with the students, however the human students don\'t know about the vampire students’ existence and the two classes are completely separated from each other, so in reality, this school does absolutely nothing to bridge vampires and humans. That\'s the whole premise of the show and it can\'t even do that right.Also this might just be a small thing but there’s that whole scene with the horse in the first episode and then we never see the horse again. There are so many scenes where they bring up something that could’ve been important, and then leave it behind.I want to point out that this show is such a bad manga adaptation.- (This is a season 2 SPOILER SECTION) Kaname’s role as Kuran family originator is mentioned one time. His revival through Rido and Rido’s kidnapping of the Kuran family heir is also never explained. These are all major plot points which are mentioned maybe once throughout the entirety of the show and never talked about again. The show has no neat ending. It\'s also never explained what the headmaster’s relationship to Juri was and why he was given Yuki.And can we talk about how the series progresses to a war at the end and all of the humans are in the auditorium the whole time.- (SPOILERS OVER)Bottom line, the manga, while still problematic, has much better storytelling and things aren’t just left unsaid.The plot progresses until it is so far off point that by the end of season 2 essentially it has nothing to do with the original premise and things escalate so quickly but none of the characters seem to have any reaction to this and continue on normally hence the show being ridiculous.ArtI wanted to take a quick second and touch on the art because I actually really did like the art style both in the manga and in the anime, shoujo art styles are great<3Finally:Enjoyment and Overall ThoughtsI thoroughly enjoyed watching this show crash and burn like “a highway accident” (as my friend put it). That\'s the perfect description and honestly I couldn’t get through one episode without thinking, “what?” The main issue is that the show takes itself much too seriously than it should for what it is. If you\'re ever feeling down and you want to watch something really trashy that you will definitely regret watching and be ashamed about, this is for you. The manga is not bad although similarly very problematic but at least we have better story lines, characters, and plots.

I mean, she\'s not a child anymore, and Yuuki was all like wanted to be with Kaname or something. It irritates me.The story is 7, and of course,the problem is Kaname and Yuuki. Like, seriously, they really freaking annoy me. Kaname keeps protecting Yuuki and he\'s...jealous because he\'s not the first one to taste Yuuki\'s blood and Yuuki keeps giving blood to someone (not gonna spoil if you haven\'t watched episode 3) so he won\'t become Level E, I mean, come on.....The rest are 10, except for the characters and story.

The whole concept of a vampire hater turning into a vampire is quite amusing, all that self-hatred and toil and such. It makes the characters deep and emotional. The pace...was perfect in my mind.Art (9):I love the dark art that they use, going with the theme, and they boys were pretty dang hot, if you ask me.

Also, the organ (organ, right?) and stings in the background while the anime was going on was perfectly excecuted. And as creepy and spine-chilling as it was, when you heard the sound of something sounding like crunchy skin when a vampire bit into someone\'s neck was disgustingly thrilling.

It may start off somewhat slow, but it definitely becomes more captivating with each episode. Throughout this anime, a love triangle is prominent consisting of the lead character Yuri, whom is open to the idea of vampires, Zero, whom is strongly opposed to anything remotely associated with vampires and Kaname, an actual vampire. The twist, I did not see coming, although some may, I surely did not!The style of anime is quite nice, colors and visual effects aesthetically pleasing, although there is  better, there is...most definitely A LOT worse. The sound, is fair... a bit so-so here and there, however the opening and closing tracks are hits in my opinion. There is no much character development present, however, there are flash backs of the previously mentioned character's childhoods, though that is about as deep as it gets. In regards to enjoyment, I rarely found myself bored; although at some parts it did drag on. Regardless, it was far from unbearable and if you push through those parts you'll most likely be pleasantly surprised.Overall, I rate this very good.

Let me just tell you why:I started to watch it accidentally I don\'t even remember how. But it just fascinated me soo.. soo much! I really liked the Story about Vampires and all these secrets around them. (And I\'m not a Twilight fan or whatever..) The plot takes hold of you and doesn\'t let you go till the very end! I was crying, I was laughing, I was freezing! The romance between the characters was just so heart touching even if there was not many ""romantic-scenes"" (and I\'m usually very...delicate when it comes to these scenes..) I just felt every single moment when there was a brief ""romantic"" moment! The main girl wasn\'t that annoying and trust me, I hate those girls normally in Animes.

It\'s when you are not ""satisfied "" and it leaves you with many questions and heart-ache( haha....)So if you like: dark, dramatic, not that bloody, less action, on it\'s own ""romantic"" vampire Anime..

Basically. the Cross Academy and there is a Night Class and Day Class. There is something special about the Night Class though.Story 9/10I like the story a lot. How it starts is interesting, and it will bring up questions for the veiwer to make their own theories about. Basically, Yuki and Zero who watch the school grounds at night to protect a certain secret from the Day Class students and Zero holds a secret too. Yuki was a young girl when Kaname found her on a snowy night...and he is her 'beginning.'The story is interesting because it is different from other vampire stories such as taking place at a school with two different kinds of 'people.'Part of Yuki's past is explained but not a lot which makes it more mysterious and this encouraged me to continue watching.Art -10/10I enjoy the art and how it was animated. I like the detail in the characters such as the eyes to the hair of the characters same as the scene.Sound 8/10I like the sound of the show such as the music it will fit perfect with the scene and the feeling.Character 6/10The reason I put 7 here is because I would have liked if they touched a bit more into Yuki and Zero's past or some of the other characters. I feel like if they did more of that I would have gave it a 7.One thing that bothers me about Yuki though is she talks about Kaname so much while Zero is kind of ignored even though she wants to look after him too. She always has problems picking between them which is annoying and how Kaname acts towards Yuki despite how uncomfortable Yuki is around him. With a bad experience with vampires, she even expresses that she is scared of him at one point.Enjoyment 10/10I enjoyed it very much.

And I think that\'s important!', ""Cross Academy was founded by the wealthy Kaien Cross to facilitate the idealized cohabitation of what would otherwise be considered predator and prey. Nestled away quiet and secluded in the woods, the students at this prestigious academy are segregated... Er, I mean, separated... Into two different classes. During the daylight hours, you’ll find the classrooms occupied by humans, going about their peaceful school lives in a way that both their innocence and ignorance are protected. Swing by campus at night, however, and you’ll find those same classrooms filled with students of a more pale and toothy sort. This class is made up of vampires, most...of which won’t hesitate to taste your blood if you get too close to them.Keeping these two halves of the student body separate are Yuki Cross and Zero Kiryu, the former of whom was adopted by Kaien following a traumatic vampire attack when she was a child, and the latter having been taken in years later after a similar event. Together, they form the disciplinary committee, formed to keep their fellow students from crossing a line that should never be crossed. Unfortunately for them, Zero seems to have brought something back with him from his encounter as a child, as he slowly begins to turn into a vampire himself. As he loses control of his humanity, it’s up to Yuki, his only friend in the world, to ease his pain and keep him tied to humanity. Can she save her childhood friend from a fate worse than death, or will her mind be too clouded by her feelings for the mysterious Vampire dorm leader, Kaname Kuran?Vampire Knight was animated by Studio Deen, a company that I praised heavily in my Irresponsible Captain Tylor review... But that was nineties Studio Deen, which I almost feel is a completely different company from 2007 Studio Deen. The animation budget, as is the case with most modern Deen releases, was bare bones, and on-screen movement is noticeably cheap with very few exceptions. Characters freeze in the background like lifeless mannequins if they’re not the focus of the scene, and move only slightly in very robotic spurts when they are. Characters profiles bounce up and down to indicate walking, or in the few far shots, they walk or run like they don’t actually exist in their own environment, with emotion only seeming to exist in their insanely detailed eyes.I can kind of tell by the angles, art design and often pretentious editing that Deen had a specific vision and visual tone in mind when they were making this show, but they just didn’t have the experience or talent necessary to work with such a small budget. The backgrounds are decent, albeit somewhat generic and lifeless. The character designs are highly attractive by shoujo standards, with it’s two male leads looking just debonair and hunky enough to tease the female viewers, and Yuki herself looking just enough like the wide-eyed, plain-yet-pretty protagonist that they’d want to insert themselves into. There aren’t very many characters other than them, but the ones we do have look distinguishable enough to be passable.The soundtrack is full dark gothic-sounding fare, blending somber piano, heart wrenching violin-work and a powerful greek choir to express the emotion of any given scene far better than the stiff looking characters can. Pipe organs are used in the main theme to create a sense of church-like foreboding, a fitting warning of the darker, more sinful paths the characters will inevitably travel. Composer Takefumi Haketa knows just when to use restraint and when to take over, grabbing your attention at all the right moments, and he also seems to know the characters themselves just well enough to give them appropriate themes to match their roles in the story. Yukis theme in particular actually had me choking up a bit the first time I heard it isolated. It’s a very well-made soundtrack in general, and it’s a really fun listen whether in or out of context.The opening theme is called Futatsu no Kodou to Akai Tsumi by On/Off, and as far as the song goes, it’s awesome. It takes the same tone and style as the soundtrack and turns it fast and catchy without bastardizing it. The video, on the other hand... Remember when I said the show occasionally uses pretentious editing? They go full tilt with it here. This single video crams in as much imagery as it can, somehow making time to go through that old cliché of having the camera pan past all the supporting characters in a single shot. It’s a busy op where there’s way too much going on visually, which is why I kind of appreciate the much slower pace of the ending theme’s video a little more. Still Doll by Kanon Wakeshima is probably the best piece in the entire soundtrack, at least in terms of composition and singing talent alone.The English dub, on the other hand, is ghastly. To start off on a positive note, there are two really good performances in this, with one of them of course coming from the celebrated VA Vic Mignona in the role of Zero, a character constantly going through some sort of physical or emotional turmoil, which Vic pulls off flawlessly. The other is by Laura Bailey, playing the role of the deliciously evil villain Maria, who sadly doesn’t enter the story until episode 9. She’s able to play both halves of her character in equally convincing fashions, and she doesn’t just do this by changing her voice... No, they’re two completely different characters in one, which she handles like the pro she is.All right, let’s rip this band-aid right off. In the role of Yuki Cross, we have Mela Lee, one of my least favorite voice actors ever. She’s more or less okay with her characters awkward or comedic scenes, but anywhere else, she alternates between sounding wooden and sounding like a deflating balloon. She also gets on a lot of viewers nerves by mispronouncing Kaname’s name with a distinct ‘meh’ at the end. But oh, speaking of Kaname, at least Yuki doesn’t sound like a synthesized computer voice. You can partially blame this on the character, but good voice actors can make a character sound good even without inflections. Somebody like Crispin Freeman could have killed this role.There are other assorted characters played by actors who don’t do a very bad job, but aside from Bryce Papenbrook as Hanabusa, Travis Willingham as Kaname’s best friend Toga and a delightful cameo appearance by Jamieson Price, they don’t get much in the way of screen time or lines. For the most part, their role in the story is to gush about how awesome Kaname is and dump exposition for the audience, and they do a serviceable job of it.The dub was written to be extremely faithful to the source material, with the only changes made being in the interest of matching the on-screen lip flaps. Believe it or not, this was kind of a bad idea. The dialogue is very literal, with little to no subtlety in any of it. As much as I hate using Family Guy as an example of anything, do you remember the Handiquacks episode, where Meg, Chris and Peter are trying to write their pilot? The dialogue in Vampire Knight sounds closer to what Chris and Peter settled on than the far more engaging line that Meg suggested. Everything is blatant and explanatory, making the characters sound stilted and downright boring.This is unusual for me, but I actually wish somebody had tweaked the dialogue to sound more flavorful... I’m not talking about crow-barring in slang terms or pop culture references, but it would have been nice to hear some double-talk and sly innuendos tying the thirst for blood to more basic impulses. Or at the very least, have the characters be a little more vague about their plans and motives so that the audience actually has something to think about. The only character who actually speaks with any subtlety or ambiguity is Maria, and Laura Bailey does have a lot of fun with this, but it only lasts for a single episode before her identity is revealed and she rejoins the rest of the cast in mediocrityThere are plenty of times in this season alone where two characters will have a conversation that goes along the lines of “Hey, remember that thing we both know about that the audience doesn’t?” “Yes, I do, and I’ll explain it to you, for no other reason than just to prove it! Seriously! No other reason!” And that’s just when they manage to avoid the most cliched exposition set-up in anime history, “As you know...” Rewrites are not a bad thing when done right, and Vampire Knight seriously needed one. If you need any more proof of this, there’s a scene in episode 9 where Zero gets scolded for not referring to a pure-blood with the proper honorific... Despite the fact that the dub has no honorifics. Go ahead and listen to it if you really want to hear Vic and Laura chew the scenery, but otherwise, stick to the subs on this one.If you didn’t notice from my plot summary, Vampire Knight follows what sounds... At least to me... like a flawed concept. Maybe I’m just thinking about this all wrong, but if you’re trying to encourage the peaceful cohabitation of humans and vampires... Maybe you want to let the humans know about it at some point? Maybe you’d want them to go to school together, under close supervision, rather than holding the humans just out of reach like a tasty snack that they’ll want even more because they can’t have it? Because every time these two classes meet, the chance for danger is so high that they needed to implement a disciplinary committee. And hell, it’s not like the sunlight kills the vamps. They just get sunburned... Which somehow makes less sense than the whole sparkly thing.While I haven’t heard anybody make that complaint before, I have heard pretty much every other complaint this series receives. A lot of them are from Twilight haters claiming it’s the anime answer to that sorry franchise, while a lot more of them criticize it on technical issues, or they just call it flat out boring. Yeah, this show doesn't have a very good reputation. Even Watchmojo, a Youtube channel that considers Naruto and Pokemon to be two of the top ten best anime ever made, didn’t even bother to include Vampire Knight on their top ten anime vampires list, despite Zero and Maria being pretty good candidates for it. So for everything that it does wrong, does it do anything right?Quite a few things, actually. Vampire Knight is a paranormal romance story through-and-through, belonging to the same genre as Twilight and it’s various knockoffs. The point of these titles is to be a sexy, romantic escapist fantasy for women, although target age may differ. Vampire Knight is about as good as a paranormal romance can get, as it succeeds at a few basic elements that Twilight failed at. First of all, in regards to the main love triangle, you never have to wonder why those two paranormal dudes are after that bland, bitchy Bella chick. Zero and Yukis relationship leaves absolutely no question about why they’re so close or why there’s so much unresolved tension between them, and while Kaname’s intentions aren’t made clear until season 2, you can still tell at an early stage that there’s some substance to it beyond him just being a creeper. Also, I hate to say it, Vampire Knight is actually really sexy.And no, I’m not saying there’s a ton of fanservice, exposed skin and big boobs. At best, Zero takes his shirt off a few times. The sexuality in this show is something far more subtle than that.See, the school is divided between two classes. The night class, the vampires, are mature, introspective, experienced, and generally carry an air of superiority. The night class, made up of humans, come off as much younger in comparison, despite being physically the same age. They’re naive, and they worship the night class, but interaction is forbidden... The vampires can only drink blood from other vampires, while the humans are left to wonder what goes on in the other class, having no idea what the truth of it all is, and yes, there’s heavy temptation on both sides. The metaphor behind all of this... Yes, Vampire Knight has a metaphor, close your jaws... Is about sexuality. Vampires represent the sexually active, while humans represent the virginal. That’s why the opening song’s title translates to “Two beating hearts and the crimson sin...” The blood in your heart is the sin.Now, if you’re going to sexualize vampires, you have a very fine line you need to be careful not to cross. Vampire bites aren’t always consensual, and a series that handles itself poorly could become rapey as a result. Long time readers will remember me criticizing Diabolik Lovers for exactly that problem. Non-consensual biting does occur in Vampire Knight, but unless it’s being used for tension, it’s considered a bad thing... Zero is so ashamed after he bites Yuki for the first time that he begs her to kill him before he gets worse, and doesn’t touch her again until she freely offers herself to him. Moments of tension between these two occur in a dimly lit bathroom, in the school pool, and in an empty part of the school where SHE LETS HIM BITE HER FROM BEHIND, turning the act of vampirism into an erotic sort of forbidden fruit.This is why Vampire Knight resonates so strongly with it’s target audience. This is why people like myself, who are still as far away from that target audience as possible, can still find it so damned addictive. It’s engaging not because of it’s low-stakes plot or it’s terrible writing, but because of its sexuality. And even if you don’t pick up on any of that, the main plot-line is still pretty interesting. Having one of your main characters struggling to resist becoming a vampire with every fiber of his being while a girl who cares about him tries her best to ease his pain while setting respectable boundaries is a concept you simply can’t screw up, and it makes borderline Mary-Sue Yuki into a much stronger character as a result.This plot-line will make up for all the other boring or confusing stuff, leading you all the way to a cliff-hanger that will leave you salivating for a second season... Which unfortunately exists. Yeah, I’m not going to talk too much about Vampire Knight Guilty, as I’m only reviewing season one, but it’s worth noting that in my opinion, that season is just one long, consistent journey downhill. It brings fatalism into the arcs of our three main characters, rendering all of the choices they’d made throughout the series pointless and ending in a conclusion that would have pissed me off even if it was conclusive... Which it wasn’t. But at least the first season makes you WANT a sequel, which is something.Vampire Knight is available from Viz media. You can watch the entire series for free on their site, or if you’d rather own the physical copy, you can find the DVD sets at a reasonable price both in stores and online. The second season, Guilty, can also be found the same way, or you can just buy all 26 episodes together. The original manga by Matsuri Hino is also available stateside from the same company, or just in old issues of Shoujo Beat. The live action musical is totally a thing that exists, and if you don’t need subtitles, you can view the whole thing on Youtube.Vampire Knight is everything a trashy paranormal romance should be. It’s romantic, it’s sexual, it plays very sincerely with the concepts of forbidden love and loss of innocence, and it even manages to squeeze in some homoeroticism at the last minute without ever breaking from context or character. Having said that, good trash is still trash, and being a more serviceable version of Twilight still leaves a lot to be desired. I enjoyed it for what it was, and I’m likely to keep my DVD set despite the unfortunate festering growth that’s attached to it. I won’t hold the second season’s failings against it, though... On it’s own, I give Vampire Knight a surprisingly decent 5/10. of which won’t hesitate to taste your blood if you get too close to them.Keeping these two halves of the student body separate are Yuki Cross and Zero Kiryu, the former of whom was adopted by Kaien following a traumatic vampire attack when she was a child, and the latter having been taken in years later after a similar event. Together, they form the disciplinary committee, formed to keep their fellow students from crossing a line that should never be crossed. Unfortunately for them, Zero seems to have brought something back with him from his encounter as a child, as he slowly begins to turn into a vampire himself. As he loses control of his humanity, it’s up to Yuki, his only friend in the world, to ease his pain and keep him tied to humanity. Can she save her childhood friend from a fate worse than death, or will her mind be too clouded by her feelings for the mysterious Vampire dorm leader, Kaname Kuran?Vampire Knight was animated by Studio Deen, a company that I praised heavily in my Irresponsible Captain Tylor review... But that was nineties Studio Deen, which I almost feel is a completely different company from 2007 Studio Deen. The animation budget, as is the case with most modern Deen releases, was bare bones, and on-screen movement is noticeably cheap with very few exceptions. Characters freeze in the background like lifeless mannequins if they’re not the focus of the scene, and move only slightly in very robotic spurts when they are. Characters profiles bounce up and down to indicate walking, or in the few far shots, they walk or run like they don’t actually exist in their own environment, with emotion only seeming to exist in their insanely detailed eyes.I can kind of tell by the angles, art design and often pretentious editing that Deen had a specific vision and visual tone in mind when they were making this show, but they just didn’t have the experience or talent necessary to work with such a small budget. The backgrounds are decent, albeit somewhat generic and lifeless. The character designs are highly attractive by shoujo standards, with it’s two male leads looking just debonair and hunky enough to tease the female viewers, and Yuki herself looking just enough like the wide-eyed, plain-yet-pretty protagonist that they’d want to insert themselves into. There aren’t very many characters other than them, but the ones we do have look distinguishable enough to be passable.The soundtrack is full dark gothic-sounding fare, blending somber piano, heart wrenching violin-work and a powerful greek choir to express the emotion of any given scene far better than the stiff looking characters can. Pipe organs are used in the main theme to create a sense of church-like foreboding, a fitting warning of the darker, more sinful paths the characters will inevitably travel. Composer Takefumi Haketa knows just when to use restraint and when to take over, grabbing your attention at all the right moments, and he also seems to know the characters themselves just well enough to give them appropriate themes to match their roles in the story. Yukis theme in particular actually had me choking up a bit the first time I heard it isolated. It’s a very well-made soundtrack in general, and it’s a really fun listen whether in or out of context.The opening theme is called Futatsu no Kodou to Akai Tsumi by On/Off, and as far as the song goes, it’s awesome. It takes the same tone and style as the soundtrack and turns it fast and catchy without bastardizing it. The video, on the other hand... Remember when I said the show occasionally uses pretentious editing? They go full tilt with it here. This single video crams in as much imagery as it can, somehow making time to go through that old cliché of having the camera pan past all the supporting characters in a single shot. It’s a busy op where there’s way too much going on visually, which is why I kind of appreciate the much slower pace of the ending theme’s video a little more. Still Doll by Kanon Wakeshima is probably the best piece in the entire soundtrack, at least in terms of composition and singing talent alone.The English dub, on the other hand, is ghastly. To start off on a positive note, there are two really good performances in this, with one of them of course coming from the celebrated VA Vic Mignona in the role of Zero, a character constantly going through some sort of physical or emotional turmoil, which Vic pulls off flawlessly. The other is by Laura Bailey, playing the role of the deliciously evil villain Maria, who sadly doesn’t enter the story until episode 9. She’s able to play both halves of her character in equally convincing fashions, and she doesn’t just do this by changing her voice... No, they’re two completely different characters in one, which she handles like the pro she is.All right, let’s rip this band-aid right off. In the role of Yuki Cross, we have Mela Lee, one of my least favorite voice actors ever. She’s more or less okay with her characters awkward or comedic scenes, but anywhere else, she alternates between sounding wooden and sounding like a deflating balloon. She also gets on a lot of viewers nerves by mispronouncing Kaname’s name with a distinct ‘meh’ at the end. But oh, speaking of Kaname, at least Yuki doesn’t sound like a synthesized computer voice. You can partially blame this on the character, but good voice actors can make a character sound good even without inflections. Somebody like Crispin Freeman could have killed this role.There are other assorted characters played by actors who don’t do a very bad job, but aside from Bryce Papenbrook as Hanabusa, Travis Willingham as Kaname’s best friend Toga and a delightful cameo appearance by Jamieson Price, they don’t get much in the way of screen time or lines. For the most part, their role in the story is to gush about how awesome Kaname is and dump exposition for the audience, and they do a serviceable job of it.The dub was written to be extremely faithful to the source material, with the only changes made being in the interest of matching the on-screen lip flaps. Believe it or not, this was kind of a bad idea. The dialogue is very literal, with little to no subtlety in any of it. As much as I hate using Family Guy as an example of anything, do you remember the Handiquacks episode, where Meg, Chris and Peter are trying to write their pilot? The dialogue in Vampire Knight sounds closer to what Chris and Peter settled on than the far more engaging line that Meg suggested. Everything is blatant and explanatory, making the characters sound stilted and downright boring.This is unusual for me, but I actually wish somebody had tweaked the dialogue to sound more flavorful... I’m not talking about crow-barring in slang terms or pop culture references, but it would have been nice to hear some double-talk and sly innuendos tying the thirst for blood to more basic impulses. Or at the very least, have the characters be a little more vague about their plans and motives so that the audience actually has something to think about. The only character who actually speaks with any subtlety or ambiguity is Maria, and Laura Bailey does have a lot of fun with this, but it only lasts for a single episode before her identity is revealed and she rejoins the rest of the cast in mediocrityThere are plenty of times in this season alone where two characters will have a conversation that goes along the lines of “Hey, remember that thing we both know about that the audience doesn’t?” “Yes, I do, and I’ll explain it to you, for no other reason than just to prove it! Seriously! No other reason!” And that’s just when they manage to avoid the most cliched exposition set-up in anime history, “As you know...” Rewrites are not a bad thing when done right, and Vampire Knight seriously needed one. If you need any more proof of this, there’s a scene in episode 9 where Zero gets scolded for not referring to a pure-blood with the proper honorific... Despite the fact that the dub has no honorifics. Go ahead and listen to it if you really want to hear Vic and Laura chew the scenery, but otherwise, stick to the subs on this one.If you didn’t notice from my plot summary, Vampire Knight follows what sounds... At least to me... like a flawed concept. Maybe I’m just thinking about this all wrong, but if you’re trying to encourage the peaceful cohabitation of humans and vampires... Maybe you want to let the humans know about it at some point? Maybe you’d want them to go to school together, under close supervision, rather than holding the humans just out of reach like a tasty snack that they’ll want even more because they can’t have it? Because every time these two classes meet, the chance for danger is so high that they needed to implement a disciplinary committee. And hell, it’s not like the sunlight kills the vamps. They just get sunburned... Which somehow makes less sense than the whole sparkly thing.While I haven’t heard anybody make that complaint before, I have heard pretty much every other complaint this series receives. A lot of them are from Twilight haters claiming it’s the anime answer to that sorry franchise, while a lot more of them criticize it on technical issues, or they just call it flat out boring. Yeah, this show doesn't have a very good reputation. Even Watchmojo, a Youtube channel that considers Naruto and Pokemon to be two of the top ten best anime ever made, didn’t even bother to include Vampire Knight on their top ten anime vampires list, despite Zero and Maria being pretty good candidates for it. So for everything that it does wrong, does it do anything right?Quite a few things, actually. Vampire Knight is a paranormal romance story through-and-through, belonging to the same genre as Twilight and it’s various knockoffs. The point of these titles is to be a sexy, romantic escapist fantasy for women, although target age may differ. Vampire Knight is about as good as a paranormal romance can get, as it succeeds at a few basic elements that Twilight failed at. First of all, in regards to the main love triangle, you never have to wonder why those two paranormal dudes are after that bland, bitchy Bella chick. Zero and Yukis relationship leaves absolutely no question about why they’re so close or why there’s so much unresolved tension between them, and while Kaname’s intentions aren’t made clear until season 2, you can still tell at an early stage that there’s some substance to it beyond him just being a creeper. Also, I hate to say it, Vampire Knight is actually really sexy.And no, I’m not saying there’s a ton of fanservice, exposed skin and big boobs. At best, Zero takes his shirt off a few times. The sexuality in this show is something far more subtle than that.See, the school is divided between two classes. The night class, the vampires, are mature, introspective, experienced, and generally carry an air of superiority. The night class, made up of humans, come off as much younger in comparison, despite being physically the same age. They’re naive, and they worship the night class, but interaction is forbidden... The vampires can only drink blood from other vampires, while the humans are left to wonder what goes on in the other class, having no idea what the truth of it all is, and yes, there’s heavy temptation on both sides. The metaphor behind all of this... Yes, Vampire Knight has a metaphor, close your jaws... Is about sexuality. Vampires represent the sexually active, while humans represent the virginal. That’s why the opening song’s title translates to “Two beating hearts and the crimson sin...” The blood in your heart is the sin.Now, if you’re going to sexualize vampires, you have a very fine line you need to be careful not to cross. Vampire bites aren’t always consensual, and a series that handles itself poorly could become rapey as a result. Long time readers will remember me criticizing Diabolik Lovers for exactly that problem. Non-consensual biting does occur in Vampire Knight, but unless it’s being used for tension, it’s considered a bad thing... Zero is so ashamed after he bites Yuki for the first time that he begs her to kill him before he gets worse, and doesn’t touch her again until she freely offers herself to him. Moments of tension between these two occur in a dimly lit bathroom, in the school pool, and in an empty part of the school where SHE LETS HIM BITE HER FROM BEHIND, turning the act of vampirism into an erotic sort of forbidden fruit.This is why Vampire Knight resonates so strongly with it’s target audience. This is why people like myself, who are still as far away from that target audience as possible, can still find it so damned addictive. It’s engaging not because of it’s low-stakes plot or it’s terrible writing, but because of its sexuality. And even if you don’t pick up on any of that, the main plot-line is still pretty interesting. Having one of your main characters struggling to resist becoming a vampire with every fiber of his being while a girl who cares about him tries her best to ease his pain while setting respectable boundaries is a concept you simply can’t screw up, and it makes borderline Mary-Sue Yuki into a much stronger character as a result.This plot-line will make up for all the other boring or confusing stuff, leading you all the way to a cliff-hanger that will leave you salivating for a second season... Which unfortunately exists. Yeah, I’m not going to talk too much about Vampire Knight Guilty, as I’m only reviewing season one, but it’s worth noting that in my opinion, that season is just one long, consistent journey downhill. It brings fatalism into the arcs of our three main characters, rendering all of the choices they’d made throughout the series pointless and ending in a conclusion that would have pissed me off even if it was conclusive... Which it wasn’t. But at least the first season makes you WANT a sequel, which is something.Vampire Knight is available from Viz media. You can watch the entire series for free on their site, or if you’d rather own the physical copy, you can find the DVD sets at a reasonable price both in stores and online. The second season, Guilty, can also be found the same way, or you can just buy all 26 episodes together. The original manga by Matsuri Hino is also available stateside from the same company, or just in old issues of Shoujo Beat. The live action musical is totally a thing that exists, and if you don’t need subtitles, you can view the whole thing on Youtube.Vampire Knight is everything a trashy paranormal romance should be.

Having said that, good trash is still trash, and being a more serviceable version of Twilight still leaves a lot to be desired. I enjoyed it for what it was, and I’m likely to keep my DVD set despite the unfortunate festering growth that’s attached to it. I won’t hold the second season’s failings against it, though...

But there's enough to keep watching.Art: The characters are very detailed and expressional. Especially Zero. You can see how much pain he has in his eyes. That's good art there. All of the characters have an expressional face.Sound: GoodCharacter(s): Each character has a personality for everyone. My favorite will always be Zero. But later, I liked Aido and Ichiru. It was amazing to see Aido change from resisting Yuki to not.I kind of wished the Anime did more with the two of them.Enjoyment: It's one where you have to be in the mood...for.

Because it really only gets good in the second season."", 'Ohkay, here it goes.Story-What really bothered me about the story was how in the beginning, it was introducing everything that the story was about. and once you get further into the story it leaves you on the edge of your chair just waiting to see what happens. By the time I finished the first season, I was jumping off my bed eager to know what\'s going to happen next. Season Two, I would say, in my opinion, and bare with me here, did not move forward. What I mean by that, during the first season, the story was actually getting to the plot,...and what lead to it, but once the plot hit, it\'s mystery after mystery after mystery after mystery! First, we have Yuki, I still don\'t understand her past, even though she kept flash-backing to it. Kaname, I\'m not even going to start on him. He\'s just a book with blank pages. You literally have to find the right words and letters somewhere in this world in order to understand how he came about. And Zero, him I wasn\'t that disappointed with, to me, it explained his....well, everything, his whole life, pretty much. I just had this feeling inside me that kept thinking wait, there\'s something more to this, I just know it. Yet, it left us hanging, hanging for so long I almost gave up and took the fall.Another thing that bothered me about the story, was the ending. This is the biggest disappointment EVER because after EVERYTHING that Zero and Yuki have been through, he still turns the other cheek, BUT IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. I\'m not to spoil the end.... Didn\'t he love her..? It was damn obvious to me despite the fact that it wasn\'t mentioned AT ALL. I hate.... hate.. how just because Yuki turns a completely different leaf, he automatically thinks, ""because she turned a new leaf, all that we have been through, all that she meant to me, is irrelevant."" despite the fact that he\'s a vampire hunter, I still lost some hope in them two, regardless of Yuki and Kaname, I think Zero and Yuki would be better together. It really disappointed me. But that\'s just my opinion.Also, at the end you see someone, I\'m not going to say whom, getting a flashback and, I\'m telling you, I cried the MOST at that part. I hope it will get to you as it did to me, because it was just completely sad and the thought of it being all over makes me want to cry again. AND... at the end you see two people, I\'m not going to say whom, go off on their own and then you realize. Shit, where\'s ______!! While I was watching, I completely forgot about this character and I cried because I realized where he was. Another mystery that I want to be solve because what if I\'m wrong.? And at the very very end, when you see Zero and what he does, that right there gave me tiny bit of hope, but inside I feel like the hope will just be a waste. I actually cried because Yuki and Zero are no longer close. It broke my heart into a billion pieces, you can\'t imagine how heartbroken I am.BUT.... I really love the story as well.... Just soo many shocking truths when the mysteries do get solved. I screamed in shock so loud I think I woke up my neighbors from across the street.And I did that almost every episode... maybe twice. I love everything, but the ending... It disappointed me so much that I was balling(crying immensely) but I also cried because it wasn\'t what I expected from the 3 main characters, Kaname, Yuki and Zero. And because the series was over as well, but mostly the first two.Art-The art was beautiful! I love the details, including Zero\'s tattoo and the veins and how they drew the night class students, they look gorgeous! Also, the bodies look incredibly amazing, and I put emphasis on the bodies because other animes would make them too tall, or too skinny that they look like twigs or tooth pick dolls walking and talking, it wasn\'t appealing to me.Sound-I LOVE the songs chosen for the openings and endings for both season, especially the ending for Season Two, because it was more of a creepy, scary , feeling and I think it fit the genre of the story well.Character-Ohkay, I\'m not going to spend my time on this one because I spent a lot of time on just the story.First off, Yuki. Because of her, half of the drama and supernatural things that happened, probably wouldn\'t have happened if she wasn\'t so selfish. Yuki pissed me off half of the time I watch it because she was too clueless to the point where it\'s not even cute anymore, and she was selfish, especially towards Zero. Poor Zero, I cried for him every time Yuki did something that hurt him. She is also stubborn, especially at the end. It got me soo mad because people were risking their lives for her and she decides to be an idiot and do things her way. But that was in the beginning of the end.. If that makes sense. Because if it wasn\'t for her, the ending would not have ended the way it did and the ending would\'ve have been a lot more disappointing than it already is.Then you have Kaname. Like I said, a huge book with blank pages. He is still filled with mystery and I gave up, hoping that I can be able to look into the manga and actually find the gates to Kaname. Other than that, I would want someone like Kaname, because to me, throughout the story, he was the one who was hurt the most. And it was all for Yuki. Kaname still is mysterious and I have a gut feeling that he will remain mysterious, which gets me aggravated because that makes the story less enjoyable.Last is Zero. Zero is, well, Zero. There\'s not much to say about him other than him having a huge grudge on Kaname and anyone who is related or associated with him. And towards the end, I feel like someone needs to hit him with a bloody rock and tell him to wake up and let it go. But Zero is also a guy who just hates himself, yet wants to make Yuki happy regardless if that means giving up his life for her. I cried so much for Zero. Yuki doesn\'t even realizes what she has, she\'s so selfish she just wants it all but doesn\'t look in front of her and sees what she already has. What saddens me the most is how he hasn\'t changed perspective at all in the end, and how he will just be miserable because of a grudge that\'s holding him back from moving on.Enjoyment-In general, I enjoyed it, some of the episodes were a bit too scary where I was scared to sleep at night, but I enjoyed the excitement. I enjoyed how I was always on alert and on the edge of my seat anxious to know what would happen next.Overall-Overall, it was amazing.. just amazingly beautiful. I loved it. I would say I would watch it again, but I think the excitement would begin to fade because I know how the story went. It really saddens me now that it\'s all over, and I wish there were more seasons and episodes because this series is truly one of the best, I love the plot twistings, the drama, the tension between the main characters, all of it. Even if it pissed me off a little bit and disappointed me greatly in the end, I think that not all endings are complete endings, let alone happy, and I think the ending just leaves you more on the edge of your seat to the point where you\'re already sitting on the floor. I realized that there is more drama than there is romance; its almost 50/50, but the drama is a bit greater. I recommend this to those who love the thrill, the excitement, the cliff hangers, the plot twisting, the journey of a love triangle, and maybe even like getting aggravated over it. It\'s a good story, and it makes you want to get more into it.I hope this was helpful :)And arigatoo for taking the time to read this ^-^ and what lead to it, but once the plot hit, it\'s mystery after mystery after mystery after mystery!

Luckily, Vampire Knight is one of them.Before I started Vampire Knight, I had very low expectations for the series. The animation style seemed sloppy, and the entire story seemed cliche and cheesy. This anime quickly changed my mind and erased all of my uncertainties.The story is somewhat of a love-triangle, not gonna lie. But it’s not bad at all! Even more than a love story, the series is action-packed, has well thought out dialogue, has amazing characters and character...development, and has many twists and turns that will make you want to keep watching episode after episode with no breaks in between.This series is a must watch if you enjoy all of the above. There is lots of blood, and lots of feels. The story-line progresses wonderfully, and is complete throughout the beginning, middle, climax, and end. Nothing left me disappointed. I mean, a little more love action would be nice, but that’s just because I’m a perv.As a sidenote, Vampire Knight Guilty is the second season that starts out right where the first season left off and should be watched directly after.Both opening theme songs are awesome.There are a few super epic twists that I hope don’t get spoiled for you.The reason this is an 8/10 and not higher, is mostly because of the animation. It’s simply not my favorite style. A few things could also be a bit less cheesy, effects could be cooler. If the series was longer I probably would have enjoyed it more.There you go, good luck and I hope you enjoy your Vampire Knight journey.~Oddtakuu development, and has many twists and turns that will make you want to keep watching episode after episode with no breaks in between.This series is a must watch if you enjoy all of the above. There is lots of blood, and lots of feels. The story-line progresses wonderfully, and is complete throughout the beginning, middle, climax, and end. Nothing left me disappointed. I mean, a little more love action would be nice, but that’s just because I’m a perv.As a sidenote, Vampire Knight Guilty is the second season that starts out right where the first season left off and should be watched directly after.Both opening theme songs are awesome.There are a few super epic twists that I hope don’t get spoiled for you.The reason this is an 8/10 and not higher, is mostly because of the animation.

I started watching this because I was told it was the darker, vampire version of Ouran, but I was sadly mistaken. It's just another common shoujo romance with vampires included.The story wasn't anything impressive. All the plots were pretty easily guessable, the the show is constantly surrounded by this dreary feel that makes it hard to watch. It's not exactly the type of dark I like in my shows, but I'm accustomed enough to shoujo romances and vampire stories that I managed to make it through.The art was fine. The characters were easily distinguishable, the animations for 'vampire...powers' were pretty cool to look at, and Zero's design (especially with his glowing eyes and tattoo) were pretty well done. The backgrounds and characters other than Zero, Yuki, and Kaname were too mundane to remember though.The opening and closing themes were pretty good, and the gothic music was cheesy but somewhat fitting. Most of the voice actors were pretty terrible, but with Vic voicing Zero, I managed to get through it, though I cringed every time any other character talked pretty much.The characters are cliche as any others you see. There's nothing special about them in the least. Don't even hope for character development either. The heroine is simply a doll who comes off at first as a strong heroine before becoming another regular wall decoration.I enjoyed it enough to finish it. Zero got me through it-- without him, I'm not sure if I could have retained my sanity through watching this. There's so many plot holes I don't even know where to start. Why are two people tasked with handling hordes? Why can't they just buy barriers? Why don't they instill an actual curfew? Why don't they have vampire hunters on campus until halfway through the season? Why does Zero get a private room? Why is every character an idiot?Overall, not bad, but not something I would watch again.I would recommend this if you: like damsels in distress, like fights, like vampires, like strong masculine guys being adamant while writhing in pain, love triangles?I would NOT recommend this if you: want character development, want an actual dark plot, don't like clichesHave a great day everyone! powers' were pretty cool to look at, and Zero's design (especially with his glowing eyes and tattoo) were pretty well done.

Having stumbled across it while watching television, I decided to give it a go.I actually enjoyed it quite a lot, but then again at age 13 I enjoyed pretty much anything that caught my interest. Now that I'm 17, I've been exposed to a lot of anime that I enjoy a lot more.So Vampire Knight is, in a nutshell, what you get when you turn Twilight into an anime, get rid of a lot of...the sparkles and werewolves and give it some more interesting characters. The story is simple: we have a boarding school that is inhabited by both vampires and humans. The vampires all take the Night Class, because hey, guess what, they're actually nocturnal! Well, except one - Zero Kiryuu, a vampire-turned-human who resides in the Day Class with his best friend Yuki Cross.Now, the main characters - Yuki, Zero and Kaname - can all be described as Bella, Jacob and Edward respectively, in layman's terms. Of course, mere comparisons will only bring forth confusion, so let me go through each of them real quick.Yuki is a cheerful but ditzy girl who really just wants everyone to get along with each other. Basically the typical cardboard cutout shoujo protagonist, really. There's nothing much more I can say about her, but she does become a little more badas after a particular turning point in the second season.Zero would probably be the end result of a fusion between Sasuke Uchiha and Jacob Black. He was the son of a couple of vampire hunters; however, he was bitten by a pureblood vampire for... some reason that I can't remember. But lemme just say that as a character, he's edgier than the Shadow the Hedgehog game, and that's saying something.And finally, we have Kaname, the gorgeous but mysterious pureblood vampire dude. Nothing much I can say about him, either, aside from some major spoilers - I honestly don't know whether it's because I haven't watched this anime in ages or he and the other characters are just that flat and poorly-developed. Because ironically enough, from what I remember Yuki was the one who got the most character development.So anyway, the art and animation in this anime is... okay. Nothing to write home about. The music's okay. The OPs and EDs aren't really my cup of tea, personally. I can't say much about the sub since I haven't watched it, but I'm not a very huge fan of the dub. I will give brownie points to Vic Mignogna pulling off a dark and edgy character's voice surprisingly well, but the rest of the characters' voices aren't really that great to listen to, especially Kaname's. He just sounds... so passive-aggressive all the time.Overall, if you happen to be 13 or younger, or you're just entertained easily, then you might actually enjoy watching this.

I was just starting to watch anime and this anime kind of made me a bit upset. The art style is very unique and I honestly didn't mind it as much. The big eyes were an adjustment.

It's such a good idea and theme but, the backgrounds of the characters kind of messed it up. In the end I was truly...shocked and honestly disgusted.I always had a thing for vampires and this really was fun to watch that sort of thing, but the characters honestly were weird. Yuki, she was a very weak character and seemed so... weird. Zero was the best character I would say, because he was almost normal. And might I say, the incest is not my thing at all.I love anime when it shows 2 people fighting for a girl, so that is the main reason why I watched this anime.

This show has all these things in abundance. What surprised me was that the story actually felt somewhat grounded. The characters' reasonings and motivations, while melodramatic, felt consistent and not unconvincing.The heroine Yuki is a mixed bag. She doesn't cry and drown in self guilt nearly as often as she could, and her actions aren't completely recklessly stupid. I was able to sympathize with her conundrum- wanting to help both Zero and Kuran and not understanding either of them or...herself, and I usually felt like she was making tough choices out of necessity. However, she was also pretty lame, carrying around a weapon she never ever uses.The politics of the vampire world were interesting to watch, and I felt like themes of mortality, trauma, cruel fate, attraction, and loyalty were well-explored.

Rest assured though my enjoyment of this show is primarily ironic, and has NOTHING to do with the hot vampire boys because I am dignified enough not to be swayed by such simplistic joys. The show is a laugh riot, and I mean it. There are some parts in this show that absolutely killed me to the point where I had to rewind and watch bits over just because it was so goddamn funny. I remember...a specific scene where a very dramatic thing had happened and they did this ridiculously dramatic zoom through a door and god that was funny. There's of course the main love interest's strange habit of laying on the couch in the sun half naked which is something he literally does every single episode, and then there's a batshit insane twist that I can't spoil, but I promise you is so mind bogglingly absurd that it's worth the price of admission alone.Take out all the unintentional comedy that's just rampant in this show though, and there is some stuff that is genuinely quality. It has a fun setup for a show of this type, and tries its best to blend the shoujo sort of tropes with a bit of action and horror elements to spice it up a bit (the success of that is dubious, but its an idea I can get down with regardless). It's somewhat tragic though because with some key changes, I do see a show that could have been enjoyable in a non-ironic way. The protagonist is by far the biggest issue with the show. I swear to christ- half of this shows runtime is devoted to her laying on a bed and hammering her exact feelings and motivations into our brain as if we were so braindead that we couldn't piece it together otherwise. I understand with the type of show this is that a tropey character with no personality being the lead is pretty much commonplace, but c'mon dude!There's this whole supporting cast that are really interesting in the form of the night class (a small group of vampires who attend the school after the other kids leave) but they just sort of linger in the background. I feel like Vampire Knight would have benefited greatly from just a couple of filler episodes here and there, just a few episodes where the melodrama took a backseat and we could spend some time doing some light fun activities with some of the supporting cast. Fuck dude- just every once in awhile take one of Yuki's dull ass monologues and replace it with whatever the hell the night class were up to and you'd at least manage to get me a bit more invested in those other characters. The problem isn't just that I wish there was more time with the night class, it's that as the show goes on they expect you to care alot about these guys who basically amount to set dressing the majority of the time. You can't expect me to be all choked up at the drama involving these people who I really don't know the first thing about, and you'd think that across 2 seasons of a show it wouldn't be that hard to give them something, anything to do, but no. The night class just sort of sit around and look pretty until they become necessary for progressing the plot, and then we're expected to get deeply invested.I feel like these problems can be encapsulated with the vampire power system the show introduces. All the vampires have their own special abilities, for example: Aido can manipulate ice, Senri can use his blood like a whip, etc, and the show builds to this battle with the big villain during season 2 and then the battle finally happens and it lasts like... 40 seconds. This is not a battle focused anime by any stretch of the imagination, and that's totally fine, but you can't half-ass the like final battle this hard and expect people to be cool with it. The question then is: why introduce this unique vampire power system only for it to come into play so few times? I'm assuming the answer to that question is because it was a thing in the manga, and the manga actually did something interesting with it, but we're not talking about the manga, we're talking about the anime, and the anime lets this power system (along with the night class as a whole) fall entirely into the background because Yuki Cross needs to lay on a bed and cry about how hard it is being surrounded by hot anime boys 24/7. All these problems persist throughout the show (Don't even get me started on the fucking vampire hunters, and Yagari the badass vampire hunting teacher man who is completely wasted).All in all, Vampire Knight is incredibly flawed, like so goddamn flawed, but it's also kind of a delightful mess. If you can put up with some really sloppily written melodrama and the worlds most useless protagonist, and you enjoy some corny and terrible romance (that's totally not insanely toxic or anything) then I think you'll have a lotta fun with Vampire Knight.OH YEAH- and the theme song kicks ass a specific scene where a very dramatic thing had happened and they did this ridiculously dramatic zoom through a door and god that was funny. There's of course the main love interest's strange habit of laying on the couch in the sun half naked which is something he literally does every single episode, and then there's a batshit insane twist that I can't spoil, but I promise you is so mind bogglingly absurd that it's worth the price of admission alone.Take out all the unintentional comedy that's just rampant in this show though, and there is some stuff that is genuinely quality. It has a fun setup for a show of this type, and tries its best to blend the shoujo sort of tropes with a bit of action and horror elements to spice it up a bit (the success of that is dubious, but its an idea I can get down with regardless). It's somewhat tragic though because with some key changes, I do see a show that could have been enjoyable in a non-ironic way. The protagonist is by far the biggest issue with the show. I swear to christ- half of this shows runtime is devoted to her laying on a bed and hammering her exact feelings and motivations into our brain as if we were so braindead that we couldn't piece it together otherwise. I understand with the type of show this is that a tropey character with no personality being the lead is pretty much commonplace, but c'mon dude!There's this whole supporting cast that are really interesting in the form of the night class (a small group of vampires who attend the school after the other kids leave) but they just sort of linger in the background. I feel like Vampire Knight would have benefited greatly from just a couple of filler episodes here and there, just a few episodes where the melodrama took a backseat and we could spend some time doing some light fun activities with some of the supporting cast. Fuck dude- just every once in awhile take one of Yuki's dull ass monologues and replace it with whatever the hell the night class were up to and you'd at least manage to get me a bit more invested in those other characters. The problem isn't just that I wish there was more time with the night class, it's that as the show goes on they expect you to care alot about these guys who basically amount to set dressing the majority of the time. You can't expect me to be all choked up at the drama involving these people who I really don't know the first thing about, and you'd think that across 2 seasons of a show it wouldn't be that hard to give them something, anything to do, but no. The night class just sort of sit around and look pretty until they become necessary for progressing the plot, and then we're expected to get deeply invested.I feel like these problems can be encapsulated with the vampire power system the show introduces. All the vampires have their own special abilities, for example: Aido can manipulate ice, Senri can use his blood like a whip, etc, and the show builds to this battle with the big villain during season 2 and then the battle finally happens and it lasts like... 40 seconds. This is not a battle focused anime by any stretch of the imagination, and that's totally fine, but you can't half-ass the like final battle this hard and expect people to be cool with it.

Almost immediately, Yuki\'s character was exposed to be nothing more than the same love-struck school girl and the storyline was that of every mediocre anime. However, the show proved itself to be different when Zero\'s secret struggle of being a vampire took off. This sudden internal fight created interesting suspense in this otherwise predictable story.The show became particularly noteworthy and distinguishable when Zero gave into his blood lust and drank Yuki\'s blood. His character, even in these early episodes, became the sole drive of the show, his hatred for vampire-kind creating a believable struggle for a...human turned vampire. Kaname\'s response to this scene was somewhat mysterious, yet expected. It was Yuki, however, that failed to surprise. Her predictable decision to still care for Zero, while also remaining ignorant of Zero\'s apparent feelings, was not believable.The show continued with this somewhat cliche love triangle, though remained interesting because of Zero\'s hatred for Kaname and struggle with himself. At this point in the show, the audience could easily empathize with Zero, somewhat like Kaname, and perhaps put up with Yuki despite her annoying qualities.The entrance of Maria Kurenai brought the show to a particular low. Her cliche ""bad-girl"" routine was annoying and loathsome, though it was perhaps the purpose of her character. The needless ""mystery"" of her true identity made the audience question why Shizuka did not just appear herself without the useless middle man.However, Maria\'s entrance did improve the tension between the characters. Kaname began showing particular promise as a character when he showed signs of dislike for Maria. Zero\'s character development and history continued nicely with his hate for Shizuka leading him to protect Yuki further. However, Yuki remained suspended in the middle of this now interesting development, making her character annoyingly naive amidst a greater problem.The entrance of Ichiru shifted the balance of the show and, though being an odd and sudden third party, proved to be an interesting and important addition to the show. His character provided another side to Zero\'s story, showing the difference between humans who hate vampires and humans who envy them. The heartbreaking conflict between these once loving brothers created even more depth to Zero\'s already tragic character.In the ball scene, the anticipated moment of Yuki and Kaname\'s romance finally arrived. However, it proved somewhat disappointing when Kaname\'s affection was met by childish complaints. While Kaname\'s character, at this point, seemed only important for his affection for Yuki and attractive face, the audience was left on Kaname\'s side, confused by Yuki\'s dismissiveness to both him and Zero.In the final episodes, Yuki unsurprisingly gives herself to Shizuka for Zero\'s sake. Fights ensue between nearly all the characters and the audience was left more interested in Yuki\'s choice between Zero and Kaname rather than the seemingly pointless fight with Shizuka, who did not seem to have a real motive at all. In the confusing end amid all the fighting, the audience was left to believe that Zero murdered Shizuka. Shizuka\'s dying story seemed more like ""filling"" time than anything else. However, Ichiru\'s character proved to be truly breathtaking when he, being a human, drank Shizuka\'s blood. It is this final episode, however, that truly brought everything to an exciting and suspenseful cliff hanger. Kaname\'s character, having been boring and needless throughout the whole season, suddenly became perhaps the most unique of all of them. When Kaname was revealed to be the true killer of Shizuka, his character became one of incredible illusion and mystery, his true motives being veiled throughout the entire season. In addition, Hanabusa\'s unrelenting loyalty to Kaname was shaken when he was revealed to be the only eyewitness of Shiuka\'s death.The final scene was one of true anticipation, being the final face off between Zero and Kaname. While they did not physically fight, Kaname revealed his true nature to Zero, not for the first time, but now in light with the murder he committed. While his motives towards Yuki were true, Kaname\'s motives for Zero and the school were left unknown. Surprisingly, and very excitingly, Kaname almost forced Zero to drink his blood, though the audience was left unsure exactly why he would choose to save such a hated foe.Overall, Vampire Knight has one of the more surprising and exciting storylines of anime. With the beginning being somewhat cliche, the show takes dramatic turns that quickly pull it from the ""romantic comedy"" genre to that of ""thriller"" or ""drama"". While Yuki\'s character is predictable, annoying, and not unlike that of any other anime female, she can be tolerated with Zero\'s unique and tragic character as well as the reveal of Kaname\'s ulterior motives. The end of this season proves to be an appropriate closure with Shizuka\'s death, yet also leaves the audience wanting more of the irresistible plot twists and interesting character relationships. With wonderful plot twists, incredibly developed supporting characters, and subtle themes of chaos vs harmony, Vampire Knight is a show worth watching and can be much enjoyed by audiences with preferences from the romantic genre all the way to that of thriller. human turned vampire.

The needless ""mystery"" of her true identity made the audience question why Shizuka did not just appear herself without the useless middle man.However, Maria\'s entrance did improve the tension between the characters. Kaname began showing particular promise as a character when he showed signs of dislike for Maria. Zero\'s character development and history continued nicely with his hate for Shizuka leading him to protect Yuki further. However, Yuki remained suspended in the middle of this now interesting development, making her character annoyingly naive amidst a greater problem.The entrance of Ichiru shifted the balance of the show and, though being an odd and sudden third party, proved to be an interesting and important addition to the show. His character provided another side to Zero\'s story, showing the difference between humans who hate vampires and humans who envy them. The heartbreaking conflict between these once loving brothers created even more depth to Zero\'s already tragic character.In the ball scene, the anticipated moment of Yuki and Kaname\'s romance finally arrived. However, it proved somewhat disappointing when Kaname\'s affection was met by childish complaints. While Kaname\'s character, at this point, seemed only important for his affection for Yuki and attractive face, the audience was left on Kaname\'s side, confused by Yuki\'s dismissiveness to both him and Zero.In the final episodes, Yuki unsurprisingly gives herself to Shizuka for Zero\'s sake. Fights ensue between nearly all the characters and the audience was left more interested in Yuki\'s choice between Zero and Kaname rather than the seemingly pointless fight with Shizuka, who did not seem to have a real motive at all. In the confusing end amid all the fighting, the audience was left to believe that Zero murdered Shizuka. Shizuka\'s dying story seemed more like ""filling"" time than anything else. However, Ichiru\'s character proved to be truly breathtaking when he, being a human, drank Shizuka\'s blood. It is this final episode, however, that truly brought everything to an exciting and suspenseful cliff hanger. Kaname\'s character, having been boring and needless throughout the whole season, suddenly became perhaps the most unique of all of them. When Kaname was revealed to be the true killer of Shizuka, his character became one of incredible illusion and mystery, his true motives being veiled throughout the entire season. In addition, Hanabusa\'s unrelenting loyalty to Kaname was shaken when he was revealed to be the only eyewitness of Shiuka\'s death.The final scene was one of true anticipation, being the final face off between Zero and Kaname. While they did not physically fight, Kaname revealed his true nature to Zero, not for the first time, but now in light with the murder he committed. While his motives towards Yuki were true, Kaname\'s motives for Zero and the school were left unknown. Surprisingly, and very excitingly, Kaname almost forced Zero to drink his blood, though the audience was left unsure exactly why he would choose to save such a hated foe.Overall, Vampire Knight has one of the more surprising and exciting storylines of anime. With the beginning being somewhat cliche, the show takes dramatic turns that quickly pull it from the ""romantic comedy"" genre to that of ""thriller"" or ""drama"". While Yuki\'s character is predictable, annoying, and not unlike that of any other anime female, she can be tolerated with Zero\'s unique and tragic character as well as the reveal of Kaname\'s ulterior motives. The end of this season proves to be an appropriate closure with Shizuka\'s death, yet also leaves the audience wanting more of the irresistible plot twists and interesting character relationships. With wonderful plot twists, incredibly developed supporting characters, and subtle themes of chaos vs harmony, Vampire Knight is a show worth watching and can be much enjoyed by audiences with preferences from the romantic genre all the way to that of thriller.', ""Vampire Knight is the worst kind of vampire story. It's extremely homoerotic, fetishistic and emo. The drama is the sort of stuff that a wristcutting 15 year old girl would write on her blog in 2002. It's almost on the level of the My Immortal fanfiction. It abuses vampire tropes like two vampires lusting over a human girl, a vampire who doesn't want to be a vampire and so, erotically, abuses himself to cope. There was something about a Level E vampire that kept being mentioned but it was never explained so I have no idea what its relevance was. The only thing I enjoyed...about this show was the opening song which is pretty cool.Avoid Vampire Knight at all costs. It is unholy and, although I haven't checked with my local priest, I think watching this counts as a mortal sin. about this show was the opening song which is pretty cool.Avoid Vampire Knight at all costs.

Lots of plotholes that make no sense and the love \'triangle\' is super meh. The only props I can really give this show is that our leading lady Yuki has a personality and isn\'t just a sweet girl who wants to help everyone and is...perfect waifu... Is what I\'d like to say but all this girl thinks about is the boys her in her life. It\'s not selfless as much as it\'s her thinking ""I can change him"".I\'d go into more detail as to why this love triangle doesn\'t work but I don\'t want to put any spoilers in this review.

It started really slow, and towards the end when I was just starting to like it a little bit it got weird and confusing so I dropped it. All I can say in terms of the story line is that it was really boring for me personally, and also a little weird but not in a good way. Also just when I was starting to enjoy the romance elements of the show they totally ruined it. Overall I'm giving it a 3.

Missing out on what? You ask. Well, the art of course!  Granted, it's not nearly as beautiful as the manga, but it's still pretty good (minus occasional fight scenes).  In fact, the whole reason I continued watching through all episodes of Vampire Knight and Guilty, was because of it.  It's so detailed and the colors are so dark and gorgeous that it held my interest the entire time.  I kept wondering how long it took them to draw all those scenes (I have no...idea how they animated it-for the record) with each character having such detailed clothes and hair and eyes.  Crazy.So what did I think of the rest of it?Story:Similar to every vampire romance.  Not necessarily my cup of tea, but hey if you take the story apart to it's core: vampires living among humans, it's pretty interesting.  (the whole romance thing overshadows the politics and nuances of it in every story like this though)  I am reading the manga, which is ongoing, so I would recommend to people who think the anime has no plot: read it.  After it gets past where the anime is; it gets more interesting, trust me.  They address some pretty interesting topics.  It's a shame the anime never touched on them.Sound:As other reviews have mentioned; the music is great.  The opening and closing have a sort of dark beauty to them.  I liked the first opening a lot.  The soundtrack itself is decent as well.Character:As mentioned, this is like most vampire romances and the characters follow that theme as well.  There's one girl with two guys that will cause a ship-war for the followers.  Much like the Edward and Jacob war of Twilight, you're bound to see Zero fans vs. Kaname fans online.  Yuuki isn't quite as needy as Bella, though, so that's good.  Actually I found the supporting characters more interesting.  The Night Class and the Hunter's Association have more drama between them (drama that I found more interesting than the romance aspect) than Zero and Kaname, well, almost.  I found Cross's idea that vampires and humans could coexist interesting and...well, I don't want to spoil anything.  I do want to say this: they gave the supporting characters very little to do in the anime.  Again, I recommend reading the manga.Enjoyment: 8/10I liked looking at the art and listening to the music.

Rather than being a dig at this anime, I say this as a positive. The other side of the coin is that, while better than the twilight movies, I\'ve seen more intelligent conversation in OHSHC (host club for non otaku).Story: 4A solid 4. A VERY solid 4. The show is entertaining to watch at a base level. That being said, if you like surprises, look slightly further. Maybe a little more to the left? I could accurately describe...in detail to my friend how the season would end from the first three episodes or so alone. I don\'t recommend this show as a ""I\'m going to sit down and watch this!"" show. Leave it running in the dubbed (cringe if you will but the dub was very well done for this show) while you write a paper or something. Odds are you won\'t miss anything.Art: 7I am probably being overly generous here by a full point or more. I personally liked the art style because it suited the genre. Those of you able to find symbolism in little ways will pick up on strange character effects that give a somewhat deeper insight into who they are.

I actually liked it so much that I started reading the manga, as well, which was even more beautiful, artistically, anyway.As much as I enjoyed the story, however, I couldn't say so much for the characters. I wasn't a huge fan of either Kaname or Zero: Kaname pretentious and conceited, which I guess he had a reason to be since he was so powerful. I'll admit he was pretty awesome in that respect, but mostly I just wanted to slap him. I liked Zero just a bit better, but all of his whining about hating vampires and hating his existence got a little old eventually. Yuki was okay, but I just felt like there was nothing unique about her to make her stick in my mind. As for the rest of the characters... none of them really resonated with me. I kind of liked Yori later on even though she was a minor character. I just thought she was sweet.Anyway, overall the first season of Vampire Knight was something I really enjoyed.

Yuki\'s English voice actor sounded honestly mediocre and for some reason had a hard time pronouncing Kaname Kuran\'s first name right. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the voice work for this anime Japanese & English that is. 10/10Characters: The main character Yuki Cross can be described in one word by everyone who watch this show. "" Pathetic"". She spends most of her time crying about not  being able to help Zero and lets her get into some kind of danger only for Zero and Kaname to save her ass. She can\'t do anything on her own and when confronted with a problem she runs away from it. She\'s a bland and forgettable as the main female lead. Kaname was a creepy stalker who had the hots for his own ( spoiler )..... ugh just thinking about it grosses me out. Zero was the only normal and decent one out of the three main characters. His love for Yuki was explained well and reasonable unlike Kaname and on top of that he is actually strong and dependable. Kaname has bad vibes coming from him just by looking at him. The side characters were interesting since they were actually developed. Hanabusa\'s reason for worshiping Kaname is pretty passionate and Kaien Cross\' love for his children was very strong and you could actually feel the bond between him and his family. I could mention other characters but this section is getting way too long. 6/10Story: I fell asleep while watching this anime which rarely happens even if I am watching an anime at 3:00 am because I\'d still be awake but this anime actually bored me to sleep. The plot was dull and forgettable simple as that. This anime is short so it shouldn\'t have any filer episodes but there were way too many filer episodes. Far too many sexually provocative blood draining scenes that was time consuming ( I mean there\'s like seven scenes in the anime where Zero keeps drinks Yuki\'s blood it\'s too many and takes up way too much time.) This anime also has incestuous elements to it which is a major instant turn off. I\'d rather watch the last few episodes of Death Note than this snore fest. I\'m not gonna include shit from the manga because news flash this isn\'t the manga.Enjoyment: This anime wasn\'t awful but it\'s nothing that I\'d watch twice. I guess since It was really boring  I didn\'t really understand half of it. But if the plot was decent, with the art style and music as well as the dub work this anime could have been a masterpiece. But sadly, the plot and characters just dragged it down. 4/10Overall: If you\'re interesting kinky romance sucking blood and hot guys shit like that or just have a lot of free time this is the anime for you. But for those who are looking an interesting anime about vampires here\'s a list of decent vampire animes:1 Hellsing/Ultimate ( Violence and War )2 Shiki ( Survival )3 Seraph of the End ( Friendship/ Family and War )4 Blood Lad ( This shits hilarious )5 Jojo\'s Bizarre adventure ( violence and profanity)6 Trinity Blood ( Masterpiece)7 Servamp ( In case you\'re into hot guys and fights because it was actually pretty good )8 Blood C (epic Fightsssssss )9 Bakemonogartari series ( This is so bad that its good )10 Vampire Hunter D ( very short but interesting)Vampire animes to avoid: Diabolik lovers because that shit will make you die and come back to life just to commit suicide againItsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi: I can\'t describe how cringy and awful this anime is anime.

It is what started my love for anime, so I decided to revisit it.Story 9/10 - It's unique to itself from what I can see, and I love how the characters interacted with each other. Sure, it did sometimes seem as if someone was doing something for no reason, but everything was eventually revealed. I would love to see the anime surpass what it already has.Art 10/10 - The art is beautiful and well made. Art styles are very important for me, and most times I tend to stray away from old art styles. Although sometimes I...would gawk at some very 'broad' shoulders.Sound 7/10 - I did this mainly because the voices rarely portrayed what emotion the character was showing. Also, some voices were a bit .... different.Character 9/10 - The characters were intriguing and each would surprise you in their own way.Overall 8/10 - The anime was something great to come back to and revigorate my love for anime.

Every episode feels the same. However, I do intend to finish it to see how exactly it ends. I admit, some episodes end where I'm curious to watch the next one.Yuki, our protagonist, is rather annoying. Her voice is starting to irritate me, as well as her actions.  She is rather bland and naive. But perhaps she is neutral enough for the viewers to imagine themselves as her, to appeal to teenage girls.As for the other characters, they seem to parrot things over and over again. It's getting rather boring. They are very...2 dimensional.The story is an interesting idea, but I suppose it's just poorly written. This is an anime you'd rather watch for fan service than the story itself.I have enjoyed the opening and ending. I like the art style as well, including the designs for their school uniforms.Overall, it has potential. I'm aware it gained a second season, so the ending may be better than I predict. 2 dimensional.The story is an interesting idea, but I suppose it's just poorly written.

I think it tried to be too many things and failed at everything.I'm not a fan of slice-of-life animes.

Sorry, going to have to put these somewhere. I will start with with the heroine. Yuki Cross annoys me quite a bit with her overly perky and prodding behavior. I'm not saying I dislike her per-se, just that I am annoyed by her personality. I also find that her eyes are drawn very large and I feel that they don't have character in them, and they don't suit the...small mouth drawn for her. Though needless to say, she is a unique and independent character, and I admire her for that.Now, for the pros! So many of the characters are so darn likable! For example, Zero Kiryu. He is a strong character for the series, and the inner conflict only helps with that. Another one of my favorite characters has to be Headmaster Kaien Cross. Excluding the scenes that show him as a foolish, silly, naïve imbecile. Other than those scenes, I admire that he has a level-headed wise personality, a mentor. Overall, the art is good, and the backgrounds are absolutely wonderful. The sound quality is good and I am enjoying the series quite a bit.Adding to the cons, though, would have to be all of the love-struck girls of the school, and it seems that Sayori Wakaba is the only rational, level-headed girl to attend.As I said before, this is what I have concluded after watching three episodes, and I'm sure Vampire Knight makes drastic changes in episodes I still have yet to watch. small mouth drawn for her.

Firstly, the writing: The story is about a girl called Yuki who was rescued by a vampire as a child and adopted by a former vampire hunter who now runs a school split into a day class of human students and a night class of vampire students. A love triangle develops between Yuki, her adopted brother, and the vampire who rescued her as a child. There's some action and some attempts at making the villains morally ambiguous, but none of the characters really undergo any development or make rational choices. For example, the senate want to bring back...to life the vampire who killed Kaname's parents... even though they have no control over him and he keeps killing their members.The character of Ichiru keeps changing sides willy nilly and doing things counter to his own motives, and to make matters worse one of Yuki's love interests is revealed to actually be her brother. This would disturb any real person, but instead she freaking agrees to be his lover, turning the cliché vampire love triangle into an incest vampire love triangle. Zero, one of thetwo love interests, also doesn't try to talk Yuki out of leaving with Kaname at the end, and for no reason promises to kill her, even though that is blindingly the opposite of what he actually wants to do, and his actions once again seem highly unrealistic. The animation quality is appalling by Studio Deen's standards.Anyone who's seen the Fate UBW movie knows that they have some seriously talented animators, but in this series the frame rate is often much slower in backgrounds than it is on the characters, and there are a few I stances of the walk-cycles being off, and it looking more like characters are growing than moving forwards. That might be forgivable, if it weren't for the fact that there are 2 scenes in which characters fall forwards out of windows and inexplicable land on their feet, suggesting that they did somersaults in mid air that we didn't see. Characters frequently go out of their way to act cool for no clear reason, including the headmaster, who half the time acts like a complete nut job, and since the vampires are in no way adversely affected by sunlight, it makes sense that they would be split up into the classes that they are.It's also not explained why all of the main characters who are vampires in the second season suddenly have powers that were said in the first season to be exclusive to purebloods. Yuki is also a very weak main character, frequently needing to be rescues and suffering from very unhealthy levels of obsession towards Kaname. It also makes no sense that Zero would ever be on a school disciplinary committee when he keeps skipping classes. The English dub is the worst I've ever had the misfortune of listening to in terms of bad voice acting, and two of the supporting characters, Aido and Ichijo look almost exactly the same, so it's often hard to tell who is who between them. In short, Vampire Knight is an appalling mess of an anime and I do not recommend it. 3/10 to life the vampire who killed Kaname's parents... even though they have no control over him and he keeps killing their members.The character of Ichiru keeps changing sides willy nilly and doing things counter to his own motives, and to make matters worse one of Yuki's love interests is revealed to actually be her brother.

Well, i liked it in a way that, it was kept short and less complicated. There are some stuffs that i find annoying about the characters but still i enjoyed watching. To be specific with the character, the main heroine, ""Yuuki"". I find her a little bit helpless, like she always needs to be taken care of and when she said she\'s ready to help she will eventually turn to something like (sorry for lack of better word) useless.I\'d say...the music, i mean are very very good. The opening song and the ending song are both fantastic! Eventhough some might think that the ending song is a bit creepy but hey! This is a vampire story so i guess, it cant be helped right ^_~ wink! the music, i mean are very very good. The opening song and the ending song are both fantastic!

"", 'Twilight, Interview with the Vampire, and even Vampire Diaries are just some of the famous movies and shows that tackles vampires. Vampires has always been one of my biggest fascination and here I am about to express in details on why vampires has always been a hot topic nowadays and why Vampire Knight became one of them.There’s a long review coming……….About the STORYFirst, it is a very common story for vampires to have a very gloomy life. In this series, we see how complicated can be the lives of vampires. Not only for the lowest type of vampires but for nobles and purebloods also. We...always admire them and yet they are always portrayed as not so happy people. It serves like a moral lesson that even with so much power and long lives it still wouldn’t give you an assurance of attaining happiness. We see vampires who do not want people around them turn into vampires and we also see human beings who wanted so bad to become a vampire.  After learning the truth about their lives and that vampire themselves is not so happy with their lives, you will realize the importance of being a human. The story itself might be gloomy and equipped with a very heavy drama however you can still get so excited by the storyline and main plot of the series. It is still interesting and anticipating to see how the story will go. The only thing that bothers me in the story is the romance part. One of the reasons why I love stories about vampires is because of their love story. Vampire’s love story is always complicated which is very much different from your everyday love story and yet you can still feel the passion from them when they are in love. Because they’ve been living for so long or can live for so long, vampires tend to either fool around with different people all their lives or search for that one true love. After finding that true love they will love that only person for the rest of their eternal lives. There is no half-hearted love when it comes to vampires and they are always so passionate about their love. The thing that bothers me is that it is an obvious fact that Yuki and Kaname are in love and yet it looks like to me that Yuki is more infatuated with Zero. In fact, there are moments when I thought that Kaname was just a third party and it is a love story between Yuki and Zero. Oh well, I guess it gives more a complicated touch to the story considering it is not just about the romance side of the story but more on the complicated lives of vampires that intertwines with humans.About the CHARACTERSThe number one reason why I just love vampires is that they are so damn gorgeous looking creatures. Particularly, in this series, almost all the characters are delicious looking especially the vampire characters. The author manages to create them perfectly and that’s not only with the way they look but more importantly with their personalities. Vampires are very proud creatures. Aside from the fact that they’ve been living for so long that they’ve acquire too many wisdoms much like old people, they are so proud of their species also. They believe that they are way above from any type of species including human beings. And because of that, they carry themselves with so much nobility, sophistication, and elegance. The series’ characters are the epitome of a genuine vampire. Setting aside the real and noble vampires, Zero is also gorgeous looking although he suffers a lot because he is not a vampire at will. I don’t exactly like Yuki though I don’t particularly like her. She’s one of those types of character that I like the least. The type of character that’s very frail and weak just like a traditional damsel in distress in your everyday fairy tale. She can’t do much and keep on doing misplaced kindness which turns out so cheesy and so very cliché. Because of her unnecessary and over to top kindness to Zero, it’s as if he is the real person that she loves when she always claims that she’s always been in love with Kaname. I really don’t like people who do things half-heartedly and can’t decide considering Kaname himself is so sure with his feelings with Yuki.About KURAN KANAMEKaname is the very epitome of a real vampire. Gorgeous, sophisticated, elegant, enigmatic and very much cool. Him being a pureblood and leads the rest of the vampires make him even hotter. Plus, there’s this very mysterious aura around him just like a typical vampire character. You really can’t understand what are his real motives and the reasons with his actions. And after realizing the reasons behind it all you will love him even more. In fact, his in the top 10 of my hundred lists of best characters and NUMBER ONE on my lists cutest male characters and that never changes for so many years already. I just love it when he speaks and utter the name “Yuki”. It is like a very devil seduction.About the AnimationVampire Knight has one of the most amazing animations with its breathtaking visuals and gorgeous looking characters. The seiyus’ voice gives more seduction to the hotness of the characters and so the delivery of the lines is so magnificent.This is one of my favorites and would always remember even after watching it or even after so many years. I am so looking forward to the sequel. always admire them and yet they are always portrayed as not so happy people.

They believe that they are way above from any type of species including human beings. And because of that, they carry themselves with so much nobility, sophistication, and elegance. The series’ characters are the epitome of a genuine vampire. Setting aside the real and noble vampires, Zero is also gorgeous looking although he suffers a lot because he is not a vampire at will. I don’t exactly like Yuki though I don’t particularly like her. She’s one of those types of character that I like the least. The type of character that’s very frail and weak just like a traditional damsel in distress in your everyday fairy tale. She can’t do much and keep on doing misplaced kindness which turns out so cheesy and so very cliché. Because of her unnecessary and over to top kindness to Zero, it’s as if he is the real person that she loves when she always claims that she’s always been in love with Kaname. I really don’t like people who do things half-heartedly and can’t decide considering Kaname himself is so sure with his feelings with Yuki.About KURAN KANAMEKaname is the very epitome of a real vampire. Gorgeous, sophisticated, elegant, enigmatic and very much cool. Him being a pureblood and leads the rest of the vampires make him even hotter. Plus, there’s this very mysterious aura around him just like a typical vampire character. You really can’t understand what are his real motives and the reasons with his actions. And after realizing the reasons behind it all you will love him even more. In fact, his in the top 10 of my hundred lists of best characters and NUMBER ONE on my lists cutest male characters and that never changes for so many years already. I just love it when he speaks and utter the name “Yuki”. It is like a very devil seduction.About the AnimationVampire Knight has one of the most amazing animations with its breathtaking visuals and gorgeous looking characters. The seiyus’ voice gives more seduction to the hotness of the characters and so the delivery of the lines is so magnificent.This is one of my favorites and would always remember even after watching it or even after so many years. I am so looking forward to the sequel.', 'Story9.5/10The amazing world of vampires.. where they are ruled by the awesome power of the pure bloods...Yuuki Cross who at the age of 5 was saved by a pure blood vampire Kaname from another blood thirsty vamp remembers this as her first memory.

(brotherly and sisterly love)Vampire knight is a long series obviously about vampires.The headmaster of true cross has a theory.....his theory is that Vampires and humans should get along and live side by side now and forever. But there are obviously going to be a few hiccups in this plan to ensure that it goes smoothly. This encludes The True Cross academys day students to protect the Night class students. Yuki Cross and Zero Kiryu, the only two students that can protect the Night classes secrets.theres a bit of a love triangle though inbetween Yuki Cross, Zero Kiryu and Kaname Kuran.

Shes the adopted daughter of the headmaster.Zero Kiryu: hes been Yukis childhood friend since he can remember but he hates Kaname and his affection towards Yuki. He was turned into a vampire when he was younger. he knows that soon he will be losing his sanity and will fall to a level E.Kaname Kuran: Hes the night class president and saved Yuki from a vicous vampire when they where younger. Hes the only Pureblood in the night class and thats why hes the president.Theres many other characters that you will meet along the way but all in all these are the main 3 characters to look out for in the series.A smash hit manga and anime all around the world, with many series and a brilliant story line it is a must read. the episodes can drag on a little bit and kind of repeat themselves, i recommend that you watch the episodes and then read the books.12:59 Pm 9th of October 2012 ~Amy is a night class student who is a vampire and Zero is a half blood.Half Blood: A person who isn't born a vampire and is turned into one during his or hers life.Yuki Cross: a young girl who knows nothing about her previous life as she had her memory wiped by a vampire that she doesn't know.

They both have love triangles, but the characters are different however...but I won't spoil it for you! :D The art has this gothic lolita style, I like it. The soundtrack does give you this gothic lolita vibe, it matches the art style and story perfectly. The characters were okay, Yuuki Cross comes off as a Mary-Sue, and so does Kaname Kuran...except he's a Gary-Stu. xD Zero Kiryu had to be my favorite character, he had character development throughout the show. I would say that I don't necessarily enjoy this anime. Some episodes were...good, but some weren't. Overall, I give this anime a...3 out of 5?

It had a nice premise, and some parts were written very well. However, overall disappointing from the standpoint of rewatching it for nostalgia.The art is good. Not horrible because it\'s an early 2000\'s anime, but the animation could be better; however, in my opinion, the animation is better than big series like Bleach. That\'s just my opinion. However, I do agree that the character designs were bland, but...I guess they tried to make it more serious toned. Then again we have series like Death Note that have more serious and ""normal"" designs; however, they\'re memorable.The voice acting was nothing in my opinion. It wasn\'t good nor bad. Nothing felt cringe worthy. (Note I watch the Japanese dub). I personally liked the music, but that\'s just my opinion. I do have trash taste in music though, lol.Fix the characters... The anime would have gotten a significantly higher score if it had better characters. Just for some clarification, Yuki and Kaname are not blood siblings. Kaname is her ancestor, but I\'ll let it slide because I\'ve seen way too many animes with that kind of romantic relationship. Also, Rima was my waifu before I learned I liked other girls.This is a guilty pleasure of mine because it holds such a high nostalgic value to me.

The whole setting and theme goes pretty well with the ""dark academia"" theme and the serious emotions they wanted to express–– Maybe it ends up a little too serious for the plot they are trying to give.Let\'s start with the story:Quite fair, not really brilliant. Even if there\'s perhaps some subplot at the last chapters (I would call it like ""the second arc"" of the anime), the main and only plot until chapter 10 (aprox) is the progressive transformation of Zero into...a level E vampire, how Yuri reacts to this, and the development of a bond between these two, and the change of Zero as a character. I am utterly serious, this anime has not other plot beside this and some triangular romance between Zero, Kaname and Yuri.A lot of aspects of the school fells like “empty, without use”: The fact that Yuki and Zero works as the Disciplinary Committee, which ends up as “some background data”; the fact that for some reason Yuki can jump in trees, jump from high walls, but she can’t (or the anime doesn’t let her) defeat some enemies (I’m actually angry with the anime about this, because Yuki could have defended herself in some situations, at least in the final chapter, but the anime want her to be the archetypical “girl in distress”); the fact that Yuki has a protection bracelet and doesn’t really use it in any chapter?; etc, etc.The art:Good enough to be enjoyed, but not that good to stay long term in your head, to feel thrilled by it or to search with despair the animation house and the original artist. It\'s pretty 2008 shoujo style anime, with big eyes, stylized bodies, bishounens and good-looking girls everywhere. Not a bad thing though; it doesn\'t stand out, but you feel quite nostalgic at seeing the style and the characters are pretty.A point for the anime: The op changes in the last arc, which is rather satisfying.The sound:Not really memorable except for some tracks like ""Secrets"" or the opening (I love the op too much, it just traps you). I literally went through some tracks and remembered or recognized barely one or two (without taking the op and ed into account). This anime does not stand out in music specifically. The music more of the times does not give a lot of feeling or complement that much a dramatic scene. However, it does set the scene and the ""vampire"" vibes: Organ, violin, piano and specific instruments for specific characters (like the music box for the mischevous, ""playful"" Maria\'s personality)The characters:I need to say that I was expecting a worse characterisation and found a quite enjoyable development from Zero.Let’s start with the (supposed) main character, Yuki. The character of Yuki has some depth: Her past events makes her to fear vampires, and she grows up with the company of the director and Kuran Kaname. Over the years, she gets more and more distant with Kaname and (probably) the director, and the place of these two relationships is filled in by Zero. Through all the serie, Yuki continuously tries to avoid Zero from killing himself, by supporting him, and trying her best to help him, even by giving her blood to him. You can see how Yuki overcomes her fear to vampires thanks to Zero, and you can actually comprehend why she wants to help Zero so badly, because she has passed four years thinking that Zero was her equal, and then realised how much Zero was suffering. There’s also the selfishness compound in Yuki’s actions: She doesn’t want to end up alone, and that is one of the reasons she does not want Zero to die, even if her actions will end up hurting Zero. Nevertheless, in the counterpart, Yuki is innocent and always end up in problems too bigs for her to solve them alone. This is actually a bad aspect, because the character throw herself to problems even when she and others has been in danger sooooo many times before because she did that. I mean, it is not realistic. She is not that clumsy or stupid, or she is not portrait as someone like that.Zero is one of the best characters in the anime, probably because he is who more story has. In my opinion, he is the real main in all the Vampire Knight series. Zero is presented at the start as a cold, distant boy who has been with Yuki for four years, and works with her as part of the Disciplinary Comittee. Zero also knows about the vampires, because a vampire killed his family when he was a kid. At the end of the first chapter, the spectator observe that Zero is not fully human, and has some vampire traits (because he is actually a vampire who was a human before, duh). The growth of the character comes with the fight Zero has inside him: He hates vampires, but he himself is a vampire. Then, in consequence, he hates himself, and actually tries to kill himself in order to end the pain and the fight, because he knows one day he will become a level E. At the start, what Zero thinks is that he does not have anyone, that he could give up without worries. Nevertheless, when Yuki learns about this, she said to Zero that she is there to help him. Zero, after a long long fight in his mind, decide in the last chapters that he will, like Yuki did, be at her side. There’s a change in Zero mentality: from a boy who wanted to die in order to end up his pain, to a boy who thinks about what is the best option to make less harm to the people he loves (aka Yuki). The suffering of the character is really well portrait: Zero doesn’t drink any blood (well, except when Yuki offers it, and he can’t resist that much), until the end, from Kaname, after he\'s telling him that it was because of Yuki that he was giving his blood. And Zero drinks it because, he wants to stay with Yuki for one side, but that is also what will make Yuki happier.Overall, the enjoyment is granted if you like bishounens, romance and more or less well-built vampire lore. Being sincere, this anime is not for everyone. It is quite mediocre too, so... Well. a level E vampire, how Yuri reacts to this, and the development of a bond between these two, and the change of Zero as a character.

Being sincere, this anime is not for everyone. It is quite mediocre too, so... Well.', ""Wow, definitely my “good” grade comes from the fact that my expectations were extremely low, I thought it would be a Diabolik Lovers 2.0, that must be why I found it better than I imagined. Well, I'm on the team that has a slight obsession with vampires, since Twilight. But I find it hard to find a decent vampire shoujo. I think the thing that bothered me the most in the entire anime was how helpless Yuuki is, getting hurt or getting into shit every episode, however, I must admit, she does more than a Yui would. I know my rating is kind of meaningless...because it's compared to another bad anime, but most of my judgment was in relation to that.*[Nossa, definitivamente essa minha nota “boa” vem pelo fato de que as minhas expectativas estavam extremamente baixas, pensava que seria um Diabolik Lovers 2.0, deve ser por isso que achei melhor do que imaginava. Bom, eu sou do time que tem uma leve obsessão por vampiros, desde Crepúsculo. Mas acho difícil achar um shoujo de vampiros que seja decente. Acho que a coisa que mais me incomodou no anime inteiro foi o quão indefesa Yuuki é, se machucando ou se metendo em merda em todo episódio, porém, devo admitir, que faz mais coisa do que uma Yui faria. Sei que minha nota é meio sem sentido pois é comparada ao de outro anime péssimo, mas a maior parte do meu julgamento foi em relação a isso.] PTStory: I don't know how to say the summary of the story before the antagonists appear at the end of the anime, maybe a combination of melodrama. I don't know how this narrative dragged on for so long, I would hardly be able to differentiate the episodes from each other, as they are all the same, what changes most among them are the flashbacks to the past, which are still poor, I believe that the best of them was the which shows Yuuki's affection for Kaname since she was younger, which answers some of why she likes him so much, but doesn't answer the opposite. The story doesn't have as many explanations, and the feeling is that they turned 4 episodes into 13, because the story is so shallow that it could be summarized in about 10 episodes less.*[História: Não sei dizer bem o resumo da história antes dos antagonistas aparecerem no final do anime, talvez uma junção de melodrama. Não sei como essa narrativa se arrastou por tanto tempo, dificilmente conseguiria diferenciar os episódios entre si, pois são todos iguais, o que mais muda entre eles são os flashbacks do passado, que ainda são meio pobres, acredito que o melhor deles tenha sido o que mostra a afeição de Yuuki por Kaname desde que ela era mais nova, o que responde um pouco do porquê dela gostar tanto dele, porém não responde o contrário. A história não tem tantas explicações, e o sentimento que se da é que transformaram 4 episódios em 13, pois a história é tão rasa que poderia ser resumida em uns 10 episódios a menos.] PTArt: I think it fits the pattern of the time in general, except for some scenes that the characters' faces cause some discomfort, not because it's too dark, but because of the strange appearance. Not to mention that if we compare it to the art of the manga, the art looks mediocre.*[Arte: Acho que se encaixa no padrão da época em geral, tirando por algumas cenas que a cara dos personagens causa certo desconforto, não por ser sombrio demais, mas pela fisionomia estranha. Sem contar que, se compararmos com a arte do mangá, a arte parecerá medíocre.] PTSound: It didn't really attract my attention, except for the opening that really sticks in your head.*[Som: Não atraiu muito a minha atenção, exceto a opening que gruda muito na cabeça.] PTCharacters: Bad. Just, really bad. Hard to empathize with someone here, not even their tragic and sad pasts could. The protagonist is the classic shoujo of the helpless and silly girl who needs to be saved, too bad, I could even blame the time when the anime was made, but it was together with OHSHC, where we have Haruhi, who is far from a helpless girl. Kaname for me is poorly presented, just exists to be adored and beautiful, how open the character is left is frustrating. Definitely one of the ones that pissed me off the most was Zero, it's impossible to empathize with him when the only thing he knows how to do is be an asshole and not be nice, I just got pissed off. I wanted to open a question now about why the other vampires are on the cover of the anime if they aren't even relevant enough for that?? It must have been the producers' best way of attracting girls desperate for handsome men.*[Personagens: Ruim. Apenas, muito ruim. Difícil criar empatia por alguém aqui, nem mesmos seus passados trágicos e tristes conseguiram. A protagonista é o clássico shoujo da garota indefesa e tonta que precisa ser salva, péssimo, poderia até mesmo culpar a época que o anime foi feito, mas foi junto mesmo de OHSHC, onde temos a Haruhi, que está longe de uma garota indefesa. Kaname para mim é mal apresentado, apenas existe para ser adorado e bonito, o quão aberto o personagem é deixado é frustrante. Definitivamente um dos que mais me irritou foi Zero, é impossível sentir empatia por ele quando a única coisa que ele sabe fazer é ser babaca e nada simpático, apenas me irritei. Queria abrir um questionamento agora do porquê os outros vampiros estão na capa do anime se eles se quer são relevantes o suficiente pra isso?? Deve ter sido a melhor forma dos produtores de atrair garotas desesperadas por homens bonitos.] PTEnjoyment: It wasn't a bother to see. I didn't give much of my attention to the anime itself and I don't regret it, I'm thinking of watching some episodes of Vampire Knight: Guilty to see if I'll continue this saga.Note: Why is Aidou beaten so many times in the anime? I don't care enough about it, but it's so repetitive it's comical.*[Prazer: Não foi um incômodo ver. Não dei muito de minha atenção ao anime em si e não me arrependo disso, estou pensando em ver alguns episódios de Vampire Knight: Guilty para pensar se continuarei essa saga.Obs: Por que Aidou apanha tantas vezes no anime? Não me importo o suficiente com isso, mas é tão repetitivo que chega a ser cômico.] PT~Nine <3 because it's compared to another bad anime, but most of my judgment was in relation to that.*[Nossa, definitivamente essa minha nota “boa” vem pelo fato de que as minhas expectativas estavam extremamente baixas, pensava que seria um Diabolik Lovers 2.0, deve ser por isso que achei melhor do que imaginava. Bom, eu sou do time que tem uma leve obsessão por vampiros, desde Crepúsculo. Mas acho difícil achar um shoujo de vampiros que seja decente. Acho que a coisa que mais me incomodou no anime inteiro foi o quão indefesa Yuuki é, se machucando ou se metendo em merda em todo episódio, porém, devo admitir, que faz mais coisa do que uma Yui faria. Sei que minha nota é meio sem sentido pois é comparada ao de outro anime péssimo, mas a maior parte do meu julgamento foi em relação a isso.] PTStory: I don't know how to say the summary of the story before the antagonists appear at the end of the anime, maybe a combination of melodrama. I don't know how this narrative dragged on for so long, I would hardly be able to differentiate the episodes from each other, as they are all the same, what changes most among them are the flashbacks to the past, which are still poor, I believe that the best of them was the which shows Yuuki's affection for Kaname since she was younger, which answers some of why she likes him so much, but doesn't answer the opposite. The story doesn't have as many explanations, and the feeling is that they turned 4 episodes into 13, because the story is so shallow that it could be summarized in about 10 episodes less.*[História: Não sei dizer bem o resumo da história antes dos antagonistas aparecerem no final do anime, talvez uma junção de melodrama. Não sei como essa narrativa se arrastou por tanto tempo, dificilmente conseguiria diferenciar os episódios entre si, pois são todos iguais, o que mais muda entre eles são os flashbacks do passado, que ainda são meio pobres, acredito que o melhor deles tenha sido o que mostra a afeição de Yuuki por Kaname desde que ela era mais nova, o que responde um pouco do porquê dela gostar tanto dele, porém não responde o contrário. A história não tem tantas explicações, e o sentimento que se da é que transformaram 4 episódios em 13, pois a história é tão rasa que poderia ser resumida em uns 10 episódios a menos.] PTArt: I think it fits the pattern of the time in general, except for some scenes that the characters' faces cause some discomfort, not because it's too dark, but because of the strange appearance. Not to mention that if we compare it to the art of the manga, the art looks mediocre.*[Arte: Acho que se encaixa no padrão da época em geral, tirando por algumas cenas que a cara dos personagens causa certo desconforto, não por ser sombrio demais, mas pela fisionomia estranha. Sem contar que, se compararmos com a arte do mangá, a arte parecerá medíocre.] PTSound: It didn't really attract my attention, except for the opening that really sticks in your head.*[Som: Não atraiu muito a minha atenção, exceto a opening que gruda muito na cabeça.] PTCharacters: Bad. Just, really bad. Hard to empathize with someone here, not even their tragic and sad pasts could. The protagonist is the classic shoujo of the helpless and silly girl who needs to be saved, too bad, I could even blame the time when the anime was made, but it was together with OHSHC, where we have Haruhi, who is far from a helpless girl. Kaname for me is poorly presented, just exists to be adored and beautiful, how open the character is left is frustrating. Definitely one of the ones that pissed me off the most was Zero, it's impossible to empathize with him when the only thing he knows how to do is be an asshole and not be nice, I just got pissed off. I wanted to open a question now about why the other vampires are on the cover of the anime if they aren't even relevant enough for that?? It must have been the producers' best way of attracting girls desperate for handsome men.*[Personagens: Ruim. Apenas, muito ruim. Difícil criar empatia por alguém aqui, nem mesmos seus passados trágicos e tristes conseguiram. A protagonista é o clássico shoujo da garota indefesa e tonta que precisa ser salva, péssimo, poderia até mesmo culpar a época que o anime foi feito, mas foi junto mesmo de OHSHC, onde temos a Haruhi, que está longe de uma garota indefesa. Kaname para mim é mal apresentado, apenas existe para ser adorado e bonito, o quão aberto o personagem é deixado é frustrante. Definitivamente um dos que mais me irritou foi Zero, é impossível sentir empatia por ele quando a única coisa que ele sabe fazer é ser babaca e nada simpático, apenas me irritei. Queria abrir um questionamento agora do porquê os outros vampiros estão na capa do anime se eles se quer são relevantes o suficiente pra isso?? Deve ter sido a melhor forma dos produtores de atrair garotas desesperadas por homens bonitos.] PTEnjoyment: It wasn't a bother to see. I didn't give much of my attention to the anime itself and I don't regret it, I'm thinking of watching some episodes of Vampire Knight: Guilty to see if I'll continue this saga.Note: Why is Aidou beaten so many times in the anime? I don't care enough about it, but it's so repetitive it's comical.*[Prazer: Não foi um incômodo ver.

It follows a lot of tropes in romance so I don't completely mind it. The first season focuses on Zero and Yuki's relationship a lot and does sprinkle in her feelings for Kaname but it doesn't feel as compelling as a love triangle. The pacing with these relationships and the secrets revealed along the way were very well done. The characters overall were decent.

Although, I did like the supporting characters such as Senri and Rima much more enjoyable. However, I feel it doesn't do justice towards the manga as it is slightly more childish. Maybe catering towards a younger audience.Yet, when I watch it now - there are numerous faults. I'm surprised viewers can get passed the first episode as its...slightly cringey especially in DUB.

I love dark themed anime, it really is the best genre. That being said, vampire themes can be really played out or straight up the same story over & over, to make it sort of boring. The same can be said of shojo.This particular plot blended together a traditional high school shojo with a vampire story line (think better version of twilight). It was interesting/different enough take that it keeps you engaged and still retained the dark/sexy vibe but in a more innocent way.Overall I wish it had more action and a little more sinister storyline but it...is an enjoyable watch. is an enjoyable watch.']"

It was adapted from the Crusher Joe light novels, written by author Haruka Takachiho. Directed by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko, who had already worked on the 1979’s Mobile Suit Gundam, it won Animage Anime Grand Prize in ’83.Story (6/10):Crusher Joe follows the adventures of Crusher Joe and his team, Alfin, Talos and Ricky. Our main characters are the so-called Crushers, a kind of legal and controlled mercenaries. The movie revolves around a group of Pirates, which have stolen a highly dangerous weapon, while Crusher Joe and his team are fighting the Pirate faction. The...Story overall is quite generic and is something that one would expect from this kind of movie. And although it’s not a complex story, it’s intelligent.Art (9/10):The Art is stunning in this Anime. While I was watching this, I forgot that it’s almost 30 years old. There were quite an amount of awesome fight scenes, and the design was splendid. Crusher Joe is without a doubt, one of the best-looking Anime’s from the early 80’s.Sounds (8/10):The Music in this Movie was always a crucial point, to create the perfect ambient. There wasn’t a moment where I thought the Music was misplaced, even when there wasn’t any. I don’t have any complains about the Voice Acting (Japanese Version), where the seiyu’s did a flawless job.Characters (8/10):All Characters are the most 80’s cliché possible, but everyone is likeable. They are all funny, serious and distinctive. The relationship between the 4 main Characters is very interesting, where they despite being all friends have the occasional fights, which can bring a good laugh.Enjoyment (9/10):With great fighting scenes, funny situations, enjoyable characters and a bit of romance, this Movie is really a great joy to watch. Even with its 120 minutes, you won’t ever feel bored, because there is always something happening.Overall (8/10):This is really an underrated and especially underappreciated Movie. This is one of the best Movies I have seen from the early 80’s and I don’t understand why it’s so underappreciated. A good way to sum this movie is to say that it’s a generic 80’s Anime at its best.

It's adapted from a series of sci-fi light novels Haruka Takachiho that were initially published in 1977.In this movie we follow a team of Crushers comprised of Joe, Alfin, Ricky and Talos. Crushers are intergalactic jacks-of-all-trades who will take on any task for the right price. Joe and his team are tasked with helping escort a cryogenically frozen heiress to a medical...facility.

The pirates have been playing them for fools in order to escape, but Joe doesn't like being fooled and goes to track the pirates down to get his revenge and to rescue the human cargo.I have to give props to the animation in this movie. The movie was pretty well animated. I also really love the more cartoonish stretch and pull techniques they use to make the characters so much more expressive and alive. I am a huge sucker for things like that and I really liked that in this movie. The space dogfights and general hand to hand combat was also animated pretty well, so I have no real complaints in terms of the visuals of the movie.The music in this movie let me down a little to be honest. I can not really remember any music at all. It almost felt like it wasn't even really there at all. Some better music definitely would have helped out during the fights and could have made the entire movie seem a lot more epic.Overall I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. I had been told before hand that I was probably gonng to like it, but I did not think I was going to like it as much as I did. The action in this movie was really good. They did a nice job making it so that our main characters felt strong and good at what they are doing, but at the same time they managed to keep them from being so overly strong and cool that no one would ever be a threat to them. This was shown especially during a fight at the disco where they would both beat people and get swarmed and overpowered. Other things I thought the movie did really well was the animation. The way they portrayed expression in the characters using more cartoonish animation techniques really did wonders for this movie. I also really liked that instead of having what the characters were thinking and feeling show through inner monologue, they used the animation and expressions of the characters to get that through to the viewers.Now I have a lot of praise for the show, but I also have a few complaints. One of the complaints which you could read earlier was in the music department. I don't really remember any music from the movie, cause it really did not make an impression on me. I wish they would have got some better music cause it really could have elevated some of the scenes in this movie. Other than that it's just minor things that I think they could have explored a bit more, such as the whole Crushers organization and some more villain motivations and how they were connected to the events that took place, but I think they did an ok job at that. I would really recommend people give this movie a watch. I don't understand why it's got such a low rating on MAL, cause I think it's a lot better than what it's given credit for.

The plot is serviceable; it\'s a relatively simple plot with predictable twists that\'s been done before, but they really stretch it out over the two hour-plus runtime. Direction-wise, there are often shots that seem repetitive or that linger on nothing in particular, probably in an attempt to pad the film. Some scenes look like they were inspired by iconic scenes in ""Star Wars."" (This came out around the same time.)The animation itself is good, especially for the time it was made. It\'s clear and fluid, with vivid colors. The character designs...are kind of generic, though, and the proportions on some of the characters seem to be a little off, making them look noodle-like in some scenes. There are some cartoonish elements in the animation, especially during the fights and comedic parts. The alien animals that pop up in the background throughout the movie look unique.As for the sound, this movie has an orchestral soundtrack, which sounds good enough on its own, but often doesn\'t fit the scenes it\'s paired with. For instance, suspenseful or dramatic music will start playing in scenes that aren\'t suspenseful or dramatic at all. The ending theme is average. The voice acting isn\'t anything spectacular; it\'s not terrible, but there\'s nothing memorable about it.There isn\'t much background given on the characters (just a brief intro at the beginning), or much at all about the universe they\'re in or how it works (like what exactly being a ""Crusher"" entails), so it\'s hard to empathize with the characters or really get into the story.As for explicit content, there is a lot of violence and death; people get killed in a variety of ways in this one, but mostly by getting shot. There is also a fair amount of nudity -- basically brief shots of breasts being shown here and there randomly (like on the cover of a magazine in the background, etc.), and there is a cryogenically frozen woman who is kept naked for about half of the movie.This anime movie wasn\'t the worst I\'ve ever seen, but it wasn\'t that good, either. If it had been about 30 minutes shorter and more compact in its direction, it probably would have made for a more agreeable watch.
