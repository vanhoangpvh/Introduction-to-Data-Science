Saikyou Bushouden: Sangoku Engi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6902/Saikyou_Bushouden__Sangoku_Engi,"[""Anyone ever watched the Romance of the Three Kingdoms anime version by Yokoyama Mitsuteru and was sad to find out that it did not continue the entire story from the book?  Well I got good and bad news for you.The good news is that this slightly more modern anime not only looks good and sounds good, it also covers the story written in the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms book and goes all the way to the end by showing one kingdom coming out as victorious.The bad news is that this anime is almost impossible to find.  Seems information on this anime...is limited so I will tell you the facts.  This anime IS available in both Chinese and Japanese dubs but it appears that it is impossible to buy it since DVDs do not exist for sell.I have watched all 52 episodes in Japanese and was very impressed with the quality of this anime.Overview:Story:  Follows the story of the original novel of Romance of the Three Kingdoms and covers it until the end.  The story does feel rushed though so if you've never read the novel then I suggest you do that first.  However, I think it is perfectly acceptable to watch this anime first.  It is very educational.Usually when there is a new Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it either follows the story through the perspective of the 3 factions, Wei, Wu, or Shu.  This anime follows the anime from the perspective of Shu, and I believe it definitely takes the cake as the best RoTK anime created as of yet, beating out Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi.Art:  I found the art style to be perfect  It has a good sense of realism and characters are not overly exaggerated.Sound:  The soundtrack is very nice.  At certain points when some heroes appeared in battle, there was this epic soundtrack that gave me chills.Character:  The characters are very well done and I felt really attached to a lot of them.  Since the story was rushed though there could be some improvements.Enjoyment:  I really enjoyed this anime and would watch it again.Overall:  This is the BEST animated version of the RoTK if you enjoyed Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi simply because it covers the story to the end and is realistic.  I give this anime a 10/10 is limited so I will tell you the facts.

Shinmai Maou no Testament Burst: Toujou Basara no Shigoku Heiwa na Nichijou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30365/Shinmai_Maou_no_Testament_Burst__Toujou_Basara_no_Shigoku_Heiwa_na_Nichijou,"[""Story: so this OVA is basically split into to parts so ill cover those. Segment 1 really is nothing new with Maria she tries to get Basara to basically bang or do lewd thing with Mio than at school stuff happens with him and Yuki they all 3 get knocked out and go too the nurse office only for Chisato to put the moves on him. Segment 2 is that maria says its mio birthday when basara goes too ask mio what she might want mio is under a hypnosis spell well cause of maria (also Yuki is aswell) basically too do lewd things.Art: art...is the same as the 2 season so nothing new here.Sound: OP is different but the Ed is okay otherwise sound is the same.Character:   Basara is the main guy of the anime and well he is pretty shy when it comes to the pervy parts but in action he is a total bad ass. Mio one of the main girls she is the demon lords daughter and honestly she can be a perv and also not she is pretty sweet and what not. Maria is another main girl of the anime and the succubus of the anime and she basically like Mio in a sense but she is like hella pervy in the anime and even recording the lewd thing happening. Yuki is the last main girl form the anime and is also basara long time friend she is pretty sweet she really doeskin show that much emotion most of the time unless really in battle but still she does. (copied my character reveiw of season 2 sense stuff about them never really changes.) Chisato im not gonna rip from my other review basically because of the fact she really isn't in this one at all really just there for the lewdness of Basara for that little moment but she is nice and sweet.Enjoyment: there is no action so yeah the comedy in this was pretty good and the ecchi moments are as good aswell nothing really to say here.Overall: it gets a 7 from me the OVA was good comedy was decent and ecchi was pretty good and now i finish the whole series as a whole the anime was really good worth the watch for sure is the same as the 2 season so nothing new here.Sound: OP is different but the Ed is okay otherwise sound is the same.Character:   Basara is the main guy of the anime and well he is pretty shy when it comes to the pervy parts but in action he is a total bad ass.

This OVA isn\'t that bad. They removed all the unnecessary demon plot stuff and focused on what they do best: ""Slice of Life mixed with Hentai.""Unlike the previous episodes, this one is somewhat creative in the absurd situations they end up in and in its high level of horniness.Like almost every situation in this, OVA is fueled by horniness, and it rarely lets up, so prepare for the BIG THIRST.Cons:1. Music is forgettable; I didn\'t remember a single soundtrack that stood out.2. Many of the sexual situations are ABSOLUTELY stupid. For example, getting mad at Basarchi; yes, I\'m...still calling him that for seeing you half-naked or getting ""stuck"" while climbing over an object because your crouch touched it and apparently, the pleasure of having your crouch touch something is too much.3. It\'s too damn short; this OVA is as long as a standard anime episode and doesn\'t add to the story.4. Half the cast is gone, and there\'s no explanation as to where they are, which doesn\'t make sense, especially since Zest is technically one of Basarchi\'s ""servants,"" so wouldn\'t having her near him in case she enters a sexual panic attack be smart?5. Best mode Basarchi is not present 0/10.Pros:1. The ""Lil Pervert Loli Succubus"" Maria is back! And she\'s back to her usual shenanigans. This episode is good because of Maria. I doubt it would be even half as good if she weren\'t in it.2. The humour attempts to make a comeback in this episode, and it\'s a mixed bag. The comedy outside of the expected sexual scenes is decent. Although it\'s very Japanese, you must understand and appreciate Japanese humour to enjoy it.3. As mentioned above, the Slice of Life elements have returned, making this OVA much more enjoyable because of all the ridiculous situations they find themselves in.4. This might be one of the most creative episodes in the series. The situations and locations vary significantly for its short run time.Conclusion:If you watched the first or second season, this episode would pose like icing on top of the cake. This cake icing tastes good but isn\'t necessary to the plot as there is no plot, so if you miss it, you\'re not going to miss much.The OVA is just a slice of life mixed with crazy fan service and repeats all the troupes we have already seen within this series. still calling him that for seeing you half-naked or getting ""stuck"" while climbing over an object because your crouch touched it and apparently, the pleasure of having your crouch touch something is too much.3.

Tenchi Muyou!: Galaxy Police Mihoshi Space Adventure,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2725/Tenchi_Muyou__Galaxy_Police_Mihoshi_Space_Adventure,"[""A spin-off of the Tenchi Muyo OVAs. Framed as Mihoshi telling the gang a story about her past work as Galactic Police Detective, but filling (almost) all roles in the story with the usual Tenchi characters. The notable exception is her partner Kiyone, who makes her first appearance here.The story itself is rather straight forward and centers on apprehending a thief who stole 'ultra energy material'. With the roles of chaser and chased being played by the main Tenchi Muyo characters, the usual character dynamics from there carry over, e.g. Ayeka and Ryouko competing for Tenchi's romantic attention. New character Kiyone plays the unfortunate role...of strait-laced detective who has to suffer from the ineptitude of her partner Mihoshi.The plot is nothing to write home about, but there are occasional switches of the narrative back to the main cast on Earth complaining about their depiction in the story, which adds extra amusement. Mainly important for people who intent to watch more of the Tenchi Muyo universe, since it introduces both Kiyone and the Pretty Sammy persona, which feature heavy in later works. of strait-laced detective who has to suffer from the ineptitude of her partner Mihoshi.The plot is nothing to write home about, but there are occasional switches of the narrative back to the main cast on Earth complaining about their depiction in the story, which adds extra amusement.

Tansu Warashi.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10502/Tansu_Warashi,"[""Due to the lack of free time which is supposed to be allotted for my daily serving of anime, I resorted to watching short anime films and such. Of course, I was hoping to find something as magnificent yet light as Tsumiki no Ie. Then I stumbled upon the 4 short anime shows that comprised the 2010 Young Animators' Training Project. As the name of the said endeavor implies, its an on-the-job-training project funded by the Japanese Animation Creators Association to train fresh aspiring animators. Although I found it not as touching, unique and outstanding as Tsumiki no Ie, this anime collection was still worth...the watch as each story brought me back to those shows and stories I used to love when I was still a child.Having been produced by Production I.G., the same people who served  us loads of great anime through the years, amazing classics like Neon Genesis Evangelion and Ghost in the Shell, the wild and random FLCL and touching anime series like Kimi ni Todoke and Higashi no Eden, Somehow, that set the bar quite high for me for this show, Tansu Warashi (The Wardrobe Dwellers). Although it was quite a letdown after seeing this show's art compared to the first 3 of the 2010YATP shows (I watched this one last) rather simple (although this observation is just superficial to its overall quality), and the story not as deep and touching, as exciting or not even gripping as I was expecting it to be (granted it's from Production I.G.), the show still proved to be very enjoyable in itself being a short lighthearted and laid-back slice-of-life tale. Tansu Warashi is the story of a regular OL (office lady), Hiiragi Noel and her brief yet unforgettable experience with six spirit children who live in a dresser that is passed down for generations of the women of the Hiiragi family. They also claim themselves to be the servants of the current Hiiragi family's mistress, or more likely, the mistress of her own apartment, Noel, and are bound to correct her too carefree ways of living, teach her to become a responsible adult, and help her bloom into a beautiful yet modest woman.STORY: 9The best part about this show, I could say, is its story. Like how its opening goes, Its quite relaxing and fairly easy to digest. Like I've mentioned earlier, having a warm yet light atmosphere, its like being served with a bowl of warm and tasty rice porridge. The consistency is perfect, the suitable amount of elements of comedy and emotions mixed in complement the flavor very well, providing the viewers with a healthy, hearty slice of life. Also, I loved the mix of characters that comprised the six wardrobe dwellers. Jirokichi, the safety specialist who looks like a mountaineer/archaeologist, Masa, the cook who dresses like a sushi chef, Yuki, the beautician with her curls and pouty lips and Tae, the motherly figure who teaches Noel the perfect manners looks like a traditional Japanese woman wearing a kimono. Daigoro the fat glutton and Hanpei the brat may seem like useless characters but I believe their presence might be for the purpose of training Noel on how to handle such troublesome folks.ART: 7Although, from one's observation, the show's backgrounds look really very simple, like something that popped out from a children's picture book - lightly colored with minimal detail, I think it fits the shows lighthearted theme nicely. Also, the characters are drawn with just enough to little detail and with flat colors, reminiscent of classic anime like Doraemon. Another thing I  couldn't help but notice is the dynamic images (e.g. characters) that move around a very light background throughout the show seems a little offish especially when the background turns dark, but maybe its just a matter of preference.MUSIC: 8The background music is very nice and pleasant, as expected from a relaxing theme of a show. Good lighthearted themes all throughout the scenes with a few memorable ones like the whistling laid-back theme where Noel returns home from work red-faced and a little tipsy and the light quirky theme during Hanpei's first appearance. The ED theme also provides good relaxing music fitting the short animation on a squiggly animated box that plays with it.ENJOYMENT: 8Overall, it provided me with a perfect relaxing end after watching the 2010YATP shows in one sitting. Usually, lighthearted and easygoing shows like this tend to stick to my head for quite sometime . It provides a good escape from the busy and tiring monotony of everyday life by sharing the same fun, mellow and pampered feeling similar to Noel's experience with her wardrobe dwelling friends. the watch as each story brought me back to those shows and stories I used to love when I was still a child.Having been produced by Production I.G., the same people who served  us loads of great anime through the years, amazing classics like Neon Genesis Evangelion and Ghost in the Shell, the wild and random FLCL and touching anime series like Kimi ni Todoke and Higashi no Eden, Somehow, that set the bar quite high for me for this show, Tansu Warashi (The Wardrobe Dwellers).

About feelings. Good things come then you realy need them even if you do not expect it. Anime about little miracles in our everyday life. I realy like this kind of stories and would like to recomend it everyone.Art is simple enouth but for this kind of story is the best solution. It reminds me oldschool anime were main thing is story, not art. Characters are interesting and in 23min we can see all disposition. ', 'Young Animator Training Project/Anime Mirai short reviews: Part 3/12Wardrobe Dwellers is basically Snow White if Snow White was a Japanese salarywoman. Also if Snow White didn’t have any singing or dancing or evil witch or basically anything interesting at all. A salarywoman moves into an old flat where magical fairies live in her wardrobe who tell her to kill hookers and something about her grandmother also owning this wardrobe. It’s supposed to be about the passing of generations and tries to lean on the nostalgia button, but never really pulls it off. Characters don’t show enough emotion or personality to feel anything from their reactions...to events. The wardrobe dwellers themselves are pretty boring people. Once they show up, they don’t really do anything else interesting. I was expecting them to do some funny stuff, maybe crack a few jokes or some slapstick humour, but the overall mood is too busy lounging around that it can’t work up the enthusiasm to have anything energetic happen.Verdict: Skip to events.

Shuumatsu no Izetta,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33433/Shuumatsu_no_Izetta,"['What’s worse: a consistently mediocre show, or a mediocre show that looked like it could’ve been a lot better? Whichever you prefer, Shoemaster no Izetta is the second option.I’m not gonna sit here and pretend that Shuumatsu was, at any point, even a strong contender for anime of the season. I don’t feel particularly burned or let down by this show falling apart, but at the same time I can’t help but feel a little surprised: Two super hot main characters, one of them being a witch or magician, a story with historical context, a metal-based OP, and one of the best soundtracks of the...year come together to form… a light 4. So, what the fuck happened?To be honest, it wasn’t that anything really happened, it’s just that Shuumatsu put on a nice facade for a bit. That sounds like I’m stating the obvious, but hear me out: This anime was only good on a conceptual level. Beyond writing ""MAGIC + WW2"" down, the writing team had no idea what the fuck to do. There’s no singular element to Shuumatsu that makes it bad, it’s a consistent series of fuck-ups and bad writing that starts to become apparent after the story’s introduction.Much of the conflict can be blamed on people being complete fucking idiots, and that’s never a good thing. When you have some pretty high stakes such as… I dunno, a WORLD WAR involved, it’s expected that the people have some sort of responsibility. This involves not discussing the weakness of someone who is single-handedly carrying you in the war, or even discussing this someone period, in broad fucking daylight. God forbid someone hears you and runs back to camp to tell all his friends about it for no reason... ... ... ... ... ...HEY WAIT A MINUTEAnother problem that becomes more apparent as time goes on is the absolute perfect perfectnicityness of the three lead characters: Izetta, Fine with an accent at the end, and Izetta’s Tits, which you better fuckin’ believe are fine with an accent at the end. These are the good guys, so they’re good people. They do absolutely nothing wrong and have no flaws whatsoever. Finemon is noble and brave and lives to defend the country she proudly leads. Everyone that’s not literally Hitler happily supports her. Izetta is the most OP being on the planet, and all she wants to do is use her power for good, which means indiscriminately killing shitloads of Nazis. Her entire character is that she totally wants a piece of dat Fine ass and will do virtually anything for it. She might be a little childish due to literally not having a life for the most part, which doesn’t really count as a flaw.Meanwhile, the bad guys are Nazis. They do bad things because they’re the bad guys and that’s basically it. I suppose the real context of the antagonists can be summed up as “read a fucking book”, but it’s not like we’re getting actual historical figures in this anime. This isn’t Drifters. This is an original story with not-very-cleverly renamed things like “Germania” involving original characters. Original characters such as Smug Villain who is a villain that smiles in a smug fashion. He has a low voice and talks clearly but quietly while smiling in a smug fashion. Because he’s the bad guy.Unyielding good versus unforgivable evil. It’s too obvious who you should root for. Tropes aren’t bad on their own, but too many of them will dumb things down and come off as boring, unless you can fully embrace them and use the best parts to tell a satisfying story. I’m describing ‘My Hero Academia’ for the record. Not that it’s related. But meanwhile, Shuumatsu is full of one-note, trope-y, flat basic bitches. Well, not Izetta. She’s not flat. She got some pretty big dynamics nahimean?In short, despite the serious tone Shuumatsu puts off in its early moments, its story is far from mature. Even when nothing is happening, there’s still something wrong. Like, talking about pie for all eternity, or watching Izetta get molested by some creepy designer lady. I think that’s where they uh… Cross the Line, eh???? Goddamn that song is good.Okay, so I’ve complained a lot about a show that’s based on a hot chick flying around on a gun. So let’s talk about that for a moment. For some reason, people defend bad writing and fanservice with “she’s riding a gun, it was stupid to begin with!” Just because something’s a little silly doesn’t mean all its faults are suddenly cleared. Like, what? It doesn’t even look or seem that silly. Not only is it cool as shit, but it brilliantly combines both the setting of war and the concept of magic. If anything, wearing a big hat and flying around on a broom would’ve been inappropriate.But anyway, the battles themselves are actually pretty good. Izetta is OP as shit and just fucking destroys everything in her path. It’s a lot of fun seeing shit like that, and it’s not every day where you see tanks getting thrown around. But, of course, the stakes need to be raised at some point, so the enemy introduces… more magic. Aww… It’s kind of a bummer that they couldn’t stick with Magic vs. Military and had to make it Magic vs. Magic instead. Granted, the story’s timeline gives it very limited technology, but it would’ve been really cool to see the Germans--oh, sorry--the GERMANIANS (you know that\'s just Germany in Romanian, right? That\'s not a rename at all, those hacks!) develop some sort of weapon or even a clever strategy to level the playing field a bit, instead of just introducing more magic out of nowhere.That said, when Izetta has finally met her match, things don’t go downhill. They get crushed, flattened, stomped on, pushed off a cliff, and dropped into the fucking ocean. Shit gets real FAST and that made me appreciate the evil side a lot more.Nothing’s animated too well, though. Izetta flying around looks quite nice, and let me compliment the character designs one more time because they’re outstanding. But, as expected, the larger animations such as large objects getting tossed around or a collection of swords slicing around… they’re CG. The CG itself isn’t particularly good nor bad, but combined with normal 2D animation, it looks kinda weird and took me out of the experience a little. I don’t remember anything being terrible, though. The general style is very common despite the obscure studio--if you told me this was by A-1 Pissants or J.C. Staff, I wouldn\'t have questioned it.The soundtrack on the other hand… now there’s a hidden gem. The mystical, magical music in the back with a rock influence, particularly with Izetta’s fight scenes, holy shit it’s brilliant. It felt a little overdone, though. Exposition could be going on, and the composer’s still going apeshit with dark, jittery, and mysterious music as if the most amazing plot twist’s about to happen. Still, I’m gonna be downloading thi--I mean purchasing this soundtrack in a very legal manner when it releases to the public. And the credits themes were equally outstanding. ‘Cross the Line’ has one of the most hype-inducing introductions of the entire year, and its piercing metal sound kept me on my toes the whole way through. The epic piano ballad used as the ED is equally mesmerizing despite being basically the exact opposite sound.Would I recommend Izetta: The Last Witch? Given the interesting premise, I might. After all, an anime with historical context always draws in an audience. \'member Joker Game? Talk about awkward! Anyway, just be warned. You’re not getting a very intricately-written story. It has some good moments for sure, but more often than not you’ll want to rip your hair out. Come in mostly for the fights and the occasional charm. And don’t forget the boobies. Hooray for boobies.Story - 3/10Art - 6/10Sound - 9/10Character - 2/10Enjoyment - 4/10Izetta - Fine/10Overall - 4.25/10 (Score range: 3.5-5.0)Favorite episode - 1Favorite character - Izetta’s EttasRecommendation level - Medium year come together to form… a light 4.

Tropes aren’t bad on their own, but too many of them will dumb things down and come off as boring, unless you can fully embrace them and use the best parts to tell a satisfying story. I’m describing ‘My Hero Academia’ for the record. Not that it’s related. But meanwhile, Shuumatsu is full of one-note, trope-y, flat basic bitches. Well, not Izetta. She’s not flat. She got some pretty big dynamics nahimean?In short, despite the serious tone Shuumatsu puts off in its early moments, its story is far from mature. Even when nothing is happening, there’s still something wrong. Like, talking about pie for all eternity, or watching Izetta get molested by some creepy designer lady. I think that’s where they uh… Cross the Line, eh???? Goddamn that song is good.Okay, so I’ve complained a lot about a show that’s based on a hot chick flying around on a gun. So let’s talk about that for a moment. For some reason, people defend bad writing and fanservice with “she’s riding a gun, it was stupid to begin with!” Just because something’s a little silly doesn’t mean all its faults are suddenly cleared. Like, what? It doesn’t even look or seem that silly. Not only is it cool as shit, but it brilliantly combines both the setting of war and the concept of magic. If anything, wearing a big hat and flying around on a broom would’ve been inappropriate.But anyway, the battles themselves are actually pretty good. Izetta is OP as shit and just fucking destroys everything in her path. It’s a lot of fun seeing shit like that, and it’s not every day where you see tanks getting thrown around. But, of course, the stakes need to be raised at some point, so the enemy introduces… more magic. Aww… It’s kind of a bummer that they couldn’t stick with Magic vs. Military and had to make it Magic vs. Magic instead. Granted, the story’s timeline gives it very limited technology, but it would’ve been really cool to see the Germans--oh, sorry--the GERMANIANS (you know that\'s just Germany in Romanian, right? That\'s not a rename at all, those hacks!) develop some sort of weapon or even a clever strategy to level the playing field a bit, instead of just introducing more magic out of nowhere.That said, when Izetta has finally met her match, things don’t go downhill. They get crushed, flattened, stomped on, pushed off a cliff, and dropped into the fucking ocean. Shit gets real FAST and that made me appreciate the evil side a lot more.Nothing’s animated too well, though. Izetta flying around looks quite nice, and let me compliment the character designs one more time because they’re outstanding. But, as expected, the larger animations such as large objects getting tossed around or a collection of swords slicing around… they’re CG. The CG itself isn’t particularly good nor bad, but combined with normal 2D animation, it looks kinda weird and took me out of the experience a little. I don’t remember anything being terrible, though. The general style is very common despite the obscure studio--if you told me this was by A-1 Pissants or J.C. Staff, I wouldn\'t have questioned it.The soundtrack on the other hand… now there’s a hidden gem. The mystical, magical music in the back with a rock influence, particularly with Izetta’s fight scenes, holy shit it’s brilliant. It felt a little overdone, though. Exposition could be going on, and the composer’s still going apeshit with dark, jittery, and mysterious music as if the most amazing plot twist’s about to happen. Still, I’m gonna be downloading thi--I mean purchasing this soundtrack in a very legal manner when it releases to the public. And the credits themes were equally outstanding. ‘Cross the Line’ has one of the most hype-inducing introductions of the entire year, and its piercing metal sound kept me on my toes the whole way through. The epic piano ballad used as the ED is equally mesmerizing despite being basically the exact opposite sound.Would I recommend Izetta: The Last Witch? Given the interesting premise, I might. After all, an anime with historical context always draws in an audience. \'member Joker Game? Talk about awkward! Anyway, just be warned. You’re not getting a very intricately-written story. It has some good moments for sure, but more often than not you’ll want to rip your hair out. Come in mostly for the fights and the occasional charm. And don’t forget the boobies. Hooray for boobies.Story - 3/10Art - 6/10Sound - 9/10Character - 2/10Enjoyment - 4/10Izetta - Fine/10Overall - 4.25/10 (Score range: 3.5-5.0)Favorite episode - 1Favorite character - Izetta’s EttasRecommendation level - Medium', 'Liechtenstein is fighting Hitler with magic. That\'s all. But if you want a more detailed review...Story:It\'s World War 2 and the country of Eylstadt (which geographically would be Tirol) is about to be curbstomped by the Nazis. Good thing though that the princesses faithful doggy...I mean, good friend Izetta just woke up from her slumber and does her witch thing. Izetta uses its story within the real life happenings around that time, which is pretty nicely done. However, it doesn\'t do much with the military setting after the nazi witch shows up, which is a wasted opportunity. The ending was lackluster and I can\'t help...but think, that the creators were too scared to leave the safe route for this little fantasy story.6/10Art:This anime looks very good. From backgrounds to character designs, Izetta is a very eyepleasing show. When it comes to the fighting scenes, they were able to turn it up even more. It also lacks the usual ""oops, we ran outta money"" episodes in the middle. I can\'t find a flaw in the visuals at all.10/10Sound:The opening song is pretty cool and thrilling, the ending a good, relaxing song. The background music fits very nicely in the whole scenery as well. Voice acting was very good too, even though I found Izetta to sound a little too cutesy at times. Sora Amamiya gives me another reason to praise her and it was nice to hear Kana Hanazawa in a completely different kind of role than what she usually does.9/10Characters:Oh, Izetta, as cute as you are, you are a very, VERY one-dimensional girl. It\'s only natural for this anime to focus on the (homoerotic) relationship between Finé and Izetta, but all this little witch thinks about is her ""hime-sama"" and how she can be of any use to her. Finé herself isn\'t that bad, she can be a good politician every now and then, but once we get back to her worrying about Izetta, it all comes tumbling down. The other witch that turns up later has a motivation for her actions, but...I don\'t know, I just didn\'t feel it. In the end she did the same thing Izetta does, despite telling her how idiotic that is. The best characters were the agents of both sides, who did the logical things to do and acted pretty clever.5/10Enjoyment:Like most others, I enjoyed the first half more than the second, though I don\'t think it went completely to shit. While this anime started out interesting and creative, they started playing it safe halfway through, which was quite disappointing. The ending was a lame cop-out for a show that did a lot of things right, but then started heading the wrong way.6/10Overall:7.2/10 but think, that the creators were too scared to leave the safe route for this little fantasy story.6/10Art:This anime looks very good.

Everything I tell you…Izetta the Last Witch is something I was optimistic for considering it was an alternative take on the second world war which I’m sure many of us have studied at some point before viewing. The Germanian Empire is our like for like replacement for the Nazi Regime which was led by the infamous Adolf Hitler. To summarise, the Germanian Empire has gone on the offensive using arguably one of the best tactics in modern history. The ‘Blitzkrieg’ was designed to create disorganisation among the Allied forces which was...composed of countries such as Britannia and Thermidor. The fictional small country of Eylstadt (modern-day Austria) which houses our main two characters Archduchess Ortfine and the last witch in question being Izetta, is on the receiving end taking blows from all the powerful Germania.The show fails to deliver on providing interesting characters apart from the main duo of Ortfine and Izetta. Ortfine during the war is saddened by the news that her father has passed away due to an illness. This incident has caused her to take up reigns, whilst being designated as the successor at the coronation ceremony giving her the ultimate task of leading her country. Being the sole monarch for such a tiny nation has exacerbated the fact of her wanting to protect to what is deemed as being vulnerable. That is the defining trait for our young Archduchess who for the most part doesn’t exhibit any other qualities which is what sets apart memorable and forgettable characters. She would be in the latter bracket as there is no major characterisation from her as the series progresses.Izetta is our heroine for the Eylstadt soldiers, who have been demoralised from the current conflict knowing they had no chance of winning against the stronger army. Izetta being a witch allows her to use magic in the battlefield which is not the magic that I had envisioned at first. There are no spells being made that resemble any sort of sorcery. Izetta’s magic is just having the ability to levitate certain objects such as torpedoes and lances which are just some examples. The magic used does create mayhem among the enemy line as it’s used in an unpredictable fashion. What concerns me though is the instances where she is pegged back by the enemies’ retaliation which is evident in numerous occasions. Despite being called the key to winning the war, she hasn’t shown enough for me to acknowledge her as being exactly that.As a witch, she does have her limitations, which is revealed through the information about the ley lines that are spread out through all of Europe. These hotspots as I like to call them are the areas where she can use her magic effectively without deteriorating greatly in magic usage. The best tactic to defeat Izetta was confronting her at a weak magic location but no there is more to that apparently. Izetta like any other superhuman entity will usually have some form of weakness aka their kryptonite equivalent. Funnily enough it does share a similar appearance to that of the kryptonite.I’ve been mentioning her magic but what defines Izetta’s character? She can basically be summed as being a sweet-natured girl of a placid disposition. Her objective in the current war is to protect the Archduchess and the country that she governs. It is known beforehand that Izetta has been given a verbal warning by her late grandmother not to use her magic powers excessively to the point it would get out of hand. She inevitably breaks this promise and proceeds to display her abilities in the chaotic battlefield. Her existence is predicated on the fact she will do all it takes to protect Eylstadt even if it means her dying. She’s come close to kicking the bucket but the God of Death hasn’t exerted his influence that much.The show is suffering from other consistencies preventing me from enjoying it and it’s a shame as it looked promising in the beginning. A significant portion of screen time was given to an average infantry soldier named Jonas, who had survived his fair share of blows at times while it being questionable. The poor man dies because of an information leakage which resulted in his death… what was the point in showing his character for him to be dismissed like that?Another occasion where the plot felt loose was during the banquet held in one of the Allied nations. The fact that Berckmann managed to appear out of thin air to confront the Archduchess should be raising alarm bells. What I find baffling is how he managed to get past all the security considering it is being hosted for all sorts of delegates during wartime. This just adds to the plot convenience needed to advance the storyline.There was also the instance where Berckmann’s assistant managed to sneak into the countryside of Eylstadt for his espionage mission. The man was picked up by the retainers of the Archduchess who never questioned the validity of him abstaining from conscription. A spy has just managed to get a ride with Bianca and co who are viewed as being competent and act as being professional. This group managed to harbour an enemy for the whole time without suspecting him once, just convenient if I must say. The writing is abysmal through proper retrospection.There are countless more but I shared the obvious ones that were glaring to me. Another pet peeve of mine is the fact that the Germanian Empire has somehow managed to invent cloning of humans, which may not sound too outlandish at first. The idea of cloning existing in an alternate timeline that can enable for magic isn’t too far-fetched but if you think about it, DNA mapping was never introduced until the 1950s which is after WWII in this case. My case is closed.The animation by studio Ajia-do is probably one of the factors that enticed people into watching as well as the setting involved. The character designs are designed for the moe aesthetics, which is evident in Izetta who just seems cute all around. The designs are reminiscent to what was used in Sword Art Online, this show has an A-1 Pictures feel to it but there is no relation whatsoever. The animation is crisp and fluid when it needs to be in the action sequences but is generally consistent with no substantial drop in quality.The sound for the most part is befitting for a show set in this period. The array of tracks which are mostly heard in the battlefields usually consist of orchestral compositions. The variations of vocal sequences add to the immersion during intense scenes but felt lacklustre with nothing being too exceptional or noteworthy. The opening song used feels more like a J-pop song and does not really match with the themes to be honest. The ending song takes more of a dramatic feel to it and is genuinely feels better to listen to.VERDICT-Positives –Decent AnimationNegatives –Terrible directing along with a poor script. The plot convenience is unbearable at times.Bland side characters and no variety.The fan service is heavy with this one and feels inappropriate at times.

I didn’t mention the moe maid lol', 'If potential is something that you’re seeking for, Shuumatsu no Izetta (Izetta: The Last Witch) will breathe life into that word. At first glance, anyway. Think about it though. It’s a series that combines elements of military warfare, witchcraft, political conflicts, and other magical shenanigans into a single package. And as an original series, the show isn’t held back by a dedicated fan base or those who lusts for “faithful adaptation”. However, Shuumatsu no Izetta isn’t exactly perfect or even close as the word potential is dragged down each step of the way.The risk of making a historical fiction war drama story can be viewed...from many angles. While it doesn’t always have to rely on historical accuracy, it should still make sense. In essence, the show attempts its best job at that by adapting the setting into World War II style war story. That’s right. It’s when the Allies fought against the Axis Powers that stretched from Europe all the way to the Pacific theater. However, this series doesn’t fly across the globe even though it has a cute little witch. In fact, it focuses primarily on this tiny Alpine country of Eylstadt as imperialist forces of Germania decides to invade them.Mark my words, the show gets straight to the point pretty fast. The first few episodes easily establishes the fact that there’s a war conflict going on. Ortfiné ""Finé"" Fredericka von Eylstadt (the princess) is pursued by Germanian forces and even gets captured aboard a train. A mysterious witch named Izetta shows up from a capsule and she recuses Fine. Turns out, they actually knew each other before during childhood. While all this is happening, it’s hard to forget about how Izetta saves her. Literally, she flies on a giant gun and is able to use magical powers to influence objects. So basically, she is a witch although where her powers came from is a mysterious origin. What we do know is that Izetta is among the last of her kind and she enters an alliance with Fine to protect their country. So for standards, the series leaves me a good impression as the storytelling can expand quite a bit with the war drama and mystery. A lot of questions will pop into viewers’ minds like “who really is Izetta?” “Why does Germania want to invade Eylstadt”? or “Who will win the war?”I’ll be honest here though. Perhaps my expectations for the series were a bit too high from the start but the series seems to dwindle down each and every episode. The first few episodes does a fairly well job at launching the series with its premise. However, the pacing drags back the show as transitions between certain episodes just feels stale. Certain episodes such as ones that info dumps about witch magic or Izetta’s daily life style can easily be condensed to further the storytelling. Instead, they are stretched out with slice of life content with little impact. The series also seems to have a fetish for Izetta’s breasts as the girls often makes fun of them, especially Fine and the maids. On the other hand, it is evident that the series remains faithful to the premise. The war is still the main focus and we see how the roles of characters are played out. Izetta is a prominent figure as a witch so her allies uses her in ways to not just directly engage their enemies but also with psychological warfare. In other words, they want to make the best of what she has to offer with her powers, carrying military squadrons to certain positions, and boosting morale. While it’s not realistic, it does make her character intriguing to watch as we can see what a witch can really do. While I did mention how ludicrous the comedy can get sometimes, this show does not joke with death as certain characters really do die. As such, do expect the violence and war drama to take hold to show how tragic warfare can be.Even though she’s the titular character, the series isn’t just about Izetta. Fine, the princess of Eylstadt, serves as a good mentor and leader for her country. She plays the role of a strategist, idealist, and also a friend for her people. The most important relationship she has is with Izetta as the latter saved her during childhood. However, I am not overly impressed by the character relationships in the series. Beyond Izetta and Fine, there’s hardly any others that are memorable. For instance, there’s Bianca, Princess Fine’s personal bodyguard who only gets a memorable role in the latter half of the series when she kills a Germania spy. There’s hardly any development between that spy and her so most of their storytelling is easily forgettable. The main antagonist of the series is Berkman, a Major of a Germanian Special Unit. And oh boy, he is about as stereotypical as you can get out of a villain. Egoistic, manipulative, and cunning are just a few words to describe this man. The fact that he also has a secret weapon to counter against Izetta shows him as a sinister bastard.One thing that does surprise me though is the quality of the visual production. Ajia-Do is practically an unknown studio that most are unfamiliar with. Their most recognizable work might as well be this one so it’s interesting to see how they took on this project. On the surface level, the series is beautiful with crisp animation. The landscapes and country-style feel gives a good impression of its setting. Furthermore, character designs is noticeable as it fleshes out Izetta being distinctive with her white dress and scarlet hair. Fine is noticeable for her beauty and classic blonde hair, fitting for a princess of her country. On most parts, the action has solid choreography without much jerky movements. Camera angles often capture the most intense parts of war that makes the show thrilling. Do note that there’s a bit of fan service that seems to have more fun with itself than it should.When it comes to soundtrack, Shuumatsu no Izetta, Nagasaki Yukio seemed like a fitting choice for sound director. His most recent work from GATE shows his talent and brings it into this series. The fast pacing of the action combined with the elements of military warfare all seems to work with the instrumental music. The feel of the European style OST also brings credibility for the series’ setting. Finally, character voice acting is well performed for characters such as Fine with haughty personality, Bianca’s toughness, or Berkman’s arrogance.How do I really sum this up? A massive disappointment or just a show to watch for the pure entertainment? To be fair, this show is probably not suitable for everyone. Fanatics of historical elements and war drama enthusiasts will probably find this series more entertaining than others. However, if you’re seeking for a well-rounded story, then this show will feel like one that dropped the ball. Not literally but just the type that makes you hope there’s so much more. Too bad really. from many angles. While it doesn’t always have to rely on historical accuracy, it should still make sense.

Too bad really.', '""Izetta - the last witch"" - is good anime in alternative history genre. Events of anime happen in alternative Europe of ~1939, where Germania tries to conquer the world, and as ""real"" (from other fiction) nazi they study occultism and magic. And there is what to study - because in this world magic is real. And easy prey for Germania as little alpine country Principality of Elystadt suddenly get support from Izetta - the last witch of this world. Magic vs technic, science and cunning, great setup for nice anime.And there is probably the main problem, anime at the beginning show so great potential, which...is really poorly realized, so many people even drop this anime in the second half of season. But it is not bad at all, just do not expect much, and you will not be disappointed.==Story== (7/10)Story is decent, it was interesting to follow warfare and politics at that world, despite the fact that politics are shown really childish and primitive. Cool guys from secret police of both countries were shown much better and darker. History of witchcraft was well presented, and some little stories too.Also relations between main characters Fine and Izetta - is great and cause you to imagine what happens next.But really inappropriate fan-service and some misunderstanding in motivation at the end, where it can be better written, spoils the story.==Characters== 6.5/10One more problematic side of anime. No, mostly characters are good, someone even great, just looks at the agents of secret police Berckmann and Muller, some other supporting characters are great too, germanian pilot for instance. Ortfine despite hers childish and sometimes dumb speeches had some charisma and looks like the proper aristocratic girl.But Izetta - oh, she is just one dimensional. It is pure naivety and mindless loyalty, whatever is going on, Izetta reacts just the same way. If at the start of series you did not notice this, in the second half it so unbearable to ignore. Still relation between Fine and Izetta are nice, except for some predictable Izetta moves.Main villain is pretty generic and can be found at any average anime==Art and Sound== 10/10I love it! Alpine landscapes - just beatiful, tech and building - also drawn nicely, and there is no complaints about character. I love this style, whatever it is.Sound is even better, some german alpine motives create great atmosphere. Battles also had music accompaniment, which fit war well. OP - is nice, but nothing specific, ED - calm cool song.==Enjoyment== 9/10The main problems of this anime are Izetta and the fact that it could be better (maybe, maybe not), but this two facts does not spoil me anime. I got many positive emotions while watching. Decent story, great music, some great characters and emotional chemistry between main characters.P.S. It is good anime, but hype spoil so much in the eyes of viewers. is really poorly realized, so many people even drop this anime in the second half of season.

It is good anime, but hype spoil so much in the eyes of viewers.', 'The fact that Japan was on Germany\'s side during WWII along with how we dropped nukes on them during said war really makes things uncomfortable whenever that country decides to dip their hands into alternate WWII fiction. Especially since they can\'t demonize the actual Germans, so they have to call them names like Germanians or Britanians or Americans (oh wait) whenever they have to portray actual antagonists. Germanians who are pretty damn fluent in Japanese for a country that wants the world to be ruled by the master race, but what do I know about alternate history? Well I may not know much, but I...do know that if you want to show your child a good entry in that genre, Izetta: The Last Witch is better left in that bargain bin where you found it.The show is centered on a young princess named Fine and her attempts to stop the evil Germanians from taking over her country on the eve of this war that shares the same name as the world-spanning conflict of the 1940s, but otherwise has no relation to it whatsoever. Because in addition to all the usual changes that are made to the history in order to make a WWII story fresh after it\'s been exploited by the entertainment industry like ten thousand times, we now have magic in this world. And I\'m not talking about the cultish Hellboy/Conqueror of Shamballa/Maria the Virgin Witch religious magic, although it wouldn\'t surprise me if the writers of this show took inspiration from that. This one deals more with basic witchcraft, except witches use anti-tank rifles to fly around rather than brooms and can decimate entire armies in ways that an entire army of Jedi would cry foul at.Said witchcraft takes the form of a young red-haired girl named Izetta, a witch-in-hiding who was saved by Princess Fine in the past, and now that they\'ve both grown up, Izetta vows to use her magical powers to help Fine\'s kingdom win the war and launch a thousand yuri fanfictions in the process. However, the opposing Germanians are aware of the existence of witchcraft and vow to discover Izetta\'s weaknesses in order to tip the war back in their favor. From there, the show basically spreads itself out way too thin, trying to juggle multiple characters, viewpoints, and genres all at once. In theory, this means something for everyone. In practice, this means absolutely no one is satisfied.See, I know Izetta got a lot of attention from anime fans upon initial watch because it dumped a lot of elements that people were intrigued by to the point that they were interested in what it might become over what it actually is. Every time I read an initial positive impression for this show, they never praised anything resembling actual story direction, always concentrating on individual scenes or characters who seem likable and all that stuff that sends out warning lights that the show is going to turn to shit within a few episodes like 99% of all anime out there. Although to be fair, I didn\'t expect the show to be as tonally inconsistent as it ended up being, dedicating entire episodes to the breast sizes of the females (because that\'s totally appropriate to talk about during wartime, isn\'t it?), only to shift to a no-name male soldier who ends up getting an early perish because he knew too much.Since this is a war story, that means we have to sit through the usual boring ""being a soldier is bad"" storytelling with all the pointless deaths, men turning into monsters, and blablabla that I really hate about war fiction. But you know what\'s worse than a war story that throws out its elementary school-level cliches like we haven\'t heard them before? A war story that throws out its elementary school-level cliches, only to shortchange it with elementary anime cliches. I mean can someone explain to me why all the high-ranking soldiers that hang around Fine happen to be cute girls with big racks? Why exactly do I have to watch them trying to give Izetta a shower, and why exactly should I care about them getting their own episode when they have about as much impact on the plot as a malfunctioning cell phone? Didn\'t exactly help that the episode itself was just plain bad, focusing on them taking care of a male soldier who happened to be on the opposite side, and anyone who didn\'t see that ending coming has obviously never watched a war story in their life, and you should have picked a better one to start with.The characters themselves are pretty generic. Fine is a headstrong princess who wants to serve her country and protect the people, and that philosophy isn\'t challenged at all during the show\'s runtime, making it hard to sympathize with any of the arbitrary struggles that she faces along the way. Izetta is pretty much defined by her devotion to her. Pretty much every other good guy is characterized the same way only they can\'t lift tanks. And the bad guys are pretty much characterized by either ""kill the witch"" or ""die soldier die"". Really, Fine is pretty much the only person who\'s in a position to spearhead the story, but because she doesn\'t take much action nor does she have her actions challenged, she\'s about as qualified to guide the viewer as she is to run the country in general. Just about the only thing she really cares about is risking her friends\' lives, specifically Izetta\'s, on the battlefield - and the majority of what qualifies as her arc involves her making sure that her witch friend is safe whilst dealing with a war that outsiders shouldn\'t be involved in. That sort of relationship couldn\'t carry a two-hour movie by itself. Why on earth would it be able to carry twelve episodes?As for the magic angle, I think Izetta was actively trying its best to make it as bland as possible, because it hits all the usual cliches you\'d expect from an anime gimmick thrown into a generally serious situation. It has limits so the good guys don\'t get completely overpowered. It\'s used for generic slapstick that no one over the age of eight would find funny. After initial usage, it\'s never used with the same amount of efficiency again. Oh, and did I mention that the enemy side happens to have someone with similar powers? To which I respond with ""how does that make any horse-fucking sense?"". If they had someone on their side who could use magic, why would either the writers or the characters need to devote so much time to discovering Izetta\'s weaknesses in the first place when they can just send someone on her level who would definitely know how magic actually works in this world beforehand? And where the fuck did this girl come from anyways? I can\'t recall her ever being foreshadowed prior to her initial appearance in the last third of this show, so the only possible answer I can come up with was that even with the Germanians discovering her weakness, the writers didn\'t have an idea how to make a suitable final conflict so they threw Sophie in at the last minute.One other way the magic in Izetta is misused is that the show ends up putting so much attention on the gimmick that it loses focus on the actual story that was initially hinted at at the very beginning. The final conflict is pretty much one big magic duel that has nothing to do with WWII and introduces a bunch of out-of-nowhere plot elements leading to a paint-by-numbers ending that makes Luke Cage\'s finale look like Fullmetal Alchemist\'s (either anime adaptation). I should point out that Izetta: The Last Witch is made by a newbie studio who I know nothing about, but apparently doesn\'t have any recognizable veterans amongst their ranks, because the animation in this show is absolute ass. Everything looks way too flat, the magic spells have no personality, and just about anybody could have directed this show. As such, don\'t expect that final conflict I mentioned to be a suitable payoff for all the mismanaged elements that came before. And if you\'re watching this show for the yuri, put away those virgin boners, because you\'re not gonna get much of a resolution out of that either.There really isn\'t a single thing I can recommend Izetta: The Last Witch for. It only has one not-so-unique idea that\'s only on-screen like half the time at best, and it failed to make anything interesting happen with it when it bothered to show up. The show is cheap junk food: unfulfilling and you feel kind of weird after experiencing it, but you can\'t really describe why. My recommendation? Toss it into the same hellfire we threw Corpse Princess and that shitty Romeo x Juliet show and forget everything about its existence, just like we did with those shows. do know that if you want to show your child a good entry in that genre, Izetta: The Last Witch is better left in that bargain bin where you found it.The show is centered on a young princess named Fine and her attempts to stop the evil Germanians from taking over her country on the eve of this war that shares the same name as the world-spanning conflict of the 1940s, but otherwise has no relation to it whatsoever.

A show like this gets put out of its misery like a dog on the streets.*SPOILERS FOR SHUUMATSU NO IZETTA*I\'m sure we all remember what happened with the spring 2016 anime known as Kabaneri. To recap, the series started off strongly and interestingly before divulging into a convoluted mess that made everyone remember this series as ""the biggest disappointment of the year"" rather than ""the biggest blockbuster anime of the year"". Something similar happened here. This when this series started, it had a fairly decent reception and many people interested, thinking that...this could quite possibly be the dark horse of the season. Unfortunately, it lost all of its luster by the end, and now, it is up to us to bury this series and say our final goodbyes to this failed soldier. You may ask: ""how did this series flop on us all?"" Well, let\'s find out, shall we?To be fair to this series, the premise is one of the most fascinating of its season. A witch gets summoned to fight for one of the many European countries (this one being Elystadt) oppressed by Germania\'s assault during World War II. Even the first episode managed to feel like it would turn out to be interesting, if not necessarily as grandiose as a war series tends to be. Unfortunately, some of the series\'s major problems come early, with one of the biggest being how the magic is explained.  There are these things called ""ley ines"" (which no one can see, ever, so how were they recorded?) which are the lines of magic energy that allow witches to use their magic. However, they aren\'t everywhere, so Izetta has to be careful not to wander into an area in which she cannot use magic.  This becomes a problem due to the fact that we can never truly know where they are and where they stop, meaning that the writers can, on a whim, make Izetta accidentally go off to a bad location without us knowing any better until she suddenly falls down and gets herself injured, which end us happening in episode 9, bit I\'ll get to that episode is the point in which the series jumped the shark, later.While episode 9 is the point of no return, the part that first comes of major concern is episode 4, where they fake Izetta\'s power via theatrics to fool the world into thinking that she is a very powerful witch while beating the Germanians in another battle. However, this raises the question of ""why didn\'t she just use her own magic when the world from this point on, will know of her magic anyway?\'. Not only that, but it leads into one of the tritest setups that I ever have to see: the whole ""this person I admire is secretly a fake"" cliche"".  It turns out that there was a spy all along, and Jonas, the guy who found out the secret about Izetta, is blackmailed by the spy that he\'ll kill his family. Then, he gets shot by him before the guy runs away, and then Jonas is shot and ""killed"" by Sieg. This should really affect his family given how much they talked about it. However, we never see his family once. After a few meh episodes, one ship explosion that took one torpedo when they explicitly said it required 4 to do the job, and one ball later, we finally get to episode 9.Turns out, in episode 6, there was a girl who kissed Izetta in order to make her bleed that way said girl could drink her blood (don\'t ask me how this makes sense, or how they manage to pull it off realistically; this show never bothered to make it work). Turns out, she was a copy of the real White Witch: a girl described in legend to be a noble and tragic witch. I won\'t even get into how many of the false versions of the story there are here, as only the one showed in the middle of the finale is right, which means the series has lied to us extremely often. Let\'s just say this: now, she is evil. Also, they are mass-producing clones of her via magic that they shouldn\'t understand thanks to how this works. After struggling against her, Izetta loses power, and crashes into the land below. How? They went out of their way to state that she is still on land where the ley lines are located. Apparently, they didn\'t care to explain this, as there is no indication that her powers were manually shut down. Then, she starts bleeding despite nothing indicating that she was badly wounded anywhere. You could assume the crash did this to her, but all it was, was her tumbling a lot with nothing harmful going into her. She is then captured. Episode 10 even explicitly states so. So why is she still with the good guys? It turns out, that in that same episode, they retrieved her. Since that\'s the case, why did the Germanians bother saying that they got her. Also, why did the SS try to kill Berckmann? They had no reason to fire him, let alone execute him.Somehow things only get worse in the final set of episodes. In episode 11, they start moving to the area with Izetta seemingly getting ready after another yuri bait moment, but in the very first 5 second of episode 12, she is already at the fight with Sophie already hovering opposite of her. After about 8 minutes, we get this. Remember when Sieg shot Jonas in the head? Turns out, he\'s completely fine, with the Germanians, and then he shoots Sieg out of panic. This raises a multitude of questions that damn this series even more into absolute failure. Whatever. The day is saved, Sophie is stopped, the Germanian operation has been foiled, and peace roams the land. Also, despite the last few episodes making it out to be a heroic sacrifice for Izetta to fight, she is perfectly fine, and in a wheelchair. This is just like when Ikoma copped out in the finale as Kabaneri by also living after he was supposed to die. All\'s well that ends well, I guess. Either way, the script is dead, and I still don\'t think I\'ve covered all that makes this plot so terrible. Why did Izetta\'s grandmother call Sophie a traitor? They explicitly showed that when Ozetta asked if her criticism of Sophie (interfering with humans) was the reason, she said no. How did Izetta get captured prior to episode 1? Issues like this further break this sorry excuse for a narrative.The cast isn\'t great either. Izetta, while adorkable, and determined, isn\'t a compelling protagonist despite still being the best character here with a believable backstory. She was saved by Ortfine when they were young, as the locals were about to kill her. Speaking of Ortfine, she\'s your typical strong-willed leader pushed to her limits. Nothing much to her. Most of the cast is also pretty forgettable and unexplored, like Bianka, Sieg, Hans, Berckmann, etc. Also, Berckmann\'s son, Ricelt fits this bill too, getting a mostly useless episode 7 to himself before he and the spy both die.It\'s the villains that are pathetic. Otto is just a lame tyrant interested in witches, and there\'s nothing else to him. I struggle to find any reason for Elliot to be here given how useless he is. Then we have Sophie. She is a generic antagonist introduced just to have an eventual final boss, in the same vein as Biba from Kabaneri (as if there weren\'t enough comparisons between the two shows already). After being betrayed, she wants revenge. In episode 6, she is presented as this mysterious figure. After that, she\'s just a vengeful maniac who cackles while doing evil things for the sake of it.This series looks pretty good, despite the fact that the studio Aija-Do isn\'t well known. If this show stayed consistent, this might\'ve put them on the map. Sure, the citizens of Elystadt have this generic light novel look to them, and many characters have those gaps in their mouths (meant to represent lips) that are way too big sometimes, but Izetta, and the styles for the Germanian characters look a lot more interesting and varied. The action looks nice too. Special mention goes to that section in the OP where Izetta is moving from bullet fire. They even went out of their way to not only get the looks of the weapons and cars right, but they even animated certain moments in the black and white box look reminiscent of that of the actual days of WWII. I wouldn\'t say the show looks great or amazing, but it\'s clear that there was some significant effort put into this show.The music was composed by a newcomer named Michiru, who does a fine job. Many of the vocals are in German, and in certain scenes, they fit perfectly, even if none of the songs are ones I would go out of my way to listen to. Still, its experimental and it works rather well. The OP, ""cross the line"" by AKINO with bless4, is a satisfying and energetic OP with some tight build-up and several electrifying moments. As good as it is, I\'m even more impressed by the ED, ""Hikari Aru Basho e"" by May\'n, who, if you don\'t know, was the voice for the singing done by Sheryl Nome in Macross F. Here, she delivers a powerful, emotional, and slow-moving song that makes me wish this show was as gripping as its ED. Everything works rather well, except for the dub, which is comprised primarily of newcomers who do a mediocre job. That\'s the simuldub business for you, but hey, anything to give this show some kind of boost, right? It honest to God needs it.I\'m sure we, the people of this community, will cynically remember this in the same way we did with Kabaneri only 6 months before. Only this time, even less of us cared in the first place. In the fires of the show\'s train wreck path, we can only grieve at what could\'ve been. An interesting first half that led into a stupid yet equally by the numbers second half that only served to make the first half\'s flaws more apparent. It mostly felt like a love letter to World War II, but that\'s all this show was good for. Even then, they stopped doing interesting things with that by the second half, so there\'s nothing I can latch onto in order to recommend this show to anyone. this could quite possibly be the dark horse of the season. Unfortunately, it lost all of its luster by the end, and now, it is up to us to bury this series and say our final goodbyes to this failed soldier.

So why is she still with the good guys? It turns out, that in that same episode, they retrieved her. Since that\'s the case, why did the Germanians bother saying that they got her. Also, why did the SS try to kill Berckmann? They had no reason to fire him, let alone execute him.Somehow things only get worse in the final set of episodes. In episode 11, they start moving to the area with Izetta seemingly getting ready after another yuri bait moment, but in the very first 5 second of episode 12, she is already at the fight with Sophie already hovering opposite of her. After about 8 minutes, we get this. Remember when Sieg shot Jonas in the head? Turns out, he\'s completely fine, with the Germanians, and then he shoots Sieg out of panic. This raises a multitude of questions that damn this series even more into absolute failure. Whatever. The day is saved, Sophie is stopped, the Germanian operation has been foiled, and peace roams the land. Also, despite the last few episodes making it out to be a heroic sacrifice for Izetta to fight, she is perfectly fine, and in a wheelchair. This is just like when Ikoma copped out in the finale as Kabaneri by also living after he was supposed to die. All\'s well that ends well, I guess. Either way, the script is dead, and I still don\'t think I\'ve covered all that makes this plot so terrible. Why did Izetta\'s grandmother call Sophie a traitor? They explicitly showed that when Ozetta asked if her criticism of Sophie (interfering with humans) was the reason, she said no. How did Izetta get captured prior to episode 1? Issues like this further break this sorry excuse for a narrative.The cast isn\'t great either. Izetta, while adorkable, and determined, isn\'t a compelling protagonist despite still being the best character here with a believable backstory. She was saved by Ortfine when they were young, as the locals were about to kill her. Speaking of Ortfine, she\'s your typical strong-willed leader pushed to her limits. Nothing much to her. Most of the cast is also pretty forgettable and unexplored, like Bianka, Sieg, Hans, Berckmann, etc. Also, Berckmann\'s son, Ricelt fits this bill too, getting a mostly useless episode 7 to himself before he and the spy both die.It\'s the villains that are pathetic. Otto is just a lame tyrant interested in witches, and there\'s nothing else to him. I struggle to find any reason for Elliot to be here given how useless he is. Then we have Sophie. She is a generic antagonist introduced just to have an eventual final boss, in the same vein as Biba from Kabaneri (as if there weren\'t enough comparisons between the two shows already). After being betrayed, she wants revenge. In episode 6, she is presented as this mysterious figure. After that, she\'s just a vengeful maniac who cackles while doing evil things for the sake of it.This series looks pretty good, despite the fact that the studio Aija-Do isn\'t well known. If this show stayed consistent, this might\'ve put them on the map. Sure, the citizens of Elystadt have this generic light novel look to them, and many characters have those gaps in their mouths (meant to represent lips) that are way too big sometimes, but Izetta, and the styles for the Germanian characters look a lot more interesting and varied. The action looks nice too. Special mention goes to that section in the OP where Izetta is moving from bullet fire. They even went out of their way to not only get the looks of the weapons and cars right, but they even animated certain moments in the black and white box look reminiscent of that of the actual days of WWII. I wouldn\'t say the show looks great or amazing, but it\'s clear that there was some significant effort put into this show.The music was composed by a newcomer named Michiru, who does a fine job. Many of the vocals are in German, and in certain scenes, they fit perfectly, even if none of the songs are ones I would go out of my way to listen to. Still, its experimental and it works rather well. The OP, ""cross the line"" by AKINO with bless4, is a satisfying and energetic OP with some tight build-up and several electrifying moments. As good as it is, I\'m even more impressed by the ED, ""Hikari Aru Basho e"" by May\'n, who, if you don\'t know, was the voice for the singing done by Sheryl Nome in Macross F. Here, she delivers a powerful, emotional, and slow-moving song that makes me wish this show was as gripping as its ED. Everything works rather well, except for the dub, which is comprised primarily of newcomers who do a mediocre job. That\'s the simuldub business for you, but hey, anything to give this show some kind of boost, right? It honest to God needs it.I\'m sure we, the people of this community, will cynically remember this in the same way we did with Kabaneri only 6 months before. Only this time, even less of us cared in the first place. In the fires of the show\'s train wreck path, we can only grieve at what could\'ve been. An interesting first half that led into a stupid yet equally by the numbers second half that only served to make the first half\'s flaws more apparent. It mostly felt like a love letter to World War II, but that\'s all this show was good for. Even then, they stopped doing interesting things with that by the second half, so there\'s nothing I can latch onto in order to recommend this show to anyone.', ""Shuumatsu no Izetta is an anime from late last year. It was written by Yoshino Hiroyuki who did some work for Code Geass & Kuroshitsuji. He also wrote the anime adaptation for Dance in the Vampire Bund, which was pretty dreadful. The studio behind it was Ajia-Do, which I remember from Magic Tree House. So, with this staff the series could go either way. Let's find out how it does, shall we?Story:Our narrative is set in an alternative world at the beginning of World War II. Princess Finé of Elystadt is going to the allies to plead for help against the Germanian forces. She...and her guards are being chased by Germanian soldiers when she spots a strange capsule on the train. She tries to open it but the Germanians find her before she can. She and her guards manage to escape, but she's taken prisoner after reaching the Britannian minister. She's taken aboard a plane with the mysterious capsule when it opens, revealing a  young red-haired girl who  Finé knows very well, Izetta. Izetta uses her magic to rescue Finé and their struggle against Germania begins.There are some relatively minor story issues. First off, there are some contrivances. For example, there's a character who learns a secret because two higher ups in Elystadt's military are discussing it outside where anyone could overhear them. Surely, they are strategic masterminds. There's another case where a Germanian spy happens to make friends with a couple of supporting characters who he randomly encounters without knowing who they are and he makes friends with them in a very short time just to try and make a confrontation betwixt him and one of them more dramatic. It doesn't really work. The length is also a bit of an issue. There are some really good ideas that really could have used more time to be properly fleshed out. The secret of Elystadt's original White Witch, the death of Finé's father very early on, the political gambits that Finé takes to try and save her nation. Frankly, there are enough ideas here that the series could have been twenty six episodes without ever feeling like it was dragging and the pacing wouldn't have had to be so rushed.That being said, when you factor in the time constraints, the series is really well written. It has strong sources of tension that get explained as well as one could reasonably expect them to be in a twelve episode series. The series is good at touching on all the beats that it needs to, even when there are ones that could have benefited from greater extrapolation. I also appreciate that every plot point comes into play. There's a scene where a certain character dies for the sake of a state secret and it doesn't seem like it's going to be important but then it comes into play for two different plot points later. The way the series brings propaganda into play is superbly handled. It's certainly a series that keeps you engrossed with every episode ending in a way that makes you curious about what comes next.Characters:The characters are the biggest strength of the series. Most of the supporting characters are well enough fleshed out to have verisimilitude. Which adds gravity to the situations. Sophie is a compelling character, particularly when you learn the truth behind her hatred of Elystadt. The best part of the characters, however, is Izetta & Finé's relationship. It is expertly handled with a strong back story to illustrate how they got to the point they're at when we first see them in the series and with a good degree of development over the course of the series. They're both strongly fleshed out characters and having a very powerful dynamic only serves to highlight their best, and in a few cases worst, qualities thanks to the ways they interact with one another.Art:The artwork in this is largely excellent. The backgrounds are quite lovely and there's clearly a lot of work put into the various military gear, outfits and animation. The one complaint I have with the artwork is that some of the scenes cross the line into crass fan-service. Which can be distracting when they're trying to have a serious scene.Sound:The entire vocal cast does well. There aren't any weak links in that regard. The strongest performances come from Akaneya Himika & Hayami Saori. The two of them really manage to sell the chemistry between their characters. Amamiya Sora is also really good in this. We can thank Michiru for the music. Which is excellent.Ho-yay:There's a lot in this series. This is one of those anime that's technically not shoujo-ai, but might as well have been. There are a lot of scenes where the artwork and atmosphere give the impression that  Finé and Izetta are going to start passionately snogging and then the scene will have to shift before the rating goes all the way up to Rx.  Finé cross dresses at one point, seemingly just so she can dance with Izetta at a party. There are also some indications that Bianca would be interested in turning their relationship into a poly-amorous one and there's a former journalist turned tutor who seems interested in the pair of them as well. There's a maid, Lotte, who seems interested in Izetta. I wonder if these two meet a lot of other women who are interested by coincidence or if Elystadt's royal family just hires a lot of lesbians by design.Final Thoughts:Shuumatsu no Izetta certainly has its narrative flaws. It's got its contrivances, it can be somewhat crass with its fan-service and it really would have benefited from a longer run. That being said, there's a lot to like about it. The tension is strong. The characters are nicely fleshed out. The dynamic between our leads is amazing. The artwork largely looks legitimately lovely.  The acting and music are strong. As a whole, I found it highly endearing and rather enjoyable. If you're interested in seeing a WW II fiction that factors in magical powers and escapes being classified as shoujo-ai by a minor technicality, this one is for you. For myself, I give it a very respectable 8/10. Next week I've actually got a short request to look at, it's going to be Sakamichi no Apollon. and her guards are being chased by Germanian soldiers when she spots a strange capsule on the train.

I could only wish.Izetta at first seemed like a love letter to my anime taste. Beautiful girls flying on guns, flipping tanks and piercing planes with giant swords. What\'s not to love?A lot apparently.*Quick side note: I watched this as it was airing, if that changes anything.*Story: 4This is the biggest downfall of Izetta. The first few episodes were absolutely fantastic for me. They set up the alternative World War II setting well, introduced the main cast,...that looked unique at first glance, showcased some kick ass action and more. However, as soon as the battle started to calm down, I felt as if the writers didn\'t know what to do. The SOL moments were okay, but the ""battle of wits"" between people at the side of Elystadt and Germania was straight up butchered. Each action they took was a bit too predictable. I refuse to believe that Germanians had only one smart person on their side, that could figure Izetta out. I refuse to believe that a secret place hidden under a castle had a secret passage the whole time, that just randomly opened when someone needed to escape. Finally, I absolutely refuse to believe that Elystadt didn\'t expect to be crushed just because of some wins, even if important from a strategic point of view. This is not how war works. No matter if magic exists or not, there are always a ton of people that have to work on every detail, but here we have only a handful. Another big problem I had, was the introduction of the main threat way too late into the show. I am not a fan of that decision to say the very least. The story does end nicely, but there are still some stories that were not completed. The last few scenes showed that there could be a special episode or something like that coming up.With all the bad stuff out of the way, there were some cool ideas in there. There was a lot of creative directing in each action scene, groups of guerrillas attacking from the forest looked believable (for the short time that we saw them), the media propaganda was used nicely, the setting was explored well and the relations between witches and normal humans were really interesting. Unfortunately that can\'t fix all the problems I had with the rest of the shows story.Long story short, the writing flopped way too fast, way too hard.Art and Animation: 9The most surprising thing about the show is how good it looks. The Ajia-Do studio wasn\'t well known before making Izetta, so that makes their achievement even more outstanding. This series looks gorgeous. Every character design, while a bit more moe than I expected, fits. Some scenes, especially the more SOL oriented ones, get a bit less care, and you can spot some mistakes, but dear Lord, the action scenes look fantastic. Every scene from each bigger battle is handled in a great way. I don\'t have many complaints here.Sound: 7It\'s fine. Nothing spectacular, but it fits the specified time period and can get you hyped or put you in a pensive mood when it needs to. Bonus point for the opening, both visually and on the music side. I liked it, but music is of course subjective. The seiyuus do their job well too. Berckmann sounds like an asshole, Izetta sounds like a lost girl, and Fine sounds like a strong princess. Good stuff.Characters: 5.5At a first glance the cast looks unique enough. A witch in a World War II setting? Sounds good. An all female  princess guard? Seems interesting. A smart Germanian to rival the princess? Looks promising.Unfortunately most of them flopped like a bunch of old pancakes.Izetta was ineresting to the very end, I thought she would get more development and new motivations other then ""I love you Fine-samaaaa"", but she wasn\'t a bad MC. Fine on the other hand was. She seemed to be a strong, independant princess, but she ended up only playing a minor role. Everything was done for her, she was mostly there just to represent her country. However, I have to mention that she risked her life on numerous occasions for the good of her country, so there\'s that. When it comes to the sides, they just... didn\'t work. They try to contrast characters or have a random romance pushed in, none of that made much sense and their development was rushed. Their actions didn\'t have important repercussions on themselves or anything else. I have to admit though, while they were all simple characters that were a bit dumb at times, I liked them. I couldn\'t say that I didn\'t. They had strong love for their duty and their homeland. They didn\'t do their job well enough though, thus I consider this score appropriate.Enjoyment: 8For the first few weeks, this was my favourite anime of the season. The action scenes were full of hype and the story looked promising. In the end I did like the characters, I was satisfied with the ending and I am glad that I watched it. I will remeber it fondly, because there were a lot of ideas that I personally liked. I haven\'t watched any World War II anime before, so I can say that I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it, but also incredibly sad by how much it disappointed me later. With all that, I can say that at the very least I cared about the characters and the story. I wanted to see how it will end and  ultimately, the positive feelings outweighed the negative ones, mostly thanks to the awesome action.Overall: 6A low 6 at that. There were some moments where I wanted to pull my hair out because of how stupid I found some episodes, but there were also moments where I grinned like an idiot after all the awesome fights. This show wasn\'t good for me, but I still embraced what it gave me. Thank you Shuumatsu no Izetta for teaching me not to get hyped for a show after a few good episodes and showing me some of the most awesome scenes of the year. It was a bumpy ride, but I think I can reccomend this to someone who will think that this looks interesting, but be cautious. It may disappoint you much more then it disappointed me.Of course this is purely my opinion, and I reccomend you to develop your own. that looked unique at first glance, showcased some kick ass action and more.

I like it a lot.The problem with so many of the harsher critiques is that they don't seem to know how to just enjoy things. If I wanted to I could critique this series down to the point that it becomes not worth watching even if nothing else was on. I could do that to any show.The main character Izetta is a witch in this WWII era. This is fine because it is NOT some moe magical girl transformation cliche.Perhaps I'm just a hopeless...simpleton, but what I see when I watch this is a cool World War era time period with all the trimmings; tanks, planes and soldiers. You have a cliche plot line of one kingdom/territory invading another. The only difference here is this witch who is fighting for the losing side. She has magic powers that even come with an explanation as to how they work and what her limitations are.I mean come on, she flies on a giant rifle. How cool is that?And the best part of all is that it's not clogged up with pointless ecchi filler like Infinite Stratos is. simpleton, but what I see when I watch this is a cool World War era time period with all the trimmings; tanks, planes and soldiers.

How cool is that?And the best part of all is that it's not clogged up with pointless ecchi filler like Infinite Stratos is."", 'I\'ve always personally been a fan of good historical fantasies, so when I first caught wind of Izetta: The Last Witch, the premise and setting intrigued me enough to give it a shot. However, although I was initially quite impressed with this anime, that quickly began to change as the series went on...So, for a quick overview of the story (while intentionally leaving the details ambiguous): You have Germania, a large country with vast military might, baring it\'s fangs at the small country of Elystadt. Just when things are seeming to take a turn for the worst in the conflict between these two countries, a...witch (the last surviving one, no less) turns the tide of battle. The witch in question, Izetta, seems unmatched and wins a number of battles against the Germanians. Of course, the happy times must always come to an end, as Izetta meets her rival, the only one capable of matching her strength.And now for my criticisms:Story:The story is frankly unimaginative and predictable. The events in the story unfolded much as you\'d expect from any run of the mill fantasy story. Even the plot twists are fairly anti-climactic and expected, in that, they serve to further the story in the most predictable and convenient way possible. This makes them obvious to foresee, especially since they\'re spun using pre-existing story elements (they\'re not just grabbed out of thin air, nor do they introduce anything new to the story besides some tidbits of exposition).With that issue aside, what I disliked most about the story is that, the actual world and the vast majority of it\'s characters are not even expanded upon at all, apart from Izetta and Ortfine. There are plenty of side characters that, at first glance, seem to have a unique personality and their own agendas that you\'d believe would contribute to the story in some major way. However, this is not the case. Many of the characters aren\'t utilized to their fullest, or really, not even any at all. For lack of a better word, they are wasted potential. World building in this anime is also pretty terrible. Essentially, since all the countries are placeholders for modern day countries (France, Germany, the United States), and since the major conflict in this series is basically just a fictional World War I,  I suppose that\'s supposed to suffice for any sort of explanation about the current state of world events in the time this series takes place, or of the different cultures and societies that dwell within these countries. The world is just very bland and colorless. Why go through the trouble of symbolizing real world countries when your not even going to bother giving these countries any kind of identity to distinguish themselves from one another?Characters:I\'m just going to come right out and say it. The only real characters that receive any development are Ortfine and Izetta. Apart from that, pretty much all of the other characters are stagnant and have very little value or impact on the story. Even then, Ortine and Izetta are far from being complex characters, they\'re very two dimensional. Izetta is your average shy, subservient, and caring girl that lives only to make her best friend (Ortfine) happy, that might as well be her sole reason for existing. Ortfine is essentially just an embodiment of her own ideals, namely, justice and responsibility. While they do change somewhat throughout they story, the change is fairly subtle.There are also multiple sub-plots that were brought up in the story but were never fully expanded upon or explained. For example, in one episode, the writers created what I can only describe as an ""implied romance"" between two characters that had just met. In this episode, these two characters had met for the first time, which is clearly not enough time to develop a romantic relationship, nor enough time to inspire any kind of feelings for said relationship in the audience. However, by the end of the episode, it\'s implied that they suddenly have deep feelings for one another. I won\'t spoil the rest, but their relationship ended on the same episode that it began. Pretty poor writing, perhaps?There\'s also instances where it\'s implied that two characters know each other and may even share a history, yet it\'s never even touched upon or explained. Once again, I\'m not sure why the writers even bothered to make the effort if they were just going to introduce the idea and leave it hanging.Sound, Art, and Animation:Despite my problems with just about every other aspect of Izetta, I actually found the OST to be fairly enjoyable. It uses a few different orchestral scores which I found pleasurable, as they matched the setting and tone of the story quite well. The opening and endings songs were also done quite well. While I doubt I\'d listen to them again, they were good enough for me not to skip through.The animation was...well, it was good for the first handful of episodes, but slowly started to taper off in quality near the end (which can be seen in the abundance of off model shots during the last few episodes). The only parts in the anime where it\'s animation was better than average was during the few battle scenes, which actually made the fight scenes/battles fairly enjoyable to watch.In general, I found the art to be pretty good, for the most part. Some of the landscapes and nature scenes in this anime are quite gorgeous, although not extremely detailed. The character designs are good, although it would\'ve been nice to see some more variation, especially in regard to the different country\'s representatives (since they all look the same it\'s difficult to tell their ethnicity).My personal enjoyment of this series only began to wane more and more with every episode that was released. Eventually to the point where watching the last few remaining episodes felt more like a drag than anything else. The only reason I continued to watch this was because, when I seriously questioned whether or not to drop the series, I was only a few episodes away from finishing it and couldn\'t find a reason to drop it after getting that far in.Although I initially had high hopes for this anime, It\'s poor excuse for a story and lackluster characters completely ruined it for me. Perhaps if I could ""turn my brain off"", I could enjoy it for the mediocre historical fantasy that it is, but alas, I have yet to find that elusive off switch that I\'ve heard so much about. Until then, I give Izetta: The Last Witch a score of 5/10. While I\'ve personally seen much worse, I\'d recommend that you skip this one, as botched series like this one are a dime a dozen. witch (the last surviving one, no less) turns the tide of battle. The witch in question, Izetta, seems unmatched and wins a number of battles against the Germanians. Of course, the happy times must always come to an end, as Izetta meets her rival, the only one capable of matching her strength.And now for my criticisms:Story:The story is frankly unimaginative and predictable. The events in the story unfolded much as you\'d expect from any run of the mill fantasy story. Even the plot twists are fairly anti-climactic and expected, in that, they serve to further the story in the most predictable and convenient way possible. This makes them obvious to foresee, especially since they\'re spun using pre-existing story elements (they\'re not just grabbed out of thin air, nor do they introduce anything new to the story besides some tidbits of exposition).With that issue aside, what I disliked most about the story is that, the actual world and the vast majority of it\'s characters are not even expanded upon at all, apart from Izetta and Ortfine. There are plenty of side characters that, at first glance, seem to have a unique personality and their own agendas that you\'d believe would contribute to the story in some major way. However, this is not the case. Many of the characters aren\'t utilized to their fullest, or really, not even any at all. For lack of a better word, they are wasted potential. World building in this anime is also pretty terrible. Essentially, since all the countries are placeholders for modern day countries (France, Germany, the United States), and since the major conflict in this series is basically just a fictional World War I,  I suppose that\'s supposed to suffice for any sort of explanation about the current state of world events in the time this series takes place, or of the different cultures and societies that dwell within these countries. The world is just very bland and colorless. Why go through the trouble of symbolizing real world countries when your not even going to bother giving these countries any kind of identity to distinguish themselves from one another?Characters:I\'m just going to come right out and say it. The only real characters that receive any development are Ortfine and Izetta. Apart from that, pretty much all of the other characters are stagnant and have very little value or impact on the story. Even then, Ortine and Izetta are far from being complex characters, they\'re very two dimensional. Izetta is your average shy, subservient, and caring girl that lives only to make her best friend (Ortfine) happy, that might as well be her sole reason for existing. Ortfine is essentially just an embodiment of her own ideals, namely, justice and responsibility. While they do change somewhat throughout they story, the change is fairly subtle.There are also multiple sub-plots that were brought up in the story but were never fully expanded upon or explained. For example, in one episode, the writers created what I can only describe as an ""implied romance"" between two characters that had just met. In this episode, these two characters had met for the first time, which is clearly not enough time to develop a romantic relationship, nor enough time to inspire any kind of feelings for said relationship in the audience. However, by the end of the episode, it\'s implied that they suddenly have deep feelings for one another. I won\'t spoil the rest, but their relationship ended on the same episode that it began. Pretty poor writing, perhaps?There\'s also instances where it\'s implied that two characters know each other and may even share a history, yet it\'s never even touched upon or explained.

An original anime which focuses during the time of world war two interestingly enough, witches also exists in that era. If that doesn't speak your interest... Well I have no words.Story:8The story is probably one of the high points of this series, as it features a witch out of her time period, yet at the same time, goes to show that it's not entirely a bad thing. The story picked up quite well and moved along with a rather moderate and enjoyable pace, but ultimately felt a little rushed in the end.Art:9Not much to say about the art except,...HOLY SHIT! The art very very well in my eyes. Sure, there a bit obvious slumps here and there, but the fact that they had a different animator just for the tank mechanics goes to show how through they were.Sound:9The OP was decent, and the soundtrack itself was simply astounding. It emphasized the scenes and gave them a better to them.Overall: 7Overall this was a decent anime, definitely above average and something I would recommend to watch over again.

(What else would you do in 1939, especially if your country is called Germania?) But when they invade the small alpine nation of Liecht ‒ I mean Eylstadt ‒ the opposition has a plan: to defeat them with... magic. And by magic, I mean the titular witch Izetta, flying on rifles and destroying tanks by launching swords and so on.So let me ask a question here: is anyone actually interested in Nazis as the antagonists? (Oh, I\'m sorry, not Nazis. I mean imperial Germans who happen to yell ""Sieg...Reich!"" and put up propaganda posters.) Actually, let me put it a bit differently: is anyone really interested in a black-and-white war story against a generic expansionist militaristic country? Because that\'s what we\'re getting here. Oh, don\'t get me wrong, it could be a lot worse. A few of the Germanian characters seem at least remotely human. But still, what I\'m mostly seeing is working for the glory of the fatherland and the emperor (and furthering their own careers in the process, I guess).The show is certainly fond of the idea. The protagonists and antagonists alike are full of selfless sacrifice for their respective countries. In a particularly baffling moment, the ""ruthless strategist"" character berates a Germanian defector for betraying his fatherland for his own survival. So let me get this straight. If he had done all the dodgy things he did for the fatherland, it would have been fine then? Really?On the protagonists\' side we have Finé: the paragon of courage, duty, self-sacrifice, national pride and all the other alleged virtues. She is always willing to sacrifice herself for the greater good. She never lets power get to her head or abuses it in any way. She holds speeches about how the nation is everything and you must fight to protect it, blah blah blah. And on top of all that she is a princess. Hmm, I sure wonder which side we are supposed to root for in this show: the perfect protagonist or the freakin\' Nazis?Meanwhile, Izetta does whatever she can to help her because she is her... friend? No, I\'m sorry; nobody would believe that after the tearful eyes, holding hands, dancing, playing around in underwear and the moonlit flight. The show may not admit it, but Finé is her love interest. Izetta is thoroughly defined by her love and has no ambition or interests beyond it. I\'m sure an actual personality would only get in the way of fanservice and fight scenes.Whenever a side character has a bit more personality, they get approximately five seconds of screentime. Good luck getting attached to these people. After all, we are on the clock here. This show is only 12 episodes long, and we need to set aside some time for maid antics, eating cake and comparing boob sizes. Establishing character motivation? Logical plot progression? World-building? Who needs these?By the way, character motivations are a major problem here. For instance, the antagonistic witch has a great motive: a revenge plot where she takes revenge on a bunch of innocent bystanders. How compelling. And then there\'s this one character who defects after getting backstabbed for no clear reason... offscreen. What happened? Am I supposed to make a blind guess here? The show also ends with a hasty clipshow and various copouts. At that point, they probably thought it was already a trainwreck and couldn\'t be bothered.There is some novelty value in a ""what if"" story where a witch is wrecking tanks and planes, but you should actually do something with the idea. It\'s not like it would have been hard to have a more engaging plot: what if their good intentions go overboard and their cult of personality goes to their heads? How about showing that the other countries also have their own problems instead of everything being the Germanians\' fault? How about some internal conflict between the protagonists? Or make it a parody or something; there is more than enough material here.But nope, just got to beat those wacky Nazis for the hundredth time. Barely anyone has interesting motivation in this show. We don\'t even learn about the history behind the war. Why are the Germanians on a rampage? I mean, I get it, they are an expansionist militaristic country, but why did things turn out that way? Wars don\'t happen in a vacuum. Could we maybe get some historial context here? Some world-building? No? Is the war going on literally only because it\'s 1939?The crowning moment of this show is when a Germanian officer enters into a rant to berate the character who prioritizes his own survival. Just listen:""I had brothers-in-arms, too. People who fought and died for what they loved! That ‒ being able to do that ‒ is what makes you human! He believed in you! He believed you were fighting for the fatherland!""The presentation in the narrative is clearly on this guy\'s side. So you\'re talking about noble causes and the example you give is... waging expansionist war and slaughtering and oppressing countless innocent people for the glory of the fatherland?

Personally, I am pretty big on historical and alternate historical settings and shows which utilize them, and I like magical girl shows, so throwing them together into a blender is a good way to get me interested in the show, and at twelve episodes, it wasn't a very big commitment.Taking place in an alternate World War II, Izetta is focused almost entirely on the small fictious country of Eylstadt, which borders the Germanian Empire (...Germany) and the...Romulus Federation (Basically Italy), and so they end up getting war declared on them by the Germanians to be able to better move with their allies. Being a small nation, they would normally be pretty boned...were it not for the last known witch in the world, Izetta, who was being secretly smuggled into Germania to study her (and, well, for some more reasons), which throws a whole wrench into things when Princess Ortfiné Fredericka von Eylstadt (...We'll go with what everyone else calls her in the show, Fine) is trying to escape Germanian capture and happens upon her, then later is kept with her on the way to Germania...because, you see, Izetta and Fine have a past together, enough to awaken the witch!The start of the series is ultimately pretty simple, albeit well enough put together, where Izetta's witchly powers (which, by the way, look really cool) are used to defend the kingdom against overwhelming odds...and also a lot of yuri, of course. While the plot of the series is pretty standard at the start, the Germanians trying to find out Izetta's powers and weaknesses against the main characters trying to work around things like her limited range and some spying plot is enough to carry it well enough. Around the halfway point, the plot begins to get a good deal complex, and I would actuall say the latter half of the series is more of what I was hoping for: More of a look at what happens when a magical girl style of magic meets with a real world war and technology scenario, political plays and spy work and so on.Dipping into characters, the two main characters are the aforementioned Izetta and Fine. Izetta is not a particularly complex character, and while fun enough, she really could have used a bit more depth to her character and I don't think it would have been too hard to give it to her, such as some more reflection on, you know, all the stuff she is doing in WAR for Fine and so on. Fine is the more interesting of the two, a young ruler thrust into a difficult situation and forced to make tough choices, and while it isn't explored to a particularly deep degree, it does allow her some stronger character moments and is at least fairly interesting, being a stronger character driver than Izetta, although the show is a bit...light in this regard, and so I did not feel it was handled as well as it could.Something I wish had changed with the show is that the show, rather obviously and something everyone would know who has been paying attention to this show's description on anime sites or promotional material, pretty obviously plays Izetta and Fine as having lesbian moments with each other. As someone who naturally enjoys yuri moments, this is appealing to me, but like many of the shows it doesn't turn into an actual romance, which is pretty disappointing. I felt it was especially disappointing here, as not only does the show play it pretty heavily, but I feel it would better tie together Izetta and Fine's characters, as how they see each other and what they will do for each other is an important part of the show, and frankly it feels totally ripe for a romantic upgrade from friends...in fact, Episode 11 has a perfect moment for this, and while the show may trick you for a moment to think it has happened, it ultimately cops out with an open ending instead of a solid one, and to me it ends up making it feel like this plot line does not resolve in a satisfactory way.The other characters are more interesting to me. Berkman is not an especially memorable antagonist, but he is played in an interesting enough way and his very self-centric viewpoint ends up being in very interesting context and contrast to essentially every other character in the show, making him more standout and unique. Sieg is probably the most interesting character in the show, with earlier moments that might seem a bit confusing at the start end up slotting into place when backstory is revealed, and ultimately makes him feel like a more deep character than most of the others, although the last stuff he does feels kinda out of place. There's also more minor characters who come in and out and I won't go into all of them, but they tend to have some of the more interesting/different moments in the show.Both the plot and the characters are a bit basic overall, though, and I wish that the show focused more on the second half's styling, as one thing I wasn't super happy about with this show is that I feel the integration of technology and magic could have been better done. Izetta's gun-broom is AWESOME and I love the idea and I do like how her powers feel both analogous to various real life military units and cleverly tied in. But the politics of it, the fighting aside from Izetta, and so on is rather lacking, and would have been more interesting had the tone of the second half been spread more through it, as the tone is oddly two-faced to it even if it never really goes dark but instead more serious. While I did like the second half, the last episode left me very divided, especially in how it messes with how one might imagine the world, although I did like the villain of the end.Going into the animation and sound, the animation is actually really pretty, with Izetta popping off as vibrant and managing to make surprisingly realistic styled character designs soft and interesting, which helps make Izetta stand out more among them. Stuff like Izetta's riding of her gun-as-broom looks pretty cool and some of the scenes with the magic are quite lovely. One issue the show sometimes has is in some iffy CGI, most apparently in the last episode but at times seen before. This keeps it as a pretty and high end animation, but far from the best. Sound-wise the opening, Cross the Line, is REALLY standout and something I could listen to all the time. The sound effect of things like the planes and so on are very nice...but while the OP is good, the ED is forgettable, and it has some good music, but nothing which can be compared to the best around, so I leave it as good but not amazing.Overall, Izetta is not a show that will amaze you, and if you seek a show with a deep exploration of a premise, you'll probably end up ultimately disappointed. If you want something which can give a more minor level of depth, really nice animation, and enough character and plot to keep one interested until the end, you'll probably fine Izetta enjoyable.

It is actually rather cool to see a witch riding a huge tank-busting rifle instead of your typical broom into battle. This anime deliver good, enjoyable story till the end, but there are so many wasted potential that prevented it from being a true masterpiece.The plot of Shuumatsu no Izetta is a linear one. A princess befriended a powerful witch that could help defend her home country in the midst of war. While everything seems...to be fine, there are bound to be obstacles and conflicts that makes it more interesting. Death and sacrifice is a concurrent theme, and the anime doesn't shy itself for letting several key characters dies. The anime ended in a rather strong and satisfying end, albeit rushed. My biggest complain about the anime is how its should split into 2 cours instead. Character development focused heavily on the two main characters and seems to ignore the other. This is a huge flaw since some of the side characters had a some important roles yet the viewers understanding of their past and motivation is almost null. It had so much potential alas, everything had to be crammed inside a single cour.The two main characters that mostly took the spotlight are Princess Fine and Izetta. Princess Fine is your ideal image of a ruler, loved by the people and have a strong sense of responsibility to rule and defend the country well. Izetta meanwhile is a rather powerful witch that complement with Fine is a sense that she also want to make sure she become a great ruler, giving Fine her unyielding trust and power. There are no obvious romance that could be elaborated, but the friendship between those two is definitely stepping the boundary of Yuri; not that it is a bad thing.The art and animation are decent for the most part. The action scene were executed really fluid and well. The portrayal of alternate europe during the World War 2 era is also very detailed; from uniform, to weapons and vehicles. Tanks, airplanes and ship are modelled using CGI, which is really common nowadays. There are little animation issues; while not the best this season to offer it is still a job well done from the studio. Sound is also decent enough. The OP gets the viewer pumped up while the ED leaves a melancholic feel as each episode end.Shuumatsu no Izetta is one of my top anime this season; which is saying something since this season overall is rather mediocre. It is good and enjoyable to watch, yet it had so much potential that could be exploited if the anime was mad longer instead. While not perfect, it does it job alright. to be fine, there are bound to be obstacles and conflicts that makes it more interesting.

It initially had everything it needed to succeed: an intriguing premise, serviceable animation, and promising characters. An alternate history exploration of WWII, with magical girls, would have been a fascinating twist to the historical war drama. However, it becomes painfully clear that Ajia-Do either had no idea what they were doing, or they simply did not think this whole thing through well enough.The animation, while it does have its moments, ranges from relatively average and even sub-par in certain episodes. Some episodes have beautifully animated action sequences, which is something...I can commend the show for. However, some other episodes will feature poorly done background characters, some even lacking facial features at its worst. The CGI used, mostly for military vehicles and Izetta’s anti-material rifle/broomstick and weapons, is serviceable but nothing truly stands out.The story is inexcusably sub-par. The whole narrative is built on a mountain of plot conveniences and deus ex machina. Characters and plot devices are shoe-horned into a scene to get things moving, and the plot contrivances are many. The war side of the story is often sidelined in favor of showing Fine and Izetta together. You wanted a show that featured a small country locked in a dance of death and political intrigue with world powers? WELL TOO BAD! You’re either getting episodes of the girls hanging out instead, or episodes of Izetta single-handedly annihilating everything which, in turn, encourages the rest of the good guys to not do much of anything.The biggest fault in this entire mess are the characters. The female leads,Izetta and Fine, are two of the biggest Mary Sues I’ve ever seen in an anime, coming close to such characters like Medaka Kurokami of Medaka Box. Izetta is a complete tool with no sense of agency. Fine is somehow a flawless master statesman out of the gate, in which we never see her struggle for most of the time. The villains are laughably cartoonish and two-dimensional. I don’t really need to talk about the rest of the side-cast as they really weren’t characters, and the anime didn’t care about them much either (and don’t even get me started on the “Royal Guard”).For the vast majority of the anime, these characters, Fine and Izetta especially, all show far too little character development. They don’t really encounter any plot development to precipitate any sort of meaningful change until the very end, and by then, it’s too late for it to matter. You will have stopped caring about them.The relationship (and heavily implied romance) between Fine and Izetta, a major selling point of this series, is a painfully droll affair that just doesn’t feel like it belongs in the anime all together. It really feels like it competes with the rest of the anime for attention, rather than it enhancing the narrative experience. It’s almost as if this show can’t make up its mind as to what it is, and what kind of experience it wants to tell.Arguably the most frustrating aspect, is that Ajia-Do forgets that this is an anime that is just as much about WAR as it is about a couple of lesbians. There is so much potential that is wasted to use the unique setting to both shape our protagonists and tell an interesting story. Izetta pretty much murders a small army by shows end, and she never seems affected by the horrific reality of war. You really don’t see Fine really struggle with the reality of running a country at war as a young, new, and inexperienced head of state. Instead, they just keep plodding along as they are. Ajia-Do completely disregarded this psychological element that would have made the story much more compelling.BOTTOM LINE:  I cannot recommend this anime to anyone. It is a production that is too unfocused and fails to make use of the premise’s incredible potential to tell an interesting story. I can commend the show for.

It is a production that is too unfocused and fails to make use of the premise’s incredible potential to tell an interesting story.', ""This anime is an underrated gem that I hope will receive better ratings as time goes on. This has been an anime I can really enjoy.///Story Score – 8The story is relatively straightforward. Finé is the only daughter to the Archduke of Elystadt and Izetta is the titular last witch known to walk the earth. Izetta and Finé are childhood friends who after a series of events reencounter each other after being separated for so long. Izetta wishes to do what she can to protect Finé’s country of Elystadt from the Germanian invasion while Finé does what she can to help Izetta anyway she can,...so Izetta can survive. The chemistry and bond these two share are a driving force of this show, and it is definitely one of the strongest points.In addition to that, we also get to see some of the behind the scenes things in wars, such as the political, military strategy, and propaganda side. As in the real world, politics in this story can make things quite difficult. I also appreciated that they utilize actual strategy in this story rather than simply have Izetta fight the enemy head on every time. In regards to the propaganda side, it sort of reminded me of “Captain America: The First Avenger,” except Izetta actually showed off her powers against the real enemy rather than trying to sell bonds.The anime makes pretty good use of foreshadowing, specifically visual foreshadowing. A little more than I think some people might give it credit for. These are just some instances, so I’m sure there are plenty more.During the first episode, we see what appears to be magical energy flowing towards Izetta during the flashback scene and when she is awakening. In episodes two and three, it establishes that there appear to not only be limits to Izetta’s powers but fluctuations to it as well. Those signs firmly foreshadow the revelation Izetta’s power doesn’t come from within but from the magical energy in ley lines outside. As Izetta explains in the fourth episode, she can only tap into her magical abilities if there are ley lines, but if there aren’t any, she is more or less a normal human.I’ve seen some people complain about the use of spies in this story, but I think some people don’t realize that the spies were foreshadowed from the very first sequence. In the first episode, the Germanains were aware of Finé being on the train. That alone foreshadows there were most likely spies in Elystadt. Additionally, one of the smug Germanain officers who holds a gun to Finé’s head in the first episode, brags about the Germanian spy network. He obviously wasn’t lying about it. Since Germania was planning on invading multiple nations, I would be surprised if Germania sent out spies into every country as sleeper agents. It would explain why they were effective in taking care of some of them. Not to mention, making use of spies has been a valid tactic that countries have used for a very long time.One type of foreshadowing that might go into spoiler territory would be one that foreshadows a certain character’s fate. During battle, one character sees one of his fellow soldiers die in some manner and he eventually suffers the same fate. It is due to that sneak foreshadowing that I think certain other characters fates for the end of the series have been foreshadowed as well, and we might look back on certain scenes with a ‘harsher in hindsight’ look.There is also a very noticeable foreshadowing regarding the ending of Izetta.  I won't go into details about it, but I think in hindsight, it visually gave us a pretty decent explanation for why certain things ended the way it did.  It is one of those endings when you look back on it, it seems much better than you initially thought.  Izetta really does a much better job with visual foreshadowing than some people give the series credit for.There are a few instances where there is some fanservice that seem a little out of place. While I don’t really have an issue with it, I can understand why some people do. However, the fanservice scenes are usually pretty tame or relatively short. At worse they are a minor annoyance.Additionally, due to this being a twelve episode series, I feel like it prevented Izetta from being able to fully explore its potential.  At the end of Episode 8, it set things up for at least two major plotlines that would have been awesome to explore.  While one of those plotlines were utilized and the other was regulated to the side, I think it would have been far better for the series to have had the episodes to fully utilize both those plotlines.  Additionally, I think we could have had more episodes of Izetta fighting various Germanian units if we had more time.Basically, I think this is an unfortunate case of the current climate of the anime industry.  It is likely the anime company wouldn't have been able to get more episodes than 12, and they had to decide from the start to end it with just one cour.  They did a great job with what they had, but it would have been even better if they could have gotten more.///Character Score – 8The main characters of this anime are Izetta and Finé. These two prove in the first two episodes alone that they are capable, likable, and strong female protagonists that you want to root for. They maintain that likability throughout the series. The chemistry between the two is wonderful.  The two characters consistently carry the series throughout the twelve episode run.In the first episode, Finé takes the center stage, and she establishes herself as being pretty intelligent. During the train sequence, she doesn’t solely focus on her bodyguards to protect her nor is she one of those whiny royal brats who says she doesn’t need help. Instead, she works with her bodyguards, and she ultimately figures out how they initially escape. Finé also proves to be quite political and understands her place as a princess. She is ready and willing to put everything on the table to protect her people, including offering herself for a political marriage.Izetta proves herself to be a wonderful protagonist to root for as well. Her loyalty towards Finé is understandable considering what Finé did for Izetta as a child. Izetta’s powers as mentioned before are great, but she is not invincible. What I like is that while Izetta is loyal to Finé and Finé clearly has the stronger personality of the two, Izetta isn’t completely dependent on her either. Izetta is capable of making her own decisions.Decisions that Finé and Izetta make during the series have been perfectly inline for their characters. For example, when Finé originally doesn’t want Izetta to help her fight Germania, I realized this was fitting for the characterization the first episode established. Finé proved to have a political mind and tries to think in the long term, such as making sure there were possible heirs for the throne before offering herself up for a political marriage. She understood that if Izetta used her power it would expose her existence to the world and not just Germania and Elystadt. Getting involved could very well put a target on the back of Izetta’s head both during and after the war. After Izetta makes her decision, Finé respects the decision and does her best to help Izetta anyway she can.Izetta actually does go through some character development in the series. It is subtle, but it is there. Izetta has major self-worth issues at the beginning of the series, but they seem to lessen a little as it goes on. She also proves to be quite assertive at time as well. Although, I’m sure it is mostly due to her feeling useful. Izetta was also somewhat nervous when talking to people or being introduced to new people. However, she does seem slightly more comfortable around people, and she is less nervous talking to new people as shown in Episode Seven.  She also has a major moment in Episode Eleven that is very satisfying, but I won't go into details about because it'd be too spoilery.As mentioned before, I love the bond between Izetta and Finé. I consider it a highlight of the series. Personally, with all the moments they share, I hope they become romantically involved. It seems like they should, and it feels like it too. They have so much chemistry that I've been a shipper for these two from the very start.In regards to supporting characters, certain criticisms about the supporting characters lacking development does have some merit. We are introduced to a decent number of supporting characters in the first few episodes. Their personalities do receive some characterization, but we don’t learn too much about them. They seem likable, but they lack the development or characterization that makes me want to care about them like I care about Izetta or Finé. While I do wish they developed the supporting cast more, I suppose having strong main characters that don’t aren’t overshadowed by others is fine with me. However, there are still some standouts for the supporting cast.For the first few episodes, I found Seig to be the most interesting supporting character because of his character development, his logical thinking, and his willingness to engage in morally questionable activity. While he did do a major slip up in Episode 5, I believe he did make up for it rather quickly. Additionally, the fact he showed some regret for his morally questionable activity does show some dimension to the character.  The later episodes develop his character further, and we can really see the similarities and contrasts between him and Berkman.Of the antagonists, Berkman does prove to be relatively interesting. Rather than having people say he is intelligent, he proves to be intelligent. Through logic and noticing clues, he is capable of piecing together a fair number of things, namely as a potential weakness in Izetta’s power. I do appreciate having an antagonist who is intelligent, and there are valid reasons for him to come to his conclusions. Similar to Seig, he does extremely morally questionable things, but unlike Seig, he seems to enjoy them a little.  We also learn that while Seig and him are very similar, there are more than a few differences between them due to who they truly are in the inside.Episodes Seven and Eight do seem to partly address the issues regarding a lack of development in the supporting cast. During the seventh episode, we get introduced to a new supporting character Gromon, who quickly establishes himself as a character that fans can like. The fact he seems like a shipper for Izetta and Finé helps. Despite being a one episode wonder, he proves to be far more useful to Izetta than a majority of the other characters have been over the series.In Episode Seven, there is a scene with Bassler and Rickert playing poker with other Germanian soldiers. Personally, I like that we got a scene with characters on the antagonist side doing something other than planning and preparing for war related activities. It shows some humanization on the Germanians similar to how we’ve seen characters on the protagonist side having downtime. It also further establishes the Germanians aren’t simply evil. They can have similarities to the protagonists, but they happen to be on opposite sides.The eighth episode provides us with a day in the limelight for a few supporting characters as well with them taking more of the center stage while Izetta and Finé are more on the side. I liked how the plot can progress without their direct involvement or in some cases the plot progressed because of their earlier actions. Anyway, I found that episode enjoyable because it felt like things that have been building up are paying off.During the concluding episodes of the series, we get to see a few other characters make major contributions to the plot as well and/or interact more with the main characters. I'm glad we got to see some more development and fleshing out for the supporting characters toward the end.  However, I think it would have been done much better if we had more episodes to allow them to be fleshed out.///Art Score – 10Personally, I found the art style to be very appealing back from the promotional artwork and the previews. The series proper doesn’t disappoint. The opening and ending themes have great artwork. The characters generally are well designed and appealing. They do a fine job animating the environment and the action sequences.  The final battle was very well done.While there have been some potential weaknesses in the artwork, I do believe that will be taken care of in the Blu-ray. That seems to be the general practice to improve the artwork in the Blu-ray release of anime.///Sound Score – 10The music for the opening, ending, and OST are great. They are very fitting for the scenes and atmosphere of the series. The voice acting for the original Japanese cast along with the English dub produced by Funimation have been fitting for their voices. While the Japanese version seems to have better voice acting, I think the English voice actors do a stellar job. Additionally, I’ve noticed some slight script alterations between the Japanese version and the English dub, and I actually think the localization team did a good job changing certain things to make them sound better.///Enjoyment Score – 10During the series run, I’ve watched every episode in both English sub and English dub format shortly after it has become available.  I remember how I would always look forward to the next episode every Saturday.  I was saddened when the show came to an end, but I'm glad it had a relatively conclusive ending.  I hope others will enjoy it as well. As I stated, I think this series is underrated, and I hope there will be some vindication overtime. so Izetta can survive. The chemistry and bond these two share are a driving force of this show, and it is definitely one of the strongest points.In addition to that, we also get to see some of the behind the scenes things in wars, such as the political, military strategy, and propaganda side.

However, I think it would have been done much better if we had more episodes to allow them to be fleshed out.///Art Score – 10Personally, I found the art style to be very appealing back from the promotional artwork and the previews. The series proper doesn’t disappoint. The opening and ending themes have great artwork. The characters generally are well designed and appealing. They do a fine job animating the environment and the action sequences.  The final battle was very well done.While there have been some potential weaknesses in the artwork, I do believe that will be taken care of in the Blu-ray. That seems to be the general practice to improve the artwork in the Blu-ray release of anime.///Sound Score – 10The music for the opening, ending, and OST are great. They are very fitting for the scenes and atmosphere of the series. The voice acting for the original Japanese cast along with the English dub produced by Funimation have been fitting for their voices. While the Japanese version seems to have better voice acting, I think the English voice actors do a stellar job. Additionally, I’ve noticed some slight script alterations between the Japanese version and the English dub, and I actually think the localization team did a good job changing certain things to make them sound better.///Enjoyment Score – 10During the series run, I’ve watched every episode in both English sub and English dub format shortly after it has become available.  I remember how I would always look forward to the next episode every Saturday.  I was saddened when the show came to an end, but I'm glad it had a relatively conclusive ending.  I hope others will enjoy it as well. As I stated, I think this series is underrated, and I hope there will be some vindication overtime."", ""To be honest I didn't know what to expect from this series, however as I kept watching the series became more and more enjoyable.The characters are likable and the story was solid. It kept coming back to the theme of war and how Germania was invading their country.The soundtrack and background music was amazing, the entrance for Izetta was amazingly executed and you could tell that she was a changing factor in battles.The characters were well presented at the start which kept me interested in watching more and seeing how they would develop throughout the series. I loved the bond the main heroines had...and you could clearly tell how much they cared for each other which made me want to see more of them.The soundtrack also showed how holy and godlike the witches are.Overall I really enjoyed this anime from start to finish. and you could clearly tell how much they cared for each other which made me want to see more of them.The soundtrack also showed how holy and godlike the witches are.Overall I really enjoyed this anime from start to finish."", ""Shuumatsu no Izetta is a pretty anime with an even prettier main character. Izetta is the last witch in a tiny little kingdom during an alternate WWII, helping her princess fight the invading Germanian forces.The episodes are rather fast paced, and there isn't much explanations, especially in the first 2-3 episodes. However the character development is quite good and gives even the background characters some backstory and you want to root for them, tragic as it may be. (I'm looking at you, Jonas.) There is a-lot of light-hearted moments during the anime that are for a nice lap, and the character of the Archduchess Fine...is cute in her mannerisms, despite how 'stately' she has to be. Episodes often end in cliff-hanger moments which make me want to goto the next episode almost immediately. So I considered that as a huge plus. However towards the ending the timeframe of the war gets skewed alot and could be a bit better and there is a bit of a Deus Ex Machina, although it was well planned/made to fit into the story itself.I did throughly enjoy the concept of magic and how it's made/played out. However a latter element does seem to have an overpowered enemy, but the final battle should've been played out a decent bit more.The characters are very loveable, especially the Archduchess and Izetta (my favorite.) They're also rather well endowed, or most of them, anyways. However my favourite part of the cast is one of the background characters who I was constantly rooting for. The enemy's side had a lot of confusing and contradicting stories at first, but were mostly explained later. There are/were still some unresolved/confusing elements at the end of the anime I had questions about on the technicality of it. I like the dialogue at times too and the concept of the truth behind fairy tails was a nice way of advancing the plot.Music was good, and well made, especially the intro and I loved it. Ending credits could use some better music however.In the end I found that the anime was very enjoyable and had a good mix of magic and realism, and if you ignore the glaring issues with plot and episode/time frame speed, it was a very nice watch with a cute end. Overall the ending could use more work, but was still nicely done.Overall 8/10 anime, and I might rewatch it sometime, or at least some episodes from it. is cute in her mannerisms, despite how 'stately' she has to be.

It was as if the anime was playing with error and accuracy, with countless attempts. Those that either went very well, or went very wrong. I came across many times wondering why I continued to follow the anime, and I could never get a concrete answer. Maybe it was because I had a little curiosity to know if the relationship of both heroines was so ""non-superficial"" to the point of having so many cute and pseudo-romantic scenes, or if it was because I simply had a huge doubt of how anime Would end...up leaving so many doubts and events to be clarified and developed in the penultimate and final episode.I was very impressed by the fact that since episode 3, the anime made it so predictable and explicit that one of the heroines could die, entitled to an emphasis just before this possible scene, and simply to have left the logic and coherence aside To leave that same heroine alive for no reason at all.So the anime was interesting and dynamic only in the first three episodes only, then it was a huge adjection of apathetic and mild episodes, which suddenly happened something random to give an impaction to it so as not to let those who watched sleep.The plot was well formulated, but failed to give a dynamism to it, which unrolled all other negative factors to it.

It was very well elaborated and is easily noticeable in whatever the situation or event.The characters are not charismatic, they are not loving and they are not hateful.

First of all if you are a person that loves history and fantasy this is a great anime for you. The anime follows an original plot inspired by WW-WW2. The plot is really interesting and also it's really hard to guess what it will follow.As about the characters they were all unique kept on their roles until the very end, the voice actors and the director did a really good job in the anime in general.The art was impressive...as well, the background were fitted exactly as the time of reference of the anime (which it was around to 1930-1945), the effects were really nice!Pretty much i enjoyed watching this anime, from the first episodes it teared me up a little bit and also motivated me to hold on until the very end, i didn't got bored at all since the type of it fits to my standards.I wouldn't recommend this anime to people who dislike history and politics. You aint like this stuff but i would introduce it to my close friends so i can hear their opinion!Thanks for reading my review! I tried to make it as short as possible, my overall rating of this anime is 9 and no i wouldn't rewatch it but i'll remember it with all my heart!Izetta you rock baby <3 as well, the background were fitted exactly as the time of reference of the anime (which it was around to 1930-1945), the effects were really nice!Pretty much i enjoyed watching this anime, from the first episodes it teared me up a little bit and also motivated me to hold on until the very end, i didn't got bored at all since the type of it fits to my standards.I wouldn't recommend this anime to people who dislike history and politics.

The crown Princess of Eylstadt, Ortfiné Fredericka von Eylstadt (Hayami Saori), does what she can to defend her meager country but in doing so falls into the hands into the hands of the Germanians. Through this series of events, Finé is reunited with her childhood friend Izetta (Akaneya Himika), the last remaining descendant of a family of witches. After escaping, Izetta pledges her magic and loyalty to Finé in...order to defend Eylstadt against the encroaching forces of Germania and to realize the ideals of her dear friend.[Characters]:At its heart, Shuumatsu no Izetta revolves around the pair of Finé and Izetta with a light interest aimed at the show’s fairly extensive supporting cast. Their friendship makes a lot of sense within the story. Finé came to Izetta’s rescue as a child and showed her kindness when nobody else would. Though Izetta saw her magic as something that made her an outcast, Finé was enamored and enchanted by it and these things gave Izetta a great deal of admiration for her. To Finé, Izetta represented somebody who saw her for who she was – someone who appreciated her outside of the context of her royalty. Within this give and take between the two characters, the groundwork for their personalities and their relationship is pretty good.Finé herself is strong-willed, idealistic, and fully embodies the kind of self-sacrifice and poise of a just ruler. She puts others first at every turn and most of her dialogue is spent agonizing over the fact that because she herself doesn’t have the power to protect her country, that she must risk the well-being of her friend Izetta. Her conviction and care for her people is endearing but at the same time she presents such a paragon of idealism and devotion that she often comes off as kind of bland and cliche. Her unflinching loyalty to the people of Eylstadt consumes her to the point that the only significant characterization that remains is that she is a ‘good person’ and that she cares for Izetta. Though she has these issues, watching Finé struggle to come to terms with what needs to be done is a compelling part of her character.While Finé can at times be a little uninteresting, Izetta, the titular witch of the show, features this quality to a more extensive degree. She adores Finé, her personality is kind and innocent, and that’s about it. Almost all of her time is spent staring starry-eyed at Finé and wanting to do her best and pay back the kindness she once received as a young girl. Izetta herself is somewhat symbolic of Finé’s penchant for sacrifice and how she empowers herself. In the same way that Finé laments having to send her soldiers off to fight the war, she must send Izetta out onto the battlefield if she wants to have any chance at victory. This conflict of interests is what drives their relationship but whereas Finé becomes more interesting because of it, Izetta remains the same, earnest character she always was. She becomes wrapped up in the characterization of a more interesting person and between her overwrought simplicity and total lack of development fails to become an engaging character in her own right.While the two central characters have their ups and downs, the rest of the cast is woefully uninteresting and impressively forgettable. Despite hosting a relatively large cast of characters, you’d be hard-pressed to find one that couldn’t be entirely summarized by a one-word description. There’s a maid, a pilot, a spy, a reporter, a captain of the imperial guard – the list goes on. They just have no depth or personality to them whatsoever and so when the focus of the show turns to them to be interesting or meaningful, their scenes fall utterly flat. The Germanians are about as typical of a depiction as you can render of Nazi-Germany and the motives of the antagonists present in the story either don’t make much sense or don’t matter in respect to the story at large.[Art/Animation]:Shuumatsu no Izetta boasted a visual style that at times wavered in quality but was for the most part fairly consistent. There were lots of pastoral backgrounds, villages, and castles and so the setting itself looked pretty decent. The show as a whole often came off as major WWII fan-service in its depiction of trenches, tanks, infantry, and dogfights. If you came to the show seeking European wartime imagery than Shuumatsu no Izetta delivers. The explosions look fantastic and the general combat looks pretty good as well. There are a number of action scenes and battles throughout the show but they are far too infrequent in their appearance to carry it through some of its more mind-numbing friendship-building scenes. For what it’s worth, Izetta flies around on an anti-tank rifle which is probably the most compelling image in the entire show and the most representative of the show’s duel subject matter.Speaking of fan-service, Shuumatsu no Izetta features a surprising amount of it in the form of suggestive camera angles and unnecessary nudity scenes. While it doesn’t appear too frequently, the early mid-section of the show becomes rather bogged down with this extraordinarily out of place content. Izetta just doesn’t bill itself as the kind of show where this kind of sexualization feels necessary or meaningful. The first episode establishes political intrigue, war-centric imagery, magic, and drama. What follows is awkward and very tonally disruptive, going as far as to sexualize Izetta during combat scenes when she should be most appealing and engaging.[Story]:The central narrative of Shuumatsu no Izetta is pretty straightforward. The Germanian empire seeks to invade the land of Eylstadt and Finé does everything she can to stop them and save her country. With the appearance of Izetta and the powerful magic she wields, the rules of combat are fundamentally changed. Suddenly, this small, nearly insignificant country which lay at the mercy of its attackers stands a fighting chance as it rallies behind Finé and Izetta who strongly resembles a famous witch from the county’s folklore. It’s a promising start but the show ultimately fails to capitalize on what made its story initially appealing.The failing of Shuumatsu no Izetta’s story is twofold. What starts out as a promising blend between WWII European wartime and magical fantasy quickly becomes dull and uneventful as the focus of the show turns away from politics and warfare and towards the antics of Izetta, Finé, and the supporting cast. The scenes of battlefields, tanks, and planes are quickly forgotten in place of scenes about bathing, eating pie, and incessantly going on and on for episodes at a time about whether or not Izetta should fight on behalf of Eylstadt. In this respect, Shuumatsu no Izetta should have quite literally stuck to its guns. What made the show interesting was its take on warfare, magic, and the historical intrigue of its depiction.This subject matter doesn’t run the length of the entire show but it really bogs down the early episodes when it would be most important to be developing something meaningful. Moreover, hardly anything happens for long stretches of time. The battles are highly infrequent and the developments between Eylstadt and Germania happen very intermittently. One bit of praise I will give the show is its use of propaganda and information warfare which is only spotlighted upon for a brief time but which captures a bit of Shuumatsu no Izetta’s earlier magic.Though the show eventually arrives at its ultimate conflict somewhere in its later episodes, the other thing that really hamstrings the story is just how many plot contrivances it has. Too frequently are characters sent out of their way simply for the sake of manifesting some crude development down the line. It feels unnatural and often involves the show busing itself with its supporting cast which leaves each of those respective scenes completely drained of meaning and personality. Simply put, the bulk of the show is spent investigating the relationship between Izetta and Finé and at other times attempting to spin some sort of story out of the show’s other far less interesting characters. The story is predictable to a truly unfortunate degree and never really shakes its propensity for behaving in the most obvious of ways even as it winds down.[Sound]:The soundtrack of Shuumatsu no Izetta is actually quite an interesting one. Some of the tracks fit better than others but for the most part they attempt to distill the show’s sense of magic and war through various orchestral styles, occult singing, and occasional rock influence. The music gives Shuumatsu no Izetta a kind of unique sound which works to its benefit however some tracks don’t fit into the scenes as well as others which can leave them feeling out of place.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:It’s easy to write-off Shuumatsu no Izetta as a case of wasted potential and it’s certainly true that the show doesn’t take its image of a rifle-riding, magical witch in World War II quite far enough but for the most part I feel the show hit upon most of what it could have done. Themes of helping yourself through others and self-sacrifice give the two central characters some thematic significance but also contribute to the show’s more stereotypical elements.Rating: 3I gave Shuumatsu no Izetta a 3 because it was uneventful, poorly written, and its cast was exceedingly under-characterized. Though its premise sported some potential[Recommendations]:If the premise of a witch flying around in a WWII setting, dodging gunfire and upending tanks sounds appealing then, despite its faults, Shuumatsu no Izetta will probably still deliver. Its depiction of war is a pretty entertaining one though it hardly apologizes for the show’s other many faults. Outside of its specific premise appeal, the show doesn’t have much going for it and probably isn’t worth watching unless you’re in love with the idea itself. order to defend Eylstadt against the encroaching forces of Germania and to realize the ideals of her dear friend.[Characters]:At its heart, Shuumatsu no Izetta revolves around the pair of Finé and Izetta with a light interest aimed at the show’s fairly extensive supporting cast.

They just have no depth or personality to them whatsoever and so when the focus of the show turns to them to be interesting or meaningful, their scenes fall utterly flat. The Germanians are about as typical of a depiction as you can render of Nazi-Germany and the motives of the antagonists present in the story either don’t make much sense or don’t matter in respect to the story at large.[Art/Animation]:Shuumatsu no Izetta boasted a visual style that at times wavered in quality but was for the most part fairly consistent. There were lots of pastoral backgrounds, villages, and castles and so the setting itself looked pretty decent. The show as a whole often came off as major WWII fan-service in its depiction of trenches, tanks, infantry, and dogfights. If you came to the show seeking European wartime imagery than Shuumatsu no Izetta delivers. The explosions look fantastic and the general combat looks pretty good as well. There are a number of action scenes and battles throughout the show but they are far too infrequent in their appearance to carry it through some of its more mind-numbing friendship-building scenes. For what it’s worth, Izetta flies around on an anti-tank rifle which is probably the most compelling image in the entire show and the most representative of the show’s duel subject matter.Speaking of fan-service, Shuumatsu no Izetta features a surprising amount of it in the form of suggestive camera angles and unnecessary nudity scenes. While it doesn’t appear too frequently, the early mid-section of the show becomes rather bogged down with this extraordinarily out of place content. Izetta just doesn’t bill itself as the kind of show where this kind of sexualization feels necessary or meaningful. The first episode establishes political intrigue, war-centric imagery, magic, and drama. What follows is awkward and very tonally disruptive, going as far as to sexualize Izetta during combat scenes when she should be most appealing and engaging.[Story]:The central narrative of Shuumatsu no Izetta is pretty straightforward. The Germanian empire seeks to invade the land of Eylstadt and Finé does everything she can to stop them and save her country. With the appearance of Izetta and the powerful magic she wields, the rules of combat are fundamentally changed. Suddenly, this small, nearly insignificant country which lay at the mercy of its attackers stands a fighting chance as it rallies behind Finé and Izetta who strongly resembles a famous witch from the county’s folklore. It’s a promising start but the show ultimately fails to capitalize on what made its story initially appealing.The failing of Shuumatsu no Izetta’s story is twofold. What starts out as a promising blend between WWII European wartime and magical fantasy quickly becomes dull and uneventful as the focus of the show turns away from politics and warfare and towards the antics of Izetta, Finé, and the supporting cast. The scenes of battlefields, tanks, and planes are quickly forgotten in place of scenes about bathing, eating pie, and incessantly going on and on for episodes at a time about whether or not Izetta should fight on behalf of Eylstadt. In this respect, Shuumatsu no Izetta should have quite literally stuck to its guns. What made the show interesting was its take on warfare, magic, and the historical intrigue of its depiction.This subject matter doesn’t run the length of the entire show but it really bogs down the early episodes when it would be most important to be developing something meaningful. Moreover, hardly anything happens for long stretches of time. The battles are highly infrequent and the developments between Eylstadt and Germania happen very intermittently. One bit of praise I will give the show is its use of propaganda and information warfare which is only spotlighted upon for a brief time but which captures a bit of Shuumatsu no Izetta’s earlier magic.Though the show eventually arrives at its ultimate conflict somewhere in its later episodes, the other thing that really hamstrings the story is just how many plot contrivances it has. Too frequently are characters sent out of their way simply for the sake of manifesting some crude development down the line. It feels unnatural and often involves the show busing itself with its supporting cast which leaves each of those respective scenes completely drained of meaning and personality. Simply put, the bulk of the show is spent investigating the relationship between Izetta and Finé and at other times attempting to spin some sort of story out of the show’s other far less interesting characters. The story is predictable to a truly unfortunate degree and never really shakes its propensity for behaving in the most obvious of ways even as it winds down.[Sound]:The soundtrack of Shuumatsu no Izetta is actually quite an interesting one. Some of the tracks fit better than others but for the most part they attempt to distill the show’s sense of magic and war through various orchestral styles, occult singing, and occasional rock influence. The music gives Shuumatsu no Izetta a kind of unique sound which works to its benefit however some tracks don’t fit into the scenes as well as others which can leave them feeling out of place.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:It’s easy to write-off Shuumatsu no Izetta as a case of wasted potential and it’s certainly true that the show doesn’t take its image of a rifle-riding, magical witch in World War II quite far enough but for the most part I feel the show hit upon most of what it could have done. Themes of helping yourself through others and self-sacrifice give the two central characters some thematic significance but also contribute to the show’s more stereotypical elements.Rating: 3I gave Shuumatsu no Izetta a 3 because it was uneventful, poorly written, and its cast was exceedingly under-characterized. Though its premise sported some potential[Recommendations]:If the premise of a witch flying around in a WWII setting, dodging gunfire and upending tanks sounds appealing then, despite its faults, Shuumatsu no Izetta will probably still deliver. Its depiction of war is a pretty entertaining one though it hardly apologizes for the show’s other many faults. Outside of its specific premise appeal, the show doesn’t have much going for it and probably isn’t worth watching unless you’re in love with the idea itself.', 'Izetta the Last Witch: An Exercise in DisappointmentIzetta started off as one of the most promising shows of the season. Unfortunately, it suffered a gradual downward spiral that left it the biggest disappointments of the season.The plot takes a look at a fictionalized version of WWII, with not!Germany planning to invade not!Liechtenstein. However, the Princes of not!Liechtenstein finds Izetta, her childhood friend and the witch mentioned in the title, and convinces her to use her magic to help defend not!Liechtenstein, despite being forbidden as a witch to use her powers to meddle in human affairs. Izetta agrees, and starts kicking not!German butt, but complications...arise, because of course they do.The plot is a pretty standard-issue ""underdog country vs. evil expansionistic empire"" and ""magical girl genre deconstruction"" fare. The finale initially carries some satisfaction and poetry, but the epilogue\'s final moments rob the moment of any poignancy, almost like the creators were scared to let the story conclude on too sad a note. Also, the ship-teasing between Finé and Izetta got pretty aggravating, especially after Yuri!!! On Ice had the balls to carry through with it. Add in an out-of-nowhere late season twist and a clumsy ""magic equals nukes"" through line, and you get an ultimately ""meh"" plot. The military aspect of the show was, I think, unfortunately left to the wayside after the first few episodes.The art was quite lovely, even bordering on Ghibli quality at times, especially in the action scenes, and character design was quite good. No real complaints here.Sound effects were quite good, there was something very satisfying about the sound of medieval swords pounding not!panzers. Music was quite lovely also, kudos to the composer.Characters were also ""meh."" Most of the characters are pretty one-dimensional, with only a couple showing shades of moral ambiguity or emotional nuance. Izetta herself was a bore, being a personification of the ""senpai noticed me!"" meme. Finé showed some depth, especially in her voice acting, but as a whole, the characters were one-note: the heroes are mostly all goody-goods, the villains are mostly mustache-twirling, and there\'s precious little grey between all the black and white.Now that said, the show picks up when you get to the action scenes, were are all uniformly creative and exciting. Seeing a teenaged girl fly around on an anti-tank rifle (and fire it!) and toss tanks into the air with magic is not to be missed.Ultimately, Izetta made promises it ultimately didn\'t keep, but it\'s not a total waste. One just can\'t help but wish things could have turned out better. arise, because of course they do.The plot is a pretty standard-issue ""underdog country vs. evil expansionistic empire"" and ""magical girl genre deconstruction"" fare.

In this world the Germanian empire which is a country that is based on Nazi Germany of the 1940's is launching a war of world conquest and so far has been hugely successful. Opposing them is a coalition of allied countries that include Britannia which is the anime's version of the United Kingdom and the United states of Atlanta which is the anime's version of the US. One other country that...opposes the Germanian empire is the small country of Eylstadt which within the anime is a fictional country that is located in Western Austria.The main story focuses on Eylstadt's struggle to protect their country and stop the Germanians from taking the world.As settings and stories go an alternate Earth is a interesting setting to use for an anime as it gives the chance for the characters to be featured in a time period that was both interesting and brutal and at the same time allow us to see what could have happened if magic and witches really did exist at that time. Would a small country half the size of the UK be able to stand up to the military might of the Germanian empire.Izetta is the titular character of the show and one of the two main characters of the anime. Izetta played by Himika Akaneya a relatively new seiyuu is the last surviving witch of a clan of witches that were descendants of the famous white witch that was important to the country of Eylstadt and its founding. Prior to meeting the start of the series Izetta and Fine actually met when she saved her from being lynched by a mob of villagers after they suspected her of being a witch. This laid the foundation of their friendship and bond. Before the war Izetta did all she could to hide her heritage due to the prejudices that people had toward them but once the war started and her power awakened Izetta realized that her powers can be used to help both her beloved friend and later leader Fine and her country by protecting them from the invaders.As a witch Izetta is able to animate various inanimate objects such as lances and bombs and use them against the enemy by throwing them with magic. Instead of a traditional broomstick she rides a anti tank rifle which she can also use as well. Her magic though powerful depends on the planets ley lines which really means areas that have magic in them.Izetta is a nice person by nature and is kind and nice to everyone she meets with her most prominent traits being her determination to protect Fine, her friends and her home, bravery, loyalty and diligenceI felt that Izetta was a great character as despite being a witch that was viewed by others with disdain and fear Izetta still stepped up and use her powers to protect Elystadt and its people even though they done nothing for her. Her bond with Fine is one of the highlights of the show and the friendship that they forge was great to watch as they both care deeply about each other with each willing to sacrifice themselves if they can save the other. Himika Akaneya despite being a relatively new seiyuu really did a great job here and her portrayal of Izetta will surely propel her more into the spotlight.Fine whose full name is Ortfine Fine Fredericka Eylstadt is the crown princess and later Archduchess of Elystadt and one of the two main characters of the show. Fine played by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami who's also my fourth favorite seiyuu is the leader of the country of Eylstadt after the death of her father. Fine is a brave and determined young woman who despite her age is well versed in political intrigue and maneuvering. Fine is very loyal to her country and always tries to do whats best for its people and as such is very popular with its people. Fine cares a great deal about her people and staff including her best friend and her countries most powerful weapon Izetta and hates putting them in danger despite the needs for doing so. This aspect of her i actually admire as i believe that a good leader should always care about their subjects and people.As stated earlier Fine and Izetta actually met when they were little and have have forged a bond that is very strong. Her friendship with Izetta is one of the highlights of the show. Another aspect of Fine is her strong orator skills as she is able to give speeches that are both grand and convincing and arguably this is due to the hard work done by her seiyuu Saori Hayami.I felt that Fine was a great character as while Izetta was the spear and sword of Eylstadt Fine was the shield that manages the countries various alliances while also caring about her subjects and friends. The work of a ruler is never easy but Fine exemplifies the image of a calm and caring leader that cares about her people and always does what's good for the country and its people. I been a fan of Saori Hayami since 2012 and arguably her performance as Fine is nothing less than exemplary and her best performance to date.MullerMuller that i call Sieg is one of Fine's counselor's and closest advisers and is also Fine's spymaster. Quiet for the most part Sieg prefers to operate behind the scenes and does what is needed to secure the country. Though not as positive as Elvira or Lotte Muller understands that his work while certainly untactful is necessary for the country in this time of war and takes his duties seriously. His most prominent trait is perhaps his loyalty both to the country and to Fine.Elvira played by veteran seiyuu Kana Hanazawa and my 2nd favorite Seiyuu is Fine's personal tutor and later PR adviser. A former reporter that has worked in newspapers and radio Elvira is intelligent and understands very well how news works and how it can influence a country and its people. As a personal tutor Elvira teaches Fine and later Izetta how to behave and the etiquette's that they should follow and her attempts at doing so are rather funny. Her most prominent trait is perhaps craftiness.Berkmann is the head of the Germanian special unit that acts as  the intelligence agency of the Germanian empire. Intelligent, quick thinking and a shrewd and cunning person Berkman pursue's his objectives relentlessly. However one surprising trait about him is that he is loyal to no one but himself which is best demonstrated near the end of the anime. This is a complete contrast to his opposite number Sieg whose prominent trait is his loyalty. I think that this was the most unexpected thing about him that surprised me and no doubt his protege and his allies.As the head of the Germanian special unit Berkmann acted as the main villain until the second arc of the series where he was replaced by Sophie and i have to say that his character who was played by veteran voice actor Junichi Suwabe really did a great job of portraying the cunning and calculating intel chief.Sophie voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Sora Amamiya and my third favorite seiyuu is a clone of the original white witch that the Germanians were able to create by using a sample of the original witch. Despite being a clone Sophie has all the memories of the white witch and as such as a intense hatred towards Eylstadt due to what its previous king did to her. As such she cares little about the wishes of the Germanians and only wishes for the destruction of the country that wronged her this being Eylstadt. Starting from the second arc Sophie becomes the primary villain of the series replacing Berkmann and i have to say Sophie was a great villain that was portrayed brilliantly by Sora and arguably her most villainous role to date. Sophie's most prominent trait is her cruelty and her quest for revenge which means that she will stop at nothing to attain that. In a way Sophie is a dark mirror of what Izetta would become if the people that she cared about turned and betrayed her however unlikely that sounds.Rickert was Berkmann's protege and though a member of a well do family chose to join the military instead. Calm, collected and loyal Rickert was the complete opposite of Berkmann and though inexperienced he makes up for it by his kindness something that looks out of place lol. Indeed Rickert was able to infiltrate Eylstadt thanks to this trait. Indeed Rickert was able to catch Bianca's attention during the mission which while unintended was quite funny. Though sadly events did not go as planned for both of them. The almost romance between them was sweet and sad at the same time.OttoThe germanian emperor that was based on a combination of Hitler and Wilhelm II had a mostly support role within the story. Unlike others within his country Otto believed in the existence of witches and magic and advocated for their location and extraction similar to what Hitler did in real life. Aside from giving orders to Berkmann and Sophie Otto did not have much of role in the series but when he did it was usually funny due to his manner of speech.LotteLotte portrayed by veteran seiyuu Nao Toyama is a maid that serves as Fine and Izetta's personal retainers. Lotte is a positive and caring person that has a rather go lucky personality that believes in both Fine and in Izetta's powers. Lotte i felt was a great support character as even when things are dire she can still be positive which can be infectious. Her most comical trait is perhaps the fact that she has a foot stool strapped to her back. Lotte also serves as the narrator for some parts of the anime which i felt was a good move as her seiyuu Nao Toyama is well suited for this due to her voice range.BiancaBianca voiced by veteran seiyuu Aya Uchida of Trinity seven fame is the commander of Fine's personal bodyguard unit the Royal guard. Though initially distrustful of Izetta and somewhat skeptical of her abilities Bianca later become one of Izetta's closest allies and firmest believers. Bianca is actually quite different when outside of her duties as she behaves like a normal woman that is both innocent and pure and blushes quite easily. Her one and ever chance of romance with Rickert though was sweet as she did like him but ultimately had a sad ending.Arts and animationThe art style that was used for the anime i felt was amazing as the scenery of the countries was beautifully designed and had some great colors in them. The variation of the various countries and terrain types was also well done. Character designs i felt was also pretty well done and both Fine and Izetta looked gorgeous. The animation for the anime was one of the best i seen in some time with the fight scenes being particularly impressive.MusicMusic i felt was great throughout the anime and the opening and ending themes was well done. The ending theme sung by veteran singer May'n was hauntingly beautiful.Voice actingVoice acting as a whole i felt was really well done with the whole cast doing a fantastic job portraying their characters. Particular praise i feel should go to Saori Hayami who did a fantastic job portraying Fine and Himika Akaneya who played Izetta as i felt these two seiyuu's really did a fantastic job bringing their characters to life.ConclusionOverall i felt that Izetta's story was a strong one that focused on the struggle between a small country like Eylstadt and an empire like the Germanians and its determination to not only stop the invasion but also rally the world to stand against the Germanians. Key to that is of course Izetta and the bond between her and Fine which makes them both stronger and more determined to stop the germanians and protect their country. Watching Izetta lead strikes against the tyrannical Germanians with her powers while Fine rallies the various countries is like watching to halves of a person as both seek to protect the one thing that they care about the most which is each other. The one weak thing that i felt could have been executed better was the cloning of the white witch to create Sophie. While it made sense that they were able to get samples of DNA of the white witch to be able to create a clone from that should be beyond even the Germanians but the result of Sophie and Sora's first true Villain role was kinda worth it.All in all i really enjoyed Izetta as it had a great story, great characters and setting and a talented cast of seiyuu's boasting three of my favorite seiyuus in it. opposes the Germanian empire is the small country of Eylstadt which within the anime is a fictional country that is located in Western Austria.The main story focuses on Eylstadt's struggle to protect their country and stop the Germanians from taking the world.As settings and stories go an alternate Earth is a interesting setting to use for an anime as it gives the chance for the characters to be featured in a time period that was both interesting and brutal and at the same time allow us to see what could have happened if magic and witches really did exist at that time.

Aside from giving orders to Berkmann and Sophie Otto did not have much of role in the series but when he did it was usually funny due to his manner of speech.LotteLotte portrayed by veteran seiyuu Nao Toyama is a maid that serves as Fine and Izetta's personal retainers. Lotte is a positive and caring person that has a rather go lucky personality that believes in both Fine and in Izetta's powers. Lotte i felt was a great support character as even when things are dire she can still be positive which can be infectious. Her most comical trait is perhaps the fact that she has a foot stool strapped to her back. Lotte also serves as the narrator for some parts of the anime which i felt was a good move as her seiyuu Nao Toyama is well suited for this due to her voice range.BiancaBianca voiced by veteran seiyuu Aya Uchida of Trinity seven fame is the commander of Fine's personal bodyguard unit the Royal guard. Though initially distrustful of Izetta and somewhat skeptical of her abilities Bianca later become one of Izetta's closest allies and firmest believers. Bianca is actually quite different when outside of her duties as she behaves like a normal woman that is both innocent and pure and blushes quite easily. Her one and ever chance of romance with Rickert though was sweet as she did like him but ultimately had a sad ending.Arts and animationThe art style that was used for the anime i felt was amazing as the scenery of the countries was beautifully designed and had some great colors in them. The variation of the various countries and terrain types was also well done. Character designs i felt was also pretty well done and both Fine and Izetta looked gorgeous. The animation for the anime was one of the best i seen in some time with the fight scenes being particularly impressive.MusicMusic i felt was great throughout the anime and the opening and ending themes was well done. The ending theme sung by veteran singer May'n was hauntingly beautiful.Voice actingVoice acting as a whole i felt was really well done with the whole cast doing a fantastic job portraying their characters. Particular praise i feel should go to Saori Hayami who did a fantastic job portraying Fine and Himika Akaneya who played Izetta as i felt these two seiyuu's really did a fantastic job bringing their characters to life.ConclusionOverall i felt that Izetta's story was a strong one that focused on the struggle between a small country like Eylstadt and an empire like the Germanians and its determination to not only stop the invasion but also rally the world to stand against the Germanians. Key to that is of course Izetta and the bond between her and Fine which makes them both stronger and more determined to stop the germanians and protect their country. Watching Izetta lead strikes against the tyrannical Germanians with her powers while Fine rallies the various countries is like watching to halves of a person as both seek to protect the one thing that they care about the most which is each other. The one weak thing that i felt could have been executed better was the cloning of the white witch to create Sophie. While it made sense that they were able to get samples of DNA of the white witch to be able to create a clone from that should be beyond even the Germanians but the result of Sophie and Sora's first true Villain role was kinda worth it.All in all i really enjoyed Izetta as it had a great story, great characters and setting and a talented cast of seiyuu's boasting three of my favorite seiyuus in it."", ""Izetta the Last Witch is set in an alternate World War II timeline where the princess of Eylstadt, Fine, finds herself having to rely on the magical powers of close friend and witch, Izetta, against the imperialistic nation of Germania.There is quite a bit of this series that is a bit of a mixed bag, but I'll tackle what issues the show has later as I will instead concentrate on the positives to the series. The show's strongest strength is that it does a great job at establishing the bond between Fine and Izetta. The series storyline explores our two heroines having a past relationship...with one another shown through several flashbacks throughout the series and this bond also gets explored often throughout the series as Izetta feels obligated to protect Fine and her kingdom from the princess accepting her despite her origins as a witch, while Fine shows hesitance at points of exploiting her friend's powers to protect her home country.Also for the most part, the series does a solid job with exploring the rules of magic and witches in the world of Izetta. While Izetta's magic allows her to dominate over enemy armies, there are limitations and conditions in which she can apply her powers which prevents her from being too insurmountable a threat. As a result, there are points in the series where Fine and the Eylstadt armies have to be creative in exploiting Izetta's reputation as a witch to drive off Germania threats and even have to silence Germanian spies that attempt to learn Izetta's weaknesses.The use of magic makes for one of the animated highlights of the series as Izetta makes use of a heavy assault rifle to fly in the air and can levitate various objects like tanks, missiles, and lances for both attacking and to fend off enemy attacks. Action scenes have fluid movement on regular display throughout the series. Settings are animated faithfully to depict World War II era Europe with the fictional nations of the series being based off actual nations and governments who were in power during the period, and character designs are nice on the eyes despite not being as detailed.Setting aside praises, Izetta's quality does take a hit in its second half and a good chunk of this has to do with the series attempting to cram in too much for its 12-episode run. The series makes efforts to expand its story to introduce additional elements such as a story concerning Izetta's predecessor to her title of the White Witch, trying to flesh out some among the Germanian Empire, and weaving in a third side in the form of Izetta's equivalent of the USA. Unfortunately, the series lacks the time to be able to properly flesh out or integrate these additional story elements into the series which leads to said elements being greatly simplified in their storytelling purpose or getting little relevance within the series as a whole. The attempts at storyline expansion don't hurt the series too significantly as Izetta's storyline does escalate in the second half when the Germanians learn how to counteract Izetta's powers, leading to some effective escalation of drama. But it still cripples the anime's storytelling and prevents it from being one of the year's best quality titles that it showed glimmers of in its first half, and the rather anticlimactic ending does not help matters either.While I am not too sore from Izetta's second half taking a hit in quality, its attempts to try being bigger than what it could be in only 12 episodes crippled a good deal of the storytelling potential that the first half of it demonstrated. The use of magic in the series and the bond between Fine and Izetta contribute to the show's greatest strengths. But it could have been one of 2016's best anime titles if it learned to scale back a bit on the scope of its story. with one another shown through several flashbacks throughout the series and this bond also gets explored often throughout the series as Izetta feels obligated to protect Fine and her kingdom from the princess accepting her despite her origins as a witch, while Fine shows hesitance at points of exploiting her friend's powers to protect her home country.Also for the most part, the series does a solid job with exploring the rules of magic and witches in the world of Izetta.

Not only does the story seem to degrade by the end, the characters range from likable to unbearable....I would say it's a nice show if you want to watch something short with pretty backgrounds and little plot as it literally copies the second world war for just about everything once you get rid of the magic parts.

They even implemented the Graf Spee!That\'s where the enjoyment ends for me... Character development was terrible to say the least.

It\'s not until the last 2 episodes, where Shuumatsu no Izetta really starts getting back on track and ignoring the obvious counterattacking Germania is plotting.In terms of characters, due to the focus of the anime going to Izetta and Fine, they get the majority of the focus, though some of the background characters get some decent character development as due to the nature of the anime being ""anyone can die"" it might lead to wasted character potential or ""you\'ve played your part..now die"" for the minor characters which is rather odd as the minor characters round the meat of the anime started to move the plot forward instead of Fine and Izetta, the ones affected by this easily going to Ricelt voiced by Natsuki Hanae and Jonas Gallea voiced by Hiroyuki Endou. But considering how Shuumatsu no Izetta is structured as a more plot-heavy anime concerning it\'s backstories and ""fairy tales"", LA can see why besides Izetta and Fine, that it\'s not exactly character-driven. As for LA\'s favourite characters, Fine was LA\'s favourite character and with the majority of the anime dedicated to Fine, it was to be expected...ohh and Saori Hayami of course.In terms of animation done by Ajia-Do, a first time LA even heard of this anime studio, but nonetheless LA will say that the animation quality was pretty consistent and really crisp all from it\'s character designs to the warfare mixed with it\'s magical battles it had, but nonetheless with it\'s high quality and consistency the anime had throughout was great.In terms of voice acting, it was decent for the most part, and quite honestly there isn\'t much to talk about with the voice acting segment cept who was LA\'s favourite as the entire cast did decently enough but just not enough to grab LA\'s attention except for LA\'s favourite voice actor in Shuumatsu no Izetta being Saori Hayami.

I realise that war is a sensitive subject, especially for Japan, but as it’s a fantasy world, there’s no reason why they couldn’t have...named the countries something totally different (or even just gone for the ‘fake eastern European’ names which were popular in fiction written in the early 1900s). However, there’s been some thought into building up the late 30s/early setting, with the commoners wearing clothing similar to that which was popular at the time, and the weapons mostly being based on existing WWII weapons or plans for them. There’s also some great use of ‘news footage’, with black and white imagery and the flickering effect that is common in real news footage of the time. There were a few things which I spotted as being a little anachronistic or implausible outside of the obviously fantasy/magic elements, but overall there was an engrossing feeling of place and time created by the show.As characters, Finé is a young and inexperienced ruler who seeks to do what is best for her country. She’s a little idealistic, but she has people around her who help advise her and channel her idealism into more practical outlets. Izetta is shown as having a huge debt of gratitude to Finé for saving her several years ago, to the point where she’ll do almost anything to help. She doesn’t feel confident in her own abilities, but she wants to do all she can for Finé and by extension for the country in spite of being told that witches shouldn’t interfere in the affairs of others. I found the protagonists both pretty likeable, although they definitely both seemed a bit starry-eyed and out of touch with the situation at times.The soundtrack for this show was beautiful! There’s a mixture of orchestral music and some haunting choral pieces. The music works to enhance the feeling of the different moments in the show, and I especially loved the track which I’d associate with Izetta using magic.The visuals were quite competent, with a lot of love being put into the battle scenes and Izetta flying. The dog fights seemed to be choreographed in a way that was engaging and fun to watch! I mentioned earlier how I liked the period-appropriate fashions and vehicles. There were also some sharp military uniforms. While I think that during real WWII, soldiers wore khaki on the whole to blend into the surroundings, the Eylstadt troops wore a charming blue uniform with red trim. This is nice to look at and I think that these sorts of flashy uniforms help to create a sense of solidarity amongst the soldiers and also make them stand out more, which is good visually for us as the viewer, although perhaps poor in a real war situation. I would say that Izetta’s costume design (quite scanty clothing) felt rather immersion-breaking, as it seemed improbable that such clothing would have existed in the late 30s and it goes rather against the fashions of the times. There was no particular story reason given for why she had to wear this clothing instead of just wearing existing clothing which could have been found in the castle. It felt like the only reason for this sort of costume design was to sell possible figures, which was a shame in an otherwise carefully crafted world.The problem I had with this show was the story. While the concept of a witch defending not-Austria from not-Germany in WWII was very interesting, and the various elements were well crafted, the show seemed to struggle to use the elements to create a compelling tale. There were slow-paced, almost slice-of-life moments in this show which portrayed itself as being a tale of the underdog standing up against the odds, and they felt very out of place. The struggle of war and the tragedy of war seemed to be absent from this tale which was ostensibly about overcoming difficulties and self-sacrifice. There were also a lot of characters who felt like they didn’t get used to their full potential, and some who seemed to really have no purpose in telling the story at all (Elvira Freidman the stylist comes to mind). At some points in the story, the struggles of the Germanians to find information and beat Izetta felt more intriguing than the activities of the main characters, and while the show did portray some likeable and idealistic characters on both sides of the war, I don’t think that it was their intention to make the Germanians more sympathetic than the protagonists. Whilst there were some excellent moments in the series, I don’t think that the story was very good as a whole.Overall, I feel like Izetta is a show which had some excellent elements; a great concept, pleasant visuals, an outstanding soundtrack, but owing to its poor storytelling fell short of what it could have been. I think if you’re less story-oriented than myself, that you may find it to be an enjoyable, albeit flawed watch, but I didn't find it to be a pleasing watch personally. named the countries something totally different (or even just gone for the ‘fake eastern European’ names which were popular in fiction written in the early 1900s). However, there’s been some thought into building up the late 30s/early setting, with the commoners wearing clothing similar to that which was popular at the time, and the weapons mostly being based on existing WWII weapons or plans for them. There’s also some great use of ‘news footage’, with black and white imagery and the flickering effect that is common in real news footage of the time. There were a few things which I spotted as being a little anachronistic or implausible outside of the obviously fantasy/magic elements, but overall there was an engrossing feeling of place and time created by the show.As characters, Finé is a young and inexperienced ruler who seeks to do what is best for her country. She’s a little idealistic, but she has people around her who help advise her and channel her idealism into more practical outlets. Izetta is shown as having a huge debt of gratitude to Finé for saving her several years ago, to the point where she’ll do almost anything to help. She doesn’t feel confident in her own abilities, but she wants to do all she can for Finé and by extension for the country in spite of being told that witches shouldn’t interfere in the affairs of others. I found the protagonists both pretty likeable, although they definitely both seemed a bit starry-eyed and out of touch with the situation at times.The soundtrack for this show was beautiful! There’s a mixture of orchestral music and some haunting choral pieces. The music works to enhance the feeling of the different moments in the show, and I especially loved the track which I’d associate with Izetta using magic.The visuals were quite competent, with a lot of love being put into the battle scenes and Izetta flying. The dog fights seemed to be choreographed in a way that was engaging and fun to watch! I mentioned earlier how I liked the period-appropriate fashions and vehicles. There were also some sharp military uniforms. While I think that during real WWII, soldiers wore khaki on the whole to blend into the surroundings, the Eylstadt troops wore a charming blue uniform with red trim. This is nice to look at and I think that these sorts of flashy uniforms help to create a sense of solidarity amongst the soldiers and also make them stand out more, which is good visually for us as the viewer, although perhaps poor in a real war situation. I would say that Izetta’s costume design (quite scanty clothing) felt rather immersion-breaking, as it seemed improbable that such clothing would have existed in the late 30s and it goes rather against the fashions of the times. There was no particular story reason given for why she had to wear this clothing instead of just wearing existing clothing which could have been found in the castle. It felt like the only reason for this sort of costume design was to sell possible figures, which was a shame in an otherwise carefully crafted world.The problem I had with this show was the story. While the concept of a witch defending not-Austria from not-Germany in WWII was very interesting, and the various elements were well crafted, the show seemed to struggle to use the elements to create a compelling tale. There were slow-paced, almost slice-of-life moments in this show which portrayed itself as being a tale of the underdog standing up against the odds, and they felt very out of place. The struggle of war and the tragedy of war seemed to be absent from this tale which was ostensibly about overcoming difficulties and self-sacrifice. There were also a lot of characters who felt like they didn’t get used to their full potential, and some who seemed to really have no purpose in telling the story at all (Elvira Freidman the stylist comes to mind). At some points in the story, the struggles of the Germanians to find information and beat Izetta felt more intriguing than the activities of the main characters, and while the show did portray some likeable and idealistic characters on both sides of the war, I don’t think that it was their intention to make the Germanians more sympathetic than the protagonists. Whilst there were some excellent moments in the series, I don’t think that the story was very good as a whole.Overall, I feel like Izetta is a show which had some excellent elements; a great concept, pleasant visuals, an outstanding soundtrack, but owing to its poor storytelling fell short of what it could have been.

The way the friendship between them is portrayed even with their situation and it being war does make it feel more like it's not just war, there's relationships and love which shows what they're fighting for.Even though it feels a little disconnected through the episodes, going in and out of actually focusing on the war and time just seeming to pass, it was enjoyable to watch.

If you\'re picky about dodging animu cliches, CGDCT, magic interjected into WW2, or bumpy rides full of melodramatic potholes you\'re in for a huge disappointment. If you\'re one who lives for alternate European settings, beautiful scenery, and a majestic score that\'s epic beyond belief then this is the show for you.I absolutely love fantastical takes on real history, so I was overjoyed by Izetta\'s first few episodes; likewise, I adore David vs. Goliath narratives where a small, well-defended nation is pitted against a...superpower with little chance of success (Valkyria Chronicles anyone?). Here, the opening episodes gave me everything I wanted and more. Battle scenes are animated gloriously, tactics and strategies are realistic, and even the technology of IRL WW2-era Germany is presented with razor precision. There were even several closeups of Jericho trumpets on JU 87s!By the midpoint though, my ""anime pitfall"" senses were on high alert. It\'s like I could sense that something was going to trash Izetta and make me force myself through some bullshit or other just for more battle scenes. It came about two-thirds of the way through and I completely lost interest. But then I thought, ""well, I might as well read the wiki synopsis to see if the ending is going to suck balls."" I\'m glad I did, for certain. Episodes 9-11 were a total drag to get through, but I can confirm that the ending is satisfactory and happy. It didn\'t disappoint me, although it should have been better.Usually I\'d just admit defeat and abandon ship, but the great setting and meticulous worldbuilding drew me back in.

Izetta is a retelling of World War 2, a “what if” scenario involving a witch who is destined to save the Kingdom of Elystadt from imminent destruction from the evil forces of the Germanian Empire. No, Hitler isn’t involved in this one. What we do have is a gaudy, handsome villain who has hair that would make Jennifer Garner jealous. (He uses Garnier, duh). Izetta’s plot isn’t a “grand” retelling of world war II; if you know anything about history, you’ll know what happens in the end, nor is it really even about magic itself. What it really is...is a love story, one involving the chivalrous princess Fine who cares deeply for her kingdom, and Izetta, a witch girl who uses her powers to assist Fine in her struggle of life and death. I don’t want to go to heavy into spoilers for those of you haven’t seen the show, so I’ll just say that my impressions upon finishing the show were mixed.One of the heavy themes that the show revolves around is self-sacrifice, sacrifice that is for a greater purpose than oneself. We see this through the relationship between Izetta and Fine. Not every fairytale has a happy ending, and what better setting to depict this theme than one of the greatest wars that history has known, a war where millions upon millions of citizens and soldiers met an unfortunate demise? I think the show does a good job of presenting this idea, yet there a few problems that prevent this show from being truly memorable.One of these revolves around the characters. I understand that, in a 12-episode series, not every character will have the same amount of time to adequately developed. Yet, some of the characters are terribly one-dimensional, the villains in particular. Otto, the german Kaiser, is undeniably a megalomaniac, yet we have no introduction to his character, other than that he must be the villain because he has incredibly good-looking hair and talks in a deep, threatening voice. But I think a lot of this one-dimensionality applies to the main cast, as well.  Fine and Izetta, while likeable characters, don’t really evolve from the standard archetypes that they are based from. For example, Izetta willingly ignores her grandma’s purpose for what she believes is a greater purpose than herself. But we don’t really delve into what she thinks about it morally. I mean, she’s routing entire battalions of troops on her own, meaning she’s killed hundreds, if not thousands, of soldiers. And she doesn’t give a second glance. War’s a bloody business, and the show, in quite a few episodes, does a great job of presenting this, particularly through Jonas. And Izetta doesn’t really seem to give it a second thought.Now I realize that this may sound silly to a lot of people. So why am I bringing this up? It’s because Izetta and Fine don’t really undergo any sort of major progressions as characters throughout the series. We get an insightful look at the love that blossoms between them, sure, but the lack of change in their characters leads to a one-dimensionality that takes away deeply from any interested that I may have personally invested in them. It’s unfortunate, because I really do think that Izetta: The Last Witch has an has an interesting concept, and the relationship between Izetta and Fine that is the primary focus of the series is quite charming, but I can’t help but feel that this series had a bit more latent potential. is a love story, one involving the chivalrous princess Fine who cares deeply for her kingdom, and Izetta, a witch girl who uses her powers to assist Fine in her struggle of life and death.

The concept of bringing a witch into a ww2 setting and making her curbstomp Nazis was satisfying for the first few episodes. And then we watch complacency set in as the good guys make blunder after blunder,(sometimes with fanservice, sometimes without) episode after episode, while the Nazis get closer and closer to finding a final solution for eliminating the witch.Characters - 1The good guys have the witch, and she's wiping out Nazis just as easily as moving her fingers.

They also give the Nazis an ultimate genius who manages to decipher the weakness just by watching her fight for 5 minutes.There's an Oberstein-lite helping out the good guys, but he's the only guy smart enough to cover all his bases, and even his most valiant efforts are hampered by incompetent subordinates and colleagues.

The continent seemed doomed, crushed beneath the might of an evil Central European power bent on world domination. This sounds familiar, no? If you think I\'m talking about the Second World War, I\'m not. This is how ""Izetta: The Last Witch"" begins.Coming from Ajia-Do, a company most famous for ""Vampire Hunter D"", this 12-episode series gives us a look at a similar scenario to that of World War II, but only loosely so. The names of the countries have been changed. Germany is now Germania, England now Brittania (Code Geass not affiliated), America is...Atlanta (?)... you get the idea. The weapons and technology of time are about the same. Germania has a bunch of tanks and planes and the rest of the continent is stuck 20 years in the past, but this is where history takes a turn- the country of Elystadt (imagine if the skinny part of Austria to the West was it\'s own country) gets invaded but luckily, the leader of the nation (basically a Princess) has a BFF who is a witch. This witch takes flight on an anti-tank rifle instead of a broom and proceeds to defend her country against the invading Nazi- I mean, ""Germanian"" hordes. Oh, yeah- this is the meat of the show.I absolutely loved the battle scenes in this show. The artwork is good from top-to-bottom, and the horrors of war are treated with a good amount of realism, but watching panzers get flipped over like turtles from the magic of a witch is fantastic. Magic-guided blunt instruments of yesteryear getting put through planes never gets old. But, these are the high points of a show that had a lot of potential and was cut far too short. Like an athlete cut down in their prime, we see a glimmer of what could have been, and then <POOF> it\'s over.The show did a fine job of not only giving me entertaining battles and \'splosion porn, but creating some mythos that caught my curiosity, all while creating many characters that were developed well to start off with, but just as the show hits it\'s stride it abruptly ends! This show should have been easily twice the length it is and honestly left me frustrated. Maybe if it had the backing of a bigger studio it would have been longer, but I digress. The quick finale ruined the show for me.The Sub vs. Dub battle goes to the Sub for me, but frankly given the setting of the show, I feel I would have most enjoyed a German dub, much like I had hoped for with ""Attack on Titan"" and I eventually got. This show really got my hopes up. This was not from a light novel, manga, or video game, this was an original piece... sort of. It took place in a genre I love, created a story with characters I could get behind, and then it was over... quicker than Fruit Stripe gum. But, putting aside my feelings on the rushed ending, I enjoyed enough of the show to recommend a watch for anyone looking for an interesting spin on magical girls or World War II. 6/10. Check it out.

I would say by watching the first eleven episodes and then make up your own ending because damn did the last episode leave me frustrated.Spoiler ahead: So what left me so frustrated about the last episode? It has to do with the fact how they handled the ending of the war and how they wiped out magic which if you ask me was the biggest reason i started watching this show so when they take it away you get pretty frustrated.The last reason has to do with how they handled Izetta through the entire...show with no real ch development which was fine until they fucked her up in the last minute of the show.Overall score 6/10 if only the eleven first episodes the 8/10 show with no real ch development which was fine until they fucked her up in the last minute of the show.Overall score 6/10 if only the eleven first episodes the 8/10', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Most anime have an English-translated title. Makes it easier for an American like me to better understand an anime and what it will potentially be about from the get-go.Shuumatsu no Izetta’s English title is Izetta: The Last Witch. More than likely, this review will be the last time I ever think about – let alone write about – this show.STORYAs the Germanian Empire threatens to encroach its neighboring lands, Ortfiné Fredericka von Eylstadt (or Finé as she will be called from here on out), a princess of the peaceful kingdom of Eylstadt, seeks to stop...their terrible onslaught. In her charge, she is abducted. But, fortunately for her, her childhood friend Izetta, who also happens to be a magic-using witch, saves her from her predicament. From there, Izetta (the anime) starts its climb.Izetta, Die Letzte HexeAnd its early climbing is promising thanks to a solid start. The prospect of feuding countries and the politics therein. Mixing the magical elements with realistic warfare. A caring relationship between witch and princess. It was all ready, constructed as a tower that the anime scaled, reached the top, and stood upon. Leaping forth to reach some metaphorical strong footing.But it never made it, falling far and hard and without grace.The show’s grand level of incompetent writing beyond the first four episodes causes it to slip multiple times during its running start. For whatever reason, the anime sees fit to include an alarming number of contrived events that prevent the narrative from maintaining sound structure. A secret conversation held out in the open. Murdering a soldier in a forest. An old man working for Germania. The second half of the red stone plot device conveniently appears.Often, these scenes occur with an odd amount of isolation. Almost as if the anime formed its plot without care and was practically forced to make certain events happen in such nonsensical ways.The best, most bizarre example is at the ballroom dance. Izetta and Finé separate themselves from the festivities, only to have Berckmann bring the doll-like corpse of the evil witch Sophie with him so that she could steal some of Izetta’s blood with a forceful kiss. It’s unnecessarily contrived and random, and it doesn’t help that the others don’t seem to make a fuss afterwards about what was clearly an insane happening.That scene also demonstrates one of the other extreme shortcomings of Izetta: sexual content. The anime constantlyseems to think that it needs an ecchi scene here or there to help parachute its story. In reality, these scenes puncture the seriousness the setting and situation strive for, making it easier for the anime to reach terminal velocity.Again, some examples work better than others. For instance, in episode six, the ladies of the estate try to fit Izetta into one of Finé’s gowns (and one can probably already guess where this scene is going). Izetta doesn’t fit into it because of her large breasts, so Finé, fraught with envy, looks around at the huge chests of the other women. And she speaks the following line: “Is there really a way for a small, poor country to win against the overwhelming size of an empire?”That’s right. She uses her boobs to make a metaphor about the literal war they are currently fighting.There are more scenes, too. Elvira fondles Izetta’s breasts to “understand” her measurements. Ricelt barges in on a naked Bianca in the tiring I-heard-you-screaming-so-I’ll-open-this-door-without-knocking-or-asking-first cliché. Sophie’s chains wrap around Izetta, constricting her body in such a way that makes her capture nothing short of an amateur BDSM skit.Disregarding even the contrivances and this ecchiness, Izetta continues falling. Later episodes in the season feature major time skips that compound the aimlessness of events. Months fly by, the anime glossing over large parts of the war and different aftermaths. Even its delivery, done through narration by Finé’s maid Lotte, fails at being a natural progression. Her words are less an explanation of what has happened during these skips and more like the creators giving a lame excuse as to why entire sections of the show were skipped.It also has a few attempts at side plots that ultimately miss their emotional cues.Bianca shoots Ricelt, but the scene doesn’t have the weight it should since they only knew one another for a couple of days at best.Basler, the only pilot to survive Izetta’s attacks while she escaped with Finé at the beginning of the season, gets brought onto the investigation into Izetta by Berckmann. Basler is even put onto the secret sector of the Germanian Empire with a shiny new plane to boot. But he loses again during the defense of their carrier ship, he fails to kill Berckmann, and he presumably perishes in anticlimactic fashion.Sophie emerges as a real threat to Izetta and the world at large. Unfortunately, her backstory is delivered almost always as a set of still frames that do not convey much information. As such, she and others are forced to go on long, ranting expositions that impede whatever emotions are shown.To give Izetta some credit here, it at least avoids the common betray-the-helper trap. When the kingdom of Eylstadt starts to lose, they don’t blame Izetta for introducing magic. Rather, they risk their lives to save the woman who has already saved them previously.Sieghart’s death also demonstrates some awareness on the show’s part. He hesitates to kill an enemy soldier when said soldier reminds him of the young man he permanently silenced in the woods with a gunshot to the head. His hesitancy earns him an equally fatal demise.Its history-based narrative helps, too. Some of the factions. The importance placed on propaganda. Summits involving the reveal of nuclear warfare. The elimination of magic from the world through Izetta’s final act. Much of this content blends well enough with the otherworldly elements of the anime, preventing future unfairness and aligning itself further with its semi-historical context.Yet these updrafts quickly turn into doldrums when the audience realizes that that “final” act wasn’t final. For, as is shown, the anime doesn’t even have the guts to kill off Izetta when she clearly died. The show even pretended to allude to her passing in the epilogue. Which, by the way, also has a time skip right near the end just to make Izetta’s recovery more plausible.And no, no amount of full-circle narrative creation with Finé walking through the woods to meet Izetta, just as she did as a kid, can save whatever this mess ultimately became when it finally hit the ground.ANIMATIONIzetta doesn’t have too much to harp on or too much to praise when it comes to its visuals.Most of Izetta’s (the witch’s) sequences are filled with a lot of movement. Flying on her makeshift “broom,” controlling her lances, and using her magics demonstrate as such. She zips about the battlefield, flipping over entire tanks and literally throwing half of the (broken) Eiffel Tower.The show tries at times for more cinematic flair, like when Izetta and Finé’s images reflect off a lantern or when the lights of heaven shine down behind Izetta as she summons forth the “gnomes” of the mountain. But an odd shot composition during Izetta and Finé’s last flight together as well as a horribly drawn hand of Finé’s in episode six that somehow got past production offset its flair.The character designs are slightly better off. Finé’s slender figure, golden hair, and purple eyes give her a regal look with ease. And Izetta’s ample assets, red hair, and just-as-red eyes draw the attention of everyone in their world just as much as her magics do.Looking further into Izetta’s penchant for red, her color choices complement Finé’s quite well, coinciding with the strong bond they share. Finé often wears green, Izetta obviously red, and, on more than one occasion, they both choose white. Together, it almost gives off a Christmas-y vibe. A sense of merriment and good tidings that matches the words and love they constantly gift each other.Unfortunately, the gear the Eylstadt soldiers wear is shockingly bland thanks to a dominating light-blue color choice. But some of the other designs have their place. Berckmann’s shaggy hair, round spectacles, and dark-purple overcoat turn him into one shady investigator. And Bianca’s decorated attire and short, black hair give an attractive, studious look.Lastly, Izetta doesn’t have the most enthralling set pieces, and it relies a bit too much on the CG route during a few of its battles. Again, nothing ever stands out as gross or problematic. Double again, nothing ever stands out as interesting or involved either. Altogether, the visuals are what they need to be for the anime and not much else.(As one final side note, the anime cannot even stop itself from including sexual content in the visuals for its OP. Therein, a twirling, naked Izetta fills the screen roughly halfway through when it was simply not needed.)CHARACTERSMuch of Izetta’s character focus centers on Izetta, Finé, and the close connection they share.Izetta and Finé have known each other since childhood. Finé once walked upon Izetta using her magic in a wooded area, and, from then on, they remained fast friends. But it wasn’t before long that nearby villagers grew wary Izetta’s nomad status. To the point that they attacked her – possibly with the intent to kill.Finé would have none of that, though. She protected Izetta, throwing herself between the angry mob and the scared, docile witch. Finé earned a scar that day, a symbol of the love she holds for her dearest friend in the world. And, from that moment on, Izetta dedicated herself to the future queen, vowing to fight for and help her in all that she does.They don’t stay together during their early teenage years. Izetta traveled with her grandmother to train her magics, and Finé headed home to mature into the country’s next leader. But, when they reunite on their escape from Germanian aviation, Izetta begins to repay Finé, saving her and her men from early deaths on more than one occasion.Their relationship is not based on where they come from but rather who they are as people. Izetta doesn’t care about Finé’s rank. Instead, Izetta only sees her as the kind, caring girl who was there for her when nobody else was. In similar fashion, Finé doesn’t care that Izetta is a witch. Instead, Finé only sees her as the thoughtful, wonderful girl who holds tremendously special powers.Throughout the season, both Izetta and Finé demonstrate resolve but in different forms. Izetta puts everything on the line, breaking her sacred taboo (of not using her powers) and risking her life (to help Finé). In turn, Finé relies on Izetta, acting as the ruler she must be by putting her country and her people before her best friend.While they do not face any conflict between each other (e.g., a falling out, sparring ideologies), they do encounter personal strife. Izetta at one point fails, forcing her to use the power stone that, unlike everything else thus far, will definitely kill her. And Finé, having pushed Izetta to the brink, sees error in her judgement as well as her own inability to do much in her position except run during danger.Otherwise, Izetta and Finé support one another as best they can. Not in a political or warring sense but rather in an understanding sense. Multiple times throughout the season, the two share conversations and moments, sometimes of an intimate nature, that reinforce the relationship they hold together. Izetta looks after Finé as she recovers from their daring escape. They talk within the secret witch’s cavern about what Izetta wants Finé to do. Their final talk as they fly beneath a starry nighttime sky and through a tranquil forest.Izetta and Finé are by no means stellar characters, but, given how the plot plays out and simply comparing them to the rest of the cast, they are one of the stronger parts of the anime.Speaking of the other characters, they are on the lower end of the execution line.Perhaps the worst among them are the so-called villains from the Germanian Empire. Chief of that country and chief of the worst, Otto does almost nothing besides wear a fancy outfit, sit on his throne, and stand outside for a bit. He has a blind advisor that provides small snippets of wisdom, and he has a keen interest in the occult. But, given how he has no significant scenes and thus zero impact, it’s tough to call him a relevant character let alone a prominent antagonist. Made even tougher by his lame, off-camera death.Berckmann is marginally better but still unimpressive. He acts as an investigator, following leads and organizing information for the Germanian Empire. While he evidently does a lot more than Otto, he still carries an air of worthlessness about him. He shows up where he needs to, and he knows how to play the game, but his involvement for the first three-fourths of the season doesn’t extend beyond being the guy who is smart and can get the job done.His defection does add a twist to the path he had taken up to that point, but his explanation that he only looks out for himself does not stick all that well when his switched loyalty comes off more like an easy out to get Finé and crew inside enemy territory.Sophie is the last of the true villains in Izetta, and, arguably, she’s the best of the three if only because she has a stronger motive and because she actually does something tangible. Alive once more thanks to scientific advancements within the Germanian Empire, Sophie seeks nothing less than revenge against Eylstadt, the kingdom that betrayed her unfairly and unjustly, leading to her unfortunate death.Unfortunately, like the other villains, her character has a problem. Namely, she arrives far too late into the season (officially appearing in episode nine). While Germania’s secret laboratories and otherworldly work were hinted at, as was the legend of the original White Witch, Sophie doesn’t have enough time to stand as anything else besides the only “realistic” obstacle that could thwart Izetta.Interestingly (and perhaps surprisingly), these villains, alongside Izetta and Finé, manage to explore a relevant theme to the anime. A theme on benefitting one’s self or the goal at large.The best example comes from the parallel held between Sophie and Izetta. It’s hastily put together, meaning it’s not the smoothest connection possible, but Sophie’s relationship with her king mirrors that of Izetta and Finé’s. In both cases, they would do or are doing everything for the other, but, in the end, the one of royal descent must suffer through sacrificing their beloved witch for the greater good.That’s something Finé struggles with constantly. Whether it’s right to put her best friend through torment and pain to save her country. For, while it’s easy from an outside perspective to choose to help the many over the few – and in this case just one – making that decision when someone more than dear is on the line is almost impossible.And that’s where Izetta and Sophie differ. Where Izetta greets death (but not really) with a smile because she believed in Finé and the greater good, Sophie devolved into nothing but a big ball of hatred who cared neither about herself nor anybody else. Granted, she was betrayed by her partner, and she was subsequently burned alive, so it does make sense why she would be so mad. But her inability to understand what her king suffered through highlights her stance well enough.Even Otto and Berckmann, for all their troubles as antagonists, follow this theme in their own way. Berckmann cares not for the many; he cares only for himself. Ricelt’s death doesn’t faze him, betraying his country didn’t concern him, and contacting the CIA was a no-brainer. As for Otto, he is similarly selfish, but he still fights for his own empire’s greater good. He does so evilly, but it still counts.Sadly, many of the other characters do not receive much attention. Elvira, the fashion lady, is mostly there for ecchi purposes. Jonas, the soldier that Sieghart murders, just has his family photo. Elliot, Otto’s blind advisor, has wisdom to share, but he just stands around the whole time.However, considering that this tale is that of Izetta and Finé’s, giving these women the attention over the side characters is a smart move. One of the only ones in the whole anime at that.SOUNDIzetta backs itself with a surprisingly strong original soundtrack that mixes the magical with the orchestral. Female choirs chant, preceding the falling, rising violins and whimsical harp playing, to achieve fantasy. Blaring trumpets and fierce, heavy drums signal threats and danger on the horizon. The OST even throws in a circus-like tune that accompanies the rarer lighthearted moments. A fitting piece given some of the unbelievable happenings that go on during the show’s era.The opening track for the anime perhaps leans too much on the rock front, providing something very loud and very fierce. Almost to the point that it doesn’t quite fit the tone of the show itself. Still, the vocal harmonies, the hard guitar riff with drum fills in the middle, and the dropped music in the beginning and the unknowing flourish at the end give the OP a noticeable amount of flair.In comparison, the ending track goes the complete opposite direction tonally (which sometimes happens with OP-ED pairs). Strangely enough, it also goes too hard tonally. That is, Izetta was never the dramatic doomsday show that the piece seems to argue. Nevertheless, it’s a rather solid track. The slow, deliberate piano. A couple of English lyrics. Thundering drums. The ED is beyond gloomy in all the right ways.As for the voice acting, it sees no notable performances save for Himika Akaneya as Izetta. While the kindhearted witch didn’t deliver emotion or dialogue to any grand level, this role marks one of her first major ones in the business, and so she deserves at least some recognition.ENJOYMENTWhile action-oriented anime are not my go-to choices, a few of the battles were still interesting to me. Izetta’s escape with Finé showed off some blood magic, and her first official fight at Coenenberg had her controlling swords, flipping tanks, and shooting her rifle. It’s a shame, then, that her magic didn’t evolve much (if at all) the further along the season progressed. The scenarios certainly did – taking down a carrier ship, squaring off against another witch – but it was essentially more of the same.And I’m all for ecchi content – so long as it has a time and a place. But a quick shot of Izetta’s butt or her getting stripped naked for a bath doesn’t really need to be in this show where seriousness, magic, and historical influences reign.As for Izetta and Finé themselves, they were cute and fun when the situation allowed it. But they weren’t anyone special to me. It didn’t help that their relationship wasn’t as quirky as I would have liked it. But they at least had some implied yuri feelings.If I had to pick my two favorite parts from the show, they would be a non-character and a couple of words. First, Finé’s puppy named Dorothée. Her jumping in the water and sneezing made me smile. Second, the fact that they called the U.S.A. the “United States of Atlanta.” An unintentionally hilarious name that bumps up the show ever-so-slightly in my eyes.Shuumatsu no Izetta fails to take advantage of its solid start, causing it to fall and hit the ground in a not-so-pretty manner. Its story devolves into a mess, its villains are unimpressive, and its content simply lacks entertainment. Its English translation should really be Izetta: Doesn’t Last.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, while the initial episodes establish a tower for the narrative to properly leap from, contrived events, unnecessary sexual content, time skips, poorly handled subplots, and a lame ending prevent it from reaching strong footing and instead plummet it towards something unacceptableAnimation: Fine, while the visuals are neither strong nor weak, Izetta’s battles showcase a lot of movement, and her and Finé’s designs are nicely complementaryCharacters: Fine, Izetta and Finé share a close bond, a theme on selfishness versus the greater good exists, but the villains are horrendousSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, good OST, and okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, “The United States of Atlanta” was the best partFinal Score: 3/10 their terrible onslaught. In her charge, she is abducted. But, fortunately for her, her childhood friend Izetta, who also happens to be a magic-using witch, saves her from her predicament. From there, Izetta (the anime) starts its climb.Izetta, Die Letzte HexeAnd its early climbing is promising thanks to a solid start. The prospect of feuding countries and the politics therein. Mixing the magical elements with realistic warfare. A caring relationship between witch and princess. It was all ready, constructed as a tower that the anime scaled, reached the top, and stood upon. Leaping forth to reach some metaphorical strong footing.But it never made it, falling far and hard and without grace.The show’s grand level of incompetent writing beyond the first four episodes causes it to slip multiple times during its running start. For whatever reason, the anime sees fit to include an alarming number of contrived events that prevent the narrative from maintaining sound structure. A secret conversation held out in the open. Murdering a soldier in a forest. An old man working for Germania. The second half of the red stone plot device conveniently appears.Often, these scenes occur with an odd amount of isolation. Almost as if the anime formed its plot without care and was practically forced to make certain events happen in such nonsensical ways.The best, most bizarre example is at the ballroom dance. Izetta and Finé separate themselves from the festivities, only to have Berckmann bring the doll-like corpse of the evil witch Sophie with him so that she could steal some of Izetta’s blood with a forceful kiss. It’s unnecessarily contrived and random, and it doesn’t help that the others don’t seem to make a fuss afterwards about what was clearly an insane happening.That scene also demonstrates one of the other extreme shortcomings of Izetta: sexual content. The anime constantlyseems to think that it needs an ecchi scene here or there to help parachute its story. In reality, these scenes puncture the seriousness the setting and situation strive for, making it easier for the anime to reach terminal velocity.Again, some examples work better than others. For instance, in episode six, the ladies of the estate try to fit Izetta into one of Finé’s gowns (and one can probably already guess where this scene is going). Izetta doesn’t fit into it because of her large breasts, so Finé, fraught with envy, looks around at the huge chests of the other women. And she speaks the following line: “Is there really a way for a small, poor country to win against the overwhelming size of an empire?”That’s right. She uses her boobs to make a metaphor about the literal war they are currently fighting.There are more scenes, too. Elvira fondles Izetta’s breasts to “understand” her measurements. Ricelt barges in on a naked Bianca in the tiring I-heard-you-screaming-so-I’ll-open-this-door-without-knocking-or-asking-first cliché. Sophie’s chains wrap around Izetta, constricting her body in such a way that makes her capture nothing short of an amateur BDSM skit.Disregarding even the contrivances and this ecchiness, Izetta continues falling. Later episodes in the season feature major time skips that compound the aimlessness of events. Months fly by, the anime glossing over large parts of the war and different aftermaths. Even its delivery, done through narration by Finé’s maid Lotte, fails at being a natural progression. Her words are less an explanation of what has happened during these skips and more like the creators giving a lame excuse as to why entire sections of the show were skipped.It also has a few attempts at side plots that ultimately miss their emotional cues.Bianca shoots Ricelt, but the scene doesn’t have the weight it should since they only knew one another for a couple of days at best.Basler, the only pilot to survive Izetta’s attacks while she escaped with Finé at the beginning of the season, gets brought onto the investigation into Izetta by Berckmann. Basler is even put onto the secret sector of the Germanian Empire with a shiny new plane to boot. But he loses again during the defense of their carrier ship, he fails to kill Berckmann, and he presumably perishes in anticlimactic fashion.Sophie emerges as a real threat to Izetta and the world at large. Unfortunately, her backstory is delivered almost always as a set of still frames that do not convey much information. As such, she and others are forced to go on long, ranting expositions that impede whatever emotions are shown.To give Izetta some credit here, it at least avoids the common betray-the-helper trap. When the kingdom of Eylstadt starts to lose, they don’t blame Izetta for introducing magic. Rather, they risk their lives to save the woman who has already saved them previously.Sieghart’s death also demonstrates some awareness on the show’s part. He hesitates to kill an enemy soldier when said soldier reminds him of the young man he permanently silenced in the woods with a gunshot to the head. His hesitancy earns him an equally fatal demise.Its history-based narrative helps, too. Some of the factions. The importance placed on propaganda. Summits involving the reveal of nuclear warfare.

Done deal! The last part, that could be the game-changing...change, simply took a subpar...role for our cute girls to tell the story.--Art--The art could get two ratings: the battles should get an 8, as they are really well drawn (or CG\'ed, sometimes), but not outstanding. The static scenes, where characters simply stand and talk, should be a 4. Sometimes their dialogues was done with their mouths shut, which is an accomplishment by itself, but not yet acceptable in our current animations. Everything else but these two are pretty fair, thus the 6.--Sound--The anime sounds are good. We are talking about full-scale war with magic. Swords swinging around, explosions, cries and shouts, machiney working, tanks, boats, fighters, everything is well done. It felt to me that the timing between animation and sound was a bit unstable, but I don\'t know who to blame. A memorable commendation for VA Hayami Saori, who did a really good job as Finé. Her speeches were really well done.--Characters--It is nice to see Izetta and Finé relationship throughout the show. They really grow as characters, and their friendship is really beautiful. Everyone else is simply weird, their motivations are unclear, and they lack development over the show. Besides, we see in this anime another horrid example of ""victor\'s story"": I simply don\'t know why they make Germanians ruthless monsters that eats children (well...they didin\'t eat them this time), while the Allied Forces are Hope and Peace saviors. I\'ll live through the day when normal people will stand at both sides of the war.--Enjoyment--Sometimes I wondered why I kept watching this show. I had to make a big effort to go forward and look for the next episode. Maybe because I love fantasy, but I can\'t recommend this to anyone but those I dislike.--Overall--Bad fantasy. Clichéed story, unbalanced art, bad character development and alas, clichéed characters everywhere. But the protagonists were fine and the sound was enjoyable. I would say stay away from it, especially if you like the fantasy genre. role for our cute girls to tell the story.--Art--The art could get two ratings: the battles should get an 8, as they are really well drawn (or CG\'ed, sometimes), but not outstanding.

I came into this with no knowledge that this show even existed, but lo and behold, it was better than I expected.First off, the animation in general was better than many shows that don\'t get a lot of attention and while it didn\'t have much sakuga specifically (especially during fight scenes), it was very fluid and well done when they weren\'t using 3D (even that was done well sometimes!). Along with that, this was a pretty general WWII story with a superhero a la Captain America, but this time, it\'s a witch!While the main story wasn\'t that profound or new,...the interactions between the characters is what really gave the show its wings. While not new or anything, it brought up a bunch of interesting lines that intertwined and a lot of people going against what many would consider ""the right idea"", but this gave the characters more depth than those in generic, run-of-the-mill WWII stories. The main problem with the story was probably the end. While it definitely ended, it did that in a very messy way, leaving a bunch of loose ends and ""where are they now"" types of situations.However, the most detracting part of the experience was the numerous ecchi scenes. While I sadly expect it, nowadays, in shows that predominately feature female leads, it just got to the point that they were trying to fill time instead of actually providing interesting story parts and thus, worsened the show. Multiple times, I felt bad that I was even watching while these were happening and brought me out of the experience of the world and into the uncomfortable idea of ""I\'m watching this and there\'s nothing I can do about it"" which is one of the worst feelings that I\'ve had.While there are some fun and entertaining parts of the show, there are also some that are the exact opposite and can only recommend this to those who genuinely want to enjoy a WWII story regardless of the quality. the interactions between the characters is what really gave the show its wings.

I can just say it wasn't entirely generic but i don't dig it either, all animes that have war and nobility always go for the same music type, but i understand this show had to be serious to some regard so they couldn't pull a A Knight's Tale in the sound track putting queen in a knights fight lol.Now regarding characters even with the Mery Su witch which is kind of expected giving the fact we are putting magic in the fucking XX century what the fuck are you expecting to happen and the other main protagonist is the equivalent of Peta as the protagonist but everyone respect her in this world was really an enjoyable experience, and regarding the Izetta attitude towards the princess it makes sense actually, it was the first friend she had, the first person who didn’t want to kill her like her, she is not like the people her grandma told people where like, basically something similar to this story is in Somali on the library episode that is kind of similar and this was something that has been persistently told to us the spectator several times from start to finish, even tho their relation feels forced in some way and toxic but justified to be toxic regarding how Fine is just someone who thinks a lot about the people and wants to help em but at the same time fucks em up (that is why she is personified Peta with all the animals they rescue ending up dying but without the moral bait and not that much amount of bullshit), making them lose their lives for her stupid head like the 2 guys at the start do, mmm yes let’s take a public train to other city, for sure the country that wants to take our land is not going to hunt us down there, she addresses her stupid attitude towards Izetta near the end when she apologizes to Izetta for literally using her carelessly to a point she couldn’t fucking walk because she didn’t doubt, she didn’t think Germany was about to up their game because of how imprudent she is. The other characters that are not the main 2 where really entertaining though, and actually interesting to watch.Some things don't get enough time to be developed, by that i mean 2 or 3 that aren't really that major but quite stupid.After saying all the bad that I can point out easily that bugged me the most I still think this show is well above average though, it has a interesting plot, ,it got me invested enough to watch it in one go with almost no pauses from my part, even with a really flawed protagonist who has a noble cause and says a lot of things but fuck the lives of others and is unable to make the tuff decisions unless it regards Izetta. The direction was actually great, they did foreshadowing for everything, they didn't pull a Steven Universe with the story but they hinted everything, and that everything paid off, the shadow that represents Jonas’s fate (I felt my man, he survived more than one fight and died anyways and not even in combat but to get some loose ends off the game) and even how this affected someone later on, the mysterious book and a bag that Sieg had that ended up getting explained in the previous episode, i know there is some stupid shit here but the show has more good than bad in my eyes, it’s easier to point out why you dislike something than why you like it, but my overall experience was good, and it felt good to watch. Also a thing to point out, the “boring episodes” or build up episodes are actually more than welcome here, they make everything feel worse in a good way, the way characters just die in one shot, not heroic death not nothing, the thing that shocked me first was well, Jonas death, the episode was calm and then this scene came and it was shocking, alongside other scenes, the calmer parts help to contrast the conflict, shows how bad this is to live in, honestly when the guy I from Germany said “so this people are my enemies” talking about the friendly neighbors that felt heavy for me, this isn't a call of duty multiplayer but rather something that actually feels more believable seeing war thru soldiers at some points, even if its dramatized and with some unrealistic attitudes and little things like that. evasive at the beginning than at the end, and yea I know that shots from a camera 10m or just 5m away can look scuffed even more near the end and the background people don’t look good, but the battles shine and some other parts too animation wise, its not something I’ve seen in a lot of recent anime that I watched.Regarding sound, the sound got the job kinda done, it wasn't good, the whole sound effects part felt like they turned every gun sound effect down removing part of the impact of a bullet being shoot which i think is not a good thing, and the music felt like it had some personality to make it feel different to other shows but at the end of the day is orchestra and that is something that is literally everywhere in anime has, is not the same to have FF7 with orchestra music compared to something from now days because FF7 was the first (i think lol, at least the first i got to experience).

It's an Anime that shows no signs of getting another season, there's no source material, so the fact that ends well and doesn't leave you hanging is absolutely the most important thing. You may not share anyone else's opinion of the content but nobody likes to be left hanging. This one ends and it wraps things up.Taking the easy parts, art and sound. Art was solid The character designs never left you wondering who was who. There are various forms mixed, including attempts at a medieval  all of which are pulled off well.I caught the English dub of...the anime and I have to say I had some problems with the voice acting. The main characters were a little grating and flat. The rest of the cast were good to better than good. The music was good. So overall give it an average.Now for the fun stuff, the world the story line and the characters. It's one of those not quite right 20th century worlds. Europe is kind of right, the U.S. is a bit different, Japan isn't participating in WWII. If you saw Tanya the Evil you pretty much have the politics of the world. I found this to be something of a curious choice as there was no need for it.As far as the characters went,I had trouble buying the Princess as the ruler of a country. This anime wasn't about growth of characters, but for the most part what you had was consistent characterization, and their actions were in alignment with their motivations. As I mentioned earlier, the voice acting could have conveyed emotional tone better.The story was at it's best for the first 8 episodes.  It really had a nice take on what would it be like to have a super weapon that was a human being. There's no trouble believing how they use her, or how the enemy reacts. Until that pesky 9th episode where it all goes to crap. (there's actually some foundation laid earlier but it's small stuff). At this point they just start pulling stuff out of their rear ends. Some of it follows the idea of Chekov's gun, the rest comes from nowhere. It's an unsatisfactory combination, that could of been fixed if they put a little more work into the script. There was no need for superscience that had no place in the world, and the rest could have been revealed in many ways. Matter of fact I got the feeling in an earlier revision of the script but ran out of time, got over ruled or just didn't like the way it fit in. Either way it needed to be there before not after.After the the pulling of plot elements out of the air starts it doesn't stop. You get more stuff pulled out of thin air and more and more until the Anime ends. the anime and I have to say I had some problems with the voice acting.

The big bad enemy nation always knows everything; They always have a spy conveniently placed exactly where they need him to be and they always have the upper hand. They have the ability to find witches without no one else even realizing such a thing exists in the world and if that wasn\'t convenient enough they can also clone witches and even have the technology to use the witches\'s...magic as fuel for their machines and bombs.It\'s all pointless though, because even with such an advantage over the rest of the world they decide to get into a dumb feud with some small country just to prove some silly point and end up being defeated and ridiculed because the plot wouldn\'t have it any other way. They\'re basically Team Rocket.Don\'t get me wrong, i\'m a big fan of good guys winning in the end but it just doesn\'t make sense in this one. The whole thing feels artificial and convenient. The bad guys have the upper hand during the whole thing and then the plot just decides that it\'s time to wrap it up so they magically and miraculously have the good guys win and to make things even worse, apparently they thought that by having a ""sad"" ending people wouldn\'t notice how poor the whole thing was.

Personally, I think its main flaw is that is too short, but it pulls off what most 12 episode anime good or bad can never seem to get right. A solid and decisive ending. If you watch from start to end the show does a great job of immersing you into the show and setting.

I\'m a huge WW2 buff, and this seemed like a unique setting, with an interesting take on the war. And as I was watching the early episodes, the setting, and the concept certainly was holding my attention. Unfortunately, as the series progressed, the weight of this series\' tropes began to set in, and it ultimately caused it to buckle.  So let\'s deconstruct it some.Let\'s start with one of the good things: the animation.  This is top notch animation, particularly in the color department, and during the action scenes, the...animation is really allowed to shine.  Speaking of which, the action is thoroughly original, and they take every advantage they can with it.  The first scene where we see Izetta go all out is easily one of the best in the series, with her usage of medieval weapons to take down tanks and planes.  It actually might be some of the most creative action I\'ve seen in a while in any anime.Art: 9/10That all said, the series is still held back back by a story that\'s thoroughly predictable, and rather one-dimensional leads. Now I\'m often the first person to defend cliches in a series, if the series is willing to have fun with the cliches, or makes up for it with an entertaining tone. I honestly can barely remember any of the characters; the only trait I can remember about the Archduchess is that she\'s the royal idealist, whose idealism is the only spark of light in this cruel world, asking why we can\'t all just get along (not to mention I can barely even remember her name). The only trait I can really remember from Izetta is that she loves the princess, and the country, and that\'s it; sometimes she can even straddle the Mary Sue line ever so slightly.  The rest of the good guys can be cleanly sorted into the roles, like the young, optimistic maid, the stern, young bodyguard, the grizzled old general, the pragmatic agent guy, the eccentric foreign woman, the evil foreign scientist, and the evil emperor.  Really, I remember very little from any of them.Character: 5/10At first I really liked the setting, but the story ultimately failed to take advantage of any of this. The good country is the completely good country, and the bad country is the Always Chaotic Evil country, with MAYBE a Token Good Teammate or two, who you can kill and watch be killed without guilt.  It seemed like there were attempts, or at least desires, to try and show the complexity of both sides, but whenever they\'re brought up, they are promptly put to the side for the love plot between the Archduchess and Izetta.  While I suppose its not bad, per se, it more or less amounts to Izetta flying our heroine around on her magic gun (a phrase I never thought I\'d ever type), and the two sitting in the moonlight together, talking about peace and war.  I wouldn\'t mind, but its time that could\'ve been spent on developing some of the other characters, including the villains, who are often sidelined.  I try fault this more to the series\' length, but I have seen anime with similar lengths get as much done.Story: 5/10In summation, if you don\'t mind the heavy, and thoroughly predictable tropes, then you might enjoy this series enough. Personally, the story was too predictable, and the characters too one dimensional.Overall: 5/10 animation is really allowed to shine.

Or, more specifically during world war II? If finding the answer interests you at all I recommend giving this series a try. (also, if you enjoy yuri undertones, you're in for a treat!)Art: 8The animation was top notch and though I wouldn't consider it Ghibli film level, it reminded me alot of the animation in Ancient Magus Bride. The colors are vibrant and the scenery is beautiful.Story: 7The story isn't very original. It's a copy of World war II set in an alternate world where witches exist. However the way it is portrayed...in my opinion was rather realistic. There is betrayal, espionage and of course the want to monopolize magic to rule the world. If magic did exist we can be certain the natzis would've wanted to use it to their advantage.Though it may not have been the best writing, it still kept me invested and wanting to watch more. Without giving away spoilers or going into too much depth on the interactions between characters; the ones that die and the reasons they do, made perfect sense to me. War is unforgiving and in real life people are still just people who make mistakes.Soundtrack: 7The soundtrack wasn't amazing but it fit well with the series and didn't have any points where I felt the music wasn't matching the scenes. There were even a few scenes toward the end where the music really brought the show to life.Characters: 7The characters were not dislikable and as I stated previously in the story portion, alot of their actions and reasons for doing certain things resonated with me. Why I wasn't able to give the characters an 8 or higher is because I feel there could've been more depth than there was. However, I really enjoyed Seig's character and would've like more of him in the anime. I also enjoyed Bianca and Izetta herself.Enjoyment: 8I had fun watching this series. Every episode had my attention. And in my opinion it even had a good ending, which is a plus for any series I'm watching.Overall: 7.5...but since I can't do decimals I gave it an 8I just liked it! It was fun to watch and had nice art. Plain and simple. in my opinion was rather realistic. There is betrayal, espionage and of course the want to monopolize magic to rule the world. If magic did exist we can be certain the natzis would've wanted to use it to their advantage.Though it may not have been the best writing, it still kept me invested and wanting to watch more. Without giving away spoilers or going into too much depth on the interactions between characters; the ones that die and the reasons they do, made perfect sense to me. War is unforgiving and in real life people are still just people who make mistakes.Soundtrack: 7The soundtrack wasn't amazing but it fit well with the series and didn't have any points where I felt the music wasn't matching the scenes. There were even a few scenes toward the end where the music really brought the show to life.Characters: 7The characters were not dislikable and as I stated previously in the story portion, alot of their actions and reasons for doing certain things resonated with me.

It's a half-baked not-quite-yuri with magic, Nazis, and cool flying sequences. It's absolutely absurd, and they play it off with a straight face.Izetta is a fantasy WW2 setting in which Poland (or Austria?) is protected by a superpowerful witch who rides an anti-tank rifle like a broom-stick and blows up steampunk Nazis for the love of her princess.Pretty to look at, fun to watch, and - if any of this appeals to you - it's just crazy enough to be worth the time. This may not...be one of the greats, but it's a rare (if rough) gem.

An anime belonging to the action genre in which military and historical elements converge, the latter in particular linked to a fictitious Second World War in which the world and the events that make up its history are slightly different from ours. In all this, someone could also say that in its own way there is also an element that, in a slightly...out of the ordinary way, is placed in those that we usually find in works are known under the name of Mahou Shoujo.

But as mentioned, the work will not be characterized much by frenetic moments and fighting to the death, but rather focusing on other fundamental elements in wars, namely propaganda in the first place, but also a little bit on espionage.Izetta is not just a girl with enough power to defeat entire armies on her own, she is a deterrent. A weapon to be used sparingly, and whose weaknesses must be avoided.In this last point in particular, the question of espionage, the importance of obtaining information and the importance of protecting one's information immediately comes into play. Connecting us to this, the work sometimes shows, with a moderate crudeness, but without too much nihilism, dirty and not very honorable actions that some people, spies, politicians or kings, are forced to carry out to protect their own people. The condemnation of the individual, even a cruel fate, for the good of the community. Whether it be right or wrong, is something that is always pleasant to tell.However, the work does not maintain the good premises, and finally lacks a bad management of the rhythm of the narration, the lack of elements that can stimulate the interest of the viewer, moments full of clichés without any kind of intelligent use of the same, but above all a lack of psychological depth of the characters, who are from the beginning to the end of the stereotypical specks that have nothing to offer. In 90% of cases this lack also has an aesthetic impact on the character design.The two protagonists are totally reduced, in the case of Finè, to the classic noblewoman with her country on her shoulders who is ready for anything to protect her people, and courage alone is not enough to give depth to a character.Izetta instead, the only and last bearer of magic, shy but determined, and even if she turns out to be a very strong woman unfortunately whose actions end up being for the character to be perpetually in the shadow of her friend, Finè. Although the attention of the people and her enemies will mainly be directed towards her.Between the 2 there is also a friendship relationship which in reality turns out to be an almost loving relationship in several points, but which in addition to sinning thick will do nothing but give us 2 sweet moments, which in any case turn out to be very muffled. Especially the last one.The secondary characters have the same problem, and the antagonists themselves suffer from it. One of them is clearly a reprise of a well-known German dictator very well known to us, passionate about occultism and aimed at expansionist aims. But he too will not be particularly memorable, limiting himself to appearing a few times and commenting on some events of the war.A secondary antagonist is present later, whose origins and reasons would also be interesting despite the lack of originality, but he will appear little and do just as little.At the end we also find yet another, but always pleasant, condemnation, typical of several Japanese works, of the use of the atomic bomb, which in the context of the work is more or less effectively linked to the fantasy elements that compose it.On the technical side, there is nothing particular to say. On the animation side, above all, I did not start out hoping to find myself in front of an author's work that would exploit the artistic potential of directing to aesthetically enrich the narration. Like most of the anime in this category, on the other hand. And in fact this was not the case, but in this case it is not a defect, only a feature, or a choice if we want.

It has great world-building, overall story, and characters. However, it’s mildly marred by the shallowness of most of the characters.The anime tells the story of an alternate universe Europe in the mid-20th Century where magic and witches (namely, the eponymous Izetta) exist and how they interact with nations on the brink of war. Apart from Izetta, the focus is on a small, landlocked, fictional nation of Elystadt in central Europe, led by Ortfiné Fredericka von Eylstadt (""Finé""), a princess, and who knows Izetta as a childhood...friend.Story: 8While the story isn’t original, it treats the existence of magic in the real world in a realistic way. People are skeptical magic even exists. Word spreads via rumor and through plausible media that existed in 1930s Europe (namely newspapers).In its 12-eposide run, it competently juggles the earth-changing events of world war, along with nation-to-nation negotiation and interpersonal relationships between the characters. Izetta features prominently in the former, largely through her combat prowess (she’s a powerful witch), while Finé focuses on the latter, managing diplomacy and the survival of her nation.Art / Animation: 7It’s above average. Medium and distant shots are sometimes crudely animated (I’m guessing the animation team had time constraints). The fight scenes are OK, but not on par with perhaps Attack on Titan or Fate/Stay Night, examples I would consider superior.There is some CGI, mostly for vehicles like tanks and airplanes. It doesn’t detract from the overall presentation.There’s also a minor bit of fan service (camera angles, outfits, and some scenes), mostly centered on Izetta. While I’m not necessarily hostile to fan service in the right context or the right type of anime, it feels out of place here. The story and world are presented as realistic, plausible, and serious, from which the (gratefully sparse) fan service detracts.Sound / Music: 9The sound is serviceable. Not much stood out as superior or unpalatable.Caveat: I don’t speak Japanese, and what little Japanese I know I learned from anime.The voice actors were great. Izetta sounded appropriately young (and naïve). Finé displayed sufficient range to vocalize her typical default state of a compassionate, thoughtful leader, and also a deeper-toned commanding voice.The music, however, was superior. In particular, the ending (ED) theme Hikaru Aru Basho e by May’n, and Izetta: The Last Minute by Michiru both stood out as amazing. In most cases, I usually skip OP and ED tracks in anime, but I listened to the ED at the end of every episode.Characters: 8This portion of the score is regrettable, because I enjoyed the characters far more than a “mere” 8 would suggest.Most, if not all the characters have clear, articulable motivations. Finé wants to protect her country. Izetta wants to serve her princess. Otto (leader of Germania; a primary antagonist) wants to take over the world. Simple. Maybe too simple.The issue is that most of the characters are shallow (Izetta and Finé included), which is the series’ biggest weakness. Consequently, the series could have benefitted from a “2-cour” (24 episode) run (or even just a 13th episode) to flesh out some of the relationships and portray character growth and interaction, especially of the deuteragonists.In particular, I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Izetta and Finé. However, arrayed against the rest of the plot, there were far too few scenes where we could watch their relationship grow. Scenes with (just) the two together were sparse, and conversation mostly centered on their respective roles to the plot (“Izetta, I can’t make you, but if you destroy that enemy thing, we’ll be able to have peace.”).In this way, it seemed Izetta was more of a tool than a friend or confidant to Finé, although it was repeatedly made clear Finé viewed Izetta as much, much more. Even one “fluff” episode with just the two of them enjoying the other’s company would have been instrumental in demonstrating the depth of their relationship to each other, and not just to a “cause.”A final instance would be illustrating the struggle Finé (presumably) had having to choose between Izetta and her nation, which I imagine would be agonizing or tortuous or worse. There’s a scene that suggests this, but it happens off-screen. We only see the results via a confrontation between herself and Izetta (which had Steins Gate vibes).Enjoyment / Overall: 10While none of the constituent parts alone score a 10 (and I scored it an 8 on MAL), I immensely enjoyed the world, the conflict, and especially Izetta and Finé. Plot moves forward competently, and there is actual danger, in which few characters are safe. The series checks many boxes: action, magic, romance (strongly implied; yuri), military, and drama, in which it largely succeeds. It’s well worth a watch.NoteReaders may notice a disparity between my “Enjoyment” score (10) and my MAL score (8). In fairness, the anime had some flaws, most notably the depth and growth of the characters. Key bits of some inner monologues were missing or unknown to the viewer until the end, and there wasn’t really any foreshadowing. Nevertheless, I’ve re-watched the series repeatedly because of the unique blend of the world, characters, and plot. There aren’t many other anime that have this quality, apart from maybe Railgun or Adachi and Shimamura. friend.Story: 8While the story isn’t original, it treats the existence of magic in the real world in a realistic way.

Here are my thoughts:This has some really cute romantic shoujo-ai scenes.Strong confident female lead, which I always like to see. Girls are so strong and powerful. Girls can do anything!Lots of strong confident girls kicking butt in this. Girls are amazing!The female cast is super likable. Unfortunately there are a lot of dumb males in the cast as well that exist only to advance the plot.""””Expectations blown away. It horrifies me to think that I almost passed on this. Ordinarily I hesitate to watch Japanese bastardizations of European history. If you do watch this then obviously much suspension of disbelief...is required. I mean, it\'s anime. Magic is involved in the story and it takes places in a pseudo-WW2 setting. Way underrated and underappreciated.""””^is what I wrote in my anime notes after watching the first 3 episodes. This anime had a very strong start.Getting further into this anime I\'m beginning to see what is probably its most significant flaw: the plot. Ultimately, the plot is kind of lame. Ordinarily this wouldn\'t be a problem, but the issue is how much screentime is used to advance the plot. The series is very plot-heavy. There are some terrific scenes lurking within, but the overall series is diluted by this lame plot which consists of dumb violent men fighting each other for power. So basically men ruin everything as usual, smh. In all seriousness, I found most of the fighting/conflict-heavy scenes boring to watch. The fight scenes soaked up a lot of valuable screentime.Having said the above, foreshadowing is used effectively and all the developed storylines tie together well in the end. In this regard, the show isn\'t poorly directed. I still cried during the last two episodes when the story climaxed. The wrap-up of all the story arcs was pretty good, even if the journey there was a little messy.This anime is an unusual juxtaposition of genres (military/historical and shoujo-ai), of which a lot of people will like one or the other but less commonly both. I reluctantly gave this a chance knowing only that it was a historical military anime, and I was subsequently pleasantly surprised by the cute yuri romance that evolved as the episodes progressed. However, I think a lot of people who watched this had the opposite reaction, and consequently the anime is rated poorly by many. I guess an appropriate metaphor would be that Shuumatsu no Izetta is like an exotic food with a unique taste that puts most people off. Is that a flaw in the food or in the person tasting it? Maybe the same could be said about my distaste for the plot-heavy nature of the anime.An argument could also be made that the two genres balance each other well. The soft tone of the cute romance provides relief from the seriousness of the military conflict. I\'m not sure I agree with this but maybe this is what the writers were thinking.I think the series is weakest during times when it\'s focused on large-scale conflicts. During times of inaction, or small-scale conflict, there is much greater emphasis on the characters themselves. When the characters and their interactions are allowed to shine, the series is good. I wonder if the characters had been peasants instead of upper caste, would the series have been better due to a diminished scale of conflict?Overall, I rate this anime 7/10.I feel bad about rating this so low because there really were some terrific memorable scenes. Like I said though, it was too heavily diluted. In general, I think that most people would really like some aspects of this anime and strongly dislike others. It is certainly not \'one size fits all,’ but maybe its uniqueness can be appreciated.Additional Comments:Good animation at times but the quality is inconsistent. Character animations like hair and body movement looked pretty good. At times the background landscapes looked nice too.The OST is decent. It\'s high quality from a technical perspective and really suits the series thematically. The OP and ED songs are good. The voice acting is good.Overall the production quality is good, but not spectacular. My number one criticism is that the action scenes were completely unremarkable in terms of audio-visual quality, and this made them more of a chore to watch.I really liked the character designs, especially the female cast. Not only are the character designs great, but they also get lots of different lovely outfits and different pretty hairstyles too! Yay! is required. I mean, it\'s anime.

Not only are the character designs great, but they also get lots of different lovely outfits and different pretty hairstyles too! Yay!', 'The worst aspect of this anime is not that it reached for the stars, but that it did so at the expense of what it could have done best. The concept is so tantalizing, from the ""romance"" between Fine and Izetta to the prospect of witches entering World War 2 to join in the greatest conflict in human history. Immediately one cannot help but feel the fire of desire build for such a prospective story. But whereas it could\'ve honed in on the action, the relationship between the two main characters, the aesthetic of magical girls fighting during World War 2...it instead tries so hard...to make magical girls make sense in the backdrop of 1939 Europe. While this may sound like the obvious route to take in theory, in practice it is the sole reason the anime fails entirely. The story tries its hardest to make the audience believe in the virtues of the characters, while also showing them the blood and death of war. And in the beginning, this actually worked fine when Fine was the main focus of the story. The dialogue and pacing was interesting, and made the audience curious and invested in how the story would play out, and when and how magic would be introduced and used in combat. But shortly after the first episode, the story gradually begins to fall apart by each passing minute. When Izetta was introduced in the story, the first few scenes of her fighting were certainly captivating. But after it had ended, there was very little inspiration to be gained from her. The episodes usually followed a singular mundane format: Izetta pledges her allegiance to Fine, Fine reaffirms her allegiance to her people, and everyone worships Fine and Izetta. Magic was never explored outside of the initial few parts that were introduced during the beginning of the anime, and even up until the final episode, there is nothing to suggest why it exists or how exactly it works in practice. The method in which Izetta is able to use magic makes sense, but virtually regarding the origin or science behind it is ever addressed. Magic then becomes more of a way to progress the story, rather than an interesting element that is constantly being explored throughout the series. Because there was so little information regarding one of the show\'s selling points, the audience are forced to acknowledge the illogical plot points that happen, where characters make the most ridiculous choices that serve only to further the plot out of convenience. In later episodes, macguffins are even used without any hint or warning, making the audience feel as if the writers were creating such things merely to wrap up the episodes. And even after the final conflict, the resolution was so predictable and uninspired that a person cannot help but think they wasted all their time on this pointless show with how uninteresting everything turned out to be. The seemingly only redeeming quality is the close relationship between the two characters Fine and Izetta, but even that aspect is overshadowed by how bad the show tries to tell a World War 2 story where magic\'s only purpose is to be a catalyst for driving the story. To top it all off, the final episode completely fails on leaving the audience with a satisfying farewell from the couple, with not even a hint that the two actually were romantically involved with each other on a sexually intimate level. The yuri bait is so strong in this anime that at times the question occurs whether the writers only used yuri to spite and humiliate those that were initially drawn in because of it exclusively. Overall, there is virtually no real justification to invest in watching this anime, when other anime have paired similar genres to a much greater effect. Overall, the anime is an example of being given a sparkling canvas but using cheap, worn watercolors to paint a dull, forgettable picture. to make magical girls make sense in the backdrop of 1939 Europe. While this may sound like the obvious route to take in theory, in practice it is the sole reason the anime fails entirely. The story tries its hardest to make the audience believe in the virtues of the characters, while also showing them the blood and death of war. And in the beginning, this actually worked fine when Fine was the main focus of the story. The dialogue and pacing was interesting, and made the audience curious and invested in how the story would play out, and when and how magic would be introduced and used in combat. But shortly after the first episode, the story gradually begins to fall apart by each passing minute. When Izetta was introduced in the story, the first few scenes of her fighting were certainly captivating. But after it had ended, there was very little inspiration to be gained from her. The episodes usually followed a singular mundane format: Izetta pledges her allegiance to Fine, Fine reaffirms her allegiance to her people, and everyone worships Fine and Izetta. Magic was never explored outside of the initial few parts that were introduced during the beginning of the anime, and even up until the final episode, there is nothing to suggest why it exists or how exactly it works in practice. The method in which Izetta is able to use magic makes sense, but virtually regarding the origin or science behind it is ever addressed. Magic then becomes more of a way to progress the story, rather than an interesting element that is constantly being explored throughout the series. Because there was so little information regarding one of the show\'s selling points, the audience are forced to acknowledge the illogical plot points that happen, where characters make the most ridiculous choices that serve only to further the plot out of convenience. In later episodes, macguffins are even used without any hint or warning, making the audience feel as if the writers were creating such things merely to wrap up the episodes. And even after the final conflict, the resolution was so predictable and uninspired that a person cannot help but think they wasted all their time on this pointless show with how uninteresting everything turned out to be. The seemingly only redeeming quality is the close relationship between the two characters Fine and Izetta, but even that aspect is overshadowed by how bad the show tries to tell a World War 2 story where magic\'s only purpose is to be a catalyst for driving the story.

If it weren’t for magic then we may not have witnessed the birth of witches, mages, and magical girls in both manga and in anime and their exploits from a grand scale of saving the world from devastation to a grimmer plot of defeating the forces of evil that is bent on world domination and enslaving the human population. Izetta: the last witch is an interesting anime where it combines fantasy set on a...real world in a battle of epic proportions.Set in an alternate World War 2, the story revolves around Izetta, a witch who is caught in the cross fire between the Germanian Empire who is trying to pursuit world conquest and the tiny Alpine state of Eylstadt who is trying to protect their nation from the overwhelming threat. The series had a good strong start with the heart pumping action scenes with the focus on Fińe trying to escape being captured by her enemies and all the while trying to get support from other countries in order to win the war which demonstrates the princess’s strong character and dedication to her people. After a tearful reunion which involves saving Princess Fińe from her captors, Izetta, who is a witch, then took the role of heroine and decided to fight to defend Eylstadt using her magic from being destroyed by Germania.I think it is an interesting idea to see a witch in the 20th century obliterating tanks and planes created by science so it was an amusing sight for me to see our red haired witch fly and fight while causing confusion to both sides during her later appearance in the series. But after seeing all of the same scenes repeatedly, it feels it’s more like eye candy for most of the unfair battles between Germania versus Izetta.In my opinion, it’s cruel to have a little girl fight a war brought upon adults because of their conflicting ideas. And little girls, even though they are magically imbued with the power to wreck countless armies, should not stain her hands and be involved in a battle fought by men since she is still young and innocent (which troubles me). But I suppose the show is trying to convey to us that if left without any alternatives then, we need to fight, even if it costs us our lives, in order for us to protect those who are dear to us. Although Izetta was doing this voluntarily, I still feel she was forced to fight out of her friendship and loyalty to Fińe.One of the things I liked is the revelation of Izetta’s powers in which it was told too early to the viewers, which I think is odd since most secrets held by the main character ought to be kept fiercely at all costs. I think having Izetta a handicap is a good idea because this may rob the show all the fun and excitement if she were too powerful and could have just finished Germania in a single episode. Also because of this handicap, there was room for strategy and tactics for Izetta and her allies to come up with in order handle her shortcomings as shown in episode 5, but it feels very brief since it was only limited on that same episode. There were some episodes where the focus was on the other characters, which is great, but it was very brief and a bit forgettable since the only thing it contributed to the show was just some additions to the plot.I also like the idea that her enemies are well aware about her powers and are closely monitoring her in order to launch an effective plan to counter her powers. This actually paid off after they were able to extract the secrets to her powers and which turned the tides of war to Germania’s favor. In awful twist of fate they introduced Sophie in the fray who was the original white witch in the legend. Unfortunately, she has an ax to grind because of the betrayal she suffered before, and things got a lot more complicated in the story.For me, she was just an unnecessary addition to this war with a shallow motive of destroying Eylstadt and its people because of what had happened in the past but I guess this gives Izetta a challenge to defeat until the very end of the series. I was hoping the Germanian Empire was going to either to hunt down Izetta using some sort of machine or an elaborate scheme of capturing her alive and using her to do their bidding but looks like they just resorted with “fight fire with fire” and use the same powers to get the upper hand after resurrecting Sophie.I also like the part where Izetta experienced a powerful blow which crippled both her legs after fighting Sophie since this created more drama for the story and the only way for her to get back on her feet was to get the other half of the magic stone which Sophie used before in order for her to be on equal footing. That would had been a great plot line where someone else in Izetta’s group would find clues and search for it but all the excitement for the hunt for that stone was killed after Sieg revealed that he had the other half of the magic stone which provided an anti-climax for that matter.Another thing I would like to point out is that this series feels very rushed since they concluded everything at episode 12; the two witches who represent good and evil fought to the end, Germania was defeated like what happened to real life Nazi-Germany, and Izetta lost all her powers with the neutralization of the ley lines. I was actually hoping for more episodes of Izetta since this anime has a lot of potential for more stories but sadly, 12 episodes is not enough to justify if this anime was really great or not. Since the focus is more on Izetta, we were able to witness her development which strengthened her character through the whole ordeal she faced even if it will cost her life.ConclusionOver all, Izetta is a good show to watch with a great beginning but falls short near the end due to some unnecessary distractors. Like the many fans of the show like me, I was expecting this anime to end good but was greatly disappointed with it’s conclusion.First posted on 12/16/2016 at https://myanimeroom.wordpress.com/.

Oh boy.Let me give you the short review of this show if you don\'t want to waste your time reading a review about a show that was also a waste of time:If you came here hoping for a unique twist on World War 2 Storylines with an interesting twist of Fantasy and magic. Then just throw this in the...trash. No amount of Cool Animation, Soundtrack or Lesbian-undertoned Fanservice can save such a gigantic blob of wasted potential like this one.Now let me dissect each aspect of this show that contributed into this massive mess.Story-3/10We\'ve had enough Movies, Games, Manga and Anime that had a World War 2 Aspect to it, and had the Nazis. I mean Germanians, being bad guys, killing people ruthlessly because...they\'re Germanians. I expected that, someone who invests themselves in WWII themed media knows the drill. But they had a potential saving grace, and that was the risk of having FANTASY mixed into the batter. This could\'ve potentially saved this show\'s bland original concept, with enough Originality and seeing the Characters grow as people, this show could\'ve been good. But it didn\'t, it provided extremely bland uninteresting and predictable""plot-twists"", I gave Zero cares about the characters, except Jonas. Because he was the single character that, although seen in almost every type of WWII story, was executed well to drive the plot and make it have any resemblance of emotional interaction with the audience.Art-7/10The animation, background, art and Character design were all really good. But there were so many times, to the point of being uncountable in where the still shots, dialogue shots and hell even the ACTION shots being extremely sloppy in the second half of the show. If the WWII-Fantasy crossover Aesthetic was one of the few things that could\'ve saved this show, then it failed. If it did one thing well, then that\'s having really pretty girls and Yuri content for me to enjoy.Sound-7/10It was epic if it needed to be, and all in all it was really nice, the Chorale used sends shivers to my spine whenever I hear it. The OP and ED are just usual Edgy songs fitting this show\'s overall theme. One of the things done better in this show.Enjoyment-5/10This show just left a bitter taste in my mouth. The constant nagging of ""THIS COULD\'VE BEEN DONE SO MUCH BETTER"" in the back of my head was enough to make me just utterly hate this show, with that was paired how it was absolutely boring at around Episode 5 onward, this just made the show absolutely unbearable. I\'m currently just watching it to see what happens.Overall-4/10You\'re doing yourself a disservice if you watch this, it\'s an utter waste of time, that looked good at first. If you think it could be one of the better shows of this season, then you\'re lying to yourself.

A lot of anime from back then almost has like a slightly darker shade over the picture or perhaps looks a bit dull in colour saturation.The show is fine, it's pretty good with the action, and the sound of things is well-invested. However, it is also a lot of talking and romance talk without love. By this, I mean that it is basically a show about pretending you don't want someone to do something that you really do want them to do and convincing them of this. You get a classic America or 'Atlanta'...response of the suspected if we can't have this no one can in terms of power argument. They would abandon everyone because they can't have it.On one hand, you have standard World War 2 technology then you also have clones. Honestly, just pick a level of technology. It is like Attack of the Clones with magic and World War 2 technology, like a certain franchise but without as many 'magic' people and not in space.The sound is the best for vehicles here, superchargers on aircraft sound fantastic for example.Characters are stuck in a weird World War 1 vibe of the world but during World War 2. The enemy is bad, the good is pretending not to be bad and the neutral is on the pivot depending on what it gets them.Honestly, the show is good, you get good battles and fights with good sound. The show has a lot of talking, and random offshoots into what is meant to be meaningful but just isn't as a way to explore a side character's personality.7/10. response of the suspected if we can't have this no one can in terms of power argument.

As there were many reviews that had a critical tone towards it, which is not something that I would suppress but rather left a hesitant feeling for me to partake in this show. However, I do not regret watching this show, and I am rather confused now about why people have been so critical. I gave this show an 8, which means that it's a fine show, not a masterpiece, but not truly a failure. It is a show about a witch, Izetta, reuniting with an old friend that happens...to be a princess of a nation being besieged by a fictional, but rather a historically driven empire. I'm no history buff, but the names of these nations cracked me up a bit. The premise is interesting, and that may be why so many people were disappointed. Many were expecting a badass show about a witch blowing up enemy fleets, which while it indeed happened in a few episodes, was not the main point of the show at all. Furthermore, many were disappointed by this show delving into the political behind-the-scenes of a war, which I thought was ridiculous. The way this show handled the politics of war and having a ridiculous weapon as a witch was brilliant, and the planning of the opposing empire was a tremendous insight that helped to make this show more engaging. I found the criticisms of this show not having any fights, or enough yuri scenes to be a critique that lacked any viable substance, but also not highlighting the strengths of this show at all. The relationship between Izetta and Fine was good, they had great chemistry between them. Their past was an interesting take, which was potentially not explored enough, but their present relationship compensated for that. It was cute, had some intense and light moments, but it culminated into a tender, cute, and heartwarming relationship that I enjoyed to watch. Espescially in the final episode, where Izetta was willing to sacrifice her life for Fine, it was heartwarming, and nearly brought me to tears. All in all, this show has flaws and strengths, which is present in any other show. It is a very mixed show, with reactions that can stem from actual viable criticism, or nothing really substantive at all. It's not a show for everyone, but I should highlight that it is a show that has a diverse amount of genres within it.

Two women, falling through the sky with a look on their faces I couldn't quite place. The first episode was easily the best of that season for me. It drew me in so fast, with its fast-paced action and slower dialogue moments. A unique retelling of World War 2, this anime was candy for me being the history buff I am.Then, I got another pleasant surprise. Possible yuri. Holy hell, I was stoked. I thought that this might finally be the show to do it, to go all the way with the yuri....Throughout the first couple episodes, I felt pretty good about that. They took time to expand the world a little, bring in some aspects of it for many of the characters that I found particularly interesting. I feel though, that it may have taken a little too long, as the action didn't really ramp up until more than halfway through. The ending was pretty good, I found the final battle to be great. It did some things I wasn't expecting.The yuri, though, did not get off the ground. I was a little disappointed, as it had PLENTY of opportunities to do so, and do it beautifully. It is more implied if anything, but it still irked me a little.I really liked the music, as there is a choir in some of the tracks that sounded just awesome. The animation is pretty average in my opinion.All in all, this was a good show for me. Recommended if you like war, history, and fantasy action shows.

This mix of decently written characters, and swift reminders that this is war, and not everyone survives, is likely why.Story: Izetta: The Last Witch starts us off with Finé von Eylstadt, who roams the woods as a young girl, only to find another girl, Izetta, who is floating in the air, with the help of what appears to be, magic.  After spending a brief time together, they eventually parted ways and never saw each other again.  Switch to...present time, where her nation is in the middle of the World War 2 conflict, and Finé\'s father is struggling with his health.  This passes command to the Princess of Eylstadt, which is Finé.  Not long in, she gets captured by the German forces, her opposition, but she eventually gets rescued by Izetta, who displays her tremendous witch powers, known only in legends.  Wanting to preserve her memory together with Finé, Izetta vows to use any means necessary to end the war.  This includes entering the conflict and using her magical witch powers to fend off the opposition.The story itself was actually pretty interesting.  There were plenty of twists and turns to our war-driven story, and this only gets more obvious as our crew learn more and more about the history of the witches.  They do get around to this rather late in the series, but it does give the story a lot more beef than it would have had, had they chosen to keep Izetta\'s backstory to references only.  The conflicts themselves play out in typical war manner, with basically saying whoever has the most troops wins, assuming Izetta\'s presence isn\'t involved.  There weren\'t a ton of strategic plans sewed into the story, but I\'m actually glad they kept the micro-missions to a minimum, as this would have slowed the pace down a fair bit.Speaking of pacing, I thought that this series would have an issue keeping up such a strong tempo throughout, but I was pleasantly surprised that there was always something happening in each episode.  Every time, there would be new information, or something new on the screen, and this is another thing that prevented this tale from getting too stale.  There was a pretty significant character introduced near the end, and this felt like the most appropriate opponent to end of a story that I never really got bored of.  (9/10)Characters: Characters were a bit up and down, but most were used well within the story.  Finé was a pretty strong character with terrific ideals.  She always puts her nation first, and when Izetta gets involved, is extremely careful as to not ""use"" her friend for her selfish greed, even when her advisors tell her otherwise.  Her friendship with Izetta kind of stresses how much she probably needed a friend or two in her upbringing, especially one so upbeat like Izetta.  Who, by the way, probably wasn\'t the strongest character.  Her lines felt a little repetitive, and even if her friendship with Finé was really strong, you can kind of tell that she\'s had doubts along the way.  She surely does develop near the final battle, and it\'s here you can tell that she\'s finally sure of herself.Sieghart is basically Finé\'s right hand man, and he basically runs her military operations.  He\'s clearly not afraid to get his hands dirty and will do anything to win the war for his nation, even at the cost of a few soldiers.  Arnold acts as the right hand man to the German king, and you can tell that his tactics and smarts is what earned him the position he ended up in. I really don\'t like what they did with his character near the end though.  There were a lot of ways to move the story, but this didn\'t feel like one of the better choices.  Elvira feels like a bit of a mismatch in Finé\'s council, because I just don\'t really know what the point of her character was.  She was fine when she introduced, but outside of that episode, it felt like she didn\'t have a spot.  She was just there.There were a lot of side characters in the story, though many came and went, due to the nature of the story.  Some characters played a decent role within the series, so I like that they spend some time to tell us who they were.  People like Lotte and Biance were strong additions, in different ways, to the story and I\'m glad they were included here too.  Ricelt brought of a different angle to the war story than many others in the German army, so he was another that felt suitable for his role.  Overall, within our massive cast of characters, there were some you could probably live without, but Izetta was one that, while she was the centrepoint of the story, I wish they gave her more backstory.  (7/10)Art: This is my first exposure to Ajia-Do, the studio in charge of this original work, and there were bumps up and down throughout.  The series was fantastic with Izetta\'s magic, as you can tell there was some extra effort whenever she was involved.  Even some of the war sequences were done well.  That being said, there were a fair bit of mid-range shots in this series, and the animation quality really did suffer in those instances.  One thing they did really well though, is show the tender moments between Finé and Izetta really well.  I\'m glad they gave those two extra care there.  (7/10)Sound: I actually really enjoyed the OST here, as it had tracks that felt appropriate for the time, and even a handful that definitely sound more modern.  I wasn\'t a huge fan of the ED, Hikari Aru Basho e by May\'n, but I loved the OP, Cross the Line by AKINO with bless4.  Voice cast was a bit up and down.  Mallorie Rodak (Finé) was likely the star of the show.  I\'ve never really been exposed to her work before, but this was a strong showing.  Same goes for John Burgmeier (Arnold) and Christopher Wehkamp (Sieghart), both of whom were also exceptional.  Skyler McIntosh (Izetta) had some strong moments, but a few awkward ones as well.  Tia Ballard (Elvira) continues to impress me with her strong work with more mature characters.  It was nice to hear some older voices as well, with the likes of Ed Blaylock (Magnus) and Kent Williams (Benoit).  (8/10)Overall: Izetta: The Last Witch was a strong series, with a very strong story to a genre that I don\'t tend to be a fan of.  These type of series always open me up to try others in the genre, and strong supporting characters only helps that.  Finé and Izetta have some fantastic chemistry, and I\'m glad I decided to pick this series up.  Give it a try if military war series is your thing.  (8/10) present time, where her nation is in the middle of the World War 2 conflict, and Finé\'s father is struggling with his health.  This passes command to the Princess of Eylstadt, which is Finé.  Not long in, she gets captured by the German forces, her opposition, but she eventually gets rescued by Izetta, who displays her tremendous witch powers, known only in legends.  Wanting to preserve her memory together with Finé, Izetta vows to use any means necessary to end the war.  This includes entering the conflict and using her magical witch powers to fend off the opposition.The story itself was actually pretty interesting.  There were plenty of twists and turns to our war-driven story, and this only gets more obvious as our crew learn more and more about the history of the witches.  They do get around to this rather late in the series, but it does give the story a lot more beef than it would have had, had they chosen to keep Izetta\'s backstory to references only.  The conflicts themselves play out in typical war manner, with basically saying whoever has the most troops wins, assuming Izetta\'s presence isn\'t involved.  There weren\'t a ton of strategic plans sewed into the story, but I\'m actually glad they kept the micro-missions to a minimum, as this would have slowed the pace down a fair bit.Speaking of pacing, I thought that this series would have an issue keeping up such a strong tempo throughout, but I was pleasantly surprised that there was always something happening in each episode.  Every time, there would be new information, or something new on the screen, and this is another thing that prevented this tale from getting too stale.  There was a pretty significant character introduced near the end, and this felt like the most appropriate opponent to end of a story that I never really got bored of.  (9/10)Characters: Characters were a bit up and down, but most were used well within the story.  Finé was a pretty strong character with terrific ideals.  She always puts her nation first, and when Izetta gets involved, is extremely careful as to not ""use"" her friend for her selfish greed, even when her advisors tell her otherwise.  Her friendship with Izetta kind of stresses how much she probably needed a friend or two in her upbringing, especially one so upbeat like Izetta.  Who, by the way, probably wasn\'t the strongest character.  Her lines felt a little repetitive, and even if her friendship with Finé was really strong, you can kind of tell that she\'s had doubts along the way.  She surely does develop near the final battle, and it\'s here you can tell that she\'s finally sure of herself.Sieghart is basically Finé\'s right hand man, and he basically runs her military operations.  He\'s clearly not afraid to get his hands dirty and will do anything to win the war for his nation, even at the cost of a few soldiers.  Arnold acts as the right hand man to the German king, and you can tell that his tactics and smarts is what earned him the position he ended up in. I really don\'t like what they did with his character near the end though.  There were a lot of ways to move the story, but this didn\'t feel like one of the better choices.

Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken: Kanwa - Veldora Nikki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39607/Tensei_shitara_Slime_Datta_Ken__Kanwa_-_Veldora_Nikki,"[""This is about as simple of a recap a series can do, but with a slight advantage. Instead of making the whole thing be recapped by the characters who we already know the perspectives of, we do get to hear about the opinions of Ifrit and Veldora, which is a nice little change.Really the reason my score is so low is because it was still entirely a recap episode in nature. While it may be nice for those who may have forgotten some of the details of what happened, it really has no use beyond this point and can be easily ignored by those binging...the show later.As recaps go, this one is definitely above average, but it is still a largely pointless recap episode with cute little commentary bits spliced around. It's good to see Veldora again and some of the interactions are pleasant enough.What kind of annoyed me was how this was the original episode 25 to Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken, but was later separated into its own status. It rubbed me the wrong way how I thought this would be another interesting side story, but then eventually waited a week to find nothing but this waiting for me, and the revelation that no episode 25 would be coming.Again, this is not a major problem for people binging the show later, but it is still disappointing. the show later.As recaps go, this one is definitely above average, but it is still a largely pointless recap episode with cute little commentary bits spliced around.

Fair enough, if a tad odd, it\'s not like Slime is the only show to have a finale be a recap (Hi Clannad: After Story) but seeing as it is it\'s own thing, let\'s roll with it.So while I\'d rather talk about the content of the episode, I think we first need to discuss where the episode falls in the show. The big problem is that Slime has been listed as 25 episodes for...a while now, and to have it end up being 24 episodes (arguably 23 since 24 is almost an OVA episode) is definitely disappointing, especially if you were looking forward to the new episode. Couple that with the fact that the end of a season is a really odd time for a recap. I get having one before a new season for those who haven\'t watched it in a while, I sorta get one in the middle as a stop-gap to allow the team to get ahead a bit, but the end of the season? Why?But ignoring the fact that this episode has terrible timing and was generally communicated poorly, how good is it itself? And it kinda depends. The weirdest thing is for a recap, it really doesn\'t... well, recap. It\'s mostly Veldora and Ifrit having a conversation in the background that sometimes vaguely connects to what\'s being shown. In terms of reminding you of plot points, it really only hits a few major ones and generally the way it does so, it\'s not really showing what they mean. So as a recap, it\'s not very effective. However, the general running dialogue between Ifrit and Veldora is honestly quite entertaining and *arguably* worth watching for that. Veldora is the best character in the show and it\'s a travesty that he got discarded after episode 1, so seeing more of him here is great and Ifrit provides a great straight-man to Veldora\'s dialogue.Taken in isolation, it\'s a decent radio drama with irrelevant animation playing over it for the most part. Whether that\'s enough or not depends on the viewer. I personally don\'t regret watching it, but I wish I knew this is what I was getting instead of episode 25 of the series. However, down the road when people are watching this show for the first time and aren\'t expecting it to be 25 episodes, I think those who choose to watch this will be satisfied enough.

Veldora and Ifrit decide to put their abilities to the test, in a contest of strategy and craftiness (i.e. Shogi); as opposed to raw physical strength and magical abilities.  In the midst of their “battle,” the two recount the metamorphosis of Rimuru from a “normal” human to a slime with absorptive powers.  It’s a veritable smattering of pivotal scenes from the original series strung together as Veldora and Ifrit play for laughs to “entertain” the audience as they wonder why they are watching the same...crap (again!).If there is one positive aspect about this OVA, it’s the fact that the viewer does not have to listen to Rimuru’s annoying, Chip ’n’ Dale voice.

This is not supposed to be new material. Rehashing is okay once in a while I think.This is a partial retelling from a different perspective for those of us that cannot get enough of the slimy goodness that was in the parent story ever. And they were good highlights (without giving spoilers).After all, until we can get the second season complete enough to binge, we need something more that the OVAs (which were likeable enough).Just my $0.02 worth.Of course, your mileage may vary. But I was happy enough for what it was. ', ""A very skippable episode which was supposed to be the 25 & latest of Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken season 1. However, it became a summary instead of a regular episode.Although, this episode showed some new scenes and obviously totally new dialogs between Ifrit & Veldora. Basically, they play a Shogi game while talking quickly about their stories. During these discussions, we can rewatch a few moments (sort of highlights but very very restricted) that appeared during the whole season.To be honest, it's not even a recap since it does not explain much stuff and selects scenes which don't really have a logical line...(for example, we get to see for a few minutes, parts of episode 1 where Rimuru meets Veldora ; then there is a huuuuge time skip that leads us to his meeting with Shizu, etc).I think the only appreciable point was to hear Veldora & Ifrit, the first one being unheard for literaly 24 episodes and the second... did he even speak before ? Another point of view I won't remember in a few days. Ah we get to see Milim for a few seconds, so that gives the episode an additional point.

Aside from Veldora's and Ifrit's meeting moment, there was no new visual content to appreciate, all you get are snapshots from different episodes of the series that emphasizes the progression of the plot as they spat their insight on everything that happened.We do get some new information regarding Veldora's background, a few hits for what might come afterward, but that's about it.

Sunohara-sou no Kanrinin-san,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36817/Sunohara-sou_no_Kanrinin-san,"['Repost due to MAL\'s ""Finished Airing"" status, no changes are made.My initial criticism on this was super harsh, on it being a trash anime that tries to capitalize on the shouta-gal cliché (got burned out by the ludicrous Hajimete no Gal). Oh, how dreadfully wrong I was.Now that this series has ended, I\'m glad that I was able to get a good amount of enjoyment, so much so that this shall go into my Summer seasonal guilty pleasure.Sunoharasou no Kanrinin-san is at heart, a 4-koma manga to anime adaptation, so don\'t go in and expect some plot holes or some insane storyline. It is also...another slew of SoL (or Slice of Life) genre-themed anime, what that means is to just sit back, relax and enjoy what this has to offer. That\'s it.4-koma adaptations are a boon a bain, because for this kind of series to work, the script and series composition has to be done properly like a progressing storyboard. Fortunately, welcome in the veteran Fumihiko Shimo (Jun Maeda-quality anime like Air, Clannad, Kanon; Kokoro Connect and few notables), so at least this series has some competency, and he does a great job at that.Speaking of the characters, there are aplenty, aside from our shouta MC (Aki Shiina) and the gal MC (Ayaka Sunohara, which Aki always addresses her as Caretaker). For once I thought that this anime has some great character design, that is merely done to address the shouta-gal experience between Shiina and Ayaka, but that\'s not all! The ""Student Council\'s"" top brass also resides in the dorm, bringing us the sister-centric Yuzu, the playful Nana (Ayaka\'s sister), the calm and composed Yuri and the sis-con Sumire, who blemishes at the sight of Yuzu.The aesthetics is where both Shiina and Ayaka stand out, with Shiina\'s boy-at-heart feminine posture, shorts and the oh-so-shy personality a temptation and Ayaka\'s large-breasted motherly figure, with her apron and caring behaviour that resembles the sibling (Onee-san) trait a lot.Silver Link is back to direct the SoL genre again, after a few certain hits or misses, this IMO is a sleeper hit. For some reason (even in the PV), the studio opted for light coloured pastels on the overall aesthetics, and I pretty much got since this is meant to be a light-hearted series to begin with. Moreover, the animation looks clean and concise, so sasuga Silver Link, you\'ve done a good job.And oh how I love the music, especially the OP that is done by the one and only Megumi Nakajima, that\'s a super-catchy one if you so wish to desire. The ED is OK by my tastes though, decent but not bad either. The BGM is the same story, in the sense of placements and such, like it was made as gradual follow-ups to those light-hearted obscene stuff that are the irritations of certain characters and such. All this is thanks to underrated music composer Ruka Kawada, for her works which include Winter 2018\'s Gakuen Babysitters and works like ""Is The Order A Rabbit?"" and such.I know from certain people that they don\'t care the shouta-con generic caricature, and just like the failure of last season\'s Tachibanakan Triangle (which has some similarities but many differences), another passing of mediocrity. Only the minority who cares enough for this anime will be pleasantly surprised and (like me) will get good vibes from this.

(Older sister)That is older women (usually busty) who are attracted to younger boys.If you are not down with the fetish then its quite likely you won\'t enjoy this show nearly as much as I did.Oh it is so so good.Story: 6Not the strong suit of this show, but that\'s because it is a episodic comedy. Shiina Aki, a young boy who has always been treated like a girl, moves from the countryside to a Tokyo dormitory so he can have a fresh start in middle school. The dormitory...known as Sunohara-sou is run by Ayaka Sunohara, a tall, busty, kind, older-sister-type character. All the residents of the dorm besides Aki also happen to be cute girls. They all have very large boobs except for one who is totally flat. Basically it\'s just 12 very cute and very funny episodes of antics.Art: 7Really pretty cute.  Every character is incredibly moe and soft in design. Ayaka is the definition of a perfect Onee-san. There is just about something for everyone. All the characters are very unique and easily recognized.The background art is fairly standard, nothing stands out.Sound: 7The OP theme is super-duper cute and catchy. It fits the show perfectly and is a pleasure to watch at the beginning of every episode.The ED theme is pretty nice. It\'s a nice and wholesome way to wind down from a crazy episode.The BG music does not stand out at all. Most pieces are really quiet and forgettable. It\'s basically just a bunch of soft, chilled piano pieces. It\'s fine.Character: 8It was really tough for me to pick a favorite character in this series because they are all just so much fun.Ayaka Sunohara-If you know anything about Onee-san archetypes, you know Ayaka. Honestly she is a very simple character. Some might even say that she is cookie cutter basic. Ayaka\'s simplicity does not take a single thing away from this show. It\'s great to see her interact with the tenants of the dormitory. She is truly the ideal older-sister that all Onee-san loves have been wishing for.Aki Shiina-A young boy who has always been treated like a girl. Mostly due to his somewhat abusive older sister. Aki really is quite feminine. He moves to Tokyo because he wants to become a man. Almost every joke in the show revolves around Aki, the main character. We see a small but sure amount of growth in Aki throughout the show, but mostly we see him getting teased by older girls.Other dorm members: Yuzu, Yuri, Sumire-Mostly 1 dimensional characters that exist to set up jokes. However, nobody is watching this show to see outstanding character development. They\'re all hilarious in their own rights. Sumire probably being my favorite never ceases to make me laugh.Enjoyment: 10Yes, I appreciate the whole ""shotacon"" thing. I can\'t even say why but it\'s great. We\'re all very jealous of Aki\'s newfound harem. Even if you can\'t appreciate shotacon, nobody can deny that this show can be hilarious.  Anybody who has a taste for ecchi humor will get a real kick out of this show. It\'s all so simple and a tad cliche, but I PROMISE its SUPER CUTE and SUPER FUNNY. I don\'t care about the poor ratings on this show. I absolutely will defend this show till my death.Overall: 8Unfortunately for me laughs and nosebleeds are not the sole thing that contribute to a shows rating. What Sunohara-sou lack in depth and storytelling, it makes up with for it with great comedic writing and timing. (and cute characters)I will never forget my first shotacon show. known as Sunohara-sou is run by Ayaka Sunohara, a tall, busty, kind, older-sister-type character. All the residents of the dorm besides Aki also happen to be cute girls. They all have very large boobs except for one who is totally flat. Basically it\'s just 12 very cute and very funny episodes of antics.Art: 7Really pretty cute.  Every character is incredibly moe and soft in design. Ayaka is the definition of a perfect Onee-san. There is just about something for everyone. All the characters are very unique and easily recognized.The background art is fairly standard, nothing stands out.Sound: 7The OP theme is super-duper cute and catchy. It fits the show perfectly and is a pleasure to watch at the beginning of every episode.The ED theme is pretty nice. It\'s a nice and wholesome way to wind down from a crazy episode.The BG music does not stand out at all. Most pieces are really quiet and forgettable. It\'s basically just a bunch of soft, chilled piano pieces. It\'s fine.Character: 8It was really tough for me to pick a favorite character in this series because they are all just so much fun.Ayaka Sunohara-If you know anything about Onee-san archetypes, you know Ayaka. Honestly she is a very simple character. Some might even say that she is cookie cutter basic. Ayaka\'s simplicity does not take a single thing away from this show. It\'s great to see her interact with the tenants of the dormitory. She is truly the ideal older-sister that all Onee-san loves have been wishing for.Aki Shiina-A young boy who has always been treated like a girl. Mostly due to his somewhat abusive older sister.

There really isn\'t much one can do story telling wise when the source was a 4-koma manga. Practically no story progression has happened (besides slight romance progress) during the time this review was made. Typical boy and girl anime tropes come into play here (Walking in on a girl bathing, the good ol\' unintentional boob-slip, etc) y\'know, the usual.Art: 9 (Great)This and some other things that I\'m gonna mention later played a huge part as to why I...actually like this anime. To me Silver Link has always been a semi-above tier studio in terms of art and animation, the art style in this anime in particular has always reminded me of anime like Imouto Sae Ireba Ii, (no surprise there considering same studio) an anime with art as one of it\'s strengths. The art was definitely a plus in my book.Sound: 6 (Fair)Nothing really much to say here, the soundtrack sounds pretty ""meh"" for the most part excluding the OP and ED.Character: 10 (Outstanding)WARNING: I\'m about to fire my Bias-Blaster 10000 (patent pending) onto this particular section, so take it with a grain of salt.The characters all fill some type of archetype in harem-esque anime. There\'s the big oppai woman, the Kuudere, the normal-until-you-get-to-know-them girl, and the token loli. Originality is thrown out the window in this anime when it comes to character design but it didn\'t really bother me, probably due to the fact that I absolutely ADORE the loli (Yuzu) in this anime. These characters (especially yuzu) set the icing-on-the-perverted cake for me, and is one of the main reasons as to why I personally like this anime. I realize these archetypes are overused and probably will continue to be that way, but for me personally I didn\'t really mind them.Enjoyment: 8 (Very Good)....What can I say here? I happened to catch myself laughing a lot watching this anime for better and for worse. The humor is there, and fanservice is also present in nearly every episode, it didn\'t add much to my enjoyment but I know it does for some people out there.Overall: 7 (Good)It seems stupid to like it, but I\'d like to say that this anime is definitely worth your time if you happened to enjoy anime like Imouto Sae Ireba Ii, and not just because it\'s produced by Silver Link, but it also gives off that same vibe Imouto Sae had. That light-hearted, peaceful but slightly ecchi vibe it provides is something I\'m sure some people out there like. I\'m not putting it any higher than a 7 as the amount of flaws in this show (there are MANY) make it hard to do so, and I know it almost seems like a bad thing to like it but to conclude....If you don\'t really care about plot progression besides the slow-progressing romance and the lack of actual originality besides the shota mc, I\'d give Sunoharasou no Kanrinrin-san a watch.Enjoy the show.

However, noted that it\'s clearly a fetish-based anime. Therefore the scores really depends on how much you love Oneesan-Shota or Gal-Shota actions and fan-services.If you like them, this really cute anime will be no doubt an outstanding anime for you. If not, it\'s probably not an anime for you.""Oneesan/Gal X Shota"" had been a really big genre in the world of doujin and illustration. We have seen flashes of it in Minami-ke, Miss Kobayashi\'s Dragon Maid...and Oshiete! Galko-chan, but they aren\'t the main focus of the show. There is Kanokon, but the concept in general was rarely explored in the anime world.And here comes Sunoharasou no Kanrinin-san.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------StoryIt\'s adapted from a 4-Koma manga, which means it\'s going to be a Slice of Life anime. Don\'t expect any extraordinary plot and plot twist, but it\'ll give you a very relaxing experience. There is also a lot of fan-services, which is also great.One of the problem for 4-Koma adaptation is that, pacing would be weird if it\'s not done probably. But it\'s not a problem in Sunoharasou no Kanrinin-san, as Shimo Fumihiko, one of the best Series Composition ever, is doing the job.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CharactersAs mentioned, it\'s a SoL anime where character development is not necessary. So the biggest question lays in the character designs.As one of the pioneer for this sub-genre in anime, the character design doesn\'t need to be extraordinary. In fact, it has to be as basic and typical as possible to set a tone for future anime to work on.Aki\'s feminine looking, shy personality and shorts make him the perfect shota.Kanrinin-san\'s motherly breast, apron and affectionate behaviour make her the perfect Oneesan. Therefore, the character design of Suroharasou no Kanrinin-san is literally perfect.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SoundThe soundtrack is by Kawada Ruka, an experienced composer for SoL anime, and the it is great this time also. The op and ed are great, and they fit the anime. Voice actors are excellent.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ArtstyleSilver Link is one of the more experienced and competent studio in handling harem or SoL adaptations. The use of colour is light and lines are soft, which fit the adorable, motherly, peaceful atmosphere of the show. Animation is looking fluid so far, hopefully they can keep it up.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ConclusionThis is one of those very good anime that is not made for everyone.

This is as miserable as it can be.  I will not even disassemble this anime normally, it is not worthy of it.  A bunch of cringe, stupid jokes about the genitals and about animal instincts.  This can amuse only a schoolboy masturbating 100 times a day, with an excess of testoterone and sperm in his blood and knowing nothing expect the word ""fuck"".  Really, start watching the episode and after about 20-30 seconds you will see a joke below the belt,...well, or above the belt if it’s about the boobs of a  chan.  It\'s not funny.

I enjoyed the art of the waifu that was rolled so on a whim I decided to watch this anime. At face value, it is a compilation of lowkey milf softcore implied fan service. But after watching 9 episodes it truly is an anime with a great cast and a great entertaining story. It gives me that wholesome feel while still having some comedy, it is not afraid to embrace the tropes of the genre and is unapologetic about being an anime with fan...service. For it being about a group of students, there are actually no scenes at school, this is very interesting to me as it can build a world where we know what's happening but doesn't have to show it. By doing so it creates an environment where we can focus on the characters and see how different plot points unwind without showing the clutter and useless things. Although I am not finished I am positive I will love this anime by the end.  Its deadass on like Kobyashi levels of wholesomeness and its overall just a fun anime to watch and relax, if you are looking for an easy watch i def recommend this.

It\'s not overly ecchi and the characters are all lovable and well-designed, but that\'s about where my enjoyment ends. There are a few good jokes sprinkled here and there, but many of them have virtually no punchline and might as well end with an ""I can\'t stand it!"" from Peanuts, as if it\'s the character\'s confused frustration over a bad punchline that is supposed to be funny.I don\'t know how this is supposed to be a coming-of-age story for the barely-a-teen MC Aka when almost half of the jokes are him getting...kind of molested by his voluptuous house maid Ayaka or her younger sister Nana. But if you like gorgeous and idealistic waifus, they\'ve got the physical appeal and moe personalities that will make a sad weeb\'s heart go doki-doki. It\'s hard to see what events throughout the school year might have helped him develop into a more mature young man when so much of the series is just goofy hijinks or characters comparing their bust sizes.Did I mention these beautiful ladies have MASSIVE knockers?

Its about the same feeling you get if you spend the entire day on the couch, eating cup-noodles and ice-cream, and then finish it off with takeout junkfood.Animation 5/10 Nothing special.

It sometimes match the mood and the timing is  alright, that\'s about all it gets.OP/ED Skipped/10Its *current year*, unless its spectacular or a major banger, who gives a shit about about the OP/ED?(Not affecting my overall score of the series)Characters 4/10 Mostly cookie cutter stereotypes, they serve their purpose but they are not in any way, shape or form memorable. Episode 1 starts out with internal monologues in a loud screaming voice, it gets a bit less obnoxious over time, but at no point were i ever in doubt about what the characters was feeling, MCs in particular. The elegance of which it was communicated can be compared to being smacked over the head with cheap folding chair during a wrestling match, painfully crude but effective.MC aka. shota-kun, is about 13-ish old boy whom everyone assumes is a girl, apparently. He lacks any real masculine traits, and his demeanor is usually very passive. He is obsessed with being seen as ""a man"", as many young teenage boys are, and he fails, for the most part, to convince his surroundings of this, despite several poorly thought out plans. In typical early teenager fashion, he is easily distracted and promptly flushed by; random lewd thoughts, big boobs - covered or not, underwear and close contact/proximity to a member of the female sex.His personality swings between being unassertive and passive, to being able to stand up for himself to some degree and persue his goals actively whenever he feels that his ""manly hood"" is in doubt. This flexible personality, along with the occasional near panic attack level of response to stress makes him a mildly entertaining character, for most people. I personally grew tired of him very quickly, his actions seems forced and he is often eye-rollingly predictable. He is, quite frankly, C R I N G E.Ayaka aka. ""Miss Caretaker"" is the carefree motherly character with huge tits. Like, each one being the size of MCs head, huge. A well respected trope that has been used countless times. Her main role is to tease/embarrassed the ever-loving fuck out of shota-kun and deliver fanservice. She acts like a surrogate mother with little to no sense for personal space and treats shota-kun like a kid, to his chagrin. Despite of all that, she is actually quite reliable and serves as a pillar of emotional support for MC.The most interesting characters would be the trio student council members. Their personalities compliment eachother and with their leader, Yuzu, being direct and driven, they are able to push shota-kun into all kinds of situations. Seeing the extremely short Yuzu downright berates MC and Ayaka is always fun, and her over the top demeanor help shake things up.Story 5/10What story?The most impressive part about this is that it manages not to feel directionless, while at the same time not going anywhere.Enjoyment 8/10Despite an absolutely terrible first episode and low score on most points, i found it surprisingly enjoyable. If you read the tags before watching you know what you are getting into and will most likely have a pretty good time. But if this was randomly chosen then you will either drop it before the third episode, or watch the entire season and then proceed to channel all the pent up frustrations into a long and very negative review, most likely using half the wordcount on bashing both the creators and watchers for being pedophiles, or something like that. My personal recommendation would be to instead make a 200 word long, 1 star review, repeating the words ""big gay"" and using the excess energy in the gym. the nose.

If our main Shota MC had a goal in mind and actually stayed true to accomplishing said goal it would have been a little more interesting. So while the story was uninteresting, the amount of great female characters made up for the lack of ACTUAL plot.The art and Animation was interesting. Silver Link did a great job as always but I felt like there was something lacking to this anime. Maybe the bluray will clean up the animation a little bit but overall it was average.I really enjoyed the opening and ending. The Voice actors were...average. None hit me with the ""WOW"" factor but they fit their characters fine enough. Especially Ayane Sakura as Nana.Like I said I really enjoyed the characters. I mean they were cute and enjoyable and thats all I needed from this anime. because just at multiple times I wanted to punch the MC in the face for being a coward when it came to these women.I enjoyed this anime.

And the caretaker works hard to look after all these kids so they can have a good time. The main boy isn't criminally molesting females and acting like it's no big deal (a la 7 Deadly Sins - makes me sick) or miraculously plunging his face into panties every step (a la To Love Ru - that's the part I liked the least but I really enjoyed the rest of the show). All the girls just have different personalities, different preoccupations and create somewhat-realistic scenarios for why the boy is sandwiched between them.So what's so bad about that?The art and face style reminds me a lot of Kobayashi's Dragon Maid. caretaker lady, who obviously has to be beautiful and busty, and happens to molest all boys and girls who lives in her building, but somehow legal and in good atmosphere and in good taste.As expected of Japanese anime, there's is only 1 boy but cute girls of all ages and sizes as far as eyes can see.Seriously, apart from the ecchi, this show is full of joyful slice of life.

The comedy aspect here was certainly lame when the comedy relies a lot of putting the girly boy in a lotta awkward situation whereby he was made to be this toy boy that them older girls would wanna make a pet outta...him, but ya know the story plot wasn't that bad when you have a girly boy whose gets such treatment, but then again he was just like any harem guy, who has all the girls but will bang none of them, and although he has the caretaker, he somehow only sees her as a mom figure, even if she herself would be willing to do all kinda of kinki things that a man would love. and the girly guy has to do is just ask for it, which he won't cu'z he's stupid. Now on the art category, well, there were some occasional fanservice around, but in this case everything revolve around the caretaker whose body was to die for, and I wouldn't be surprised if those who view this , were just ogling for her sex appeal with such buxom body and would probably come up with such excuse that this anime is good or whatever BS of a lie that they can come up with. On the sound category, well I can't deny that I myself was taken by the characters smooth and refined monologue, Characterwise, It was just way too cliche and pathetic when everything was with Shiina Aki and Sounohara Ayaka whose relationship was a typical sotacon romance, in fact Ayaka would be more than willing to take over the parenting of Shiina and also pop his cherries as well in the most erotic manner that any man would think of. Now , how do I enjoy this thing?????? Well, let's just say that this was an anime where skimming and skipping a few episode was something that I can afford, so overall studio Sliver Link, puts sooo much eye candy around here that this was just too gay. So , here's how I rate it:Story-Good 7: Since it was quite different, since the plot was more of a sotacon romance, the down side was that the MC was just the usual harem guy.Art-Outstanding 10: For the buxom bodies of Ayaka, Nana and Sumire that them dogs would ogle for, and since there some fanservices around.Sound-Outstanding 10: For the smooth and refine voices of specific characters.Character-Pathetic 1: Cu'z the guy was very much of a girl as if he is gay.Enjoyment- Poor 3: This was one of those anime where one can afford to skip some episodes.Overall-Pathetic 1: Don't even think about making a season 2 of this thing. him, but ya know the story plot wasn't that bad when you have a girly boy whose gets such treatment, but then again he was just like any harem guy, who has all the girls but will bang none of them, and although he has the caretaker, he somehow only sees her as a mom figure, even if she herself would be willing to do all kinda of kinki things that a man would love. and the girly guy has to do is just ask for it, which he won't cu'z he's stupid.

Yuri is another supporting character and she is pretty much friends with yuzu and Sumire her quirk is that she's pretty much a person who REALLY loves taking pictures with her camera and dressing Shiina in girly clothes otherwise she is a pretty nice and just good character.Enjoyment: What did i like: so the comedy in this is really good for me (never really laughed or burst out laughing just really smiling) but the comedy is good for sure the character and the artwork to honestly anything in this is good also ecchi in this which i like.

There’s minimal plot, character development, and relationship development beyond the initial premise. For the most part character’s have pretty simple sets of traits, and the humor basically arises from these traits manifesting when the characters interact in a variety of situations. As such, there’s some variety to the humor, but the majority of it is centered around the protagonist Aki’s attempts at seeming more of a man and...not a boy or girl, with the focus being on him attempting to and failing in a humorous fashion, or him not being taken seriously at all in a humorous fashion. This is amusing enough for the most part. The comedy is pretty character centric so it does a pretty good job at adding new characters at a steady pace and keeping the character’s being focused on being changed up as it goes. It still felt like it was getting kind of repetitive and dull towards the end though. There’s a character added right near the end that seems interesting enough to spice things up but it didn’t really feel like she had a strong enough presence beyond her introduction where she only really interacted with Aki and Ayaka.The art and animation are pretty great. I liked the use of soft colors and think that they fit really well. The OP had good visuals and song. The ED had decent visuals and song. The soundtrack wasn’t particularly memorable. not a boy or girl, with the focus being on him attempting to and failing in a humorous fashion, or him not being taken seriously at all in a humorous fashion.

That was the only negative point for me.The anime per se is pretty good if you just want to relax while also gawking at a milf shota romance.The setting was okay but tbh it doesn't exactly work in anime, though it works wonders in a hentai.An anime like this doesnt really need a masterpiece of a story so that wot cause any problem on enjoyment.The art style is really good and the girls are all drawn nice and curvy which will keep your focus.Voice acting...is really on point.Especially, Sunohara ayaka; her voice is so warm and gentle.Characters are pretty shallow though.

The story is about Sun Wukong (Monkey King) who got himself in trouble because he was short-tempered and greedy, he accidentally release the Demon King who was trapped. I wouldn't spoiler anything else but the story...was decent, exciting but predictable.Animation 8 : This movie gives me the conclusion that Chinese animation in 3D is almost the same level as Disney. Believe me, I watched a couple of Donghua It's good but not good as the 3D animation that Chinese created. the effect was cool and satisfying, fight scene was good too.Sound 7 : The sound was good and the voice acting was good (I was watched it in Chinese Dub using a subtitle) the way the Demon King sound is so good, ambient, and the battle sound was good eitherCharacter 5 : The character was decent, it doesn't surprise me at all. Basic Chinese character I would say, you got greedy character, you got pacifist character, you got funny character too. Basic.Overall 7 : If you want to watch just for fun or probably watch it with your family and friends I guess this is a perfect movie for you, but if you want a deep story I think you're in the wrong place.

Basic.Overall 7 : If you want to watch just for fun or probably watch it with your family and friends I guess this is a perfect movie for you, but if you want a deep story I think you're in the wrong place. It's probably they trying to tell a story of Monkey King for any ages so they trying to keep the story as simple as possible.""]"
Shin Tennis no Oujisama: U-17 World Cup,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50099/Shin_Tennis_no_Oujisama__U-17_World_Cup,"['What an absolute disappointment, honestly. Just read the manga. This is coming from a long-time TeniPuri fan.ANIMATION: I\'m over a decade deep into tennis hell and this anime is just awful compared to the stuff they used to put out. You can literally tell that the studio had 0 time to invest into this anime because they\'re so reliant on awful CGIs and stills. All of the ""good"" episodes only seem good until you realize that there was 0 animation/sakuga. When I saw all the seiyuu announcements for the Foreign players, I was like ""wow, they have a huge budget if they were able to...get [prolific seyuu] for this!""... Turns out the entire budget went exactly to securing the seiyuus and we get a measly $2 for the animation. At this point, I\'m only watching this show just to laugh at the awful animation (hate-watchers or garbage anime connoisseurs, put this on your list).STORY: This adaptation is so unfaithful to the source material. I am aware that the original anime was also not faithful to the source manga, but it was actually interesting with how they deviated in that series. I was emotionally invested in this specific arc of the ShinTeni manga and it was just painful to see them deviate so much from the actual story. To make things even worse, they condense so many storylines into less than 1 episode (yes, I\'m calling out the Exhibition vs Germany and GS vs. Greece arcs). With how much content was in the manga, the Exhibition Match vs. Germany could\'ve easily taken all 13 episodes this anime is allegedly contracted to run for. There is 0 suspense or anticipation for what\'s to come next episode. In the original anime, at least they ended episodes on cliffhanger points or in the middle of an important match, but this anime just ends when the match ends. You literally have no incentive to return next week to watch other than your love for this series. The manga has better pacing and actually gives us a reason to root for Japan.CHARACTERS: I think I\'m also particularly biased towards the execution of the story because I watched the musical adaptation of the vs. Genius 10 arc and that 3 hour musical was so faithful to the source material and didn\'t lose any of the character development along the way. This anime just cuts out a lot of the character dev that was instrumental in the manga for setting up the situations we find the main characters in. They cut out so much development from the GS vs. Greece match and crammed those 30-ish chapters into 15 minutes of anime. I don\'t know how anyone is supposed to like Ochi or Toono or Tanegashima\'s characters because they literally got shafted so hard in the anime.SOUND: The OP slaps. The big name seiyuus they got for the foreign players (Hanae Natsuki, Midorikawa Hikaru, Kobayashi Yuu, etc.) was literally where all of the budget for this anime went.OVERALL: I love this series but ShinTeni U-17 WC anime is a slap to the face to any long-time TeniPuri fan.

You have people doing backflips while hitting the ball, people creating gravity wells on the court, people using execution techniques and applying it to their tennis shots, there really is no end to it.  Every episode I found myself grinning ear to ear at the sheer ridiculousness of the ""tennis"" on display.  Add to that a lovable cast of characters and you have yourself a winning formula.  Even as a longtime tennis...player, I found myself totally enamored with this show.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun sports anime that casts aside all pretext of realism and takes it to the extreme. player, I found myself totally enamored with this show.

This show compared to its predecessors is lacking in every way. The tennis matches all start with one opponent leading 5-0, then a comeback starts etc. Moreover, they really bombard you with too many characters you begin to not really care about anybody. This show stopped having anything to do with tennis a long time ago, but even if you're trying to see that DBZ-styled tennis you're going to be disappointed, the matches were pretty low energy and anti-climactic besides Akutsu's. OST...is a far cry from what it used to be, character development is non-existent, and all the off-match episodes may as well not even exist. The flashbacks were also boring, even Genius vs Ova 10 had better ones. is a far cry from what it used to be, character development is non-existent, and all the off-match episodes may as well not even exist.

This is an anime if you want to watch crazy shit happen and cool effects. Think of this like Dream Sports from Mario & Sonic Olympics. It's not really the about the original sport. It's about having an excuse to fire off 10 tennis balls in one shot or create black holes on the court. For people that like high paced action like that, then Prince of Tennis does that with a side of backstory.Most of the time in Prince of Tennis you're getting people's faces smashed in with tennis balls or someone is making...up some insane trick shot. But when push comes to shove, when it comes down to the wire, you get to learn about people's origins, their motivation for winning. And that's when their personalities manifest themselves on the tennis court.If you're the kind of person whose going to complain because 2 middle schoolers are rallying with 10 tennis balls, then this is not the anime for you.

It's similar in quality to the previous anniversary specials, in that most of the episode is just reminding you of the good old days and how funny the series was in the first 2 seasons and the movie.Still, as the finale of the series, it works decently enough. Seeing the Feathers get mercilessly bullied is always a treat (it happens twice here too, thrice counting a newspaper clip from last year's anniversary).And the final scene wraps...things up nicely.

He embarks on a perilous journey to ascend a foreboding tower to seek reprieve, where the key to lifting his curse supposedly lies. But as fate would have it, his path converges with that of a mysterious witch whose enigmatic presence promises both salvation and uncertainty.As the prince navigates the trials within the tower, each...challenge brings him closer to the witch, culminating in a pivotal moment where he extends a proposal unlike any other: to share his life with her for a year. It's a proposition steeped in desperation and hope, setting the stage for a captivating romance transcending fate's boundaries.While Unnamed Memory leans more towards a serious and romantic tone, it doesn't hesitate to inject moments of fun and humor into the narrative. Amidst the earnest exchanges and heartfelt confessions, there are glimpses of lightheartedness that balance the weight of the character's emotional journey.Moreover, the anime tantalizes viewers with the promise of intriguing backstories and potential antagonists, hinting at a deeper layer of conflict and action that awaits. The story unfolds deliberately with each episode, allowing for meticulous character development and world-building that lay the foundation for future revelations.Though Unnamed Memory may not yet claim the title of masterpiece, its measured approach to storytelling and commitment to gradual progression instills a sense of anticipation and curiosity in its audience.

The two compromise and come to a solution: the witch will accompany the man for the next year, placing him under her protection until the curse is broken; the man himself will spend that time attempting to court her into marriage.Unnamed Memory is an adventure-romance-fantasy, thematically speaking. It makes several major...narrative promises, such as the aforementioned aspects of wish-fulfillment (to break a curse) and the prospect of marriage, as well as the prospect of meeting the other wicked witch who was responsible for the curse in the first place, and juggles some background elements of mystery and intrigue, showing characters outside of the main cast who skulk about in the wake of their events discussing their plots and schemes, or doing something evil to inform the viewer that the roses in the garden also have some thorns accompanying them.The first episodes are mostly promising, showing fluidity in the action scenes, a high attention to detail in character designs, and playful dialogues.

It's like tepid room-temperature water.And I can confidently say the main problem is the protagonist. Tinasha is a Mary Sue character that is out of place in the world she lives in. She is simply an isolationist. She has no dreams (apart from 1, which isn't explained well and is concluded too quickly). She has no desires. She has no interesting history. She is basically a hikkikomori wish-fulfilment character for people to project onto.

At the time of writing this review, only 3 episodes have been released, but it has been a very enjoyable watch so far.Since the synopsis pretty much says what I would have written for the summary anyway, I won't be repeating it. The anime does indeed explore how Tinasha, the witch, and Oscar, the prince, experience their time together due to the contract stating that they would live together for one year, with Oscar constantly trying to get Tinasha to...marry him. This results in a very wholesome anime with many hints of both romance and comedy, a duo that can never go wrong. Additionally, I felt that these three episodes so far have been very content-rich, meaning that the watch felt satisfying and wasn't just a lazy exposition dump- something that's increasingly hard to find in modern anime.Now, it would be a disgrace to not talk about the amazing action scenes in episode 2. While it might not have been extremely long, the animation of the fight scenes were gorgeous. The crisp lighting effects of the spells used by Tinasha, the vibrant colors present throughout the entirety of the fight, and the fast-paced action all served to greatly enhance the watching experience. While we're on the topic of animation, the character designs all felt pretty fresh, especially the designs of the witches.Quickly moving on the music, both the opening and ending themes have a very slow and relaxing tempo, making it a calming prelude to a calming show. This highlights what I think your expectations watching this show should be. In my opinion, you shouldn't watch this show expecting a nail-biting thriller leaving you on the edge of your seat, but rather a soothing anime that helps you wind down and relax.Overall, Unnamed Memory hits all the right spots for me, making it so that even though it doesn't really stand out in any way, it does everything it has to right, making this a solid must-watch for me. marry him.

Watching this show feels very much like someone got the order of episodes wrong because of missing elements that would connect situations and characters behaviour.While there were only a few confusing situations at first, where one could still make sense of the things missing, Episode 9 objectively made no sense at all anymore and there is a strong reason to doubt it can be saved in the last 3 Epsiodes at this point.I suggest to rather read the source material for this.

Oscar the main character seems like an interesting Chad protagonist, and Tinasha the witch is beautiful and clever. However, the main flaw is around episode 3 or 4, the plot starts jumping around, each episode afterward starts skipping scenes, and the character development unfortunately speeds up causing the audience to become very confused. It's like the series starts to rush.Tinasha and Oscar are a funny duo together, and the episodes are fun to watch their interactions, but overall the plot is badly adapted into anime.

Upon finding the witch and gazing upon her beauty, the prince decides that he should take the witch as his bride. Surely such a powerful woman would have no trouble being with him albeit his curse.Not a bad premise,...if you ask me.Unfortunately, that's where the story loses its spark.

They bicker and go through little problems until ultimately falling in love. You never really learn about anything about their families or the setting, it's just focused on their day-to-day interactions.The problem with that is, it just doesn't mix with the ultimate story the anime is trying to convey.

It focuses on Kuon's childhood, and it does what the name promises. Or that's what I wanted to say anyway.The story is rather interesting to say the least. It starts off by our princess peeing her bed, followed by scene where adults start talking how they used to pee their beds and how normal it was at that age. What that age is or was it really that normal, I cannot confirm, but based to the serious tone and the fundamentals of peeing, it probably has happened to...each and every one of them. However, these words do not seem to make Kuon feel any better about her wetting the bed. This made me obviously extremely worried about her. When I started this OVA, I surely did not know it would be this dramatic and real. Not even Clannad After Story threw such heavy subjects on the table during its run. Where things go from there, how does she overcome the dramas in her life or does she even, I advice you stop everything you do right now and go watching it. There is no point on me spoiling it. Do not even finish reading this review, just use your friendly neighborhood search engine and give it a go. It is worth it.This being released bundled with a special edition game release that costs like 150 bucks a new, you know it comes with the production values. In fact, this is only available in bluray and has the same production as the last Utawarerumono anime. It looks and sounds exactly as glorious. The music can be real chill and the atmosphere during the less dramatic moments is almost comfortingAs a conclusion, this is the best pee-centric narrative I have come across in my entire life. Only thing to come even close is the anime movie Gang-aji Ttong which English title is 'Doggy Poo' which is literally a story about a pile of dog shit.

The setting for the series is 1999 but in the manga and TV series it is very contemporary of 1982. For this movie it was updated to a more futuristic setting in order to be more consistent with Galaxy Express 999 and Space Pirate Captain Harlock. Interestingly, like the Galaxy Express 999 movie, this was released before the TV series had concluded meaning any fans watching this would have had the ending spoiled.The story is loosely based on the legend of Princess Kaguya (Hajime even mentions this at...one point after Yayoi tells him her history) and the original Japanese title is ""The New Tale of The Bamboo Cutter - Millennium Queen"" further supporting this.Queen Millennia starts off with a boy Hajime and his school teacher Yayoi. It is revealed from the very start that Yayoi is more than she seems and is actually Queen Promethium. Earth has a twin planet named LaMatel which also orbits the sun, however the orbit is so long that it only passes the sun once every thousand years. This means that the planet most of the time is freezing cold and its inhabitants are forced hibernate underground during this time. When LaMetal orbits the sun, it passes extremely close to Earth causing many natural disasters such as tsunamis and earthquakes. A secret Queen is put on Earth every thousand years to watch over it and help prepare for when the planets pass.Trouble occurs however because it is revealed by Hajime\'s astronomer uncle that LaMetal is actually on a collision course with Earth. Unbeknownst to Yayoi, the LaMetallians have sinister plans for when the planets meet and it is up to her to save the Earthlings she has come to care for.For a movie based on a 42 episode series the story never feels particularly rushed or missing any important events. There are a few characters who appear for only a few moments on screen who evidently would have been more significant in the series but the story never suffers for it. If anything I would feel that stretching it for 42 episodes would have seriously affected the pacing.The writing is similar to most other Leiji Matsumoto works being that the dialogue is often laden with exposition and is repeated often so there is never any confusion with the story. Thankfully the dialogue is much less melodramatic than Galaxy Express 999 and Yayoi is a more positive character than Maetel. Hajime is less childish than Tetsuro and there is a nice moment where he has to grow up and face what will happen. Believability is stretched though when he flies an aeroplane (I think he is meant to be 8 years old!).The story remains very linear and never really features many surprises. Everything which happens is mentioned far in advance and the final action scenes are very repetitive and seem to go on for too long compared to the rest of the movie\'s running time. The ending however is very poignant and gives a satisfying conclusion.The character design features the usual Leiji Matsumoto quirks, meaning that he only ever draws about 3 different designs. Hajime and his uncle are weird looking ""potato people"" in vein of Tetsuro in the Galaxy Express 999 series and Tochiro from Captain Harlock. Whilst this choice would be semi-understandable for Hajime, it is strange seeing his 4ft potato uncle standing next to a 6ft normal looking man. Yayoi also looks like Maetel and her assistant looks like Captain Harlock.The animation is pretty representative of the late 70\'s/early 80\'s era though it is clear this was made on a TV budget rather than a movie. Whereas the Galaxy Express 999 movie managed to elevate the visuals of the original series, Queen Millennia makes no extra efforts. The character designs remain consistent throughout and the action scenes are fluid.Instead of an opening theme there is an abstract image of a globe with ambient music in the background whilst a very dramatic voice states the premise continually for around 5 minutes. Interestingly the closing theme is a song seemingly written specifically for this movie and sung in English by American singer Dara Sedaka.A last note for those intending to cover the Leijiverse. The ending for this movie differs from that of the manga and TV series meaning that this acts as a standalone entry. This means that this movie cannot act as a prequel to Maetel Legend. one point after Yayoi tells him her history) and the original Japanese title is ""The New Tale of The Bamboo Cutter - Millennium Queen"" further supporting this.Queen Millennia starts off with a boy Hajime and his school teacher Yayoi.

The show did not follow its first episode\'s interesting premise but got full of ""filler"" episodes instead. If not fillers, al least episodes that, though entertaining enough for some, were shallow and unnecesary to the main plot (usually with a different theme each). This unaired episode is just another of those random stories.- Story: 6With no introduction at all, the OVA directly starts with the main male characters (Felicità barely appears) receiving a written invitation to gather in a room where some chocolats await. When they eat such chocolats they find out...they were one of Jolly\'s experiments (the ""man of Science"" here) and their effect makes their bodies switch. This will lead to a series of comical events that will conform the rest of the OVA.- Art: 8General animation is average (most of the episode happens indoors and few or none action scenes appear, so there\'s not much to be seen) but character design is attractive to sight (very much like in the series). Bright and clear, pretty smooth and expressive.- Sound: 7There is barely any soundtrack noticeable, the opening and ending are the same from the TV series. Catchy at the beginning, then they fall more into average but still nice enough (especially the ending with its unsual starting tune). I didn\'t find Voice Actors remarkable, but you can have a good time noticing how they change voices as characters adapt to the new person in each body.- Character: 6In the whole series there is barely any character development, so what could you expect from a short OVA? Each character\'s peculiarities are highlighted as they try to act like somebody else, but that\'s all there is to it.- Enjoyment: 7As random as the episode is, a couple of scenes are uninteresting and almost boring, but the body exchange creates lots of jokes and amusing moments that you can find quite funny if you are in a good mood.- Overall: 6.8In contrast to the series, this OVA is not pretentious at all: that\'s clear from the beginning and it doesn\'t promise you more than you will have. Do not expect a new and definite ending to the series, a serious plot development or anything meaningful at all. If there was something in Arcana Famiglia that you liked, or you just feel like having a nice time watching something silly then this might be a good choice for you.

The story wasn't that original: people swapping their body by accident is nothing new, but I couldn't stop laughing my ass off when I saw what each of the characters did in the others body. Imagine this: Debito in Luca´s body and Luca in Debito´s, funny huh? Because their personalities are so different that I found everything that they did strange and at the same time hilarious. And then there was Nova in Liberta´s body...and vice-versa, and Pace in Dante´s. This episode is worth watching.The thing that surprised me the most about this OVA episode, is that in the end the characters did learn something about the other´s person life, like how Nova discovered that children admire Liberta and how everybody is always smiling around him. And Liberta learned that people respect and care for Nova because he is like the hero of the town, always defending the citizens and fighting the “bad guys”.So in overall, I think if you watched the anime and didn't like it that much you should watch this OVA episode because it will take away that bitter taste of the anime. And if you did like Arcana Famiglia you are in luck because it will make you laugh so hard you´ll literally cry. and vice-versa, and Pace in Dante´s.

Alien 9,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1177/Alien_9,"[""Alien 9 is a bizarre and sadly very much underrated coming of age story. It is set in a school which suffers from constant daily alien attacks. Most of the aliens are best-like creatures both in mind and body. Our protagonists are three 12 year old school girls who were in one way or another recruited in the Alien control party.The basic look and premise of the show do not appear to be special from the first glance, yet mere minutes are enough to see that you are into something much more than just another high-school, moe, action anime. There are a few things...that make Alien 9 very distinct and give a bizarre and unique feel to the show. First of all the directing. It is slow and methodical with each and every shot meaning something or adding to the underlying themes and overall surreal feel of the show. The smart directing is accompanied by an offbeat soundtrack that helps build the atmosphere. The moe style that the show uses makes the disturbing parts provide even more impact. The tactic that some future shows also used, like Madoka Magica.The anime itself (at least in my understanding) is a scary allegory of growing up, blooming and being afraid to be left behind. What sets apart this coming of age story from many others is that it is made from the girl's point of view.The characters I found to be very relatable and well written. The voice actors also did a terrific job.A downside to otherwise amazing series is that it only adapts the half of the story from manga. The ending does not answer all questions and the story is ultimately left unfinished. While there were attempts to revive the show, it is still stuck in the developmental limbo and has been so for close to 15 years. It is unlikely that we will ever get the rest. Even without the ending. I do advise reading the manga as it is only 3 volumes long and the anime adapts the first 1.5 volumes.As it stands the show is still very much a fantastic, emotional and thought provoking ride through and through. Sadly this anime is very much underrated and mostly unappreciated. I urge people to give it a try, especially if you are into psychological, thought provoking and disturbing anime. that make Alien 9 very distinct and give a bizarre and unique feel to the show.

Starting off as a quirky sci-fi slice-of-life featuring cute girls fighting aliens, this 4 episode OVA lulls you into thinking it’s a fun little sci-fi adventure romp with its unassuming first episode, and then proceeds to shatter those expectations throughout it’s the rest relatively short run-time. It’s a bizarrely off-kilter yet compelling mixture of quaintness and horror that puts a uniquely sadistic twist on common anime tropes, even by today’s standards. Unfortunately, we’re ultimately provided with...only a small taste of the OVA’s potential, as its short episode count prevents it from becoming something truly substantial.The OVA follows three elementary school students who have been selected to be their school’s alien hunting squad. There’s Kumi, a girl much more mature and responsible than most kids her age, and a big sister-like figure to her friends and classmates. Kasumi, an accomplished child-prodigy, who volunteered herself to be part of the school’s alien hunting squad. And then there’s Yuri, a timid cry-baby who was selected by her classmates to be part of the alien hunting squad because she didn’t participate in any other school clubs or activities, and the show’s main focal point. The girls aided by aliens called Borgs, which perch themselves on the girls’ heads like hats, and supervised by the cheerful Ms. Hisakawa, who seems too enthusiastic to push the girls to hunt aliens.Now, if this situation off to you, it’s because it is. It does pit little girls against aliens, after all. Though it may not appear so strange at first, partly because this kind of thing is commonplace in anime, but also because the show introduces the premise as nonchalant and matter-of-fact. Nobody ever questions the ethics of sending little girls to catch dangerous aliens, Ms. Hisakawa seems to be more pre-occupied with monitoring and taking the girls than the safety of the girls. Early on, the show itself treats some of the alien encounters with a certain lack of seriousness and urgency, often showing them in fun little montages, as if to intentionally downplay the severity of the situation. Even Yuri’s scaredy-cat tendencies are played for some laughs. The show takes advantage of the tropes of the medium to fool the audience into thinking it’s a fun little show, and not questioning the bizarre and unethical nature of what is demanded of the girls.Of course, it the show doesn’t stay this way for too long, as the danger the girls are in become very apparent and the show’s content becomes progressively more disturbing. After some events that would traumatize any elementary school student, the show stops treating Yuri’s crying fits as comical and more as the harsh and horrifying truth of the situation. Yuri, for all her crying, is right to be scared; serving as the anxious fear-ridden heart of the show. She’s a shy, timid girl forced against her own will to fight aliens and continuously pressured to do so despite her objections. She even starts having nightmares about her ordeals, which are colorful and even child-like depictions of her rational fears. The contrast between the cartoony visual direction and the darker thematic content of the show make the experience even more bizarre and unsettling. Even when the show is at its most surreal and violent, the art retains a certain cutesiness which makes it all the more sinister.Yuri isn’t the only one that suffers psychologically as the show progresses, however. Mature and confident Kumi, whom Yuri heavily relies on, and even the enthusiastic Kasumi have their own mental and emotional scars. Their familial issues and struggles with responsibility and loneliness are just as relatable as Yuri’s fear, if not even more so. Unfortunately, the OVA’s short episode count only allows a very light examination of their psyches. This inconclusiveness envelops the OVA as a whole; the plot largely goes unexplained and left with a lot of loose ends, including a cryptic final shot which is frustrating on multiple levels. Regrettably, this severely undercuts the show’s impact. For its ambitions, Alien 9 suffers from a curious lack of purpose. It succeeds in subverting commonly used tropes and weaving a grim tale from a cutesy aesthetic, but the hanging plot and rushed catharsis leaves a certain lack of fulfillment as the OVA ends. Sadly, this ultimately devalues what the show accomplishes to an extent, making it a half-fulfilled promise of what it could have been.The show was produced in the early 2000s, a time when anime was transitioning from hand-drawn cells to digital cells, and it’s pretty easy to tell just by looking at the show. The digital coloring and animation was not the most refined, certainly not as refined as the anime series of the mid-2000s onward. It’s colorful and animated well, but the show doesn’t really pop visually outside of a few creepy surreal moments. The character designs are very purposely made cutesy, with emphasis on the characters round and expressive faces. The alien designs look more weird than threatening; they look appropriately otherworldly, but also oddly unmemorable. The Borgs in particular are peculiar looking, being frog-like creatures with wings that double as hats. The music, like everything else in the show, is deceptively light and bouncy. Mostly composed of xylophone, bells, flutes, and electronic beats, it’s an energetic soundtrack that progressively gets stranger as the show delves into darker material.Alien 9 is a nifty little oddity that has unfortunately become obsolete as time has passed. Its deceptive façade of cute characters and wacky hijinks with more sinister intentions it hides makes the OVA quite a novelty. Unfortunately, it never actually develops or expands on its themes, characters, or plot. This really diminishes the show’s value to little more than an interesting idea. This lack of development compounded with the upsurge of darker magical girl series pretty much ensure that Alien 9 is doomed to be an obscure novelty from the early 2000s, and nothing more. only a small taste of the OVA’s potential, as its short episode count prevents it from becoming something truly substantial.The OVA follows three elementary school students who have been selected to be their school’s alien hunting squad.

Thinking this was the case, I bought it. I thought that they must have been exaggerating or in complete error when I saw the 13+ rating. Not. Despite its cheery and cutesy character design, this is a very dark and disturbing anime.I should have known something was up when I kept getting bad feelings for no reason. Things happened in the anime that made zero sense, and yet I felt completely horrible while and after watching it. When I finished the series (4 30-minute episodes), I couldn't...watch anime for the rest of the week. I felt dirty, like I had done something very wrong. Although the anime was violent and disturbing, it didn't seem enough to affect me for days. Then, I discovered that Alien 9 is riddled with symbolism - and some of it not so hidden. To call it dark would be an understatement. There are blatant sexual instances represented, expressions of deep and black pain, and perverted thought processes. I would never recommend this to anyone. I have a feeling that someone who has experienced firsthand some of the horrible things the symbolism depicts would pick up on the innuendoes instantly.Last, but not least, there is some very light yuri (girl's love) tone in the anime - and it's more obvious in the manga.All in all, Alien 9 is, in short, to be avoided like the plague. watch anime for the rest of the week.

There are blatant sexual instances represented, expressions of deep and black pain, and perverted thought processes. I would never recommend this to anyone. I have a feeling that someone who has experienced firsthand some of the horrible things the symbolism depicts would pick up on the innuendoes instantly.Last, but not least, there is some very light yuri (girl's love) tone in the anime - and it's more obvious in the manga.All in all, Alien 9 is, in short, to be avoided like the plague."", 'This is one of the worst anime I have ever seen, bar none. I first watched this when I was getting into anime to be honest, a time when a feeble young mind tends to be overjoyed when it sees any anime, a time before standards start to be formed. Well, this was the anime that spurred on any sort of quality control in my mind, this was the anime that made me say ""some anime are utter and complete crap"", way to hit the very bottom of my standards, Alien Nine. And way to reference Cowboy Bebop on your box to make it look...like it might be something actually good. I enjoyed Eiken ten times more than this. Yes, Eiken.Story: 1A 6th grader gets picked for the one class job she doesn\'t want: the alien hunter. Why she wouldn\'t this job is beyond me, there are two other people who also do the jobs from other classes who will do all the work for her and they don\'t have to do homework as a perk. So the episodes mostly show them fighting some alien that is heavily implied to have been put there on purpose just so they could kill it while we see the main girl, Yuri Ootani (as they will repeat 10 times in a row before the opening credits so you damn well know) cry and whine the entire show about how unfair it is that she has to fight these aliens and someone else can\'t do it instead. It only gets worse when the story tries to pretend it\'s deep but we\'re still watching a main who is actually more of a whinebag then Shinji Ikari himself whine. Anything it tries to imply to be deep is incredibly obvious to begin with so we\'re just left watching incredibly annoying characters for 4 episodes. It\'s hard to care about a story that wants to be all mature and dark when it fails it so clearly. Not to mention that the story just....ends, no closure or anything, it basically tells you to read the manga if you gave a crap about this as is.Character: also a 1Yuri Ootani is the main and dear god does she whine the entire time and I mean the entire time. She cries when playing a recorder, when taking a bath, when trying to fight aliens in which she stands back and cries the entire time while her teammates tell her to stop crying, it\'s like this entire show revolves around her crying. The other two teammates....not quite as bad. There\'s the normal girl and she\'s pretty much unremarkable. She neither adds much nor subtracts much to the show and she\'s obviously the best character if only because she doesn\'t flat out suck. Then there\'s the other girl who reminds me of Violet from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, an overachieving little smart alec who is annoying because she spends most of the series making strange noises then she rather turns her brain off and starts acting weird. You\'d think this might make her interesting as she\'s acting a bit odd, but it only serves to make her look incredibly pretentious. The borgs...not that bad I guess, they just never bother to explain them or any of their motives. Much like the normal girl, they\'re just kinda there as characters, although they\'re supposed to sync up with their partners and act as attack weapons of some sort, but they don\'t really do all that much as characters per se.Art: 6, Sound: 7Sound is pretty good, I won\'t lie, the OP is a bit addicting. The art is...ok, I can say putting cutesy characters on ""darker"" material is new, Osamu Tezuka has been doing that for ages and now we\'ve got better darker material drawn cutesy with Kaiba anyway. It\'s nothing terribly standout, it\'s just kinda there.Overall: 1This is just torture to watch. You hear so many decent ideas above and every single one of them falls flat on its face thanks in no part to a terrible cast of annoying and boringly infuriating characters. And I\'ve heard arguments this is deep, it really isn\'t, it tries to be pretentious at best in trying to force meanings that really aren\'t there and having only 4 episodes just made it a cocktease for a manga that I sure as hell don\'t want to read (and in fact haven\'t). At least I wouldn\'t have to hear Yuri cry every 3 minutes for the entire show in print format. Don\'t watch this, not ever, I\'d sooner cut my own limb off then watch this again, but if anyone is in that stage where all anime is automatically good, watching something terrible like this to set your standards of good and bad back on track. like it might be something actually good.

Those stupid adults, they can’t fight off these alien monsters. Give it to the children. We’ll set up a club, or pilot a giant robot, or gain magical powers, and then we’ll show those baddies what for. Occasionally though, along comes another show that subverts that formula (apparently the word ‘subversion’ is a dirty word in anime reviewing circles, but I can’t think of a better word and making self-important nerds angry on the internet is fun so I’m going to use it anyway) and demonstrates what would actually happen if you gave...a child that amount of power and responsibility. Evangelion does that with mecha. Madoka does that with magical girls. Alien 9 does that with a little girl being chosen to fight aliens.The story is set in a world where aliens are invading, of which they’re not doing a particularly good job of because they keep sending down the equivalent of dogs and bulls instead of laser wielding elite warriors. Or maybe they have no intention of invading, since they have aliens who sit on humans heads to protect them from monsters and helpfully lick their backs for them. Alien 9 is based on a manga that wasn’t completed when the anime was made, so not an awful lot is explained about the setting.The important part is Otani, a 12 year old girl drafted in her school’s Alien Defence Team. She only got onto the team because nobody else really wanted to, which the club supervisor points out is surprising. I mean, you get off class when aliens invade. You get an awesome pair of rollerblades and a sweet hat. OK you have to fight off aliens in who are intent on ending your life and keep exploding with green blood everywhere, but that’s OK because your hat will keep you safe with its drill tentacle things.The set up is very much like an awesome kids show where the children join a club and beat the smelly aliens. In reality though, when faced with these scary, angry, vicious aliens, Otani is petrified. Not simply frightened, but complete deadening fear where she can’t be calm as long as she has this post. The show really does drive home how much terror she feels towards aliens, to the point that she can’t function properly as a human being.What the show probably does best is showing her interactions with other characters and how they treat her fear. Her teammates and friends think they can help her by being supportive, but that completely underestimates the extent of her fear. There’s that truly scrawpy moment where her feelings are channelled directly into the other two’s minds (I think it was through some kind of mindshare the aliens they wear on their heads enable? As I said, not much is explained about the world in this show) and the two of them collapse on the ground in utter terror. The subsequent looks on their faces when they see Otani again show how little they understood of her fear before then.The club supervisor’s treatment of Otani is a stark contrast to Otani’s feelings. She treats Otani as though she’ll obviously eventually get over it if you just treat her normally, poo-pooing her requests to leave the club. She keeps hold of this idea that eventually she’ll be a good enough fighter by the end of the year when they ‘need them’ (for what reason they need fighters I don’t know, probably have to read the manga for that). It leads to these scenes where you’ll have Otani in a petrified state lying in a heap on the floor as her friends scream her name, followed by the supervisor balancing her pen between her nose and her mouth, being lightly scolded by the school principal for allowing the aliens in captivity to be killed.Alien 9 does have some obvious issues, such as the one I’ve been alluding to frequently in this post. It’s only a 4 episode OVA and it’s part of a much longer manga, so very little is explained about the world. This also means there’s relatively little development of the characters, beyond them getting even more petrified as it goes on. To be honest though, this isn’t as much as an issue at I’m making it out to be. The story is primarily about how absolutely fucking petrified Otani is, and the show does a fine job of getting that across. The rest is just set dressing.No, my real problem with this anime is that…well, I didn’t enjoy watching it. It achieves exactly what it sets out to do in portraying this character having her life deadened by fear of a role she has been pushed into, but the experience of watching that play out isn’t enjoyable. Otani is such a wimp at everything in life that it’s difficult to feel any attachment to her. The story has no emotional highs or pay-off at the end. It’s just deadening fear the entire way through. There’s plenty of anime that are gruelling and harrowing to sit through that I absolutely love. Berserk, Infinite Ryvius, heck even the two I referenced at the start, Madoka and Evangelion. Those anime have things like narrative arcs, character progression, thrilling visuals, humour (no, really), emotional payoffs. The gruel and suffering bring about these feelings, while Alien 9 doesn’t. It doesn’t even try to because it’s so focused on the feeling of fear.Alien 9 achieves what it sets out to do. It’s definitely left an effect on me too, as proven by the fact that simply hearing the BGM when I went back to take screencaps made the hairs on the back of my neck rise. But the experience isn’t particularly enjoyable. It’s for a similar reason I don’t really have any intention in checking out the manga. As a short OVA series, it’s effective at getting that feeling across it’s supposed to be portraying, but I don’t know if I could handle any more without getting tired of it. a child that amount of power and responsibility.

To be frank this anime to me was not that enjoyable but it does something that most anime don't. Alien Nine is full of symbolism providing an insight into the life of the average Japanese student.It starts off really lame. But after forcing myself to watch it to the end i still didn't get the story. it was not until i found out the anime was all about symbolism that i finally began to understand the true meaning of the anime. (for u to find out)If...u do decide to take a swing at this anime i suggest u read the article from this site after: http://anime.mikomi.org/episode/914/Will.htmlwarning it contains spoilershowever it does explain all the symbolism and made me understand the story better. It changed the score from a 4 to a 6. keep in mind that im very strict with my anime. u do decide to take a swing at this anime i suggest u read the article from this site after: http://anime.mikomi.org/episode/914/Will.htmlwarning it contains spoilershowever it does explain all the symbolism and made me understand the story better.

I guess it takes a lot of inspiration from Evangelion, which also gets under my skin with its specific style during the psyche exploration scenes, so maybe there's that. I do believe that the people who made Alien 9 have confused repeatedly featuring minutes and uninterrupted minutes of little girls making whiny noises as being effective and Edgy™ and/or good writing. It is not. "", 'Reaches a high point when it analogizes adolescent sexual attraction and subsequent assault, but then proceeds to come off the rails when trying to deal with themes of loneliness and the inherent value of sentient life. The same can be said to occur as a result of expanding focus on Kumi and Kasumi, relative to Yuri. That being said, there are a number of tools and concepts that can make for fascinating fiction in series given proper time. This OVA just happens to feel like a bright spark of potential that never really becomes the fire it probably deserved to be. ', 'Quite an interesting and dark series, but has a very annoying lead and pacing issues.PLOT: I wasn’t overly impressed by the premise and found the characters irritating – especially Yuri who did not stop yapping for the entire flipping series! But I really liked the atmosphere of this show. It immediately put me in mind of Boogiepop Phantom and the better parts of Narutaru, as Alien 9 can be extremely dark and disturbing at times. At other times I was bored out of my mind (the duration of episode 3 had this effect on me). Its a mixed bag which isn’t really a good thing...considering this was only 4 episodes – it felt a lot longer due to the tedious pacing. Again I was strongly reminded of Narutaru, which was unfortunately not a good thing. The last episode was strange, disturbing and it felt like nothing was resolved – which further added to my annoyance with this OVA.ANIMATION: The animation is good as expected from JC Staff – not a fan of the character designs, but I liked the contrast between the cute little girls and the creepy ugly alien designs. The action sequences are smooth and well choreographed, with innovative use of the borg’s abilities.MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: The OP & ED are not the best – I skipped over them after the 1st listen, but the background music is excellent at creating a good, tense atmosphere. Voice acting was unremarkable throughout.Overall I wasn’t overly impressed by Alien 9 – granted it was nothing like I was expecting. I was fully bracing myself for a manic, comedic action series when I read the summary – it delivered something unexpected and dark. I would have scored it higher if the pacing was better, there was actual plot resolution and if  the characters more likeable. considering this was only 4 episodes – it felt a lot longer due to the tedious pacing.

I’ve been told that I underrate most of the stuff I watch and I gave it a 9. Did I do it to sync my score up with the title because I have a severe case of obsessive compulsive disorder? Possibly, but let’s delve a little deeper.Some of the themes Alien 9 ruminates on include weakness, fear, loneliness, blossoming and completely unwanted sexuality. “But Boss Chrissy,” you might say “the cover here looks like a few moe girls with butterfly nets and roller skates. I assume they’re chasing cute little aliens....In fact this is just Pokémon isn’t it you sly fox?!” That’s where we run into problems I reckon. Folks go into Alien 9 expecting it to be something it’s not (which I believe is completely intentional). It lures you in with a sweet glass of lemonade and then hurls a bitter glass of sorrow straight at your unsuspecting noggin.So if we aren’t watching a cute girls chasing cute aliens show what are we watching? Something very special indeed as far as I’m concerned. Alien 9 made me feel…weird. A strange, almost guilty kind of weird. The series focuses on Yuri, the most reluctant of reluctant heroes. And my god does Yuri suck at catching aliens. And you know how in like, every other anime, the hero like…gets better and stuff? Yuri…never…does. There is no badass scene of breathtaking alien catching action, no steady improvement shown in a training montage. Just an unending sense of inadequacy, a sense of guilt for having to completely rely on others and the dreadful feeling that Yuri has to wake up the next day and do it all over again. And the next day too. And the next.“But Chrissy! What about my power fantasy!? I don’t want to be subjected to how a small child might really feel were they put in this horrible situation!” Well sir, neither did a whole lot of other people, which probably explains why this show is rated so low and why people think Shinji is whiny. But I digress. Yes, if you watch Alien 9 you’re going to see some things that will make you feel awkward. There is a certain unease the series just radiates, and as the story unfolds the feeling increases.  But dammit this is art! This is Madoka before Madoka! Art should make you feel uncomfortable! Art should impose itself on you! I want my anime weird and dark and frankly kind of mean! I want my anime like Alien 9!Other things I liked about Alien 9 that you probably won’t like about Alien 9:The soundtrack: for the most part it’s completely insane.The voice acting: Yuri sounds like an actual person as opposed to a character. This one’s hard to explain but I think you’ll get what I mean if you watch the series. I feel like an entire essay can be written on her performance alone and how vulnerable she sounds which totally escalates the strangeness and queasiness Alien 9 conjures up in the viewer.In closing: I bet I could write a novella about Alien 9 but I’m a tired boy. Sometimes life is weird and uncomfortable and gross, and I know a lot of folks watch anime to ESCAPE from these unfortunate adjectives. But Alien 9’s not gonna let you do that. Let it in. Let it change you.Alien 9: Consistently weird and uncomfortable and gross. In fact this is just Pokémon isn’t it you sly fox?!” That’s where we run into problems I reckon.

Let it change you.Alien 9: Consistently weird and uncomfortable and gross.', ""Man what the hell do I even say about this one?This is an anime that works much more solidly on a thematic and symbolic level than it does on a basic plot level, with most of the actions and scenarios set up for meaning rather than for story. This isn't necessarily an inherently bad way to go about constructing a series, but it will absolutely put off any viewers that aren't prepared for this kind of narrative.Personally, this is the kind of anime that I've been craving for a lot as of late since I've been looking for shows that break the mold of what...the current industry has become, so I found Alien Nine to be quite thrilling, but in a much more unnerving and unsettling way, which is another style that I've been craving a lot lately. Perhaps the ending of Berserk has finally broken me, but that's neither here nor there.This anime delves into a lot of themes relating to puberty and the general discomfort and fear of growing up, with some scenes being nice and subtle, and other quite literally bashing you over the head. While this might appear as having a sporadic and uneven tone to some, I think it actually fits the allegory for adolescence quite nicely.It's also a horror anime in the sense of what I mean when I talk about true horror, in that there is something outside of your control bearing down on you, digging into your weak points and dragging you through some truly dreadful experiences. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if someone told me that Gen Urobuchi had seen this anime at some point and let some of its themes influence his work on Madoka Magica. This is purely a hypothetical conjecture obviously and I'm not in any way suggesting that Alien Nine had a direct influence on Madoka, but they do seem rather similar to me when it comes to the terrifying circumstances that both casts have to deal with.However, I do have to knock off a few points for almost wrapping up the ending nicely, but then throwing in a scene at the very end that leaves a gaping hole in the conclusion that desperately needs more content that will never be animated due to lack of popularity.Much like the story, the characters operate on a much more symbolic level than a logical one, and because there's a lot of implicit meaning behind their actions that isn't openly stated, a lot of what these characters do may come off as irrational and just plain stupid sometimes. I did find Yuri to be an excellent youth protagonist, though a tiny bit annoying sometimes, and watching her struggle with the aforementioned themes, and even just her daily school life, made the peak moments of terror all the more traumatic and unnerving.The animation is handled by J.C. Staff, and while I'm not gonna pretend that the animation holds of really well (this is an OVA from the early 2000s after all), I am surprised by how much detail went into both the environments and the alien designs. There's also a fluidity of movement that you don't see very often outside of the experimental OVA field and I wish I could see more often in regular TV anime, though I believe it would be more accurate to say that I wish there were more TV anime with darker, more emotional themes and experimental storytelling methods that can push the boundaries of what a visual medium can do. The character designs are fairly simple and do their job in creating unique and memorable characters, but the consistency does leave a lot to be desired. There's also some pretty nasty CG that pops up constantly, which put a big damper on some of the more important scenes.As for the soundtrack, I've noticed that a lot of the most striking soundtracks come from works that have less of a need to stick to a traditional classical or rock sound, and that is certainly the case with Kuniaki Haishima's work on this anime. There really isn't a selection of words or phrases that I could describe this soundtrack with other than bizarre, with a lot of different styles and sounds crashing together to create some extremely unsettling and agitating tunes, and I will definitely be coming back to this soundtrack in the near future.Overall, if you're not one to stray from traditional storytelling and dialogue, then you will probably have a lot of difficulties watching this anime, but if you're like me and feel that you can get suckered into this strange world, only to have your heart slump down awkwardly in your chest as the fear and anxiety wash over you, then give this one a try.I was a bit indecisive about what kind of rating I wanted to give this one, but then I remembered that I completely ignored my dinner just so that I could finish the series, so I guess I have my answer. the current industry has become, so I found Alien Nine to be quite thrilling, but in a much more unnerving and unsettling way, which is another style that I've been craving a lot lately. Perhaps the ending of Berserk has finally broken me, but that's neither here nor there.This anime delves into a lot of themes relating to puberty and the general discomfort and fear of growing up, with some scenes being nice and subtle, and other quite literally bashing you over the head. While this might appear as having a sporadic and uneven tone to some, I think it actually fits the allegory for adolescence quite nicely.It's also a horror anime in the sense of what I mean when I talk about true horror, in that there is something outside of your control bearing down on you, digging into your weak points and dragging you through some truly dreadful experiences. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if someone told me that Gen Urobuchi had seen this anime at some point and let some of its themes influence his work on Madoka Magica. This is purely a hypothetical conjecture obviously and I'm not in any way suggesting that Alien Nine had a direct influence on Madoka, but they do seem rather similar to me when it comes to the terrifying circumstances that both casts have to deal with.However, I do have to knock off a few points for almost wrapping up the ending nicely, but then throwing in a scene at the very end that leaves a gaping hole in the conclusion that desperately needs more content that will never be animated due to lack of popularity.Much like the story, the characters operate on a much more symbolic level than a logical one, and because there's a lot of implicit meaning behind their actions that isn't openly stated, a lot of what these characters do may come off as irrational and just plain stupid sometimes. I did find Yuri to be an excellent youth protagonist, though a tiny bit annoying sometimes, and watching her struggle with the aforementioned themes, and even just her daily school life, made the peak moments of terror all the more traumatic and unnerving.The animation is handled by J.C. Staff, and while I'm not gonna pretend that the animation holds of really well (this is an OVA from the early 2000s after all), I am surprised by how much detail went into both the environments and the alien designs. There's also a fluidity of movement that you don't see very often outside of the experimental OVA field and I wish I could see more often in regular TV anime, though I believe it would be more accurate to say that I wish there were more TV anime with darker, more emotional themes and experimental storytelling methods that can push the boundaries of what a visual medium can do.

It starts out counting votes and doesn’t tell us what though the girl that seems to be called most often doesn’t want to be. It turns out that she is going to be part of an alien fighting squad. Now something bothers me about this… why are they having elementary school children dealing with aliens and not adults? Not to mention, a girl who seems to be the weakest link is our main character. The whole time I watched it, I was thinking, Our main character everybody, the crybaby in the back row. She’s a...very big spaze who seems to just freak out about every little thing.The characters are all over the place. Yuri is pretty useless, Kumi is pretty much the always the leader, and Kasumi is the little miss perfect. Frankly, they just seem like a very miss matched grouping.

Oh ya, because they are pretty much assimilated into the damn alien fighter thing. Oh ya, can someone tell me what the Borg is doing with their tongues whenever their licking the girls backs?There is a lot of filler in this show it seems, and a lot of it feels like nothing really happens except one or two little things like seeing the personalities that are actually rather shallow.

This is only 4 episodes long, give us something more!The Animation is alright, though all the characters have a rather round face with no chins or noses when looking at a side profile.

The artwork seems a bit like the first Digimon Adventures Movie. It’s just pretty run down.The Music is alright, though it’s not the best. It could use a little more in order to stand out instead of the odd little things. The Voices are somewhat alright, though some of them seem to squeak. This is the English version that I’m talking about. The girls just feel like they are saying there lines half assed, actually, all the characters are. They just don’t seem to be able to do very good voices. When Yuri keeps saying Kumi Kumi all the time, it really sounds like she is saying ‘kill me’.

It\'s a lot like a wooden roller coaster at a tiny, local amusement park that probably hasn\'t passed safety inspection in a few years. Rickety, probably not constructed properly, may have some missing tracks but the paint job looks good, and even though you were so terrified you almost soiled yourself by golly you had a lot of fun(?). Like the best roller coasters, it\'s best the first go-round when you have no previous knowledge of what to...expect.

However, it\'s still enjoyable, and I love early 2000s anime color palettes.Sound: 10/10. This may come across as overly high praise, but the sound design on this show was phenomenal. The soundtrack is appropriately cute and creepy, with plinking piano and synth keys combined with off-key and minor chorded choir hums. It is absolutely terrifying.Character: 5/10.

A lot of exposition is dumped onto the viewer so fleetingly that sometimes it\'s hard to figure out what\'s going on in each girls\' head. I became surprisingly attached to Yuri, which is odd considering how much I usually dislike cry baby characters. However, in the context of Alien 9, you really sympathize with her tears.

There\'s not a lot of actual development, and if I was scoring only that I\'d give it about a 1. As a character *study*, particularly a study of Yuri, it\'s very fascinating.

The irony here is that too often it is the writer that is in dire need of understanding what it is they are trying to say. What starts out with an amazing concept rapidly devolves into a seemingly endless rinse/repeat cycle.The synopsis is misleading, so I include one here.Alien Nine's world has us introduced to sixth grade students that are either selected to be, or elect to be, alien fighters-in-training. To assist our future heroes, living (alien) creatures are attached like helmets upon their...heads. These creatures are symbiotic in that they protect our young trainees from harm while also living off their human waste (sweat, dry skin etc). It should be noted that this Anime is NOT for children.What's a character driven story without conflict? Nothing. Without character development? Nothing. Here we have character in abundance. In fact, our lead character is terrified of aliens! Great so far! So, viewers, what would one expect in terms of development? You guessed it! Does it happen?

Beyond that, there is little to recommend."", ""Kids placed in dangerous positions bearing great responsibility has proved a hugely popular premise over the years, 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' and 'Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica' being but two examples. It is surprising, then, that 'Alien Nine' hasn't shared anywhere near the same success as the aforementioned two. A shame, as although 'Alien Nine' hasn't had the same backing and remains incomplete, it's still a unique, unforgettable experience. One reason that people come away from 'Alien Nine' disappointed is that they aren't sure what to expect, so before I continue I need to get this out of the way.Despite its cheerful OP and cute character designs,...'Alien Nine' isn't an innocent slice-of-life. The imagery is very disturbing and the events that transpire are quite frankly horrifying. The girls are constantly at odds with life-threatening alien encounters and bizarre mind-rapes, generally resulting in the main character sobbing into the ground. For all its merits, 'Alien Nine' is not an easy show to watch.Now without further ado, onto the review!The first voice we hear in 'Alien Nine' is that of a student counting votes. “Ootani-san, Ootani-san, Ootani-san...”, are the words spoken as our distressed protagonist, Yuri Ootani, looks on. It turns out the votes are to decide who joins the Alien Party, a club concerned with capturing aliens. Unfortunately for Yuri, the result is unanimous. Joined by fellow sixth graders Kumi Kawamura and Kasumi Tomine, they form a symbiotic relationship with their Borg and set out to capture aliens. Little else can be said without giving spoilers, but ultimately 'Alien Nine' is about how kids react when forced to grow up.What most sets 'Alien Nine' apart from similar shows is its distinct atmosphere. Young girls are expected to deal with ghastly aliens, yet the narrative treats this as if it's normal. Regardless of the fact that Yuri is clearly not cut out for the job, she receives little sympathy from her friends, parents or teachers. In fact, her struggle is trivialised by comments like, “you can skip classes and get no homework, right?”. Even the music and cinematography seem to be against Yuri. The only ones who can see just how wrong everything is is the audience, who are helpless to influence the outcome. It's a peculiar atmosphere, but wholly effective.Another interesting quality of 'Alien Nine' is the number of different ways it can be interpreted. It can be viewed as a scare allegory for growing up, an anime about overcoming sexual abuse or even taken on a literal level. Those who fear that 'Alien Nine' is mere shock value can lay to rest those concerns, as this is a mature story immersed in symbolism and disturbing imagery.Unfortunately, 'Alien Nine' suffers from being incomplete. The OVA only covers 14 chapters of the manga and while plans were announced to make a sequel it has been over 10 years since, so the chances we'll ever get one are unlikely. Consequently, background information and certain character motivations are missing, and after everything the characters endure there is no emotional pay-off. While scans for the completed manga can be found online, it lacks the atmosphere that made the anime an interesting viewing in the first place. A shame, as if any anime deserves a sequel it's 'Alien Nine'.Moving on, a big part of what makes the story successful is the characters and how they react to the situations they are put in. While the cast isn't huge it works to the anime's advantage as little time is wasted on unimportant side or tertiary characters. Given the focus is mainly on Yuri it would make sense to begin with her.Of the three members that encompass the Alien Party, Yuri is the one most averse to capturing aliens. She is the  least capable member, oft breaking out into tears when confronted by a problem. While her incessant crying may grate on some, it's important to bear in mind that Yuri is a young girl who's been forced into things she clearly isn't ready for. The torment she endures is incredible, yet she receives little sympathy.The second member, Kumi, is perhaps the most interesting. In contrast to Yuri's over-dependence on others, Kumi is very self-reliant. Her father died when she was four years old, so was forced into becoming independent at a young age. Kumi had previously been student president for a number of years and her motivation behind joining the Alien Party was so that she no longer had to help other kids deal with their problems. Ironically, this is exactly what she ends up doing for Yuri upon joining.The final member, Kasumi, is your typical “Ms. Perfect” archetype. She's an exceptionally high achiever that does everything with aplomb. Given Kasumi's archetype she does takes a back seat position to Yuri and Kumi, so she isn't quite as interesting. However, her relationship with her brother is a significant point in the latter episodes and adds another dimension to her character.Outside of the main three, there's their teacher,  Hisakawa. Despite her kind demeanour, there's a constant sense that there's more to her character than she let's on. Unfortunately, because 'Alien Nine' is incomplete we don't get to learn much about her. There's also Miyu, Yuri's best friend and the only character seen with the main three during their leisure. Her role is to provide Yuri with emotional support during the early episodes, but otherwise she isn't seen much. Finally there's the Borg, the aliens that sit atop the girls' heads. They aren't awfully involved, generally just mirroring their partners' personalities, but they do have their moments. Overall, the secondary characters do feel a bit under-utilised, but given the length of 'Alien Nine' one can't really complain.The biggest issue surrounding the characters derives from 'Alien Nine' being an incomplete adaptation. It was  made with a sequel in mind and without it the characters can come across as one-dimensional. There is little backdrop and what character development there is is scarce. The characters therefore feel inorganic. That is, they feel more like tools to drive the story forward rather than real girls. Consequently, it is harder for the audience to relate to and sympathise with the characters. One can't be too harsh on 'Alien Nine' for this as it seemed there was going to be a sequel, and had it materialised then this most likely wouldn't have been a problem. However, as it is it proves a weakness.On the technical side of things, 'Alien Nine' was produced in 2001 by J.C.Staff, a studio renowned for its moe character designs. Unlike other seinen titles being released at the time, 'Alien Nine' decided against a realistic art style and instead opted for cute character designs. This deceives people into thinking it's simply another innocent slice-of-life, but the reality couldn't be further from the truth.The girls' light, round faces with cute, disproportionately sized eyes and ears are contrasted with the dark, grotesque, insect/amphibian inspired character designs of the aliens. It's a very effective juxtaposition as it makes the events that transpire so much more disturbing.The colour palette used in 'Alien Nine' is impressively varied. Light blue skies and purple leaves are used to paint an idyllic image of school during Spring term while the dark and grey of the alien storage room reminds us not to let our guard down. Lighting is also used to great effect – foreboding early on that 'Alien Nine' isn't what it initially seems.For all the stick that CGI gets, 'Alien Nine' gets it spot on. The drills that extend from the Borg are genuinely terrifying and don't feel at all out of place. There isn't a huge amount otherwise, but what little there is works to the OVA's advantage.The cinematography in 'Alien Nine' is instrumental in creating its unique atmosphere. Everything is filmed in a way that makes Yuri appear completely helpless. Low angles are used to make the aliens more intimidating while a variety of other creative camera angles are used to great effect. A special mention also has to be made for the brilliantly shot dream sequences. They felt like something you'd see in a Satoshi Kon film, and I mean that very much as a compliment.Overall, 'Alien Nine' is a visual delight, easy on the eye and instrumental in creating its atmosphere, but what about the audio? Does it meet the high standards set by the art? Short answer no, but the sound in 'Alien Nine' still has plenty going for it.The OP, 'Flower Psychedelic', is a comically cheerful track not unlike something you'd hear in a kids' anime. Its lyrics foreshadow what 'Alien Nine' is about, but musically it's nothing special. By contrast, 'Rebirth' by en avant is much more in key with the cruel nature of the show. It's a slow, sombre song with reflective lyrics sung over piano work - a fitting note to end each episode on.'Alien Nine' has a variety of BGM, some subtle and some blunt. Woodwind and brass instrumentals are used often while computerised beats can also be heard now and again. Despite not being a very memorable OST, it is aided by the brilliant music direction. For example, in the first episode the Alien Fighters attempt to capture their first alien. What should be terrifying is treated as fun and games because of the playful music that accompanies it. Soundtrack dissonance is pivotal in creating the unique atmosphere felt in 'Alien Nine'.Judging the quality of voice acting in a foreign language is never easy, but it sounded competent to my non-fluent ears. The Alien Fighters sounded as sixth grade Japanese girls should and did a good job of bringing them to life. Hisakawa's Seiyuu (who, incidentally, shares the same name as her character) did a good job at having her appear overtly kind, yet suspicious. However, I'm on the fence regarding the Borg. They didn't sound like aliens, but whether that's what 'Alien Nine' was going for I don't know. I haven't seen the English dub, so I can't comment on that.In conclusion, 'Alien Nine' is more of an experience than anything else. It's a difficult show to watch, and I'm still not sure whether I enjoyed it, but the fact it still lingers in my mind is testament to how much of an impact it made. The biggest thing working against 'Alien Nine' is that it's incomplete, but if you can overlook that then it's a good investment of one's time. As long as one knows what to expect from 'Alien Nine' then it's usually a fulfilling experience. 'Alien Nine' isn't an innocent slice-of-life.

Light blue skies and purple leaves are used to paint an idyllic image of school during Spring term while the dark and grey of the alien storage room reminds us not to let our guard down. Lighting is also used to great effect – foreboding early on that 'Alien Nine' isn't what it initially seems.For all the stick that CGI gets, 'Alien Nine' gets it spot on. The drills that extend from the Borg are genuinely terrifying and don't feel at all out of place. There isn't a huge amount otherwise, but what little there is works to the OVA's advantage.The cinematography in 'Alien Nine' is instrumental in creating its unique atmosphere. Everything is filmed in a way that makes Yuri appear completely helpless. Low angles are used to make the aliens more intimidating while a variety of other creative camera angles are used to great effect. A special mention also has to be made for the brilliantly shot dream sequences. They felt like something you'd see in a Satoshi Kon film, and I mean that very much as a compliment.Overall, 'Alien Nine' is a visual delight, easy on the eye and instrumental in creating its atmosphere, but what about the audio? Does it meet the high standards set by the art? Short answer no, but the sound in 'Alien Nine' still has plenty going for it.The OP, 'Flower Psychedelic', is a comically cheerful track not unlike something you'd hear in a kids' anime. Its lyrics foreshadow what 'Alien Nine' is about, but musically it's nothing special. By contrast, 'Rebirth' by en avant is much more in key with the cruel nature of the show. It's a slow, sombre song with reflective lyrics sung over piano work - a fitting note to end each episode on.'Alien Nine' has a variety of BGM, some subtle and some blunt. Woodwind and brass instrumentals are used often while computerised beats can also be heard now and again. Despite not being a very memorable OST, it is aided by the brilliant music direction. For example, in the first episode the Alien Fighters attempt to capture their first alien. What should be terrifying is treated as fun and games because of the playful music that accompanies it. Soundtrack dissonance is pivotal in creating the unique atmosphere felt in 'Alien Nine'.Judging the quality of voice acting in a foreign language is never easy, but it sounded competent to my non-fluent ears. The Alien Fighters sounded as sixth grade Japanese girls should and did a good job of bringing them to life. Hisakawa's Seiyuu (who, incidentally, shares the same name as her character) did a good job at having her appear overtly kind, yet suspicious. However, I'm on the fence regarding the Borg. They didn't sound like aliens, but whether that's what 'Alien Nine' was going for I don't know. I haven't seen the English dub, so I can't comment on that.In conclusion, 'Alien Nine' is more of an experience than anything else. It's a difficult show to watch, and I'm still not sure whether I enjoyed it, but the fact it still lingers in my mind is testament to how much of an impact it made. The biggest thing working against 'Alien Nine' is that it's incomplete, but if you can overlook that then it's a good investment of one's time. As long as one knows what to expect from 'Alien Nine' then it's usually a fulfilling experience."", ""Alien 9 is one of those hidden gems you find every now and then with anime. It just barely catches your eye, so you pick it up, dust it off, and find an incredible piece of work that has, somehow, against all odds, remained in relative obscurity, languishing with a mediocre reception. I stumbled upon it by total accident as I was looking for a quick watch, and armed with nothing but a brief description I settled in for what I thought was going to be a fun yet average experience. I couldn't have been more wrong. Instead, I got Madoka before Madoka. I got...a lovingly crafted fever dream about aliens, puberty, and the terrors of growing up. I got Alien 9. Beginning with the story, which is its strongest aspect, it must first be understood as a wild thing that evades intellectual understanding and rational capture at every turn, all while not slipping into the realm of the totally absurd. Building from a premise which is simple enough, where a group of late elementary school girls are tasked with defending their school from regular attacks by monstrous aliens, it builds into something so much more than that. It tackles the psychological burden of growing up, and navigating life as it changes around and within you, regardless of how you feel about it. People look at you differently, you look at yourself differently, and the whole world becomes complicated, and while you understand more of it and develop a real identity for the first time, the less of it seems to make sense, and that fragile sense of self is challenged by difficulties you must overcome. But it's also beautiful, in its own bizarre way, as the worries and uncertainties of childhood evolve into a resolve to be who you want to be. I'd say the tentpole of the story is this, that coming of age dynamic, but it covers a lot more ground within and around that concept- loneliness, depression, anxiety, friendship, social expectations, personal discovery, psychological trauma, defiant adaptation, and so much more. I could go on for hours, really. Its depiction of how scary and uncertain the transition into adolescence can be is uniquely raw and authentic, while its cautious moments of peace and togetherness are simple yet warm and infinitely meaningful. I've seen this piece compared to Madoka Magica, which would come a decade later, and the resemblance is definitely there. A lot of despair inflicted on young girls who are chosen to battle horrible monsters, pushed along by sinister forces beyond their understanding, embodying a subversion of the magical girl genre. However, there is a distinct difference that I believe makes Alien 9 decidedly superior- it feels so much more authentic. Madoka Magica is good, don't get me wrong, but the sheer depths of its edgy darkness feel almost manufactured, like the rules of that world are engineered for maximum grimness, and leaves many of its other themes under-examined. Meanwhile, Alien 9 covers so much emotional and conceptual ground in the space of only a handful of episodes, and in a few words or passing scenes manages to deeply fathom all of its major questions and ideas, leaving a distinct mark upon the viewer. It grabs you, and doesn't let go. Emotions leap through the screen directly into your chest, feeling a direct connection to the joys, anxieties, victories, and fears which unfold before you. More mechanically, the story's episodes feel like just the right length, with a somewhat disjointed pacing that lends itself well to the cerebral aspect of the show. Though, it does leave a lot of things open, and makes one wonder if that was on purpose or just a necessary exclusion to get the anime done on time. Next, the art is wonderful, combining a cute, emotive style, characterized by the distinctive inclusion of large ears and eyes, with painstakingly detailed backgrounds and alien designs that feel haunting and otherworldly. Its use of color, poses, shot composition, and smooth animation all make the art style and execution feel distinctly timeless. It cannot be understated just how great this looks for an OVA from 2001. In a phrase, it's easy to sit back and get lost in for a while. In a similar vein, the sound design is masterfully experimental. The voice work is immaculate, with voice acting that makes the characters feel more like actual people instead of just pawns for the designs of the author. They feel seriously authentic, and that is backed up with weeping that feels so genuine that its actually arresting. Definitely some of the realest crying in anime. The sound design goes on to impress with sounds of life that carry physicality and weight, with the meaty thwack of alien biology under a swift blow, or the gentle shuffle of nervous footsteps. Though, all of this auditory excellence pales in comparison with the OST. The music is bold and unlike anything else in the genre, forging ahead with a wanton experimentality, fusing cutesy slice-of-life tunes with the gripping mechanical edge of a psychological sci-fi thriller. It is a feat all on its own, distorting the perception of a given scene through a myriad of emotional dimensions, complimenting and subverting at a whim. The characters are also incredibly strong, representing the main drivers of the anime as a whole, where the story is determined by their actions rather than the whims of the plot. Their interplay is easy to get invested in, and nobody in the main cast is left wanting for depth or characterization. Beyond an engaging visual design, they are shockingly multifaceted, and are somehow able to embody this three-dimensional complexity over the course of a brief OVA. My favorite characters are Yuri Otani and Kumi Kawamura. Otani feels like one of the most authentic adolescent protagonists in anime, and since the viewer is often inside her head with her thoughts, we get a front row seat to the complex cacophony of debilitating anxiety and a desire to rise above it. She's not some special hero, she's not a secret savant, she's just a girl, a girl who's doing her best in the face of it all. Of all the things in this anime which defy logic and convention, she remains distinctly, almost defiantly, grounded. That is refreshing in a way that's hard to describe, and a surefire formula for a good character. Meanwhile, Kawamura is such a strong character for what her presence says about the story itself. She doesn't get as much characterization as Otani, but by the subtext of her actions, and brief interactions with people outside school, we get a rich portrait of her anyway. Really, that's a testament to how this anime tells its story, and handles its characters. Overall, Alien 9 is a work of art that is criminally underappreciated, but still leaves so many things unsaid. With so many open questions fluttering in the breeze, it may fail to satisfy some people, but if you can appreciate it for what it is, you will walk away with an anime that you can not only feel smug about liking, but also acknowledge as something special, a rare but brief moment that punches far above its weight. a lovingly crafted fever dream about aliens, puberty, and the terrors of growing up.

This time ""Alien 9""It is clear that I am choosing to watch less than stellar anime\'s of late. Alien 9 is another of these pieces, although not for the reasons most people would suspect. I am sure most other reviewers have spotted the weak characters, the poor plot development, the idiotic stance of a middle-school administration; et al.But to miss the most important aspect of the shows\' potential; by the actual writers themselves, leaves us all in a state of shock.First though, I wish to speak about some of the aspects that bother...me the most.1). PlotLet\'s see if I understand. Middle-school children are set up in teams, to eradicate aliens. Most of which are bent on the mind control of Humans. The children selected, have no say in the matter; regardless of any individuals\' emotional strength of character.The school administration all appear to have some connection to aliens, and it is not that far a stretch to suggest that every one of them, in this particular school; are all partially Borg hybrids.Good aliens/bad aliens. Somehow I don\'t see a difference. All of them are bent on mind control of Humans; including the Borg (interesting symbolism linked to the notion of the STNG Borg character, biologically different, but similar intentions; and that is to subjugate other species).The stated notion that the various types of aliens don\'t like each other and are trying to destroy each other; does not play well. We never see one individual alien make a lethal attack upon another alien, of any type whatever. The only true homicide that occurs is during a an actual anxiety attack within Yuri Otani; when during a serious crying fit, brought on by stark, raving terror; she forces her Borg to not only annihilate all aliens within easy reach, including the ones in the storage area, but also all the Borgs as well. Including her own.This of course, makes even the new Borg clones nervous. But somehow, all the Borgs continue, as if nothing happened of note. Interesting that the Alien Hunter Teaching Advisor, Megumi Hisagawa; created the medium and produced the seeds, to create the Borg clones herself.All of these details are ignored as long-term plot points, while the story (what there is of it) drones onward. We are supposed to be nervous about the feelings of each individual student. We are not supposed to get involved in the actions of virtually every one around the students.2). The Music.The only music in the 4 episode OVA is one single song. Count-em, one. No inter-scene music, no ED, nothing. The one song it has, is not very good, and is a true whiny piece. It matches the whining of Miss Otani perfectly. The only good thing about it is that it is played at the beginning and at the end, and does NOT intrude upon us again, for each episode.3). Character voices.Most of the dub-english voices are adequate. But I am tempted to point out, each of the student characters should have responded by not merely teary-eyed crying; but outright shrieking terror. The japanese and english speaking actors should have mutiny\'d and brought about this change. It would have strengthened the plot, and set up the story as a true horror story.4). Artwork.Lackluster, nothing special. Nothing to take away as special.5). Enjoyment.None possible. Had the story plot went in a better direction; Alien-9 would have stood as a first-rate horror science fiction. But no soap. This story completely missed the mark, in almost every story point. No excuses, the creators had almost 2 full hours to establish the entire scenario. They succeeded in completing the scenario they wanted. It was very bad.The scenario that should have become obvious; is that the only struggle present was the notion that the aliens (of all types) were trying to take over the whole Planet of earth, by controlling virtually every Human they could get their hands on. Invasion of the Body Snachers (with a alien struggle for overall dominance), in plain sight. All the basic parts were there; the forced training to combat aliens, the close contact with aliens the soldiers needed to combat said aliens, the possible hybridization of Humans to part Borg; etc. Everything was there.Except a story.And so, dear readers; we are left with an anime written a long time ago, when plot was more important than the available artwork. Remember this was made in 2002, where most artwork was not very good. That means production values were mediocre, perforce. But examples like ""Princess Mononoke""-1997 proves that it could be done.The only thing this anime had, was the potential for a good story. A horror scifi is not uncommon; but for so much of a great anime to be put into this one, and then not deliver the goods; in such an outrageously bad fashion, is bluntly unforgivable. Again, the creators had 2-hours of film. Most live-action movies are shorter than that.No forgiveness possible.For the first time, I have rated every part of Alien-9 with a 5 (Mediocre). So that is my final score; a 5. me the most.1). PlotLet\'s see if I understand. Middle-school children are set up in teams, to eradicate aliens. Most of which are bent on the mind control of Humans.

So freaking boring and let me say this -  THIS IS THE WORST ANIME I'VE EVER SEEN.The main character (Yuri) annoyed me a lot. So freaking weak! And I thought maybe she will eventually become braver at the end, but nah. Still the same. Such a crybaby. It's really annoying!And also, episode 3 is like totally unnecessary. No alien involved and what even bothers me is the dream that she's having. The story is fine without all the dreams.The...only thing that makes me kinda happy is the Borg. Protective and cute. But, the actor who played Borg is completely unsuitable for the voice.And, the ending.. WTH with the ending?! Urgghh! Also, it doesn't tell why the aliens had been attacking Earth. And how ridiculous this may sound, but who would leave the job to fight aliens to elementary students and most importantly, to a GIRL.As summary, I don't recommend watching this anime.

As such there's nothing there. I usually prefer to look at anime adaptation as its own thing but Alien 9 left me a bit confused as to what did I even watch and as such...I felt the urge to read the manga and get some frame of reference for just how much is missing, the answer is a lot. Manga had a similar problem where it's not strong in the story department but at least there was something there and unfortunately anime ends right before a major reveal that adds so much the world of Alien 9.The world is still an important part of this and a reason I think it's worth watching regardless. It's weird, bizarre, unique and other things that just say it's not like other things. It starts quick and it just keeps going from there, first you see a school kid get elected for an alien party and moments later she's putting a living, winged frog helmet on her head that extends deadly drills and eats her dead cells and waste. Four episodes don't cover much but I still feel like it's a curious package worth watching and if you want more definitely check out the manga.Symbolism is probably worth mentioning but it's too blatant and shallow to really comment on. Themes are presented with no comment or exploration of any kind so they don't matter me.One of the other unfortunate flaws that come from anime being unfinished is that characters as a result are much more boring. Director did a remarkable job of throwing in different cues that give you look inside their head but it's just cut short.Direction by the way, is one of the things where I think this OVA stands out, both visual and audio. It's clear that a bunch of respect was paid to original work with how well the tone fits the material. It's brimming with interesting shots and director added a lot of anime original sequences that add something to characters or atmosphere of the work. Color coordination does goof job of setting the tone and making everything look pretty. The real standout for me however was the music, it's just as unique as the world and always fit what was happening on screen to a t without standing out too much, it really enhanced the whole thing. In combination all that make me wish this was 10-12 episodes to adapt the whole thing but alas.Overall while I think it's not great on its own it still might be worth a watch if you're looking for something exceptional while not exactly good.

However, the anime builds its characters with how scary puberty can be to someone growing up.Alien Nine shows this to its viewers in a great way by visualizing the anxiety of the characters and the constant fear of being left behind by your peers. Is this anime anything new? In short, no. It's not breaking any new ground but with its short 4 episodes, it is a nice little story about 3 girls who are probably...not the best people to be cleaning up the alien mess that the Men in Black don't have time to deal with. not the best people to be cleaning up the alien mess that the Men in Black don't have time to deal with."", 'I haven\'t read the manga, and it\'s clear that there\'s more to this than whatever is revealed in the OVA\'s four episodes, but Alien Nine is a winsome and subtly troubling depiction of looming adolescence. Using ""alien"" school invasions as a metaphor for burgeoning puberty, three tween girls with dramatically different personalities are tasked with taking care of these pests by using the powers of their own, symbiotic aliens against them. If the premise sounds like it\'s suited for a high-flying action series or magical girl show, Alien Nine remains firmly grounded in the mundane, as ""alien invasions"" are treated like everday occurrences despite their...potential for death and destruction.

I figured I could read the manga to get a better understanding, but I shouldn\'t have to read the manga to get a grip on what the anime is supposed to tell me.I thought I wasn\'t paying enough attention, maybe.

Not explaining them would be alright to point out the defenselessness of human characters, BUT we do have characters who appear to know about these aliens and yet they STILL aren\'t explained to us.I also do not care for the characters but that\'s for later.ART:The reason I started this series mainly. I personally really enjoy the character design, by that I mean the outfits the main 3 girls wear while fighting. I think the whole hat and rollerblades thing is very creative and appealing in it\'s own way.The reason I\'m giving a 6 here is because of the bleak atmosphere the visuals have and how little goes on on the screen some of the time.\'Bleak\', not in a Silent Hill way, but in a liminal space way. Because the entire environment seems to be rather uninspired and empty. A school, the girl\'s houses, a vacation house, hallways, the train and nothing inbetween. This is a VERY personal nitpick though. I was jut negatively affected by how empty the environment felt.Also the animation is nothing special by any means.SOUND:Usually I can talk a lot about this aspect of an anime, but all I can say here that some songs are really creative and nice. Overall it\'s just a fine OST.Sadly the opening is not too memorable either besides the cool beat at the beginning.CHARACTER:Yuki Otani is one of the most ANNOYING main characters I ever had to deal with. Maybeee this is a personal nitpick again, but the amount of crying already made my blood boil after one episode. She is a very young girl so her emotions are absolutely understandable, but there\'s no need for a protagonist to cry so much that it\'s basically everything you remember from the entire series. Her friends seem to love her as well and help her out in the end, which I really cannot understand because I don\'t recall any on-screen moments of Yuki being a helpful or good friend. You will do anything nice for her and she\'ll just cry anyway.The blonde girl, I forgot her name, does the h1tler salute while saying nya for some reason. Sorry I thought it was kinda funny.Well boohoo she misses her brother, we don\'t know why she loves him so much but I GUESS he must\'ve been an awesome brother?!At the end it\'s really wannabe-deep with her, trying to explain how she has a ""tragic"" life and how high the expectations are for her. Except we aren\'t given any sort of explanation really, It just feels forced.IDK in the end this character is just typically anime-psychotic. NYAAAAKumi, I think is the 3rd girl\'s name, is easily the best character. She shows actual progress in becoming accepting of her own fright and emotions and does a good job of leading the team. She has all reason to be looked up to and I loved her scenes in the last episode. Also her mom is hot.I literally do not have any opinions on the other characters.ENJOYMENT/OVERALL:I REALLY wanted to like this anime, but as you see above, I\'m frustrated. I don\'t know what to say here.

So much so that I felt compelled to make it my first review on MAL, to defend it against its unmerited (in my opinion) low score. Its oddly cut-off ending and shortness aside, Alien 9 has a tone to it that is completely unique.The characterizations are very simplified, but that feels like a symptom of the genre and shortness of the show. I tend to like ""crybaby"" protagonists like Shinji (NGE) and Yuri Ootani because they don\'t allow viewers to skim over the emotional weight of the events happening to them. There are definitely a few frustrating moments where Yuri...is frozen with fear or indecision, but this serves to keep the viewer from simplifying her down to a hero. She\'s just a 12 yr old girl who was given a scary, gross, and isolating job by adults who refuse to fix the problem themselves. That\'s a pretty relatable position to be in for many younger people.The alien designs are incredible, ranging from cute and creepy to just bizzare.I love the funky OP, and the music helps set the strange tone of the show. If you\'re a fan of the visuals of Madoka Magica then you\'ll probably like its unsettling moe predecessor.Alien 9 gives you a lot within 4 episodes. With complex symbolism, fantastic creature design, and a banger of an OP, I think that Alien 9 is absolutely worth the watch. is frozen with fear or indecision, but this serves to keep the viewer from simplifying her down to a hero.

I was between the ages of 7-9 when I watched this with my older brother and maybe my older sister. I thought the main character was horrible. Yuri, as a joke played on her, her classmates nominate and vote her democratically to defend her school from aliens over her best friend who actually could handle it. The 12 year olds who are elected for this task have to go on patrol for aliens bringing along symbiotic alien beings they wear on their head that are used like bioweapons/armor. They essentially...become after school child soilders. Yuri is berated and shown scorn and disrespect by the serious Kumi, niether fitting in with her or her other partner bubbly Kasumi. They fight, capture and kill aliens and Yuri\'s sensitive nature and sad demeanor causes her to cry and weep constantly while trying to preform the tasks which she mainly lags behind and burdens her fellow ""Alien Party"". Her Borg and her friend seem to be her only allies. As the show goes on, the awful situations Yuri and the other face continue to escalate and the trauma, horrendous and tragedy in the show stings and perfumes any screen showing this anime.This depressing, confusing four episodes make up an incredible artwork and a truly unforgettable experience. It captures, marries and inflicts the surreality of cruel fate and the drama of realism in this at simultaneously genre-frenetic yet focused, grounded marvel. When you finish watching this show, you aren\'t the same person anymore. As I\'ve said, I thought Yuri was a horrible crybaby when I first watched this. It\'s amazing how growing up and living life so many years after this show, I\'ve realized that Yuri isn\'t some mere fish out of water. You experience her pains and her reactions to that pain are with her jarring display of emotion, (in my opinion) more accurately providing that window and pontoon bridge into her psychology and despair, because the show doesn\'t try to let you relate to <i>her</i>. She is (metaphorically, psychologically) tortured and even though the show rings you through despair, you experience it differently from Yuri. It is only if or when your own life allows you to become more like her, will you better understand her character. And in that way, one can truly feel how alone and broken she really is. It is a brave to have a vision in a show so uncompromising and so crammed with emotional experience.I will continue to go back to this show to be in awe of it\'s story.

The setting, plot, and characters are all interesting, but all feel like piles of unanswered questions by the time the show suddenly ends.  The main character also cries a lot, which makes sense for the situation, but it's really annoying and loud.  The manga completes the story and doesn't have voice acting at all so I'd recommend just skipping the anime and reading that.  It was nice to see the style of animation because it resembled the original work pretty well and is...a bit unique. a bit unique."", 'This anime’s story seemed like a pretty cool concept, it was different to me so I decided to give it a try. As I continued to watch it I started to feel a bit confused and kind of annoyed, Yuri was someone I was annoyed with the most, like I understand she’s only in sixth grade and she has to deal with aliens it’s just that she contiously cried pretty much every scene she was in. The concept was nice I just don’t think how the anime portrayed the story was very good in my opinion, but maybe if you want something different and maybe...even a little weird you can watch this, it’s only 4 episodes so u can finish it in a day, hope this helped if you’re wondering if u should watch or not :) even a little weird you can watch this, it’s only 4 episodes so u can finish it in a day, hope this helped if you’re wondering if u should watch or not :)', ""While the second two episodes are not quite as strong as the first two utterly phenomenal episodes, these 4 episodes ultimately form a very satisfying whole despite not concluding the story.The work is filled to the brim with utterly amazing imagery of kimoi juxtaposed with kawaii in very inventive and intuitive ways. Thematically, it is very much a part of the 00's discussion in otaku media of the nature of cute anime girls and their relationship with darkness and chaos, the latter in which this case is represented by grotesque aliens.The show goes through several very satisfying arcs of tension and resolution despite the almost...chronically sarcastic, slightly superflat-esque presentation of the work conveyed through the goofy cute art style and deadpan mood.The top notch visuals alone are enough to justify watching Alien 9, but the story intrigue is completely there to synergize with them. chronically sarcastic, slightly superflat-esque presentation of the work conveyed through the goofy cute art style and deadpan mood.The top notch visuals alone are enough to justify watching Alien 9, but the story intrigue is completely there to synergize with them."", '""Loneliness-- He uses loneliness as his mean to fight with us.""Alien 9, is a very unusual slice of life type of a modern horror anime, where only four episodes in it. It may look cute to you at first, but it actually is (I think, at least) for mentally matured people, not for juvenile. You may regret watching it if you cannot stand the psychological horror stuff. This is a strange anime for tasting our creepy dark side of feelings towards children.I was interested in this anime because I found it on the recommendations page of my favorite anime, Ground Defense Force Mao-chan. (also...because it had a dubbed version too) Sure, the basic settings are similar. Both of them feature a group of three grade-schooler girls who are facing, capturing aliens to protect the peace. However, the tastes of the two are completely different. While Mao-chan is overall light-hearted comedy, Alien 9 is full of disturbing moments!Honestly, I was hardly able to enjoy this anime. So... why I have scored it quite fairly despite the fact that I felt so bad I almost threw up while watching the poor girl being pushed into her unwilling duty of dealing with violence, grotesque aliens? It\'s simple, I don\'t want to judge things unreasonablly just by my own preference. Besides, people can, and should decide which anime they try next without considering its score too much.Actually, the anime is created very fine, even though it\'s quite short. The premise that regards the alien\'s invasion and the counter-measures against them as the daily usual chokes is quite interesting. The fighting style using Bougu (in Japanese it means \'a protector\' like a helmet, simply) is something cool I have never seen. And aliens, yeah, they are aliens, not (like Mao-chan does) cute aliens.Again, this is an unusual slice of school horror life anime that features a poor girl who always gets soaked by the aliens\' green blood.

Problems arise because some situations are very traumatic, and some aliens can actually know human\'s innermost desires and use them to manipulate the girls.But Alien 9 isn\'t even close to Madoka Magica for several reasons. The setting is given thin development - where are these aliens coming from? Why must elementary school girls fight them? Who is the teacher? etc. Likewise, the story feels a little... incomplete. As if it were meant only to advertise the manga.Also, it\'s unfortunate how annoying the main character...Yuri is. Here is my old reaction to Alien 9:""A potential-packed premise and solid storytelling crash and burn due to an off-the-charts annoying protagonist whose constant whinging, crying, complaining, and self-pity make every second of Alien Nine physically painful. This is hands-down the most annoying anime I have ever fully watched.""This is probably me bitching, but I don\'t like whiny little girls as protagonists.

One of them hates the job, one of them does it because the other option was worse, and one of them is raring to go. There\'s a copious amount of gore, blood, and mental breakdowns. So yeah, this show is not all sunshine and lollipops.From the first scene, Yuri (the first girl I talked about) will whine about not wanting to be the one designated to beat up aliens in her class. In the next scene she will complain and whine to her best friend about how she\'s unqualified for the job, and that she doesn\'t...want to do it. If you ever think she\'ll stop moaning and whining and suddenly start heroically busting out the moves to beat up aliens in a badass manner, I\'m here to tell you that Alien 9 is not that kind of show. Yuri will not suddenly become a badass: instead, the proceeding scenes will also include her sniveling, bawling, and feebly whimpering yet again about how she REALLY doesn\'t want to beat up aliens. Did I tell you that Yuri receives the most screentime of the three girls, so you\'ll see her going through that same pattern about 4 times in every episode? If you don\'t want to see that, then stay the hell away from Alien 9.Now, if you managed to get beyond that initial barrier, you\'ll find that Yuri\'s constant whimpering and crying, while aggravating to listen to, is not only justified, but the circumstances that led up to that point are worth a deeper look into.The point is that Yuri is too young and immature to decide things for herself. Constantly crying and whimpering is not how you solve problems, and it is especially not how an adult should act if they want to be treated like one. Her constant whimpering, her inability to speak her mind, and her extreme dependency on Kumi all hint towards her relative emotional immaturity. Out of the main cast, Yuri is the furthest from being a responsible adult, and thus she is treated like an incapable child. She doesn\'t get to call the shots, her parents and teachers do, because she\'s such a kid.Said emotional immaturity and inability to control her fear is why Yuri is the target of the most gory and violent scenes throughout the show. The sheer fear she feels toward the aliens is fueled by her instinctive repulsion towards them for how absolutely disgusting they are. How they lick her back for nutrients, how she constantly gets soaked in alien blood, how she\'s constantly being threatened to become Swiss cheese by the invading aliens. The scaredy-cat is the best target for pranks and horror shows, since they\'re assured to give the most reactive responses. Was there any other reason Luigi got a horror game for himself, but not Mario?While I did mention horror, Alien 9\'s aliens honestly aren\'t that scary, and look more like badly drawn versions of Digimon. The Borgs look like a very wrinkly Patamon with CG wings, and the invading aliens attack with tacky black and white CG drills and tendrils, like they\'re out of a PS1 game. Hell, everything looks cutesy. The girls don\'t have noses and gigantic eyes. Everything is painted in slightly flushed out, but still bright, colors. Anything that emphasizes horror loves to operate in the dark, but Alien 9 has the girls fighting aliens in broad daylight. It\'s less scary and more uncomfortable. The horror aspect is only truly emphasized when Yuri faces the aliens, and when the show depicts how raw the terror she feels can be.All that I\'ve mentioned above is in the first two episodes, and I\'ve only talked about them so extensively because they\'re the more interesting part of the show. The next two episodes go into the other two girls, and due to the divided screentime the show does not have enough time to cover them both: frankly speaking however, there\'s not much to talk about when one of the girls\' biggest defining trait--nay, quirk--is saying ""Nya!"" every one of four lines like she\'s some kind of Pokémon. The last two episodes don\'t go anywhere.We have some dream sequences, and some more scenes of the girls cowering in fear, and then the show just...ends. It ends while hinting at a potential episode 5 that never came to pass. Wouldn\'t you know it, Alien 9 is yet another member of the \'read the manga for the rest\' crowd of anime. For what it\'s worth, the manga ended and also got a sequel called Alien 9: Emulators, so if you love these 4 episodes and want more there\'s plenty of stuff to read to satiate yourself.Unfortunately, unlike the manga, Alien 9 the anime is incomplete and inconclusive, and was given far too little time to even begin to explore its own themes and characters, let alone familiarize them to the audience. The subpar production value and the lack of elaboration on its own world and internal logic will further detract many people.

So many questions are left unanswered, and the sheer amount of completely wasted time (all of episode 3, A.K.A. a full quarter of the runtime) in an already short series was infuriating beyond belief.This OVA started off with amazing potential in the first two episodes, before completely throwing it away for a filler-like third episode which was so desperately...needed to develop the plot amidst the already strict time constraints.

Argento Soma,https://myanimelist.net/anime/285/Argento_Soma,"['The anime was fantastic, yes the main character may might have been a bit villainous, but he shows his true self in the end. The anime is very mysterious, and it does have its fun moments, but it is a serious type of anime. I personally thought this was a masterpiece, and beats all the junk. Yes it was a bit repetitive in the middle, but it was all in the plot.Overall 10/10 and it is a must watch, if you think the main character is too ""emo"" like the other review, then DON\'T EVEN bother watching this. ', 'When a show is described as a ""hidden gem"" it immediately calls into mind something that you\'ve stumbled upon by happenstance with no prior expectations. These are the titles that come in and out of focus partially thanks to the presence of much more all-encompassing works made around the same time period. It\'s a common occurrence that spans across every medium but perhaps most notable in anime, where only a handful of shows per year are thrust into the limelight, while the rest are left to gather up dust and become yet another mortared in brick to support the weight of the juggernauts resting on...top of it. These ""hidden"" titles were at the wrong place at the wrong time. Like in the case of 2015\'s superhero show Concrete Revolutio, which unfortunately had to compete for views in the same season that aired the much more popular One Punch Man. Or even self-indulgent titles like Sword Art Online, which ultimately received a far bigger viewer base than 2012\'s Accel World, an anime made by the same author, Reki Kawahara. Had these shows aired at a different time, the chances of it receiving better coverage could have been amplified, for better or for worse.And when it came to being at the wrong place at the wrong time, Argento Soma could not have picked a more unfortunate release date; being produced during a period where any title with the slightest use of biomechanics and distressed young pilots were quickly dismissed as ""Evangelion clones."" This decade-long dark period also saw with it the likes of RahXephon, Brain Powerd, Fafner of the Blue Sky, Gasaraki, Brigadoon, Betterman and much more receiving that label for either legitimate reasons, or simply for the sake of grouping anything remotely similar under the same umbrella. Argento Soma was no different, becoming another statistic forced to carry the burden of that appointed buzzphrase. The reason for the label was pretty self-evident too, given the ominous aura that was ever-present throughout the mecha show\'s production; the pervasive nature of that 90s to early 2000s aesthetic that dominated all genres at the time, where anime entries were drenched in a pensive temperament, often dissecting itself and the broader storytelling landscape as a whole. This all served towards Argento\'s quick dismissal, almost being instantly forgotten upon arrival. But that\'s where the thin line of surface-level evaluations ended, as the show never stayed under Evangelion\'s thumb. Unlike the fate befalling some of its brethren like RahXephon, whom to this day still can\'t shake that ""Eva-clone"" label, Argento quickly grew into its own identity, taking a stance against its patriarch and choosing to draw from influences outside the medium altogether. Its statement may have been lost in the clutter, but for those that heard it—and more importantly—understood the bold proclamation; what they came to encounter was nothing short of an interesting artifact. To quote the words of the infamous ThatAnimeSnob: ""Argento Soma, is to me, a deconstruction of Neon Genesis"" and honestly, that\'s as befitting of a description as any. Instead of following the trendsetter at that time, Argento chose to challenge it in a way not seen before or since. Argento Soma is a ""hidden gem"" in every sense of the term.Starting off in a semi-episodic structure, we\'re introduced to our protagonist and residential edge-lord, Takuto Kaneshiro, who, like many others, found himself involved in a lifestyle where the military\'s far-reaching hand became a part of everyday life, thanks to an ever-present threat of alien invaders. After a series of unfortunate events, Kaneshiro took on an officer role in a paramilitary group called Funeral; a subsidiary of the army made for the sole purpose of combating the increasing wave of alien invasions. And as the fight against these extraterrestrials rages on, new information is slowly unveiled that changes not only the course of the battle but also humanity\'s stance on the perceived threat as a whole.The biggest forewarning that should be brought to your attention before viewing this is the choice of pacing. Argento Soma operates with a sense methodical arrangement, where everything is laser-focused to serve its characters and narrative, as it slowly builds towards its penultimate third act, where all its careful planning exfoliates into a much grander concept. A slow-burn that never concerns itself with side-show theatrics to maintain short-term attention spans, and as such, may require a bit of patience on the part of the viewer. It\'s the defining feature that separates sci-fi from hard sci-fi, Stars Wars from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Where the minutia of individual character involvement and the events of all things big and small are all held accountable; introduced with the promise of a return in investment. If pathos drove Evangelion, then Argento functions on precision.The benefits of this slower-paced first act can be seen with the metamorphosis of our protagonist, as well as the side characters that make up his surrounding environment. As already stated in the synopsis, Kaneshiro is motivated by vengeance, which gives way to a lead that\'s enveloped in a lot of mental grief and suffering due to his circumstances. He\'s possessed by this idea of ""getting even"" with the aliens that robbed him of normalcy and happiness, and it\'s seeing this very mindset mold him that brings a great deal of intrigue towards his growth throughout the series. As if donning a mask to hide his true feelings, we come to know Kaneshiro for a majority of the show by the alias Ryu Soma. An alias he chooses to adopt when becoming a member of the Funeral organization. But beyond the need to shield his identity, what\'s truly being put on guard is the person himself. Kaneshiro is in a state of denial about his shortcomings. Something we\'re made privy to as the veneer behind his actions slowly washes away, and he\'s forced to confront the true source of his grief.The first half of the show entertains a ""monster of the week"" formula but never places it center-stage to its true intentions: the character involvement and the grander concept that awaits them later down the line. In fact, it could be argued that the first half of the series is merely there to flesh out the world, give weight to the increasing alien threat, and more importantly, to add dimension to our cast of characters. In order to achieve this, the show develops its cast byways of a collective character study; a situation where the actions of one could indirectly paint a picture of another. Developments that come as a result of close-quarters interaction. And as all of this is being done, a slow paradigm shift from a character-driven story to narrative-based one is slowly being orchestrated in the background, as the show works its way towards the final thematic proclamation. One that makes broad implications yet remains intimate at its core.And while screen-time is evenly distributed to most side characters to help achieve this third act revelation, the primary focus is always awarded to Kaneshiro. Seeing his slow metamorphosis and growth as a character was quite fascinating. His brash and somewhat pigheaded persona never felt like artificial drama but was branched out from a place of genuine angst. There was a poignancy there, something that similar works fail to grasp. He\'s driven by a need for redemption and lashes out, not because he\'s justified in his actions, but because the moment he seeks for the answer through introspection, the truth revealed is far crueler than the scapegoat he designates for his revenge. He\'s drowning in self-pity, searching for any means of resurfacing. And seeing his struggle, contemplation, and eventual catharsis through acceptance was something well worth the price of admission.For those that have seen and appreciated Argento Soma, it\'s hard to fault the show\'s usage of deliberately slower pacing, as it\'s that very attribute that made its methodical reveals effective. But perhaps it\'s because of that that the show is practically unknown to a vast majority today. This isn\'t to suggest that the show had filler, but rather, it lets the narrative operate organically for far too long at times, even when it was done under careful observation. Ironically, the very free-flowing narrative that helped gave the events of the story a naturalistic expression is the same thing that contributed towards alienating its viewership. It was simply too long-winded for those that couldn\'t get behind this perceived ""slower"" pacing. This, as a result, has caused the few that have heard of it to either dismiss it altogether or shy away after getting wind of the unwarranted ""Eva clone"" mantra; a buzzphrase that offered a quick surface-level way to escape further elaboration.This anime suffers not because of the actual content but because of the audience that surrounded it. As condescending as this statement may sound, this anime is intended for a more refined viewer, someone that understands the fundamentals of proper storytelling and the need for carefully planned build up to give later events more substantial impact. It\'s the difference between a person taking the time to appreciate the fragrance and taste of aged wine, as opposed to merely swigging it with the intent of getting shit-faced. The difference is patience and consideration. And for a medium that is known for attracting people that seeks expedience, Argento\'s quaint methods places it at a disadvantage.Thankfully, for those willing to shift mindsets to accommodate this show\'s approach, it offers enough to justify its actions.For one, the show never viewed things through an ideological lens but chose to let the content speak for itself. This made decisions on the characters\' behalf to hold greater meaning. No one was ever ""good"" or ""bad,"" they were simply human, making decisions that they deemed to be the best one. This sense of moral ambiguity was shared among all characters, whether their role was of primary concern or held tertiary value to the plot. And since the leads were composed of adults, it paved the way for far more nuances in their interactions than what you\'ll typically get from an anime cast overpopulated by teens. Adults weren\'t simply nowhere to be found while adolescence ran around ""saving the day."" This was a show that had enough decency and common sense to realize that including adults was not only appropriate but essential when it came to settling the moral dilemma of characters\' choices. There are no redheaded tsunderes or emotionally detached lolis running the day-to-day operations of the military, but fully-grown competent leaders that think before they leap. To sell the seriousness of a story\'s conflict, accountability should come before marketability. Teen protagonists may sell like hotcakes for anime, but that\'s usually at the cost of legitimacy towards how plausible a scenario could be. Sadly, this is something that\'s mostly lost in the clutter of many anime titles, where teens seem to be the only characters of relevance. But in a way, it\'s because of tropes like these that the cast of Argento feels so refreshing by default. Whether the creators were cognizant of this or not, their decision to have a cast where there\'s only one teen, while everyone else was either young adults or older, ended up working out in their favor.This is yet another defining feature that contrasts Argento from its patriarch. If Evangelion\'s relatability is with that of teens, then Argento shifts to the next logical step, cataloging sentiments meant for young adults to connect to. Teens blame the world, while young adults learn that taking ownership for their actions is the key needed to depart adolescence before entering the next chapter of their lives.It\'s differences like that where Argento truly shines. Where its autonomy from the ""Eva clone"" mantra becomes crystal clear.Beyond these strong narrative distinctions, the art and animation for Argento held up surprisingly well, as it contained fights that had a sense of weight to it, where the individual movements and the environment felt well-documented. From the swing of an incoming punch to gestures characters make under extraneous circumstances; every encounter was given agency. While there are instances where the show\'s age became apparent, it never got in the way of selling a scene. But perhaps the most notable inclusion was the striking character designs themselves, which looked like a crossbreed of sleek runway model-like postures and the lengthy stone-faced appearance of Gundam Wing\'s regulars; which isn\'t much of a surprise, given that Shukou Murase handled both Wing and Soma\'s character design work. This could also be seen with another Post-Eva work that he was involved in with Gasaraki. His aesthetic sensibilities are quite unique, taking anatomical body proportions and giving it a specific vogue-like neo-gothic edge. To get into specifics, the appearance of the main character was, for the lack of a better word, cool-looking. It\'s a type of blend between brooding and swagger that\'s rarely captured this well, but when done right, lead to some attractive creations.Where the character designs lost points for creativity was with the aliens themselves, which lacked variety, as it was relatively the same design with exception given to the one known as ""Frank."" The show could have greatly benefited with a few more distinct variations than the carbon copy lineup that was offered instead. While it could be argued that that decision to keep them all looking the same was made to correlate thematically with the show\'s ""big reveal"" towards the latter half, finding a way to work in more creative liberties to how they looked was still something that they should have entertained. Another issue that would immediately jump out at you was the characters\' noses, or should I say, the lack thereof. If Escaflowne is infamous for its Pinocchio schnozzles, then Argento stands as its antithesis, sporting the Michael Jackson look whenever someone is facing the viewer. Thankfully, it isn\'t a jarring feature for long, as the problem subsides the more you watch it, similar to the effect Escaflowne had with its initial viewing.The show\'s soundtrack was a mix-bag of melancholic songs, all synchronizing under the same dreadful feeling that loomed over the entire series. And while the soundtrack served its purpose well, tonally the genres were scatterbrained. They were unified under the pensive tone each had, but that\'s about it. The opening theme captured the essence of the title quite well, having a bittersweet swooning vocal passage carried off by the swelling rise of the instrumentals; a balance between sorrowful pitfalls and hopeful ascensions. The same cannot be said about the ending theme, however, which was quite jarring and far too bushy-tailed for the sobering tone that the series gave off. It was as if someone started playing the Bee Gees ""Stayin\' Alive"" during a funeral session.Outside of a few minor nitpicks here and there, the show does have its fair share of issues outside of pacing (for those bothered by the idea of slow buildup), one of which was its decision to name things in a manner that feels entirely too superficial. You see, Argento Soma was Sunrise\'s not so subtle attempt at patterning specific name and events after a classic novel, and in this case, that ended up being Frankenstein. But outside of the first episode, naming the found alien revived by a mad scientist ""Frank,"" and having facilities and organizations named ""Morgue"" and ""Funeral,"" there was very little that paralleled the classic novel and film itself. Instead, it\'s safe to say that the show only superfluously borrowed these titles, and had it been changed to anything else, nothing of significance would have been affected thematically. The usage of these titles should be treated as more of a motif than anything with symbolic annotation. In short, ignore the relevance of these titles. Just as Evangelion\'s theology symbolism was nothing but window-dressing, so too is Argento\'s need to reference Frankenstein no more significant than an artistic choice.Naming aside, perhaps the most significant issue that the show faces has to do with the involvement of a character named Mr. X. Unlike the harmless usage of name choices, Mr. X\'s participation brought with it damaging plotting issues. This wouldn\'t be any more of an issue than what\'s usually found with most shows, but for one that operates with such precision, the inclusion of such a wildcard ended up jamming the cogs of what\'s been up to this point, a highly-functioning machine. Given how problematic his involvement is, I would save all of this for the spoiler section. Thankfully, not even the issues found with his inclusion could diminish the show\'s third act revelation, something I will also save for the spoiler section as well.With the first half of the series being dedicated towards the character and narrative buildup, it\'s the second half that the series began to strut its stuff. With carefully foreshadowed moments that started peeling back new layers to the plot, and characters growing alongside the story to match it, everything started to come together, as the reveal placed the show on a league of its own. It stepped out of the realm of usual anime fodder and took cues from cinema instead. All of its careful planning and character fixation was finally brought to fruition. The mysterious fog that hid all agendas had finally lifted, leaving nothing but the naked truth of the show\'s secrecy to be laid bare for the audience to see. With the revelation of the third act finally being unveiled, humanity, as the show comes to know it, was made humbled by the presence of something much more greater than itself.For those that have experienced what Argento had to offer, join me in the spoiler section as we discuss this in further detail.***spoiler section***What made the third act so great was beyond the theatrics of the event but what it came to represent thematically in the series. What it managed to set up, in the beginning, resulted in the last few episodes being what I could only describe as ""2001: An Eva Odyssey."" It took the ingenious vision of Kubrick\'s film and pushed beyond its ending point by introducing a prologue that saw with it the genesis of humanity as a species, and the exodus of a new stage of human evolution into a grander sentient being. It literally and figuratively showed our limited understanding when brought face to face with an advanced species. Where humanity saw a brutal, uncaring race of otherworldly creatures, in reality, it was humanity that was the uncultured simple-minded species incapable of comprehending something beyond our current intellect. It\'s like a 2D person trying to grasp the idea of a 3D object. This plot twist even paralleled the journey of Ryu Soma as well, which made it a multifaceted reveal that serviced both the narrative and the characters involved. It\'s an idea that could have easily crumbled under its own weight but manage to pull it off with such gravitas. And since Argento had already committed to making its content as grounded as possible, the potency of this reveal was amplified even further. This isn\'t to say that Argento tackled the idea to the pedigree reached by Kubrick\'s magnum opus; far from it. But the fact that it even took the idea and ran with it was awe-inspiring within itself. It\'s honestly one of the most spectacular latter halves I\'ve seen from any anime, period.But outside of this achievement, the show does have a significant plot hole that hurt it towards the end, and that was the involvement of Mr. X.David ""Mr. X"" Lawrence is by far the worst part of the show because, with his involvement, poor planning or split decision making on the part of the creators was immediately exposed. Earlier in the series, Mr. X was introduced as a sort of ""devil on the shoulder"" character that seemed to only exist in Soma\'s head. With his red hair, devilish features, and constant consumption of apples (obvious forbidden fruit reference), we as an audience was meant to believe that he was, in fact, a figment of the protagonist\'s imagination. But due to what I could only describe as a poorly executed retcon, this character was introduced as a flesh and blood human being that existed all along. Where the problem lies with that is that throughout the show, he was shown to have the ability to seemingly appear and disappear without anyone else outside of Soma acknowledging him. So when the reveal is made that anyone could have seen him all along, it rendered many instances of him appearing out of nowhere (from what we were shown) to be utter bullshit. One could argue that because of Soma\'s borderline delusional state, he simply couldn\'t follow Lawrence\'s movements and that his high-tech skills allowed him to evade cameras and personnel easily, but that still leaves the question as to how and why others were incapable of seeing him up until the point of the reveal. This was sadly a plot hole with close to no proper explanation given, but one I chose to consciously dismiss given everything else that the show had executed well in regards to the ""Space Odyssey"" third act, as well as Ryu Soma\'s character arc. That doesn\'t stop Mr. X from being a problem, and it\'s for that reason that my score was ultimately lowered. But aside from that point, nothing will take away that feeling of being awestruck that came about from the show\'s final act.***end of spoilers***Enjoyment: 9.5/10I\'ve never been one to care about the average scores accumulated by MAL users, but below 7 for this show is criminally low, perhaps being one of the most underrated and undeserving ratings given to any series I\'ve stumbled upon in the medium up to this point. Sadly misunderstood, a show with so many layers that it effectively deafened itself to the general populace. And rather than take the time to decipher its themes, the quicker solution was to subject it to semantics and label it as an ""Evangelion clone."" Ignorance is bliss, unfortunately, that comes at the cost of things of greater value being dismissed by the collective out of convenience.As a fellow anime enthusiast, I saw this at the right time, never once being bothered by the episodic first half or the methodical pacing that it chose to contain everything in. With intriguing characters and a plot that slowly revealed its hand, the more I watched it, the more engrossed I became. The protagonist was one I\'ve seen done wrong so many times before that finally seeing his type done right was quite rewarding. Very few protagonists struck a chord with me in the way he did. This was a show that only grew on me as it went along, and after episodes 16-18, it became an addiction I couldn\'t stop watching. It was modest, never once flexing its accomplishments to obtain any further appraisal. It simply told its story and let the viewers that took the time to understand it to take from it what they will. It\'s that kind of quality that I actively seek out in media. And it\'s that very reason that Argento Soma won me over, flaws and all.Overall: 7.5/10This title is not for the impatient. For those that enjoy and understand the need for carefully planned build up, the payout is satisfactory, but for anyone else seeking instant gratification, you shouldn\'t bother with this. I don\'t like to advocate the saying of ""you\'re not ready for this show yet,"" but in all honesty, sometimes that\'s just the case. This is a show that could only be appreciated by certain viewers past a threshold with their experience exploring the medium. One only accessible to those well-versed in titles of now and those of yesteryear. To truly know the legacy, the lineage, the very building blocks that make up its foundation. But perhaps more importantly, it requires a mindset that\'s moved beyond the ""critics before art"" phase. To receive what this show has to offer is to approach it divorced of any pretense, of any conceit. Humility is a must. And as a viewer, until you\'ve gotten past these crossroads, I suggest keeping this one tucked away for a later date. I can\'t promise that you\'ll receive the same level of payout that I did, but I can assure that anyone in the right mindset to accept what it has to offer will, at the very least, be given something deserving of the price of admission. top of it.

Sadly, this is something that\'s mostly lost in the clutter of many anime titles, where teens seem to be the only characters of relevance. But in a way, it\'s because of tropes like these that the cast of Argento feels so refreshing by default. Whether the creators were cognizant of this or not, their decision to have a cast where there\'s only one teen, while everyone else was either young adults or older, ended up working out in their favor.This is yet another defining feature that contrasts Argento from its patriarch. If Evangelion\'s relatability is with that of teens, then Argento shifts to the next logical step, cataloging sentiments meant for young adults to connect to. Teens blame the world, while young adults learn that taking ownership for their actions is the key needed to depart adolescence before entering the next chapter of their lives.It\'s differences like that where Argento truly shines. Where its autonomy from the ""Eva clone"" mantra becomes crystal clear.Beyond these strong narrative distinctions, the art and animation for Argento held up surprisingly well, as it contained fights that had a sense of weight to it, where the individual movements and the environment felt well-documented. From the swing of an incoming punch to gestures characters make under extraneous circumstances; every encounter was given agency. While there are instances where the show\'s age became apparent, it never got in the way of selling a scene. But perhaps the most notable inclusion was the striking character designs themselves, which looked like a crossbreed of sleek runway model-like postures and the lengthy stone-faced appearance of Gundam Wing\'s regulars; which isn\'t much of a surprise, given that Shukou Murase handled both Wing and Soma\'s character design work. This could also be seen with another Post-Eva work that he was involved in with Gasaraki. His aesthetic sensibilities are quite unique, taking anatomical body proportions and giving it a specific vogue-like neo-gothic edge. To get into specifics, the appearance of the main character was, for the lack of a better word, cool-looking. It\'s a type of blend between brooding and swagger that\'s rarely captured this well, but when done right, lead to some attractive creations.Where the character designs lost points for creativity was with the aliens themselves, which lacked variety, as it was relatively the same design with exception given to the one known as ""Frank."" The show could have greatly benefited with a few more distinct variations than the carbon copy lineup that was offered instead. While it could be argued that that decision to keep them all looking the same was made to correlate thematically with the show\'s ""big reveal"" towards the latter half, finding a way to work in more creative liberties to how they looked was still something that they should have entertained. Another issue that would immediately jump out at you was the characters\' noses, or should I say, the lack thereof. If Escaflowne is infamous for its Pinocchio schnozzles, then Argento stands as its antithesis, sporting the Michael Jackson look whenever someone is facing the viewer. Thankfully, it isn\'t a jarring feature for long, as the problem subsides the more you watch it, similar to the effect Escaflowne had with its initial viewing.The show\'s soundtrack was a mix-bag of melancholic songs, all synchronizing under the same dreadful feeling that loomed over the entire series. And while the soundtrack served its purpose well, tonally the genres were scatterbrained. They were unified under the pensive tone each had, but that\'s about it. The opening theme captured the essence of the title quite well, having a bittersweet swooning vocal passage carried off by the swelling rise of the instrumentals; a balance between sorrowful pitfalls and hopeful ascensions. The same cannot be said about the ending theme, however, which was quite jarring and far too bushy-tailed for the sobering tone that the series gave off. It was as if someone started playing the Bee Gees ""Stayin\' Alive"" during a funeral session.Outside of a few minor nitpicks here and there, the show does have its fair share of issues outside of pacing (for those bothered by the idea of slow buildup), one of which was its decision to name things in a manner that feels entirely too superficial. You see, Argento Soma was Sunrise\'s not so subtle attempt at patterning specific name and events after a classic novel, and in this case, that ended up being Frankenstein. But outside of the first episode, naming the found alien revived by a mad scientist ""Frank,"" and having facilities and organizations named ""Morgue"" and ""Funeral,"" there was very little that paralleled the classic novel and film itself. Instead, it\'s safe to say that the show only superfluously borrowed these titles, and had it been changed to anything else, nothing of significance would have been affected thematically. The usage of these titles should be treated as more of a motif than anything with symbolic annotation. In short, ignore the relevance of these titles. Just as Evangelion\'s theology symbolism was nothing but window-dressing, so too is Argento\'s need to reference Frankenstein no more significant than an artistic choice.Naming aside, perhaps the most significant issue that the show faces has to do with the involvement of a character named Mr. X. Unlike the harmless usage of name choices, Mr. X\'s participation brought with it damaging plotting issues. This wouldn\'t be any more of an issue than what\'s usually found with most shows, but for one that operates with such precision, the inclusion of such a wildcard ended up jamming the cogs of what\'s been up to this point, a highly-functioning machine. Given how problematic his involvement is, I would save all of this for the spoiler section. Thankfully, not even the issues found with his inclusion could diminish the show\'s third act revelation, something I will also save for the spoiler section as well.With the first half of the series being dedicated towards the character and narrative buildup, it\'s the second half that the series began to strut its stuff. With carefully foreshadowed moments that started peeling back new layers to the plot, and characters growing alongside the story to match it, everything started to come together, as the reveal placed the show on a league of its own. It stepped out of the realm of usual anime fodder and took cues from cinema instead. All of its careful planning and character fixation was finally brought to fruition. The mysterious fog that hid all agendas had finally lifted, leaving nothing but the naked truth of the show\'s secrecy to be laid bare for the audience to see. With the revelation of the third act finally being unveiled, humanity, as the show comes to know it, was made humbled by the presence of something much more greater than itself.For those that have experienced what Argento had to offer, join me in the spoiler section as we discuss this in further detail.***spoiler section***What made the third act so great was beyond the theatrics of the event but what it came to represent thematically in the series. What it managed to set up, in the beginning, resulted in the last few episodes being what I could only describe as ""2001: An Eva Odyssey."" It took the ingenious vision of Kubrick\'s film and pushed beyond its ending point by introducing a prologue that saw with it the genesis of humanity as a species, and the exodus of a new stage of human evolution into a grander sentient being. It literally and figuratively showed our limited understanding when brought face to face with an advanced species. Where humanity saw a brutal, uncaring race of otherworldly creatures, in reality, it was humanity that was the uncultured simple-minded species incapable of comprehending something beyond our current intellect. It\'s like a 2D person trying to grasp the idea of a 3D object. This plot twist even paralleled the journey of Ryu Soma as well, which made it a multifaceted reveal that serviced both the narrative and the characters involved. It\'s an idea that could have easily crumbled under its own weight but manage to pull it off with such gravitas. And since Argento had already committed to making its content as grounded as possible, the potency of this reveal was amplified even further. This isn\'t to say that Argento tackled the idea to the pedigree reached by Kubrick\'s magnum opus; far from it. But the fact that it even took the idea and ran with it was awe-inspiring within itself. It\'s honestly one of the most spectacular latter halves I\'ve seen from any anime, period.But outside of this achievement, the show does have a significant plot hole that hurt it towards the end, and that was the involvement of Mr. X.David ""Mr. X"" Lawrence is by far the worst part of the show because, with his involvement, poor planning or split decision making on the part of the creators was immediately exposed. Earlier in the series, Mr. X was introduced as a sort of ""devil on the shoulder"" character that seemed to only exist in Soma\'s head. With his red hair, devilish features, and constant consumption of apples (obvious forbidden fruit reference), we as an audience was meant to believe that he was, in fact, a figment of the protagonist\'s imagination. But due to what I could only describe as a poorly executed retcon, this character was introduced as a flesh and blood human being that existed all along. Where the problem lies with that is that throughout the show, he was shown to have the ability to seemingly appear and disappear without anyone else outside of Soma acknowledging him. So when the reveal is made that anyone could have seen him all along, it rendered many instances of him appearing out of nowhere (from what we were shown) to be utter bullshit. One could argue that because of Soma\'s borderline delusional state, he simply couldn\'t follow Lawrence\'s movements and that his high-tech skills allowed him to evade cameras and personnel easily, but that still leaves the question as to how and why others were incapable of seeing him up until the point of the reveal. This was sadly a plot hole with close to no proper explanation given, but one I chose to consciously dismiss given everything else that the show had executed well in regards to the ""Space Odyssey"" third act, as well as Ryu Soma\'s character arc. That doesn\'t stop Mr. X from being a problem, and it\'s for that reason that my score was ultimately lowered. But aside from that point, nothing will take away that feeling of being awestruck that came about from the show\'s final act.***end of spoilers***Enjoyment: 9.5/10I\'ve never been one to care about the average scores accumulated by MAL users, but below 7 for this show is criminally low, perhaps being one of the most underrated and undeserving ratings given to any series I\'ve stumbled upon in the medium up to this point. Sadly misunderstood, a show with so many layers that it effectively deafened itself to the general populace. And rather than take the time to decipher its themes, the quicker solution was to subject it to semantics and label it as an ""Evangelion clone."" Ignorance is bliss, unfortunately, that comes at the cost of things of greater value being dismissed by the collective out of convenience.As a fellow anime enthusiast, I saw this at the right time, never once being bothered by the episodic first half or the methodical pacing that it chose to contain everything in. With intriguing characters and a plot that slowly revealed its hand, the more I watched it, the more engrossed I became. The protagonist was one I\'ve seen done wrong so many times before that finally seeing his type done right was quite rewarding. Very few protagonists struck a chord with me in the way he did. This was a show that only grew on me as it went along, and after episodes 16-18, it became an addiction I couldn\'t stop watching. It was modest, never once flexing its accomplishments to obtain any further appraisal. It simply told its story and let the viewers that took the time to understand it to take from it what they will. It\'s that kind of quality that I actively seek out in media. And it\'s that very reason that Argento Soma won me over, flaws and all.Overall: 7.5/10This title is not for the impatient. For those that enjoy and understand the need for carefully planned build up, the payout is satisfactory, but for anyone else seeking instant gratification, you shouldn\'t bother with this. I don\'t like to advocate the saying of ""you\'re not ready for this show yet,"" but in all honesty, sometimes that\'s just the case. This is a show that could only be appreciated by certain viewers past a threshold with their experience exploring the medium. One only accessible to those well-versed in titles of now and those of yesteryear. To truly know the legacy, the lineage, the very building blocks that make up its foundation. But perhaps more importantly, it requires a mindset that\'s moved beyond the ""critics before art"" phase. To receive what this show has to offer is to approach it divorced of any pretense, of any conceit. Humility is a must. And as a viewer, until you\'ve gotten past these crossroads, I suggest keeping this one tucked away for a later date. I can\'t promise that you\'ll receive the same level of payout that I did, but I can assure that anyone in the right mindset to accept what it has to offer will, at the very least, be given something deserving of the price of admission.', ""This Anime was almost dropped. There are some problems with this show and they mostly revolve around the primary character Ryu .... err sorry Takuto is his name in the beging and this guy is an exreteme emo! He is a victim and he wallows in it. I won't go into his reasons for victim hood, but I will say that he starts as a emo and ends as one and I get the feeling he would be a wife beater. Needless to say, I greatly dislike Ryu. Fortunately, he is not the only character, more on that later.Aside from Ryu, there is another annoying...aspect of this show, the music. Music was by Katsuhisa Hattori, a famous and accomplished  composer / conductor.  Argento Soma is a military show, based in the US, so they used military style music, kind of. It was more like music from a military graduation ceremony. Maybe in Japan, that is what they think of when they think of American military music. I don't know, but it didn't work for me.But wait, the show is based in the US? Well, that is different and I like different. Also it is a military show, meaning adult characters, something else I like. In fact there is only one child, Hattie, in the show and she truly acts like a kid. Wow, an anime that realistically portrays the characters! Now, don't get wrong here, all is not peachy with the characters. Yes you already know I dislike Ryu, the others are likable but a bit shallow. After a few episodes they become fairly predictable but there are some surprises toward the end, so yeah, it's okay. They really take the edge off of dealing with Ryu and any one of the characters can carry a single episode with ease.There are more things to like fore this is a Giant anime. Giant Mecha, Giant Aliens, and a Giant Robot. Yeah, the Mecha are pretty cool, the design is nice, and I really like the flight conversion, they are pretty unique although a bit underpowered. The Aliens, well they all look the same, but react differently, too bad they have no personality. The Giant Robot, Frank, I think he is the real star of the show. Frank is just a big bruiser, to fix things you just run up and hit it. If that doesn't work, hit it Harder!  He also has a thing for young blonds, go figure.Now the story. You have Giant aliens landing on earth for an unknown reason. The military is helpless to combat them. A special force is formed with advanced mecha to fight the aliens. The name of this force is NERV....... no no no it's Funeral....  Heheh, okay so the basic story is pretty much a rip of Evangelion without the religious overtones or teenage angst. But there is Ryu, he is full of angst! He is Shinji all grown up and he is still a whiner! Still the story does heavily borrow from Evangelion, transplanted to the US with Pilgrimage Point replacing Tokyo. It's okay though, there are no EVA's attached to extension cords, at least  not really, there are no cords and the Mecha are not really EVAs , for the most part that is. Oh, yeah, and the ending is completely unlike anything in Evangelion, in fact it's pretty different and unique. Which is why I am glad I did not drop this anime.Over all, it's Okay.

To get this revenge he is reborn as Ryu Soma and joins Funeral, a military organization that deals with the aliens that attack the earth.My thoughts:At first, I didn't think I would like the anime but it was surprisingly good. The animation was superb, the characters were likeable and the ending was surprising as well.  It wasn't expected at all. This is an anime I would recommend watching. "", 'Argento Some is sometimes referred to as pretentious, an Evangelion clone, or it\'s said that the main character is ""emo."" I\'m hesitant to use the word pretentious in the many cases where it is used, as that usually just means ""it had lofty ideas, but I didn\'t like it,"" and it\'s seldom a substantive word to apply. Similarities to Evangelion are numerous and probably the closest you\'ll find to a ""clone"" other than RahXephon; the cover, with the main\'s brooding, downward-turned gaze is a bit ""these wounds... they will not heal..."" if not ""CRAWLING IN MY SKIN!"" but as far as the writing and character...of Ryu Soma goes, I don\'t see any real issue—I mean, going on a quest for revenge because your college girlfriend died in an accident is... kind of embarrassing, but it works in the realm of fiction, where love conquers all and we have themes about the self and connecting with others UwU.I came into watching this thinking it might be an unsung masterpiece—certainly it has a devoted mini-fanbase on MAL and elsewhere. The beginning is strong, then by the middle it\'s just okay, and you ride that lukewarm okayness to the end for a stretch of about 16 episodes, a few of the reveals are kind of not too appealing, but all the writing comes together, full circle, and the end is decent and even satisfying—it could have been better, had the writers done more with the middle section. It\'s often said in pedestrian HOW DO I WRITE threads that every story has a beginning, a middle, and an end—they should have just cut the middle out. There was a pretty good movie here, but as a series, it\'s on the mediocre side.The animation is consistent but mostly unexceptional. The direction, background art, and composition are all very solid in the beginning and fair throughout. While the character art is decent, it\'s mostly Ryu that stands out, and the characters tend to be missing their noses. Sometimes they don\'t even have a line or nostrils. Frank\'s design is great with its asymmetry, but all of the other aliens have one boring design.The real problem has everything to do with the aliens. There\'s a mystery as to why they want to head to Pilgrimage Point, but the main problem is that the series devolves into a monotonous monster-of-the-week show. Yes, Evangelion utilized this formula, but they made it work by crafting less repetitive stories around each angel event. The angels looked incredible, and as the show progressed, they tended to become more and more abstract and unsettling. The aliens of Argento Soma and their one design only contain any variance by giving them different abilities and forcing our protagonists to cook up special ways of beating them, but it\'s just doggerel. It\'s very apparent this was on the low-budget side.They could have set time aside for the characters to develop (and they really needed to here), but they repeat the same tedious formula instead. Either they needed to pad this series out for time, or the writer ran out of ideas—perhaps both. One good aspect that sets this show apart from other shows with the same formula, would be Ryu acting as a spy and a bit of a saboteur. Aside from trying to kill Frank a few times, he doesn\'t really do much other than leak information, and this had a lot of potential for greater drama, but it kind of doesn\'t go anywhere. I barely feel like he\'s an undercover agent at all, in fact. There\'s no sense of risk involved.Where the authors seem to lose track of where they were going with the script is seeded at an early point. A mysterious man appears before a recuperating Ryu. He looks a bit like a rejected villain from an already cancelled Yasuomi Uemetsu hentai (seriously, he looks like the guy from Kite), he has a sinister persona, and he\'s one of those characters where half of his lines are quotes he memorized from Shakespeare or other writers. This guy\'s character and motivations completely flip, and it appears they intended to make him a figment rather than real at first.Writer: I know we wanted to do that edgy sequence where Ryu\'s eyes bug-out and we find out he\'s insane, and the camera is all shaky during the hallucination scene, but it\'s not working.Director: Eh, let\'s just make this guy real. The audience will wonder if he\'s in Ryu\'s head. We\'ll slowly unveil he is real after faking the audience out the whole show. Don\'t worry about the fact that cameras would have spotted him by this point and that he\'s under house arrest or the unlikelihood of this guy being able to manipulate so much from behind the scenes on his lonesome and that none of this makes sense. It\'ll make him seem like an enigmatic mastermind. The audience will eat it up.Writer: Your rewrite of the script makes him seem like a completely different character. We alluded to him being the devil, had Ryu entering into a Faustian bargain with him, gave him all of these ""I\'m a bad dude"" faces, and even had him splatter his pumpkin-sized tomato all over Ryu\'s apartment. You\'re going to just randomly rewrite him as a good guy?Director: Who cares? No one is going to remember after all the filler in the middle. This is deep art, and it will be ambiguous and probably seem symbolic. Plot holes just make it more nuanced and fuzzy, they add pizazz and spice, just like real life. It\'s like Cinéma vérité, you know?Writer: I don\'t think that means what you think it means...Most of the themes are established in the opening episodes. The debate between the main character and the professor is a lesson on life, and the super-genius Ryu Soma is a bit slow on the uptake. The themes about connecting with others are handled in a fashion very similar to Evangelion, as this is a mech show that\'s a bit metaphysical. Except instead of being the no. 1 wimp in the world, Ryu is moody, aggressive, and maybe a little autistic? He\'ll just as soon spit in your face or insult you before going ""..."" but that\'s one feisty iteration of the most classic line in anime.The only two characters who have any development are Ryu and Maki—I mean Hattie. Instead of the development being gradual, it\'s all saved for the end. Ryu is one of the better sadsack and introverted mains I\'ve seen in recent years, and he certainly has an interesting design, what with his scars and fancy hairdo and his accident-induced heterochromia (how on earth does your eye become blue after an accident?). Hattie is 13—going on 6. I get that she spent five years in a coma and also has PTSD, but it\'s a bit much having her behave so childishly for almost the entire series. Then she has sudden awareness towards the end of the series and acts like she knows everything about Ryu\'s past relationship with Maki (what she says only makes sense if she has seen the episodes along with us) and also knows him better than he knows himself.The rest of the cast are likable enough, but only two of them have vaguely outlined backstories, and none of them develop at all. It\'s incredible to see a cast interact for 25 episodes and still seemingly not know each other. The butch Misato clone gets a few decent zingers about gender dynamics, and she semi-adopts Hattie and they live together, but unlike Evangelion\'s slice of life bits with Shinji/Asuka/Misato... we never see them together at the apartment—or at all, to be honest. The black guy is the dependable 2nd in command, and like the 1st, he\'s there for delivering exposition.Sue is about as childish as Hattie, and to contradict the beliefs of others, I think it\'s very accurate that she behaves this way. America now must have the lowest standards of entry into the military for a ""developed"" country—it\'s basically McNamara\'s Morons 2.0. I though she was supposed to be half-black and half-white, and she just happens to have silver hair (ANIME) and puts some black warpaint under her eyes, but in the last episode, she has skin as light as most of the other characters and red hair! What the hell? So she slathers on makeup and dyes her hair the entire series, then just doesn\'t do it at the end?Production staff: Sir, that character is from your other series!Director: Whatever... just leave it as is. It\'ll seem avant-garde or something. We\'re making art here. It\'s about emotion, not logic. Our fans will be talking about the deep symbolism of this character\'s transformation for years to come! As we astutely declare in the script: ""It\'s no fun when the mystery is spoiled.""Production staff: What mystery? It\'s an error.Guinevere pretty much just flirts with everyone, and she\'ll say stuff like ""Are you just jealous? ;)"" to trigger a reaction and embarrass the other characters. She also spits in at least one person\'s mouth. Dan (his awful British accent makes the dub unwatchable) is the rival, but he\'s kind of low-key about it—aside from getting irate because Ryu was hogging the computer for too long—and there aren\'t any homoerotic buddy-buddy scenes to break the ice between the two. The scene where they\'re both in the brig is basically wasted.It\'s not like the writer/director lacked the ability to churn more out of these characters. I was surprised by how impactful one of the later episodes was when Ryu is reunited with an old friend. You get a little backstory and characterization in that self-contained episode, but that character already felt like he had more depth than the rest of Ryu\'s crew, and he went out with a bang—whereas if the same happened to Sue, Dan, or Guinevere I\'d probably laugh.The whole show after the solid beginning that leads to Ryu and Hattie being pulled into Funeral\'s (NERV knockoff) orbit goes like this:Ryu: Maki, I\'m gonna kill Frank for what he did to you!Butch Misato: Psychobabble, exposition, blah blah, beep, boop.Ryu: FRANK!Devil: *Quotes Shakespeare and smashes a tomato in Ryu\'s apartment.*Ryu: ...Hattie: Mr. Fairy, I love you!Ryu: Maki, is that you?Hattie: I\'m not Maki. You\'re a bad fairy and a liar.Ryu: Oh, Hottie. ;)Sue: Keep it to your perverted Japanese cartoons.*Ryu throws Hattie in a jet and flies off*Dan: Hey, are you going to stop them?Black guy: I don\'t know. Whatever, lol.Butch Misato: Jargon, jargon. I hope to have a really nice rose garden someday.Guinevere: *Makes a noise indicating she\'s pooling spit in her mouth.*Ryu: Maki, why don\'t you say something? How am I going to understand if you don\'t say anything!?Hattie: My name isn\'t Maki, you mean stupid head!*Time passes.*Ryu: Are you okay, Ma—I mean, Hattie?Hattie: I\'m okay... because I\'m with you. *Blushes*Okay, obviously he doesn\'t hit on her, but the way he says her name often does sound like Hottie rather than Hattie... but it\'s just a back and forth about Maki and Frank, stuffed between battles and irrelevant segments with the other characters. Everything that happens is woven into the core concept to a frightening degree, and the occult phrase as above, so below, definitely applies here (in this instance, understanding something small, leads to an equivalent understanding of something much larger). It\'s kind of satisfying once the end rolls around, and I basically like what they do with it, but I\'d be lying if I didn\'t say this show runs out of gas and is towed along to the end by the execution of the premise alone. I can almost see the ridiculously funny Evangelion ending coming up with all of the characters laughing as our smart blockhead of a main has an epiphany and says, ""OH, it was all just a misunderstanding."" *Ryu places his hand behind his head in embarrassment.* of Ryu Soma goes, I don\'t see any real issue—I mean, going on a quest for revenge because your college girlfriend died in an accident is... kind of embarrassing, but it works in the realm of fiction, where love conquers all and we have themes about the self and connecting with others UwU.I came into watching this thinking it might be an unsung masterpiece—certainly it has a devoted mini-fanbase on MAL and elsewhere.

This guy\'s character and motivations completely flip, and it appears they intended to make him a figment rather than real at first.Writer: I know we wanted to do that edgy sequence where Ryu\'s eyes bug-out and we find out he\'s insane, and the camera is all shaky during the hallucination scene, but it\'s not working.Director: Eh, let\'s just make this guy real. The audience will wonder if he\'s in Ryu\'s head. We\'ll slowly unveil he is real after faking the audience out the whole show. Don\'t worry about the fact that cameras would have spotted him by this point and that he\'s under house arrest or the unlikelihood of this guy being able to manipulate so much from behind the scenes on his lonesome and that none of this makes sense. It\'ll make him seem like an enigmatic mastermind. The audience will eat it up.Writer: Your rewrite of the script makes him seem like a completely different character. We alluded to him being the devil, had Ryu entering into a Faustian bargain with him, gave him all of these ""I\'m a bad dude"" faces, and even had him splatter his pumpkin-sized tomato all over Ryu\'s apartment. You\'re going to just randomly rewrite him as a good guy?Director: Who cares? No one is going to remember after all the filler in the middle. This is deep art, and it will be ambiguous and probably seem symbolic. Plot holes just make it more nuanced and fuzzy, they add pizazz and spice, just like real life. It\'s like Cinéma vérité, you know?Writer: I don\'t think that means what you think it means...Most of the themes are established in the opening episodes. The debate between the main character and the professor is a lesson on life, and the super-genius Ryu Soma is a bit slow on the uptake. The themes about connecting with others are handled in a fashion very similar to Evangelion, as this is a mech show that\'s a bit metaphysical. Except instead of being the no. 1 wimp in the world, Ryu is moody, aggressive, and maybe a little autistic? He\'ll just as soon spit in your face or insult you before going ""..."" but that\'s one feisty iteration of the most classic line in anime.The only two characters who have any development are Ryu and Maki—I mean Hattie. Instead of the development being gradual, it\'s all saved for the end. Ryu is one of the better sadsack and introverted mains I\'ve seen in recent years, and he certainly has an interesting design, what with his scars and fancy hairdo and his accident-induced heterochromia (how on earth does your eye become blue after an accident?). Hattie is 13—going on 6. I get that she spent five years in a coma and also has PTSD, but it\'s a bit much having her behave so childishly for almost the entire series. Then she has sudden awareness towards the end of the series and acts like she knows everything about Ryu\'s past relationship with Maki (what she says only makes sense if she has seen the episodes along with us) and also knows him better than he knows himself.The rest of the cast are likable enough, but only two of them have vaguely outlined backstories, and none of them develop at all. It\'s incredible to see a cast interact for 25 episodes and still seemingly not know each other. The butch Misato clone gets a few decent zingers about gender dynamics, and she semi-adopts Hattie and they live together, but unlike Evangelion\'s slice of life bits with Shinji/Asuka/Misato... we never see them together at the apartment—or at all, to be honest. The black guy is the dependable 2nd in command, and like the 1st, he\'s there for delivering exposition.Sue is about as childish as Hattie, and to contradict the beliefs of others, I think it\'s very accurate that she behaves this way. America now must have the lowest standards of entry into the military for a ""developed"" country—it\'s basically McNamara\'s Morons 2.0. I though she was supposed to be half-black and half-white, and she just happens to have silver hair (ANIME) and puts some black warpaint under her eyes, but in the last episode, she has skin as light as most of the other characters and red hair! What the hell? So she slathers on makeup and dyes her hair the entire series, then just doesn\'t do it at the end?Production staff: Sir, that character is from your other series!Director: Whatever... just leave it as is. It\'ll seem avant-garde or something. We\'re making art here. It\'s about emotion, not logic. Our fans will be talking about the deep symbolism of this character\'s transformation for years to come! As we astutely declare in the script: ""It\'s no fun when the mystery is spoiled.""Production staff: What mystery? It\'s an error.Guinevere pretty much just flirts with everyone, and she\'ll say stuff like ""Are you just jealous? ;)"" to trigger a reaction and embarrass the other characters. She also spits in at least one person\'s mouth. Dan (his awful British accent makes the dub unwatchable) is the rival, but he\'s kind of low-key about it—aside from getting irate because Ryu was hogging the computer for too long—and there aren\'t any homoerotic buddy-buddy scenes to break the ice between the two. The scene where they\'re both in the brig is basically wasted.It\'s not like the writer/director lacked the ability to churn more out of these characters. I was surprised by how impactful one of the later episodes was when Ryu is reunited with an old friend. You get a little backstory and characterization in that self-contained episode, but that character already felt like he had more depth than the rest of Ryu\'s crew, and he went out with a bang—whereas if the same happened to Sue, Dan, or Guinevere I\'d probably laugh.The whole show after the solid beginning that leads to Ryu and Hattie being pulled into Funeral\'s (NERV knockoff) orbit goes like this:Ryu: Maki, I\'m gonna kill Frank for what he did to you!Butch Misato: Psychobabble, exposition, blah blah, beep, boop.Ryu: FRANK!Devil: *Quotes Shakespeare and smashes a tomato in Ryu\'s apartment.*Ryu: ...Hattie: Mr. Fairy, I love you!Ryu: Maki, is that you?Hattie: I\'m not Maki. You\'re a bad fairy and a liar.Ryu: Oh, Hottie. ;)Sue: Keep it to your perverted Japanese cartoons.*Ryu throws Hattie in a jet and flies off*Dan: Hey, are you going to stop them?Black guy: I don\'t know. Whatever, lol.Butch Misato: Jargon, jargon. I hope to have a really nice rose garden someday.Guinevere: *Makes a noise indicating she\'s pooling spit in her mouth.*Ryu: Maki, why don\'t you say something? How am I going to understand if you don\'t say anything!?Hattie: My name isn\'t Maki, you mean stupid head!*Time passes.*Ryu: Are you okay, Ma—I mean, Hattie?Hattie: I\'m okay... because I\'m with you. *Blushes*Okay, obviously he doesn\'t hit on her, but the way he says her name often does sound like Hottie rather than Hattie... but it\'s just a back and forth about Maki and Frank, stuffed between battles and irrelevant segments with the other characters. Everything that happens is woven into the core concept to a frightening degree, and the occult phrase as above, so below, definitely applies here (in this instance, understanding something small, leads to an equivalent understanding of something much larger). It\'s kind of satisfying once the end rolls around, and I basically like what they do with it, but I\'d be lying if I didn\'t say this show runs out of gas and is towed along to the end by the execution of the premise alone. I can almost see the ridiculously funny Evangelion ending coming up with all of the characters laughing as our smart blockhead of a main has an epiphany and says, ""OH, it was all just a misunderstanding."" *Ryu places his hand behind his head in embarrassment.*', ""Fairly droll for the first dozen of so episodes by at around episode 18 it starts to move, emotions set in and things go somewhere.. worth watching, don't let the lack of action and fairy land stuff put you off, it's a short series, stick with it.

It does bear some similarites, especially when it comes to the mechas and the secret that lies beneath their armor. Otherwise, they\'re two different concepts.

The actions scenes in Argentosoma are often much more intense than those in Evangelion. My favorite aspect of Argentosoma is the character design.

Despite having some obvious flaws, it still managed to be impressive by the end, making bold proclamations without shoving anything down your throat. It\'s an awkward dish made by someone you know and love, that nonetheless tasted home. It forced a smile on me, it made my eyes wet, while I was fully aware that what I was eating is going to fail on a competitive contest. Therefore, I could only grow to treat this anime with love, albeit a tough one. Which is rare, to be honest.Thematically, this...anime is incredible. The last five episodes are enough to change your entire perspective on this show, even if you considered everything up until then as mediocre. Among other things, it covers the political and philosophical aspects of conflict, without picking any particular side.

Who\'s my enemy, and who\'s my ally? What\'s the difference between ""my"" and ""ours""? In the midst of panic and social unrest, we\'ll quickly dismiss these fundamental questions, in favor of the imminent. Our ability to plan and foresee in these kind of circumstances is severed, and this notion is positively reinforced throughout the anime.

Consequence is rarely forgotten in character interaction (unless said character is Ryu), providing gravity behind individual action, besides making the world more believable. Needless to say then, I enjoyed Argento Soma\'s characters. Yes, Ryu too. He had some of the OP essence as with many anime protagonists, but his character arc was rarely inconsistent, even if flawed (morally). With some exceptions, there was no particular reason to disapprove someone, because as I said, their logic is pretty solid; everyone had a reason as to why they were doing whatever they were doing, which was pretty cool.Out of the cast, commander Ines was probably my favourite. I might be slightly biased here, but I just enjoy the representation of women in ""unusual"" work sectors, in this case the military. And it wasn\'t just a display of swagger and raw muscle you\'ll most often find in other shows. In Argento Soma, there is a genuine political concern for both the official and unofficial approval of women in these positions, a concern voiced by Ines herself: ""Was I truly chosen for my skill set?"" Her rebellion is not one of upheaval, but of sincere, collected, and justified dialogue, in spite of the recipient being an awfully conservative and pigheaded regime.

Let\'s just say that I wasn\'t very pleased having music play on top of Harriet singing, more than once. Thankfully, it wasn\'t disastrous enough to mix different keys, though that alone did not save these scenes.

Why is the black SARG\'s pilot turning into tomato juice a reference to him, if he\'s not even on the government\'s side? Why is that pilot even killed in the first place? David is a character that, not only makes no sense, but takes the rest of the plot down with him. Oh yeah, and he lives with an injured leg by the end, after being gunned down at point blank. That\'s peak comedy right there.Speaking of plot and holes: in the reveal that the aliens have no bad intentions, the show conveniently ignores how they were disintegrating innocent civilians with lasers... it becomes an uncomfortably transparent inconsistency, when the show simultaneously wants to highlight Harriet\'s past trauma.

How they chose to put her in the co-pilot seat of a SARG tasked with interception, and not in the much safer transport aircraft? How Ryu\'s college buddy was salivating over her like it was normal, or how two dudes were literally going to rape her? So okay, we get it - she\'s an innocent victim of war and the adult world, so can we tone down the unnecessary degeneracy?

The decision lies on you: do you want to take the journey?Wonderful (as defined in Oxford Languages): inspiring delight, pleasure, or admiration.', 'Argento Soma is as pretentious as it gets. Inspired by EVA and the like, this show is another old mecha garbage, full of plotholes, with a mess of a pretentious ending, not thought out at the start of the series. I don\'t like writing bibles that wastes people\'s time, so here we go:Plot is, in essence, a very obvious attempt at trying to cash in on the EVA train. Every episode, we\'re introduced to a new alien , the mechas take care of him, episode ends. Sound familiar, right? It\'s called the monster-of-the-week formula, and corresponds to 70% of the show. Very unoriginal, boring, slow-paced...(probably because they were stretching it out tbh). But the truth is, no one talks about those episodes, because they mean (mostly) nothing to the plot, apart from the fact that all aliens\' paths converge to the same point (familiar right?). Almost all the discourse around Argento Soma rests on the beggining and ending of the show, which infuriates me. MOST episodes are boring and unoriginal, and I do not recommend it to anyone who values their time.I will be discussing the ending next, so there will be spoilers. I do encourage you to read it because this is all the show has to offer and you\'ll have to sit through 18 horrendous episodes to get to it. So, SPOILER ALERT.Let\'s begin the spoiler section:I\'ll individually dissect each part of the twist : first, the pilgrimage point (as in, the point where all aliens were trying to get to), is the house of the first austronaut to ever leave the solar system, Yuri Leonov. First of all, it boggles me that this was a mystery in the first place. Does no one in Funeral know his address before? Did no one do any basic research? I don\'t understand why, in 2059, simple information like this is not available. Also, why didn\'t they go there? The place isn\'t guarded by the military at all.Second, and this is by far the coolest par of the entire show, Frank is Yuri Leonov, the same astronaut from before. Yuri Leonov, after staying adrift in space, encountered the land of the fairies, a place where beings that transcend our notion live. After encountering those fairies and becoming one of them, he returns to earth somehow (isn\'t explained) as Frank, the big robot that helps Funeral fight aliens. And the fairies (aliens they were fighting) are the ones trying to rescue him to return to the land of the fairies. This is super cool but is very sloppy as a lot of things weren\'t explained and may well be my interpretation, since it leaves so much unclear. How did he come back to earth? How did the fairies know where he lived when he was still human? If he is an astronaut, why did he behave so irrationaly at the beggining of the series? Such points are left uncleared and unanswered, probably because this twist was thought after the fact.Third, Mr.X, the unknown man that helped our protagonist to change identities and join Funeral. Oh boy, I have never ever in the history of anime encountered such a gigantic plot hole my entire life. They were setting him up as a mysterious character that was CLEARLY intended to only exist in soma\'s head. He teleports and disappears, leaves cryptic messages and has a lot of religious imagery attached to him to represent a devil. That Mr. X turns out to be Leonov\'s friend called David Lawrence, who should\'ve been house arrested. So, you\'re trying to tell me that he was never caught in any cameras, no one else saw him ever, nor checked his house to see if he was actually confined? No explaination given at all in any of this points. This exposed exactly what this show is: a quick, uninspired, pretentious, sloppy attempt of storytelling. This makes me believe that this entire ""twist"" planned afterwards, which is dissapointing as most of the show is a slow paced and boring generic mecha garbage. Final rating is 3/10 and it is in parts due to this, as the generic mecha garbage deserve around a 5/10 for me.Minor Nitpicks that stack up to lower the grade:- episode 14: Harriet escapes a military facility and they struggle an entire episode to find her, despite having cameras everywhere.- episode 2, strange focus given to Harriet\'s pingent, only to never be brought up again- animation gets pretty sloppy at times (inconsistency of faces), OST sometimes fails to meet the tone of what\'s on screen.- conveniently Soma\'s girlfriend (Maki) looks the same as Harriet and as Leonov\'s wife, which is essential for the plot to work. Also Harriet and Maki sing the same song (?). Kinda cringe tbh, as most scenes of Maki usually are.- The Aliens all look the same (to save budget lol) as also does the mechas, dissapointing considering the character designs look so unique.- Deus-ex Machina in the form of the excalibur to kill one of the aliens, there are others but that one stood out to me the most.- Why does Soma think Frank killed maki? He was trying to save her, even in his memory it is pretty clear that Frank didn\'t even get to touch her, she died because of the base collapsing, not Frank.END OF SPOILERSTL;DR:This show is, at heart, a boring monster-of-the-week generic mecha anime with edgyness. The ending is dumb and pretentious people will try to tell you otherwise. (probably because they were stretching it out tbh). But the truth is, no one talks about those episodes, because they mean (mostly) nothing to the plot, apart from the fact that all aliens\' paths converge to the same point (familiar right?). Almost all the discourse around Argento Soma rests on the beggining and ending of the show, which infuriates me. MOST episodes are boring and unoriginal, and I do not recommend it to anyone who values their time.I will be discussing the ending next, so there will be spoilers. I do encourage you to read it because this is all the show has to offer and you\'ll have to sit through 18 horrendous episodes to get to it. So, SPOILER ALERT.Let\'s begin the spoiler section:I\'ll individually dissect each part of the twist : first, the pilgrimage point (as in, the point where all aliens were trying to get to), is the house of the first austronaut to ever leave the solar system, Yuri Leonov. First of all, it boggles me that this was a mystery in the first place. Does no one in Funeral know his address before? Did no one do any basic research? I don\'t understand why, in 2059, simple information like this is not available. Also, why didn\'t they go there? The place isn\'t guarded by the military at all.Second, and this is by far the coolest par of the entire show, Frank is Yuri Leonov, the same astronaut from before. Yuri Leonov, after staying adrift in space, encountered the land of the fairies, a place where beings that transcend our notion live. After encountering those fairies and becoming one of them, he returns to earth somehow (isn\'t explained) as Frank, the big robot that helps Funeral fight aliens. And the fairies (aliens they were fighting) are the ones trying to rescue him to return to the land of the fairies. This is super cool but is very sloppy as a lot of things weren\'t explained and may well be my interpretation, since it leaves so much unclear. How did he come back to earth? How did the fairies know where he lived when he was still human? If he is an astronaut, why did he behave so irrationaly at the beggining of the series? Such points are left uncleared and unanswered, probably because this twist was thought after the fact.Third, Mr.X, the unknown man that helped our protagonist to change identities and join Funeral. Oh boy, I have never ever in the history of anime encountered such a gigantic plot hole my entire life. They were setting him up as a mysterious character that was CLEARLY intended to only exist in soma\'s head. He teleports and disappears, leaves cryptic messages and has a lot of religious imagery attached to him to represent a devil. That Mr. X turns out to be Leonov\'s friend called David Lawrence, who should\'ve been house arrested. So, you\'re trying to tell me that he was never caught in any cameras, no one else saw him ever, nor checked his house to see if he was actually confined? No explaination given at all in any of this points. This exposed exactly what this show is: a quick, uninspired, pretentious, sloppy attempt of storytelling. This makes me believe that this entire ""twist"" planned afterwards, which is dissapointing as most of the show is a slow paced and boring generic mecha garbage. Final rating is 3/10 and it is in parts due to this, as the generic mecha garbage deserve around a 5/10 for me.Minor Nitpicks that stack up to lower the grade:- episode 14: Harriet escapes a military facility and they struggle an entire episode to find her, despite having cameras everywhere.- episode 2, strange focus given to Harriet\'s pingent, only to never be brought up again- animation gets pretty sloppy at times (inconsistency of faces), OST sometimes fails to meet the tone of what\'s on screen.- conveniently Soma\'s girlfriend (Maki) looks the same as Harriet and as Leonov\'s wife, which is essential for the plot to work. Also Harriet and Maki sing the same song (?). Kinda cringe tbh, as most scenes of Maki usually are.- The Aliens all look the same (to save budget lol) as also does the mechas, dissapointing considering the character designs look so unique.- Deus-ex Machina in the form of the excalibur to kill one of the aliens, there are others but that one stood out to me the most.- Why does Soma think Frank killed maki? He was trying to save her, even in his memory it is pretty clear that Frank didn\'t even get to touch her, she died because of the base collapsing, not Frank.END OF SPOILERSTL;DR:This show is, at heart, a boring monster-of-the-week generic mecha anime with edgyness.

The air time slot and DVD release of this in both Japan and the Americas was poorly timed and this series got overshadowed and forgotten because of it.This I would say is the closest thing to being a proper implementation of what Evangelion was after without the meandering plot and loss of focus that troubled EVA during it\'s later episodes. If you were at all disappointed by the way EVA handled itself later on, then this anime does a great job of picking up a very similar concept and follows through without needing...a movie or OVA to wrap it up.This anime focuses on its storyline and the effects war and service have on people. It\'s a very serious tone, and deals with a naturally unlikable main character. But this I feel kind of plays well with the rest of the cast as it lets the viewer focus on the full cast rather than staying involved with a singular character. It plays the unlikable protagonist character well, and does a great job of pacing the story, and developing it\'s entire cast with a believable progression, while still keeping strongly to it\'s sci-fi setting. It is a good example of the ""Unlikable Protagonist"" story and writing element.The series pulls directly from Shakespeare, Russian and US Army inspiration,  and delves deep into the psychology of loss, and the tragedy of war.The sound and soundtrack is fantastic and has many unforgettable themes that stick in your head long after. Silent Wind, the ""Nior"" Theme, Wonderful World, and other tracks are easy to remember long after because they are so distinct and well composed. Though the ending theme is very odd and overly 90s cliche and could have been much better it\'s one of the only disappointments of the series.The English dub is also very good, and is one of the few examples of very well thought out and very well played and performed dubs. IT\'s close to Ghibli level, not exactly, but very close.The art style however is a bit odd and uncharacteristic of the time frame, and anime as a whole. While it pulls from it\'s 90\'s origin, it takes a significant strive away from standard expectations and leaves undefined features contrasting with overly defined features on the same character. It gives the show a distinct style unique for anime. It\'s strange at first, but it grows on you and plays very well with it\'s visual story telling.Interestingly enough, they were unexpectedly well focused on military details and getting them correct. There are things in the anime that are real parts of the US Military. Things that I expected any animator to just guess and replicate, they instead got accurate with a small waiver of artistic liberty. They even got the PX Military exchange shop correct. That\'s a really minute detail that most people will definitely miss.The show wears its military, Russian, and Shakespearean inspirations on it\'s sleeve and plays out much like a Drama play, and there is even an additional OVA that goes over the history of a fan favorite character(Sue Harris).It\'s clever, smart, and explores tough subjects and hard to face realities.I would definitely recommend this if you\'re into heavier themes, and harder to deal with subject matter.

I had actually dropped it after the first 2 episodes.  I picked it back up and finished it a couple years later.The majority of the episodes consist of the para-military organization ""Funeral"" defending earth from alien invaders with their mecha.  Meanwhile the understory consists of Takuto\'s desire for revenge against Frank (the monster/hero created from the parts of defeated aliens).  Things get quite a bit better once you find out ""why"" all the aliens are trying to reach the same location on earth.The storytelling itself...is sub-par, and character development is lacking.

It still turned out to be a decent enough show to watch.', 'This review will continually be updated as I *eventually* slosh through this series.I was set up for disappointment. Knowing what sunrise is capable of, ex: Geass, I expected a cool mecha story with some flare. The protagonist looks super cool. I decided to give it a go. Boy am I thoroughly disappointed with this title.Story: Argento Soma is the rip off of Evangelion with absolutely no budget. Except they somehow took Eva\'s initially confusing story and morphed it into complete garbage. Out of the blue we learn that aliens are attacking earth? It literally came out of the blue with no hints towards that...being the case at all. I thought initially it would be a story regarding the exploration of the alien shot down and the struggle between humans and the alien. Buuuuuuut no. Fighting the aliens WITH and alien (looking at you EVA)... like cmon seriously? The organization ""Funeral"" is literally NERV with a drastic cut in funding. They even have rip off scenes of the MAGI computers and some chick that is supposed to be like Gendo?? like cmon. This story is complete garbage from the get go. The protagonist has NO reason to go as far down his ""evil"" path... like cmon... a girl that stood you up? This story has horrendous writing. I give it a 2 (Dreadful/Horrible).Art: The first episode had me. I thought this series might be something special. Well it was a lie. The aliens are all bland in color schemes and look muddied up (not in the good way like battle damage). Some of the characters look straight stupid like the cop in the beginning. I could literally look down at my toilet bowl after taco bell and see better art than this. It gets a 3 (Poor/Very bad).Sound: This music is absolute garbage. Music doesn\'t fit scenes. It all out of synch. It this series has awesome music it would be maybe even above average at a 6 as a whole, but alas this isn\'t the case. I don\'t even know how to describe the music. Just... Just no. It\'s like if toddlers tried to make military esque music. It\'s downright corny. It gets a 1 (Pathetic/Appalling)Characters: There\'s only one SEMI interesting character at this point in the show and that is David Lawrence. The amount of mystery that shrouds him as well as the way he talks in old literature is a breath of fresh air. He seems truly evil but like an angel. Sadly the rest of the cast is dog shit. Takuto is edgy for no reason, Harriet is an annoying little girl who believes in elves, Sue is a childish person who would NEVER make it into the US military (oh yeah, its also set in the US). FRANK.. Who\'s idea was it to name the damn robot Frank? I get that this work was supposed to be an extremely loose interpretation of Frankenstein... but naming him adds to the childish and utterly inconsequential nature of the show. Guinevere is hot and that\'s it. Michael is the stereotypical African American that the Japanese portray in the military, Ernest is just odd, and Lana is a wannabe Gendo. Characters get a 2 (Dreadful/Horrible).Enjoyment: Not much to say here. I truly love anime but its so hard to enjoy this show.

Keep reading and I\'ll tell you that this anime is not just entertaining, but full of amazing human relationships, and has a beautiful, satisfying ending. Yes, it takes some time to get to the ""serious"" action, but the character development is wonderful. Like one reviewer said, don\'t let the ""fairyland stuff"" turn you off--it\'s not what you think.Most of the reviews for this anime (and there aren\'t many) are not complete or are incredibly unfair in how they portray the story. I have a feeling they watched this show with only one eye open...(or didn\'t finish it). Otherwise, it was not their cup of tea. I have no idea why--I loved it. Here\'s my short, yet succinct, review:What it IS:The musical score AND Shakespearean stuff is lovely and flows throughout the whole anime. There is a balance of tension and beauty.I LOVED the main character as he was complex and atypical (or should that actually mean normal, as all humans are unique and complicated?). Hattie, or the girl with the ""annoying voice,"" as some said, is actually a great voice actress and plays the part of a traumatized young girl perfectly (it is not cliche). Her character development, like Soma\'s, becomes more and more noticeable and enjoyable throughout the story. The relationship between these two becomes deep, heartrending, heart-wrenching, and redemptive.Artwork is classic--there may be a couple sloppy scenes here and there (not very noticeable), but on the whole, like Trigun, there is some pretty fantastic hand-drawn stuff. The main character\'s appearance changes (as his character changes--you\'ll find out why) and becomes really gritty and awesome. He is definitely someone we can all identify with...You really can\'t take your eyes off Soma. He\'s just ghostly cool and unpredictable.The ending is fantastic. That\'s all I\'ll give you, as you really don\'t want any spoilers for this show. The surprises are all great and weave into the plot amazingly. Look for details. Rewatch value is pretty high.What is it NOT:It is NOT like Evangelion. Just because there are flying machines, ""aliens,"" etc., does not mean it is like EVA or is trying to be. Argento completely stands on its own. And we don\'t have any obnoxiously angsty teens who are crying the entire time toward a horribly bizarre ending. The main character in Soma is incredibly complex and develops over the entire story line--and matures in realistic ways. My guess is some people gave up this anime after the first few episodes without taking the time to see what happens.The only disappointments for me:The only thing I would agree with is that the story gets slow for a few episodes in the middle,  but then seriously speeds up and takes off (probably around episode 13, imo). There are some moments of awkward dubbing, but (this is actually a positive) the lead actors are great and are now considered veterans of the anime world. It\'s fun to see them in their earlier works. The only thing I could have wished for more of was Soma--even though we saw a heck a lot of his character. I ended up loving his character so much that I was sad the series ended. I guess that is another positive.Fun Facts:Crispin Freeman plays Lt. Dan. Fun to listen to him voice act in an older work. You can tell he\'s not totally in ""Crispin mode"" yet.Soma is voiced by Stave Staley who plays Moondoggie from Eureka 7.A certain mysterious character (won\'t give away here) is voiced by the actor who plays Legato from Trigun.

The protagonist in the anime has very little to do with this intriguing and mysterious guy. He is, in fact, a whiny child with no goals and no basic thinking abilities. Someone ready to panic for no reason whatsoever to the point of being ridiculous.Honestly, I am not sure what was worse in this anime - the Swiss-cheese-like plotholes or the mostly-abysmal characters, who acted with no reasoning, so let\'s say both.I am still struggling to understand what this was all about - was it love or was it aliens?...Anyway, it was ALL very bad.The screenplay is terrible. I have watched the anime on double speed and still had some moments, which dragged on endlessly, needlessly.The story began with a walk through the lives of two (supposedly) genius students and quickly turned into a sci-fi mess with ""superbeing"" elements. One of the students was fascinated with the other. We, of course, were in the dark why, while the other student was very attached to her professor. We, of course, were once again not informed or shown what made him so great.Later on, we met a little girl and her grandpa, then moved in with a super-squad fighting the super-bad aliens. Suddenly, our protagonist appeared with a new name and a brand new background, and guess what - we had no idea how this happened and what part of the new story was reliable (if any).In episode 20, few somewhat new heroes appeared and the story finally began to make sense. Why, oh why they had not chosen a different protagonist or at least given us some background on the key characters? This would have helped save this mess or at least would have added something to grab on to.The final battle was also a useless effort, as none of the characters ever grew on me, so I could not care less what was happening to them.The end was disgustingly stupid and came out-of-nowhere. No background, no reason for any of the events shown or the relationships demonstrated.The final nail in the coffin was the ""soma"" itself.

Argento Soma it's said to be slow. Well, honestly, i didn't care, and i didnt notice until the half way. The construction and the interior drama are outstanding, each character has its own complexity of motives, truly remarkable.The fights are pretty good.

Such has slow and tedious pacing, dated animation and an uninspired soundtrack, minus the series\'s introduction opening, credits and final song.While the flaws can be overwhelming at times, they don\'t undo what is in store for you, and OH BOY, this anime has a lot of twists and realizations. This makes it worthwhile to watch and is suggested for individuals that prefer a more realistic approach to storytelling that doesn\'t rely too heavily on action or cliches to push forward character development at the cost of feeling dull at times. It\'s the type...of anime you need to be patient for and not try to control. It will reveal itself to you slowly and peel back all the layers exposing Argento Soma for what it truly is; A story about flawed humans consumed by ideals of revenge, justice, survival and trauma/loss. Mystery, curiosity and philosophy are also part of this anime and become a lot more prominent towards the end of the series, passed episode 18, where the series quality improves considerably.Speaking of the story, it\'s slow-paced and methodical. A heavy focus is on the main cast, who aren\'t cardboard copy-and-paste type cliche characters. A good example is the protagonist, who\'s a mixture of overly emotional and hyper-intelligent/philosophical being who yo-yos through phases of villainy, being heroic and troubleshooting problems, making him a contradicting character who\'s easy to both love and hate due to how unstable he is. Another example would be another main character the cast calls ""Frank,"" who\'s an alien that no one understands and forces to fight for them against other aliens who all look the same; which may appear as boring or lazy to many, but there is a reason why they follow that format of appearance.Lastly, to end this brief review, Argento Soma is nothing like Neon Genesis Evangelion; it only appears so from a superficial standpoint, as there are aliens and secret organizations with symbolic names such as Morgue and Funeral. However, the similarities end here; it has more in common with ""The Iron Giant"" and ""Interstellar"" than anything seen in Evangelion. Even the story plots and motivations are entirely different in both series. Evangelion focuses on the internal conflicts of many characters, employing many of Arthur Schopenhauer\'s, Sigmund Freud\'s and Carl Jung\'s theories. In contrast, Argento Soma is concerned with external conflicts which cause internal tensions, with a nod to Carl Jung\'s theory regarding the Anima and Animus and the concept of consciousness.I give it a 7.5 out of 10 and suggest it to patient viewers interested in psychology and philosophy, as those will be the most fascinating aspects of the story. On the other hand, if you\'re looking for action or watching something for the thrill of it, then Argento Soma won\'t be a fun experience. of anime you need to be patient for and not try to control.

A good example is the protagonist, who\'s a mixture of overly emotional and hyper-intelligent/philosophical being who yo-yos through phases of villainy, being heroic and troubleshooting problems, making him a contradicting character who\'s easy to both love and hate due to how unstable he is. Another example would be another main character the cast calls ""Frank,"" who\'s an alien that no one understands and forces to fight for them against other aliens who all look the same; which may appear as boring or lazy to many, but there is a reason why they follow that format of appearance.Lastly, to end this brief review, Argento Soma is nothing like Neon Genesis Evangelion; it only appears so from a superficial standpoint, as there are aliens and secret organizations with symbolic names such as Morgue and Funeral. However, the similarities end here; it has more in common with ""The Iron Giant"" and ""Interstellar"" than anything seen in Evangelion. Even the story plots and motivations are entirely different in both series. Evangelion focuses on the internal conflicts of many characters, employing many of Arthur Schopenhauer\'s, Sigmund Freud\'s and Carl Jung\'s theories. In contrast, Argento Soma is concerned with external conflicts which cause internal tensions, with a nod to Carl Jung\'s theory regarding the Anima and Animus and the concept of consciousness.I give it a 7.5 out of 10 and suggest it to patient viewers interested in psychology and philosophy, as those will be the most fascinating aspects of the story. On the other hand, if you\'re looking for action or watching something for the thrill of it, then Argento Soma won\'t be a fun experience.', 'Not really sure what to make of this. It seems to change a lot over the course of the series and nothing ever really becomes that clear. It also has a main protagonist who is very hard to like, but unlike other such dislikeable leads (Guts from Berserk, Sunabozu from same, etc.) has nothing which really redeems him in terms of interest (other than his snazzy hair cut). I think it’s the murkiness of the plot that leaves me with a general sense of dislike for the series. While the major plot points are addressed (or thrown away in PLOT TWISTS!!) there is a veritable...multitude of other issues which don’t get addressed. All in all this series just left me feeling a bit meh multitude of other issues which don’t get addressed. All in all this series just left me feeling a bit meh', 'This show had so much potential, such a strong and compelling start and it squanders it all by doing nothing. Seriously, the show really doesn\'t do much throughout most of it\'s runtime, but I\'ll talk about that later. In the year 2059, aliens have invaded Earth and humanity is thrown into a war. Takuto Kaneshiro, a snobbish college student and mathematics major, I think, initially has nothing to do with that war. He\'s just an ordinary twenty-something in a strained and deteriorating relationship with his girlfriend, Maki Agata. The two were college lovers and you get more and more glimpses of how their relationship blossomed...over time during flashback scenes. I say ""flashback"" because the first episode is essentially a backstory/origin story for Takuto. The real ""story"" happens afterwards. Takuto and Maki begin to spend less time with each other. Maki canceling plans and telling Takuto that she\'s busy all the time. This goes on for months and Takuto, understandably, grows more frustrated by this. It\'s later discovered that Maki and Professor Noguchi, a teacher at the college they went to, have discovered a new alien creature. The colossal behemoth lays dormant; not even awaken by the experiments conducted on it. Professor Noguchi gives a legendary and epic name to the alien. FRANK. FRANK-ly, I would\'ve gone with a better name like ""Epsilon Gamma 2000"" but that works, too. Argento Soma means, ""Silver Body"" in Greek, so I wanted to stay consistent with the Greek motif.Takuto and Maki have a sad exchange of words halfway through the episode. Takuto is clearly upset with Maki and wants her to spend more time with him like they use to. Maki tries to justify her actions, but Takuto refuses to listen and lashes out on her. Turns out Takuto was planning on proposing to Maki and throws away the engagement ring in her face. After finishing the show, upon reflection, this scene is much more tragic than what it originally was. This is going to be the very last conversation Takuto and Maki ever have and they end it on a sour note. How tragic. During the experiments, Frank wakes up. Frank is a powerful alien who wakes up in a pretty grumpy mood. He destroys the entire facility with a giant explosion killing everyone except Takuto. Half of Takuto\'s face is damaged and the building is in ruin. He screams Maki\'s name over and over again getting no response. It\'s just dead silence. The final scene of the episode is a damaged picture of Maki and Takuto.What a great start! I absolutely loved it! If the anime was this episode alone, it would get a strong 8 maybe a light 9 from me. The second episode is also strong, but not as good as the first. We\'re introduced to a new character named Harriet Bartholomew nicknamed Hattie. I would\'ve never, ever imagined that I would encounter an anime character named Hattie. My grandmother is also named Hattie, so I greatly appreciate that. She is capable of speaking to Frank, who escaped the facility in the previous episode. The two somehow become good friends and share a very strong bond for the entire show. Takuto is now in the hospital and is visited by this freaking-looking dude who has a great character design. Long red hair that goes straight down his back, a sick goatee, ear piercings, a lab coat, and some granny smith apples that he carries around for no particular reason at all. I\'m sure it\'s symbolic for something, but I have no clue. He also quotes Shakespeare everytime he\'s on screen, so yeah, that\'s a thing. He calls himself ""Mr. X"" and gives Takuto a new lease on life; by giving him a new identity and a new job. This makes Takuto a college dropout. Join the club, dude. His new name is Ryu Soma and he now works for a military group called,  ""Funeral."" He also has one of the most badass character designs I\'ve seen in an anime. He has gnarly scars on the left side of his face, his left eye color changed to a light blue, almost white color giving him the illusion of blindness in that eye. He not actually blind. Heterochromia has always looked cool to me. And part of his hair changed to a white color that stands up more compared to the rest of his hair. The man looks incredible, the change isn\'t too drastic, but it\'s genius to me.Now this is the point where I stop caring about most of the details, because once the show introduces the members of Funeral, the show goes into a direction that I\'m not a fan of at all. I\'ll say this right now, the first two episodes and the epilouge are the only strong epiodes of Argento Soma. The members of Funeral don\'t really do anything for me. I don\'t care about them all that much, despite all of them having semi-realized backgrounds and backstories. Sue Harris, Michael Heartland, Guinevere Green, Dan Simmons, and Lana Ines are all okay characters. They all left little to no impression on me whatsoever, and I will forget who they are a week after I publish this review. With the exception of Lana and Dan. Lana was the commander of Funeral, so her face was on screen for the vast majority of the show. Dan Simmons is definitely my favorite of the bunch who gradually becomes more hostile towards Ryu. The two are practically rivals, at least from the perspective of Dan. Saying that Dan is my favorite of the bunch doesn\'t mean that much since most of the cast lacks a lot of character and nuance, excluding Ryu and Hattie who are very important to the show. So, I\'m assuming you\'ve already seen Neon Genesis Evangelion. Argento Soma is a Post Eva military drama/sci-fi/revenge story that follows the same trends that many other mecha shows followed between the late 90\'s to the early 2000\'s. Since Eva had such a major impact (Lol) on the anime landscape at the time, many mecha shows wanted to go into a more abstract and esoteric direction or just have a similar structure to Eva. I bring this up now because remember the midsection of Eva where it was a ""What Angel are we fighting against this week"" show? Y\'know, a monster of the week. So imagine that, but for 15+ episodes! Argento Soma becomes so formulaic after Ryu joins Funeral, it was by far the worst part of Argento Soma. The show withholds plot relevant details from you, but sprinkles bits and pieces of clues throughout the show that are somewhat vague. Mr. X knows a lot more than what he lets on and is usually the one to give clues to Ryu, occasionally. The show just follows a set procedure for a very long time and it was not interesting in the least. The only thing remotely interesting that\'s going on is that Ryu is trying to kill Frank the entire time. Which is where the ""revenge"" factor comes from. I like that part of Ryu\'s character. He wants to avenge Maki and he feels that he can\'t move on without doing so. Funeral discovers Frank with Hattie and uses Frank to fight against the alien threat. They then name him the ""X-1.""  Ryu is so bitter and angsty during this time, but I don\'t blame the guy. The experience would\'ve been better if the soundtrack started playing Hoobastank or Shinedown whenever he showed up on screen. Fucking hilarious.During the final stretch of episodes the show becomes more plot-centric. Big reveals start to happen at this point, which I didn\'t care too much about. There\'s a dark secret about the alien threat and the mechs that the characters have been piloting that is rather similar to Eva. I won\'t spoil what that secret is, but it surprising and unsurprising at the same time. A few twists near the end that did catch me off guard. *Pssssssst* There\'s a traitor within the group. And a timeskip ending and epilouge that I thought was pretty good, but by that point I wanted it to end so badly. That midsection was terrible and difficult to sit through. This show is also very slow and plotting. It could\'ve done so much more with it\'s runtime, but it mostly just wastes it.Now for the technical aspects of Argento Soma, the production value is okay. Just okay. It\'s passable. Argento Soma is a Sunrise anime made in the year 2000. Looking through their catalog they\'ve made better looking shows even around this time period. Inuyasha was made by the same studio and it was released the same year and that show looks leagues better than this. Even Escaflowne came out four years prior and that show is gorgeous! Also made by Sunrise. Escaflowne made my eyeballs cum while this show was just average looking the entire way through. Art design and animation are all fine. The entire production is nothing remarkable, but I do like the character designs. To compensate for the lackluster visuals and animation, the characters designs, mech designs, and the alien designs are pretty detailed and distinctive, in my opinion. Despite the aliens looking the exact same way which kills the oppurtunity to have some variety. Eva, at the very least, gives all of the Angels unique forms throughout the show. I was hoping Argento Soma would do the same, but nope. And finally the soundtrack. It\'s surprising good. The only song I do not appreciate is the ED ""Horizon."" I think sounds very obnoxious and doesn\'t match the tone of the show at all. It\'s a very upbeat and brassy song and it feels very misplaced. Argento Soma overall is pretty slow, dark, ominous, and contemplative. Horizon is the last song I want to hear at the end of each episode. Easy skip for me. Everything else is pretty solid. It\'s nothing special but I enjoyed the OP, Silent Wind. Most of the score for this anime is very French and R&B inspired. It\'s all killer no filler kinda sorta!!!These are most of thoughts and opinions on Argento Soma and I don\'t feel like talking about it anymore. Despite the relatively low score for MAL, a hearty healthy 6.77, this show has a very devoted cult following. I don\'t entirely get it. I think these people are seeing something that isn\'t really there or they\'re desperately trying to convince themselves that the show is a true work of art. 6 out of 10. It really isn\'t as bad as I\'m making it out to be. It\'s far from amazing, but it\'s better than Raxephon and MUCH easier to watch. So yeah, I\'m tired. Bye bye.

All in all, a waste of time.I have seen a lot of reviews calling Argento Soma a hidden gem. It\'s not.For 14 episodes, I sat here and stared at a screen blankly. The neutral colors, lackluster fight scenes, angsty and whiny characters, and bland story makes for a bad time. The only reason I stuck around for so long was because of the positive reviews on this site. I can tell by episode 14 that things are starting to pick up, however, I have...lost any hope of my future experience being worth the 5+ hours I\'ve already committed to the show.The main characters; Takuto Kaneshiro and Harriet Bartholomew, both know a solid 2 words between the two of them. I wouldn\'t be surprised if half of Takuto and Harriet\'s lines were ""Maki!"" and ""Mr. Fairy"" respectively. When those are the type of main characters you are working with, you start to worry for everyone else (and rightfully so).Plot-wise, I have seen a lot of people compare Argento Soma to EVA. As someone who hasn\'t watched it, I cannot either confirm or deny this. However if anything I\'ve heard about Shinji is true, Takuto (or Ryu, or Lt. Soma, etc) is definitely the same character type. Whether that is good or bad, that\'s what you can expect. In my own opinion, he makes for a shitty MC with his wishy-washy ploy for revenge.I will admit, though, that the concept of a alien with cognitive thinking was a very interesting one. Although, Argento Soma misses the mark on this greatly. It would\'ve been interesting to see more of an attempt between communicating with the alien instead of having the little girl constantly thrown into battle. Although it is obvious that the girl suffers from PTSD from a past I won\'t get into, her constant crying in each and every episode gets tiresome real quickly.It doesn\'t help that a large bulk of the anime is spent running around in circles. Harriet hates the sounds of guns, gets tossed into battle, has the desire to run away and the alien helps her escape. Takuto hates the alien and hopes to kill it, uses the alien\'s escape as an excuse to engage in a fight with it, chickens out, and goes home. I can\'t say with 100% certainty that all the episodes are like that, but I can guarantee the first 14 are.There is honestly so little character development for the side (or any character in general) characters, it is disheartening. I could spend all day writing about the flaws on this show, but I don\'t want to dedicate anymore of my time to it.All in all, Argento Soma is a waste of time as a viewer.

I love the concept, and I love the finale. But...man the majority of the show was hard to get through. Nothing was terrible or frustrating, it was just largely repetitive. I wanted to drop it at several times. But I persevered and I eneded up really liking the finale both as a story, and suddenly the characters clicked. Suddenly i was attached and I wanted an S2 with these characters i was suddenly fond of. Hell, it raised it back up to a 6 and while I\'m currently riding the high I debated a 7. (Meanwhile the majority...of the story was at a 5 and I fell asleep several nights watching it)Argento Soma isn\'t bad as a story, as a character piece, or as an ""Eva clone"" whatever that title entails. (I fully believe you can take inspiration from NGE and create masterpieces....or garbage...) But man, the fights needed more variation, and the characters needed more depth earlier. I loved the finale arc fights and the character interactions were great. But I shouldn\'t have had to wait to the finale to get that from them.

more than 12 episodes, and as soon as the plot thickens and the lore starts unraveling, You realize this anime is just pretentious and full of plot holes, When you finish ep.24 and wonder ""the story got concluded, why is an episode still left?"" you will soon know that ep.25 might bring your score of this anime even more down, because it\'s just like...a ""post-canon/future"" fan-fiction that is out of character.pros at the beginning bc everything else is a rant:great art that i enjoyed.i liked the Alien design, even if it\'s the same for pretty much all the aliens.the character design was refreshing, not too eye straining but not boring either.it had some mecha body-horror instances.-spoiler and nitpick section starts here-Sooner or later, You\'ll realize the characters\' backstories aren\'t fully explained or don\'t make sense or are just plain stupid.-Takt thinks Frank ""killed"" Maki, realizes it was just an accident after going vengeance mode for 23 eps when it was so obvious from the start.he takes on the new Ryu identity in exchange of giving mr.X info about Funeral, but for some reason felt like he was used when he learnt that mr.X was using that info.when everything got concluded he still was emo -dk why- and insisted on being Ryu even when it was established that he felt betrayed being given this identity.also in the timeskip he goes to jail -dk why2- but he gets out and goes to tha spaace as Ryu in a sacrifice mission along with Harriet and the Captain, these people learned nothing.listen, i love emo vengeant anime boys but he shocks me every time with how dumb he is.-Harriet lives with her grandfather in the woods who has many artworks of creatures that look like aliens, calling them fairies, she has a pendant that resembles the fairies/Frank, but that\'s it, her grandpa dies and there\'s no explanation to how or why or what those fairies are and how he knew about them, and the focus on her pendant stops, in later episodes there\'s some imagery of ingraved alien-like drawings in an implied ancient walls, no elaboration on that.Funeral\'s doctor found alien parts or whatever in Harriet\'s brain left from the first attack and theorized that\'s the reason she can communicate with Frank, there\'s no elaboration on this as Frank was able to communicate with everyone in the end, and the reason he and Harriet got along was because she was nice to him when she first met him, just that.after the timeskip she\'s 19 years old (only living 14 of them awake since her coma), but already got a ""doctorate"" and was able to go to tha spaace and was very thrilled to meet Ryu once more (who was a jerk to her as a kid and didnt really redeem himself to her yet)-Yuri is an astronaut who lives with his beloved wife, but has to go to tha spaace so often they argued about that before he left for his final trip, in which the gvmnt or something ordered them to change routes and he said yeaa we should risk it for tha humanity and science, he got lost and started seeing fairies while thinking about his wife -which i would argue the man was hallucinating- aaand his mind manifested yellow overpowered aliens going to earth to return home to his wife but the Frank manifestation was more sentient somehow.he discovers his wife had died in the first alien attack, because none of his mind manifestations would save her but he would save Harriet over and over as Frank.he vanished but a weird thing appeared in space after the timeskip and everyone was like ""yup that\'s him"", why would he return over and over if he knows his wife had died and his home is no more?-Mr.X.. i want to nitpick about his whole character and motivation but it\'s so confusing to me, are you a villain who will use people to spy on Funeral and leak the info or are you against tha eviil millitary.-The Millitary/gvmnt, no one knows what they exactly want or why they hid the pilgrimage point and were so weird about aliens going there, they could just evacuate that

""bad"" sounds reasonable, i\'ve seen much worse that i hate so much i wouldn\'t even rate it, but this had the potential and it was disappointing. a ""post-canon/future"" fan-fiction that is out of character.pros at the beginning bc everything else is a rant:great art that i enjoyed.i liked the Alien design, even if it\'s the same for pretty much all the aliens.the character design was refreshing, not too eye straining but not boring either.it had some mecha body-horror instances.-spoiler and nitpick section starts here-Sooner or later, You\'ll realize the characters\' backstories aren\'t fully explained or don\'t make sense or are just plain stupid.-Takt thinks Frank ""killed"" Maki, realizes it was just an accident after going vengeance mode for 23 eps when it was so obvious from the start.he takes on the new Ryu identity in exchange of giving mr.X info about Funeral, but for some reason felt like he was used when he learnt that mr.X was using that info.when everything got concluded he still was emo -dk why- and insisted on being Ryu even when it was established that he felt betrayed being given this identity.also in the timeskip he goes to jail -dk why2- but he gets out and goes to tha spaace as Ryu in a sacrifice mission along with Harriet and the Captain, these people learned nothing.listen, i love emo vengeant anime boys but he shocks me every time with how dumb he is.-Harriet lives with her grandfather in the woods who has many artworks of creatures that look like aliens, calling them fairies, she has a pendant that resembles the fairies/Frank, but that\'s it, her grandpa dies and there\'s no explanation to how or why or what those fairies are and how he knew about them, and the focus on her pendant stops, in later episodes there\'s some imagery of ingraved alien-like drawings in an implied ancient walls, no elaboration on that.Funeral\'s doctor found alien parts or whatever in Harriet\'s brain left from the first attack and theorized that\'s the reason she can communicate with Frank, there\'s no elaboration on this as Frank was able to communicate with everyone in the end, and the reason he and Harriet got along was because she was nice to him when she first met him, just that.after the timeskip she\'s 19 years old (only living 14 of them awake since her coma), but already got a ""doctorate"" and was able to go to tha spaace and was very thrilled to meet Ryu once more (who was a jerk to her as a kid and didnt really redeem himself to her yet)-Yuri is an astronaut who lives with his beloved wife, but has to go to tha spaace so often they argued about that before he left for his final trip, in which the gvmnt or something ordered them to change routes and he said yeaa we should risk it for tha humanity and science, he got lost and started seeing fairies while thinking about his wife -which i would argue the man was hallucinating- aaand his mind manifested yellow overpowered aliens going to earth to return home to his wife but the Frank manifestation was more sentient somehow.he discovers his wife had died in the first alien attack, because none of his mind manifestations would save her but he would save Harriet over and over as Frank.he vanished but a weird thing appeared in space after the timeskip and everyone was like ""yup that\'s him"", why would he return over and over if he knows his wife had died and his home is no more?-Mr.X.. i want to nitpick about his whole character and motivation but it\'s so confusing to me, are you a villain who will use people to spy on Funeral and leak the info or are you against tha eviil millitary.-The Millitary/gvmnt, no one knows what they exactly want or why they hid the pilgrimage point and were so weird about aliens going there, they could just evacuate that small village.why did they pressure Takt into admitting that the accident on the lab was the professor\'s fault, and why were they so weird about the whole thing?-Guinevere and Dan both had pasts that the anime dipped its toes into and never mentioned again,Guinevere kept mentioning how she cant die yet, and revealed she was also sent by mr.X, the reason was not mentioned and they showed her grave after the timeskip, not explaining anything.in one episode Guinevere kissed Ryu, mentioned how that kiss was great some eps later, both instances where pretty forced scenes that had no weight on the characters.there was some implication that there was some conspiracy behind the incident where Dan\'s coworkers died, not to be mentioned again.Dan went betrayal and spy mode near the ending just to backpedal and help Funeral again after F\'ing them up.Dan and Sue married after the timeskip and named their daughter after Guinevere, which was pretty forced like that whole episode was, and like every love interest who isn\'t maki in the anime.4\\10 because i don\'t know..

Babylon,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37525/Babylon,"['Review contains some spoilers:This is going to be a short review/rant about Babylon.I remember when the first 3 episodes came out everyone was impressed since this show had amazing cinematography and direction, a dark and thrilling atmosphere and the story was executed seemingly very well. It continued to be quite good until the 7th episode, then it had a long break and everything went to shit.Babylon would have been great if if was just a political thriller with mystery elements. But the suicide law going worldwide and the law in general ruined the show. It is just very unrealistic that people would react to this...law in such a way (similar laws already exist), the politicians are portrayed very poorly and every decision made in the 2nd half of the show just makes no sense. The discussion that occured in the summit was portrayed as ""deep"" although it really wasn\'t, politicians should leave philosophy for actual famous and talented philosophers. Magase is obviously the actual danger, that can bring doom to humanity, but she became just a subplot for most of the 2nd half.The main aspect of this show - the suicide law just fails as a plot point, since it really doesn\'t matter because Magase Ai can just persuade literally anyone to kill themselves.All in all, at the start this show seemed quite profound and well-executed, but really it was pretentious, extremely unrealistic and absurd. My and many people\'s expectations were shattered by this show, but I\'d still recommend watching the first 7 episodes. One or two eps were pretty exceptional, therefore I\'m giving Babylon the rating of 3/10 - overall it\'s a really bad show, but has a few remarkable moments. law in such a way (similar laws already exist), the politicians are portrayed very poorly and every decision made in the 2nd half of the show just makes no sense.

Every facet of the show is oozing with a thick sense of seriousness and often boils\xa0down...to a lot of very grave talk amongst crotchety middle-aged politicians and civil servants trying to solve real crime, all of which is presented without a lick of fun or funniness. It’s exciting simply because it operates on the very generous assumption you, the viewer, are mature and worldly enough to recognize the implications of what’s happening in the story are really serious in a hyper-realistic fashion, and the fact the world is established such that that sense of realism is actually believable, the events play out like urgent breaking news as opposed to the writings of an inherently fictitious narrative. Where Babylon becomes something of a masterwork, though, is in its functionality as a mystery. Like any good political thriller, Babylon is rife with juicy machinations behind the scenes and moving parts to obfuscate them, but unlike most so-called mystery box narratives which string you along offering nothing but minuscule and minute information only at times convenient for the writers—which you could’ve very well gotten at any moment—until it’s all over and the contents of the box turn out to be ultimately unsatisfying, Babylon continually gives you specific and totally gratifying answers to questions you have, thusly reassuring you of the show’s ability to deliver on its promises, and packaged within those answers lie details of an even large mystery to come to light, so—at the same time—you’re fulfilled momentarily whilst continually intrigued with what the hell else is going on. And while Babylon opens itself with the heavy task of untangling this mess of clues and conclusions, the reason the situation is so complicated is every player is operating of their own accord, so whilst the narrative is never dizzyingly convoluted, it is very complex, even though it soon reveals itself to be one of the shows which has you slowly realize less of it is actually a conspiracy than you may’ve first thought.Babylon takes place in the city of Shiniki, the self-proclaimed testing ground for nations, a special administrative zone just north of Tokyo who's mission statement is to decentralize the Japanese economic center away from the overburdened Tokyo metroplex while also instating a new city with little regulation where laws are both easy to pass and easy to terminate, hence the tagline. Our main character, Seizaki Zen, is a public prosecutor who finds himself investigating a string of apparently related incidents of political sex trafficking being used to influence elections in the city, and it doesn’t take long for him and the viewer to come to the cold realization these cases are merely the tip of the iceberg of a thoroughly deep rooted scandal, which is to say—minor spoilers from here on—the police are in cahoots with the corrupt politicians. As Seizaki is lured into the conspirators' camp by the fact they’re work rigging elections is actually—no matter how rigorously illegal their actions are—for the greater good of stabilizing Shiniki’s still shaky political sphere and finally giving the city an identity of its own as the aforementioned legal envelope pusher, the puppet candidate they’re working to instate in office suddenly cuts ties with his fellow conspirators the second he’s elected and announces—unbeknownst to them and in complete and utter surprise to all their plans—his first new law to define the courageous new world which this city was always meant to be: the Suicide Law, the right to kill yourself. And what follows is the single most cinematically genius use of mass media spectacle I’ve seen in any anime ever. The already blood pumping, philosophically stimulating narrative of Babylon proceeds by stacking plot twists in such a way you’re constantly shocked, with every episode having some element which radically changes your perception of the events so far, all while the scale of said narrative keeps widening and widening, with every conversation adding some kind of information and the scripting continuously parceling out information in such a way which is integral to the storytelling’s engrossing identity, keeping us viewers absolutely intoxicated.Itsuki Kaika, the upstart mayor heading the Suicide Law, was chosen by the conspiring faction to be the puppet leader because of his young and refreshing image first and foremost, but also because he personally brought in the women they used to influence policy with sex and set their entire initiative into motion in the first place. As the conspirators in the challenging political parties and police headquarters, now including Seizaki, have to deal with their rouge masterless puppet, Seizaki is let in on some of the secrets they’d been keeping from him from when he was in the dark, one of which being the sinister fact all the women they’d been trafficking—including one sugar baby he himself had interrogated when previously working the case—was actually one person, one person named Magase Ai. As the show continues on and the narrative undergoes paradigm shift after paradigm shift, it quickly becomes apparent Magase Ai is much more urgent a threat than Itsuki ever was and is also hinted to even have some enigmatic occult afflictions. And before you turn away thinking a supernatural twist would ruin a straight-faced and thickly realistic narrative, remember plot devices as genius as The Voice of the City from Texhnolyze or The Black Blob from Paranoia Agent and remind yourself magical realism can be instated smartly into serious and mature stories. I’ll stop spoiling things now hoping my hinting at this character is motivation enough to go watch the show yourself, because she is a case study on presence and easily among the most electric personalities ever put to animation and says some thematically profound things about the nature of femininity and the allure and logical extreme of sexual release. And speaking of animation, her character design is iconic, her theme is enchanting, and again, her presence is simply immense. With that said, while I’m at it, the show as a whole is quite something from a production standpoint itself. The aesthetics are not particularly appealing, and the animation isn’t consistently beautiful or anything, but if it was trying to look like a hyper-realistic human narrative taking place in the real world, it succeeded wholeheartedly. It boasts god tier music which was absolutely nail biting at times, and it staffed talented character animators like Kouki Fujimoto who delivered on the most thrilling breaking points of the story with all due flair and terror. And all this isn’t even going into the excellent and outright laudably ambitious directing fit with more memorable imagery and exquisitely shot visual metaphors than you could ever ask for. Honestly, any way you slice it, Babylon is something of a modern masterpiece.… … …In Spring of 2017, an original anime by the name of Seikaisuru Kado went to air. It was a modest little thing, at least on production, made by Toei Animation, the premiere home for long running Saturday Morning Cartoon shlock and pandering game adaptations. My crude and irrelevant derision aside, though, Seikaisuru Kado not only looks and feels nothing like a project out of Toei, but it also looks and feels quite like nothing I’ve ever seen before for many reasons. Be it the quasi-CG character animation production, the irreplaceably unique concepts to accompany an alien invasion, or the hundred-ton dialogue scripting swamped in international relations of all things, Seikaisuru Kado was certainly a diamond in the rough, even if a thoroughly, thoroughly, thoroughly unpolished one. While it fashioned far more comedic relief and character emotions than necessary for a work of its apparent type—unlike Babylon wherein the characters are mature adults who are taking the story very seriously at all times—Seikaisuru Kado was first and foremost a fairly smart, talkative narrative of political intrigue. To avoid alienating what little of you are still reading by further narrating a show you’re not here to learn about, I’ll sum up the experience by saying it was brilliant…for six episodes…then it was annoying for the following two…and then it was a corpse by the end of episode nine. It was intelligently structured and adherent to reality even amongst all its inane sci-fi concepts, and it kept building itself until by even halfway though I was ready to tout it as a downright intellectual giant. However, it soon began devolving under the surface, and sooner later snapped like a twig in the most bracing twist of quality in anime history. A more-than-average mature show about the advancement of humanity and international geopolitical negotiations behind such progress was put to death by the draw of a giant energy sworn swinging the story into a downwards spiral of over-the-top mindless action, aliens VS humans battle to the death, fucking daughter from the future, batshit anime insanity, and the entire merit of the work up until that point was squandered instantaneously. And its author…wrote Babylon.At first, Babylon’s only real weakness was in the fact it attracts losers like myself. When you reach the stage of consumerism wherein your priorities become tone-deaf and your intentions become incorrigibly cynical, media—no matter how innocent in its attempts to entertain you—will find themselves endlessly, hopelessly, relentlessly attacked by your unconscious will to break something down, as you’ve conditioned your mind to be little more than a machine for critique which can only even begin to allow yourself an inch of entertainment from media which is totally infallible on every level, as you now know what it means to be so. And Babylon is not totally infallible. Babylon, much like Seikaisuru Kado, even before that heinous death blow the series dealt to itself which I just described, suffers from authorial projecting. That’s a nothing piece of terminology I just made up on the spot, but I mean it to imply exactly what it sounds like. Nozaki Mado, the creator of both works, quite frankly seems to fancy himself more of a preacher than a writer. His works so far have been bursting at the seems with unforgivingly unsubtle theming to the point of characters sitting down and spelling them out to the audience just to make sure his oh-so-precious point got across in the specific way he wanted it to. Honestly, as paradoxical as it sounds given the (periodic) maturity of his works, Nozaki seems to me to be thoroughly childish. Whereas the episodes wherein they do so and the degree to which they do so differ per show, both works reach a point around halfway through where the show takes all its ambivalent ideation and starts facing the audience directly and asserting these inherently subjective questions actually have objectively correct answers, because morals and God and shit. The works reach another turning point later on, though, towards the end, where the show completely shatters itself, and while, no, there is no giant energy sword in Babylon, the series does get to a point by the penultimate episode where anyone thinking at all critically simply has to put it down. That’s right. This masterpiece died young.How anime which seem to so thoroughly understand the ways of the world lead themselves on with such delusions as evolutionary providence in Seikaisuru Kado and now a moral death in Babylon, I honestly will never know. I don’t get it, and now that we’re two for two with this guy, I frankly don’t even want to. Nozaki isn’t a writer the likes of Tow Ubukata, who hides the interworking of his concepts with an ostentatiously stylized exterior only to eventually expose their emptiness after its clear nothing is being said, nor is he like Shou Aikawa, who presents transparently style-over-substance codifications on behalf of potential themes which also end up being ultimately meaningless all the same. He presents concepts which do, indeed, payoff, and he continues to do so expertly, only for the process to devolve somewhere along the line and have the ideas stop churning out intellectual content and begin churning out holier than thou horse shit attempting to convince you of pretentiously figured objective answers to subjective moral questions. It’s like the latter ends of his works are written by an entirely different person with an entirely different set of priorities and personal values. On its way down from a thematically enormous wonder of a political thriller to a boilerplate pseudo-psychological character study, Babylon doesn’t break any one character, nor does it defile the established ideas, and it only really disrupts the tangible plot in the final episode and, I suppose, the cliffhanger leading into it. It only wastes itself in a general sense, so unlike Seikaisuru Kado who’s devolution wholly invalidates all merit it had accumulated up until the point the energy blade came out, Babylon is actually worth watching in a sense. In fact, you could probably just watch the first seven episodes as a complete story like all the brilliant bastards who dropped Death Note after episode twenty five. But do so knowing it continues. Know the following three and a half episodes slam on the breaks and attempt to convince you of the strict, objectivist take on the previously ambivalent, thought-provoking seven episode gem you just saw. And know, as well, the following episode and a half remaining after that turn out a finale which you’d never guess, not even in your wildest dreams, could ever have been derivative of the expert craft with which you began your viewing.Thank you for reading. to a lot of very grave talk amongst crotchety middle-aged politicians and civil servants trying to solve real crime, all of which is presented without a lick of fun or funniness.

Unfortunately, this is one of those. Babylon offers one of the most interesting examinations of the classic philosophical debate of Good vs Evil I have ever seen. While on paper, it’s easy for us to say what’s right and what’s wrong, in reality, it’s often much more difficult. Life is more often in shades of grey than black and white. Babylon does a really good job of making you question everything you thought you...knew in terms of morality. Unfortunately, the show's premise goes by the wayside in one of the worst endings I have ever seen in anything.The show deals with a recently passed legislation in a newly built city adjacent to Tokyo which legalises suicide. Unfortunately, not all of the people choosing to take advantage of this new law are doing so under their own will.

That’s because it’s taking itself seriously, in a way that is not pretentious or quirky.  Two common traits that are recycled time and time again in psychological/thriller based anime.One of the key themes in Babylon is the dichotomy between what is ‘right’ and what is ‘wrong.’  This concept is fleshed out in episode 2, when Seizaki is interrogating Ai Magase, and he agrees to answer her questions in exchange for her confession.  Seizaki — a good intentioned, self-sacrificing prosecutor — discovers that his ‘firm’ beliefs, are quite...fragile upon Ai’s philosophical probings.  It’s a crucial reminder to the viewer that ingrained social norms (i.e. Seizaki’s core beliefs, as he upholds the laws/ideals of a ‘good’ society) are not essential in any regard.  Sure.  They help to create a safe environment in which the majority can prosper, but we must also recognize the flaws of such systems, and how they disenfranchise certain individuals.Thus, we have the introduction of the Shiniki initiative, which hopes to ameliorate the defects of the current political system.  Shockingly, though, we find out that Kaika, the new mayor of Shiniki, embraces the idea of death, and with his first declaration, permits the citizens to kill themselves.  Now, the resulting mass suicide where the group of people leap off the roof to their deaths, was a bit heavy handed to emphasize the ‘craziness’ of such a law; however, the concept is intriguing, nonetheless.That being said, if Babylon elects to demonize Ai and Kaika for their ‘flawed’ reasoning, then much — if not all — of the appeal will evaporate.  Morality is not black-and-white, nor should we expect it to be in a fictional work.  Therefore, if Babylon can continue to challenge the resolve of Seizaki (by flipping his ideals on their head), then Babylon will be a huge success.As a side note, the plot of Babylon is intricate, with numerous moving ‘parts.’  While it may seem daunting to keep track of all the plot threads, it gives the viewer the experience of being a member of the investigation, and the frustration that Seizaki is experiencing as he plods along.  Also, the promotional poster for Babylon is a nice piece of symbolic imagery, that gives insights on future events.  All in all, a nice start in what I hope will be a memorable series. fragile upon Ai’s philosophical probings.

That\'s impressive considering the fact it\'s competing against Ishuzoku Reviewers! Babylon is odd because it\'s tonally all over the place. An adult discussion about the ethics of suicide and euthanasia becomes a poorly written, Shonen cat and mouse game between Japanese Batman and an evil psychic who uses mind control powers to kill people. Did I mention her mind control powers work by being so incredibly sexy? Trust me, it\'s as dumb as it sounds.The story begins with Japanese prosecutor named Zen, investigating wrongdoing by a pharmaceutical giant. This leads to him discovering a murder...and eventually this leads him to a shady politician named Itsuki. It turns out that Itsuki is bribing and killing politicians and other powerful figures in an elaborate scheme to create a new libertarian district of Tokyo. This will be a place where suicide is not only allowed, but often encouraged. To kick off the ceremony, he gets his psychic minion to kill 50 people by forcing them to jump off a building. The anime tries to write Itsuki as a well intentioned extremist. His motive is ultimately to donate his heart to his ailing son. Apparently, Japan currently has a law that suicide victims can\'t donate their organs. If that\'s his MO, why not just use his psychic minion to get a law through the Diet that says suicide victims CAN donate organs? Why create a new district, kill all these people, and go through all this shit? Well, it\'s so we can have a show!Sadly, Itsuki doesn\'t get the bulk of the screen time. The main antagonist is the psychotic psychic, Ai Magase. Ai is basically the poor man\'s version of Legato Bluesummers from Trigun. She works the main villain and devotes her entire existence to make a pure, incorruptible soul suffer. She wishes to defeat Zen\'s idealism and force him to kill. Sadly, Ai never has Legato\'s intimidating presence. She\'s extremely over the top and her powers work in such a STUPID way. We have to believe that she\'s so sexy that it breaks people\'s minds. However, the show can\'t possibly draw her that sexy, so we\'re just left scratching our heads. Really? She\'s supposed to be THAT sexy? I\'d give her a 6 being generous.This is a series that wants to be adult and wants to be smart, but often it ends up just getting silly. When Zen chases Magase to America, we get to meet the greatest President ever! Alexander Wood was once the top ranked Diablo 2 player in the United States and an internet celebrity. After helping another player get good, she asked him out on a real life date and it turns out she was a super model! This gave Wood the confidence and popularity to become the President. We have a real estate mogul turned game show host as the President and that\'s still WAY more believable than this shit! Wood exists in the series to ask moral questions from a religious perspective. Wood is a devout Christian and doesn\'t know if suicide is wrong because the Bible doesn\'t explicitly forbid it. However, the writer of Babylon decided to make Wood a devout Catholic. The Catholic Church has clearly forbidden suicide for over 1,000 years! It makes little sense that Wood would struggle so much with this problem. Then again, this is the series where we\'re told Mark Twain was born in Connecticut and was a moral relativist who didn\'t believe in good or evil.It seems like every time Babylon tries to be smart, it makes a blatantly wrong statement that the writer could have double checked on Wikipedia!The art and animation by the brand new Studio Revoroot is quite good. It\'s a shame that Babylon\'s story doesn\'t hold up after the first 5-6 episodes. The music is done by the same guy that did the Vinland Saga OST. A lot of talent was involved in the making of Babylon. Unfortunately, I feel it mostly goes to waste.If I could sum up Babylon with one word, it would be ""disappointment"". This looked like it would be a mature, intelligent anime that would ask difficult moral questions and challenge the way viewers see the world. Instead, it\'s a rather mediocre experience and far too messy for me to personally recommend. and eventually this leads him to a shady politician named Itsuki.

Instead, it\'s a rather mediocre experience and far too messy for me to personally recommend.', '*Prologue*Approaching this show is a difficult task. This isn’t because the show tackles harsh subject matter involving the likes of suicide as one of its fundamental talking points. It’s not because the show isn’t exactly good at doing so, either. It’s because I’m still coming to terms with what an absolute shitshow this series has become. There’s this immense swirl of emotions that come about from watching a show crumble before your very eyes, keenly aware that there were signs of trouble from the beginning. Babylon showed promise of being a fascinating police procedural with some of the most noteworthy directing of 2019...or at least...that was the case for the first 7 episodes. Unfortunately, the last arc happened. Not only was I unable to accept any of the more idiotic decisions the show had been making as its presentation became blander and more obtuse, but the finale is one of the most devastating trainwrecks of recent years, invalidating almost everything the show had built up to that point.*Part 1: The Rise*Back when the show was about Zen Seizaki and his colleagues being wrapped up in a murder turned mass suicide mystery, the show had some of the best pacing of any recent seasonal. Its ability to generate tremendous cliffhangers was borderline unrivaled, even in the same year that Beastars and Promised Neverland came out. It never spent too much time dawdling on what the audience already knew or on presenting a character’s entire backstory since finding how the cause of a murder and eventually putting a stop to two people related to a string of suicides was at the forefront. Some of the characters that Zen interacted with, such as the morbidly nonchalant Shinobu Kujin and Zen’s first subordinate, Atsuhiko Fumino. Their banter often added a sense of levity to the tense first two arcs, and they’re involved in some of the more shocking scenes of the show.The music was done by composer Yukata Yamada, the composer for the music of Vinland Saga. He creates several moody piano melodies that add to the show’s sense of gravitas. On top of that, there are some more electronic tracks that morph in ways that accentuate some of the show’s craziest moments and cliffhangers. The track “A Given” which plays during several key moments, is the perfect example of this. Unfortunately, as good as the soundtrack is, it often feels overplayed. Vinland Saga suffered a similar problem with its piano tracks, where the same few tracks are used in almost every episode. Regardless, there are several quality pieces here. The show’s 3 EDs are also fine songs in their own right, particularly 1 and 3. The first song “Live or Let Die” by Q-MHz feat. uloco, is a more chaotic piece while the last ED, adds a sense of finality to an arc that otherwise has none.As for the visuals, this is Studio REVOROOT’s first full-length project and their second solo outing. The production values are rickety, with awkward CG environments and people scattered all over the place, and very few sequences that have much in the way of good animation. The show often feels jank, and the rough art style with white outlines does not help matters. Despite all of this, director Kiyotaka Suzuki was able to finally let loose after the horrible Psycho-Pass 2 and the decent yet already forgotten FLCL Alternative. The camera angles are often dynamic, there’s the usage of sepia tones and several interesting techniques. Episodes 2 and 7, in particular, have some of the most fascinatingly presented scenes of 2019. The former accentuates the sense of dread and confusion the former is meant to evoke, while the latter further conveys the sense of sheer agony that the main character feels in the final scene of episode 7. It’s a 5-minute torture sequence where the main character, Zen Siezeki, is forced to watch someone get cut to pieces as his ideology crumbles to the helplessly crumbles to the ground after everything he has been through. This is where the show peaks and you should stop, before the direction largely begins falling flat, and the show takes a tremendous nosedive.*Part 2: The Fall***spoilers beyond this point**Where do I begin? Just know that I\'m not even gonna go over everything that was particularly off about the show\'s writing.The first sign of trouble came at the end of the first arc, when it turned out that the new mayor of Shiniki had proposed a suicide law, making it do that you can commit die of your own free will without penalty since apparently that\'s actually illegal. He insisted this by having dozens of people gleefully jump off a building. Needless to say, this required a bit of suspension of disbelief.It turns out that this was made possible by Ai Magase whispering in their ears. There are several, several problems with Ai and her powers in general.A. She has offscreen shapeshifting powers. This isn\'t like with Fujiko Mine and other femme fatales that put on disguises. With those, they generally wear feasible wigs and can be identified by their face if you know what they normally look like. With Ai, despite having long hair, she can easily pull off all hair sizes, and her face can become unrecognizable with how different it is. It\'s as if between disguises which sometimes get deployed within mere minutes of one another, Ai goes through plastic surgery. It goes beyond having convincing disguises and into the realm of having supernatural abilities.B. Mere moments before ending his own life, Shinobu tells our main protagonist that Ai can convince someone to uncontrollably want to kill themselves. Even the most steadfast and iron-willed individuals have a hard time resisting, so whatever she says, you do. It\'s how she was able to get out of interrogation in episode 2, and how all of those people in episode 3 ended up jumping off. As of the finale, it turns out that her saying...anything is grounds for suicide, rather than her seductively whispering a suggestion for you to kill yourself.What\'s wrong with this picture? In this seemingly grounded police procedural with no confirmed supernatural elements, it seems a bit asinine for her to be able to pull this off with just her voice. What\'s stupider is that she doesn\'t even need to even specify that you have to die. In the finale, she whispers the phrase ""good job"" into the earpiece President Alexander Wood had on with his translators after speaking to a Japanese girl who was considering taking her own life. This was enough to get him to attempt suicide. Ridiculous, isn\'t it? Even more ridiculous than the idea that her whispering can trigger suicidal urges while her talking does nothing. Sure, whispering can be more seductive, but this is absurd. On top of that, there\'s a contradiction in the previous sentence. How come the horde of building jumpers in episode 3 kept themselves together and jumped off only on someone else\'s cue rather than their own accord while everyone else was unable to control their urges? This isn\'t the biggest issue, but it is still another knock against her whisper powers from a writing perspectiveC. Episode 5. In middle school, she was somehow able to walk and talk in such a way that every male she encountered found themselves feeling so unbearably lustful that they genuinely felt raped. Even in the 7 episode grace period, I had a hard time swallowing this pill. Walking seductively is admittedly a thing but this is just tasteless and asinine. Luckily the idea of rape never comes up again, but this was definitely where I started to realize that maybe Babylon might be full of shit sometimes.D. Ai herself is a rather disappointing character. She’s flash without the fire. She’ll get inside Zen’s head with borderline inane monologues about good and evil, but thanks to the director going ham during those sequences, they’re some of the most entertaining in the show. They obfuscate how dumb and insubstantial her dialogue is, like when in episode 7, she is trying to make Zen think about what evil really is (despite him doing so but I guess his answers don’t align with hers, which we’ll get to) all hile butchering one of his subordinates right in front of him.  All she amounts to is just a person who loves being evil and wants to spread an asinine notion of good and evil around. One of her interactions with Zen reveals that in spite of and because of the villainous acts she is knowingly doing, she believes she’s some hero spreading an important message, doing a service to humanity so they’ll understand what good and evil really are. It would have been interesting if part of Ai’s motivation was for people to be able to understand her, and what it must have felt like to feel almost alien to everyone around her as everyone always thinks of her as a twisted, enigmatic female figure. That sure went nowhere despite the show delving into how she received therapies that ended up being worthless to her and how she finds this plight to get people to understand her version of good and evil to be a just cause.The other major antagonist, Itsuki, isn’t that great either. While he does get an interesting debate in episodes 6 and 7 where he reveals that he wants to die so his kid can have his heart during a necessary heart transplant surgery that may happen in the future, afterwards he has almost no presence in the show. Nothing regarding his suicide law even gets resolved by the end. Speaking of characters that get shafted in the final arc, the last 5 episodes had the potential to really show how bad Zen’s mental state is after every single one of his colleagues in his field got killed. While episode 8 has him hallucinating here and there, that’s the last time the show does anything particularly captivating. Afterwards, he states his desire vengeance, gets aggy at a recording of her voice, and then fades into the background until the finale. Everyone else who survived the first two arcs gets thrown to the wayside as well, including Zen’s family that have death flags all around them despite nothing happening to them.Before we get...there, one character relevant to the finale has to be mentioned, as no one else is that interesting or important enough to bring up. Alexander Wood gets introduced via a scene where he monologues his life story to the audience, about how he got a girlfriend, how he became god tier at this MMORPG, how he now has a wealthy family and a kid that’s healthier than he could ever be, and everything. Not only is that a terrible way to introduce a character, but it becomes the first sign that the wonderful pacing of the show would go downhill. Then you learn he’s also the president. I’ll let that one sit on the part of your brain that’s forced to process it. He thinks a lot and is a decent guy. That’s really all there is to him.*Part 3: THE ENDING*You ever think of a worst case scenario for how a promising show you\'re not entirely sure about will play out, and then wish you got that instead of whatever the fuck you just saw? That\'s Babylon\'s finale. It might be one of the worst endings I have ever seen.Throughout the entirety of the show, there have been two main ideological conflicts at play: the nature of good and evil, and the ethics/logistics of suicide/the suicide law. Episodes 6 had an engaging debate where several government heads oppose the suicide law through the socio-economic, moral/ethical, the extreme scenario and accusations, and and “people naturally avoid death” perspectives. While they may have felt surface level due to them getting one minute to make one point, it was at least able to offer up several perspectives that would logically be used to approach controversial laws.Episode 11 has world leaders make strawman viewpoints about how “people gain their sense of morality through us leaders so we much teach them that suicide is wrong” while completely forgetting that most people still consider suicide wrong and that no one gets their sense of morality through world, country, or state leaders. The other viewpoints expressed are no better and just result in mindless bickering before President Wood decides that we need to examine the nature of good and evil in order to determine a unanimous position on the suicide law. What follows is the most tiresome deliberation I have ever heard, as everyone just spins their wheels examining the two most common and basic moral quandaries without actually pressing the issue further than the most surface-level ideas barely getting much exploration. My logistics class went further into moral dilemmas and that is a class where we learn about jobs, warehouse jobs, and forklift-driving. This is the epitome of the show’s incessant wheel-spinning on its topics, as even before this point it has already become a cyclical game of “what is good, what is bad, what is justice?” getting shallow, simplistic exploration despite the show constantly acknowledging how complex these issues are.That whole idea means nothing anyway and is an excuse to wax about concepts the show barely has a grasp on before Pres Alex Wood is called to convince a girl not to jump off a building. Itsuki, who initiated the summit, sets this up. In the last episode, Alex gets a translator and gets to work. The day is saved until it turns out that after this, all of the translators (since apparently there is more than one despite there being only one volunteer) are dead and Ai Magase, who is disguised as someone that was not in the building and was never shown prior, whispers “good job” in good ol Woody’s ear. After this, we never hear about Itsuki or the suicide law ever again. During the convo, SudoWOODo finally comes up with the answers to what good and bad are.Good = continueBad = endLet’s talk about how mind-shatteringly stupid this is. If continuing is inherently a good thing, does it remain that way when applied to the act of continuing to murder innocent people? What about continuing to bully people? What about continuing to swindle people, kill animals for the hell of it, gamble all your money away, suffer, etc? Can continuing be used in a positive context in those situations? No. Is continue just the show’s silly and obnoxious way of saying life? No, but that’s the only context being applied to the term in the show. You can apply it positively to say, continuing to prosper, continuing to help people, etc. but the show isn’t smart enough to do so. The idea of ending being a bad thing is just as stupid. Should “end world hunger, end your addiction, end someone’s torture, end the show on a high note, end your career with one great game, etc.” be used negatively? No. Is “end” the show’s shorthand for “end your life”? Probably. Can you apply end in a negative light with ideas such as “end someone’s life, end someone’s career, end your relationship (that one can be positive or negative), etc.”? Yes, but the show doesn’t think of that because it’s too busy thinking it has all the answers to a broad concept.This, ladies and gentlemen, is what Ai Magasee, that fucking idiot, wanted to spread to the world. This is what Zen ends up answering with once he and the president figure it out after a standoff where Zen has to shoot Wood in order to prevent him from committing suicide. As laughable as that sequence is, the idea that he has to stop Wood from killing himself after the man had just talked a girl out of ending her own life on international television, is the smartest thing the finale could come up with. After this, it is implied that through this last standoff, despite Zen pointing a gun at Ai and her just pointing a finger gun gesture at him, he dies and she gets to walk off and meet his kids. That is how the show ends, with the most anticlimactic and nonsensical ambiguous ending I have ever seen.Also, in episode 11, Morning Wood decides that perhaps the key to answering the suicide law debate and the fundamental nature of good and evil is to decipher the meaning of life. This never gets brought up again. The suicide law gets no resolution as we never find out what the decision was regarding the law or anything about what would happen to it either. Itsuki and his new country, Shiniki, just disappear halfway into the finale. Ai does not even get challenged by Zen despite him pointing a gun at her after everything she had done to him and to hundreds of people. The three main conceits of the show, all rendered moot in the span of 10 minutes. None of this meant a damn thing, and all it would amount to is negative answers and Zen potentially being dead without feeling like his rivalry with Magase ever really came to a head. The entire show was just one big waste of time. You could honestly just stop at the first scene of episode 8 and act like Ai drove Zen irreparably insane while she wreaks havoc on the world. It’s about as conclusive as what we actually got, and a lot less stupid to boot.There is one last thing to mention before we wrap things up. There’s an easy fix to the suicide law debacle, one that is based on what Itsuki wished would happen. The answer is simply to treat it on a case by case basis, making sure to educate people on the ramifications their actions would have on their families and those around them before they decide to off themselves. The more knowledgeable they are of the severe effects taking your own life would have, the less likely they are of committing suicide and the more open and knowledgeable they would be regarding the subject. Not once is this idea brought up in the final arc of the show by any of the world leaders, when at least one politician in the second arc weaponizes this idea.*Epilogue*To all the people hesitant about this show and its writer after the hellfire that was Kado’s finale: you were right to steer clear. Truly this is a case where the ending will overshadow the show as a whole after eliminating any goodwill many had with the show’s first 7 episodes. Honestly, the cover is the most clever and thought-provoking aspect of this pretentious mess, and the “p-word” is a condemnation I don’t use lightly. Spare yourself the disappointment, aggravation, and sense of betrayal. There are a lot of silly moments and twists I did not even go over, and as I was writing this review, it became genuinely difficult to remember the more positive aspects of the show’s writing. The more I think about it, the worse the show gets. For something meant to be more intellectual, filled with more gravitas than your average anime, this is perhaps the most succinctly damning thing I can say about it. Let this be a lesson that if an anime looks like it can go either way, it\'s probably going south. that was the case for the first 7 episodes. Unfortunately, the last arc happened. Not only was I unable to accept any of the more idiotic decisions the show had been making as its presentation became blander and more obtuse, but the finale is one of the most devastating trainwrecks of recent years, invalidating almost everything the show had built up to that point.*Part 1: The Rise*Back when the show was about Zen Seizaki and his colleagues being wrapped up in a murder turned mass suicide mystery, the show had some of the best pacing of any recent seasonal.

The track “A Given” which plays during several key moments, is the perfect example of this. Unfortunately, as good as the soundtrack is, it often feels overplayed. Vinland Saga suffered a similar problem with its piano tracks, where the same few tracks are used in almost every episode. Regardless, there are several quality pieces here. The show’s 3 EDs are also fine songs in their own right, particularly 1 and 3. The first song “Live or Let Die” by Q-MHz feat. uloco, is a more chaotic piece while the last ED, adds a sense of finality to an arc that otherwise has none.As for the visuals, this is Studio REVOROOT’s first full-length project and their second solo outing. The production values are rickety, with awkward CG environments and people scattered all over the place, and very few sequences that have much in the way of good animation. The show often feels jank, and the rough art style with white outlines does not help matters. Despite all of this, director Kiyotaka Suzuki was able to finally let loose after the horrible Psycho-Pass 2 and the decent yet already forgotten FLCL Alternative. The camera angles are often dynamic, there’s the usage of sepia tones and several interesting techniques. Episodes 2 and 7, in particular, have some of the most fascinatingly presented scenes of 2019. The former accentuates the sense of dread and confusion the former is meant to evoke, while the latter further conveys the sense of sheer agony that the main character feels in the final scene of episode 7. It’s a 5-minute torture sequence where the main character, Zen Siezeki, is forced to watch someone get cut to pieces as his ideology crumbles to the helplessly crumbles to the ground after everything he has been through. This is where the show peaks and you should stop, before the direction largely begins falling flat, and the show takes a tremendous nosedive.*Part 2: The Fall***spoilers beyond this point**Where do I begin? Just know that I\'m not even gonna go over everything that was particularly off about the show\'s writing.The first sign of trouble came at the end of the first arc, when it turned out that the new mayor of Shiniki had proposed a suicide law, making it do that you can commit die of your own free will without penalty since apparently that\'s actually illegal. He insisted this by having dozens of people gleefully jump off a building. Needless to say, this required a bit of suspension of disbelief.It turns out that this was made possible by Ai Magase whispering in their ears. There are several, several problems with Ai and her powers in general.A. She has offscreen shapeshifting powers. This isn\'t like with Fujiko Mine and other femme fatales that put on disguises. With those, they generally wear feasible wigs and can be identified by their face if you know what they normally look like. With Ai, despite having long hair, she can easily pull off all hair sizes, and her face can become unrecognizable with how different it is. It\'s as if between disguises which sometimes get deployed within mere minutes of one another, Ai goes through plastic surgery. It goes beyond having convincing disguises and into the realm of having supernatural abilities.B. Mere moments before ending his own life, Shinobu tells our main protagonist that Ai can convince someone to uncontrollably want to kill themselves. Even the most steadfast and iron-willed individuals have a hard time resisting, so whatever she says, you do. It\'s how she was able to get out of interrogation in episode 2, and how all of those people in episode 3 ended up jumping off. As of the finale, it turns out that her saying...anything is grounds for suicide, rather than her seductively whispering a suggestion for you to kill yourself.What\'s wrong with this picture? In this seemingly grounded police procedural with no confirmed supernatural elements, it seems a bit asinine for her to be able to pull this off with just her voice. What\'s stupider is that she doesn\'t even need to even specify that you have to die. In the finale, she whispers the phrase ""good job"" into the earpiece President Alexander Wood had on with his translators after speaking to a Japanese girl who was considering taking her own life. This was enough to get him to attempt suicide. Ridiculous, isn\'t it? Even more ridiculous than the idea that her whispering can trigger suicidal urges while her talking does nothing. Sure, whispering can be more seductive, but this is absurd. On top of that, there\'s a contradiction in the previous sentence. How come the horde of building jumpers in episode 3 kept themselves together and jumped off only on someone else\'s cue rather than their own accord while everyone else was unable to control their urges? This isn\'t the biggest issue, but it is still another knock against her whisper powers from a writing perspectiveC. Episode 5. In middle school, she was somehow able to walk and talk in such a way that every male she encountered found themselves feeling so unbearably lustful that they genuinely felt raped. Even in the 7 episode grace period, I had a hard time swallowing this pill. Walking seductively is admittedly a thing but this is just tasteless and asinine. Luckily the idea of rape never comes up again, but this was definitely where I started to realize that maybe Babylon might be full of shit sometimes.D. Ai herself is a rather disappointing character. She’s flash without the fire. She’ll get inside Zen’s head with borderline inane monologues about good and evil, but thanks to the director going ham during those sequences, they’re some of the most entertaining in the show. They obfuscate how dumb and insubstantial her dialogue is, like when in episode 7, she is trying to make Zen think about what evil really is (despite him doing so but I guess his answers don’t align with hers, which we’ll get to) all hile butchering one of his subordinates right in front of him.  All she amounts to is just a person who loves being evil and wants to spread an asinine notion of good and evil around. One of her interactions with Zen reveals that in spite of and because of the villainous acts she is knowingly doing, she believes she’s some hero spreading an important message, doing a service to humanity so they’ll understand what good and evil really are. It would have been interesting if part of Ai’s motivation was for people to be able to understand her, and what it must have felt like to feel almost alien to everyone around her as everyone always thinks of her as a twisted, enigmatic female figure. That sure went nowhere despite the show delving into how she received therapies that ended up being worthless to her and how she finds this plight to get people to understand her version of good and evil to be a just cause.The other major antagonist, Itsuki, isn’t that great either. While he does get an interesting debate in episodes 6 and 7 where he reveals that he wants to die so his kid can have his heart during a necessary heart transplant surgery that may happen in the future, afterwards he has almost no presence in the show. Nothing regarding his suicide law even gets resolved by the end. Speaking of characters that get shafted in the final arc, the last 5 episodes had the potential to really show how bad Zen’s mental state is after every single one of his colleagues in his field got killed. While episode 8 has him hallucinating here and there, that’s the last time the show does anything particularly captivating. Afterwards, he states his desire vengeance, gets aggy at a recording of her voice, and then fades into the background until the finale. Everyone else who survived the first two arcs gets thrown to the wayside as well, including Zen’s family that have death flags all around them despite nothing happening to them.Before we get...there, one character relevant to the finale has to be mentioned, as no one else is that interesting or important enough to bring up. Alexander Wood gets introduced via a scene where he monologues his life story to the audience, about how he got a girlfriend, how he became god tier at this MMORPG, how he now has a wealthy family and a kid that’s healthier than he could ever be, and everything. Not only is that a terrible way to introduce a character, but it becomes the first sign that the wonderful pacing of the show would go downhill. Then you learn he’s also the president. I’ll let that one sit on the part of your brain that’s forced to process it. He thinks a lot and is a decent guy. That’s really all there is to him.*Part 3: THE ENDING*You ever think of a worst case scenario for how a promising show you\'re not entirely sure about will play out, and then wish you got that instead of whatever the fuck you just saw? That\'s Babylon\'s finale. It might be one of the worst endings I have ever seen.Throughout the entirety of the show, there have been two main ideological conflicts at play: the nature of good and evil, and the ethics/logistics of suicide/the suicide law. Episodes 6 had an engaging debate where several government heads oppose the suicide law through the socio-economic, moral/ethical, the extreme scenario and accusations, and and “people naturally avoid death” perspectives. While they may have felt surface level due to them getting one minute to make one point, it was at least able to offer up several perspectives that would logically be used to approach controversial laws.Episode 11 has world leaders make strawman viewpoints about how “people gain their sense of morality through us leaders so we much teach them that suicide is wrong” while completely forgetting that most people still consider suicide wrong and that no one gets their sense of morality through world, country, or state leaders. The other viewpoints expressed are no better and just result in mindless bickering before President Wood decides that we need to examine the nature of good and evil in order to determine a unanimous position on the suicide law. What follows is the most tiresome deliberation I have ever heard, as everyone just spins their wheels examining the two most common and basic moral quandaries without actually pressing the issue further than the most surface-level ideas barely getting much exploration. My logistics class went further into moral dilemmas and that is a class where we learn about jobs, warehouse jobs, and forklift-driving. This is the epitome of the show’s incessant wheel-spinning on its topics, as even before this point it has already become a cyclical game of “what is good, what is bad, what is justice?” getting shallow, simplistic exploration despite the show constantly acknowledging how complex these issues are.That whole idea means nothing anyway and is an excuse to wax about concepts the show barely has a grasp on before Pres Alex Wood is called to convince a girl not to jump off a building. Itsuki, who initiated the summit, sets this up. In the last episode, Alex gets a translator and gets to work. The day is saved until it turns out that after this, all of the translators (since apparently there is more than one despite there being only one volunteer) are dead and Ai Magase, who is disguised as someone that was not in the building and was never shown prior, whispers “good job” in good ol Woody’s ear. After this, we never hear about Itsuki or the suicide law ever again. During the convo, SudoWOODo finally comes up with the answers to what good and bad are.Good = continueBad = endLet’s talk about how mind-shatteringly stupid this is. If continuing is inherently a good thing, does it remain that way when applied to the act of continuing to murder innocent people? What about continuing to bully people? What about continuing to swindle people, kill animals for the hell of it, gamble all your money away, suffer, etc? Can continuing be used in a positive context in those situations? No. Is continue just the show’s silly and obnoxious way of saying life? No, but that’s the only context being applied to the term in the show. You can apply it positively to say, continuing to prosper, continuing to help people, etc. but the show isn’t smart enough to do so. The idea of ending being a bad thing is just as stupid. Should “end world hunger, end your addiction, end someone’s torture, end the show on a high note, end your career with one great game, etc.” be used negatively? No. Is “end” the show’s shorthand for “end your life”? Probably. Can you apply end in a negative light with ideas such as “end someone’s life, end someone’s career, end your relationship (that one can be positive or negative), etc.”? Yes, but the show doesn’t think of that because it’s too busy thinking it has all the answers to a broad concept.This, ladies and gentlemen, is what Ai Magasee, that fucking idiot, wanted to spread to the world. This is what Zen ends up answering with once he and the president figure it out after a standoff where Zen has to shoot Wood in order to prevent him from committing suicide. As laughable as that sequence is, the idea that he has to stop Wood from killing himself after the man had just talked a girl out of ending her own life on international television, is the smartest thing the finale could come up with. After this, it is implied that through this last standoff, despite Zen pointing a gun at Ai and her just pointing a finger gun gesture at him, he dies and she gets to walk off and meet his kids. That is how the show ends, with the most anticlimactic and nonsensical ambiguous ending I have ever seen.Also, in episode 11, Morning Wood decides that perhaps the key to answering the suicide law debate and the fundamental nature of good and evil is to decipher the meaning of life. This never gets brought up again. The suicide law gets no resolution as we never find out what the decision was regarding the law or anything about what would happen to it either. Itsuki and his new country, Shiniki, just disappear halfway into the finale. Ai does not even get challenged by Zen despite him pointing a gun at her after everything she had done to him and to hundreds of people. The three main conceits of the show, all rendered moot in the span of 10 minutes. None of this meant a damn thing, and all it would amount to is negative answers and Zen potentially being dead without feeling like his rivalry with Magase ever really came to a head. The entire show was just one big waste of time. You could honestly just stop at the first scene of episode 8 and act like Ai drove Zen irreparably insane while she wreaks havoc on the world. It’s about as conclusive as what we actually got, and a lot less stupid to boot.There is one last thing to mention before we wrap things up. There’s an easy fix to the suicide law debacle, one that is based on what Itsuki wished would happen. The answer is simply to treat it on a case by case basis, making sure to educate people on the ramifications their actions would have on their families and those around them before they decide to off themselves. The more knowledgeable they are of the severe effects taking your own life would have, the less likely they are of committing suicide and the more open and knowledgeable they would be regarding the subject. Not once is this idea brought up in the final arc of the show by any of the world leaders, when at least one politician in the second arc weaponizes this idea.*Epilogue*To all the people hesitant about this show and its writer after the hellfire that was Kado’s finale: you were right to steer clear. Truly this is a case where the ending will overshadow the show as a whole after eliminating any goodwill many had with the show’s first 7 episodes. Honestly, the cover is the most clever and thought-provoking aspect of this pretentious mess, and the “p-word” is a condemnation I don’t use lightly. Spare yourself the disappointment, aggravation, and sense of betrayal. There are a lot of silly moments and twists I did not even go over, and as I was writing this review, it became genuinely difficult to remember the more positive aspects of the show’s writing. The more I think about it, the worse the show gets. For something meant to be more intellectual, filled with more gravitas than your average anime, this is perhaps the most succinctly damning thing I can say about it. Let this be a lesson that if an anime looks like it can go either way, it\'s probably going south.', 'After just finishing Babylon I am honestly at a lost for words, this show is actually amazing and still love it after it\'s ending. It leaves you with many questions which are open to different interpretations depending on how you look at things. That is generally what a good mystery does, granted the first half was more intense and the second half went into a different approach focusing on another character but It was still as good.After thinking about the series for a bit I can\'t really find and complaints I had, it was interesting, raised themes which left me thinking and hearing the...other character talking about it left me wondering to myself what I think about it.

One: He goes to jail, Two: He dies (Either from Magase finally getting to him so he commits suicide or someone else shoots him), Three: This is not very realistic but the presidents agents who he was with during talking to the girl on TV helped Zen knowing some of the situation and he was able to go free under certain circumstances.Obviously after the credits we see that nothing happened to Magase maybe Zen didn\'t shoot her because he didn\'t want to fall to evil and stick with his ideas of good, but either way she is still free in this world to end more people. I really like this ending cause usually it\'s the good guys winning but this time we have the villain win and in a very insane way. The ending leaves you in awe, with many questions, dumbfounded, and also disappointed if you didn\'t like the ending.---End of spoilers---Now overall I love this series, I think it has amazing themes, interesting and a wide range of characters, and for me an amazing ending I will be thinking about for awhile. other character talking about it left me wondering to myself what I think about it.

Also, this is just some thoughts 5 episodes in.Why I think it is sub par at best (includes heavy BIAS and SPOILER of course):-Commercialsed TV ViolenceBorrowed the term from David Lynch, meaning the effects of violence in this TV show is completely shallow, just a means to an end. Let me elaborate, there are 60+ normal people and 1 very close colleague to MC died,...but they left almost no impact to the other characters.The 1 very close colleague's death gets covered up as quickly as ice melts in a hot summer day and the MC barely thinks about him afterwards (and move on with his new hot female colleague). Also, 64 people suicide at once as a political message. Not only MC and his team never shows any strong emotion towards that, it barely has any impact on the public as well. The effects of their death are quickly skipped over and only serve as a plot device.-VillainHere is where this show is getting weird and immature, the main villain is a lady who is good at manipulating people and can AROUSE men just by men seeing her and make them feel so guilty they want to kill themselves. This is just so dumb, are we in a superhero show all of a sudden? People can just starting to have supernatural abilities now? That aside, the part of the show that is supposed to show her manipulation skill is when MC interrogates her, but that scene is more about MC is terrible at his job than anything else. He just keep feeding her information and excuses at every opportunity he can and allowing her to derail the conversation as she like.Other thoughtsThe art and sound are both alright. The reason why I would follow this show for a bit longer is that I want to see if this show is going a different direction than it currently is.

A very interesting premise, gradually becoming a disaster of story telling and destroy everything it stood for.Please read my view on the show and it\'s structure:It is not as clever as you think it is. It\'s really not. It just gives if the illusion that it\'s a good show. Nothing more.The only character which undergoes an character change is the main character, but it shatters all it\'s development... For what? For a catastrophic anticlimactic ending.To give the positives, the morality it...explores is really unique. Something which is not explored in traditional shows. But it overcomplicates itself, thus concluding nothing of substance.It\'s not above having bad ends. There are plenty of shows which features a person\'s loss of sanity in a much more better manner. Like Death Note, Psycho Pass etc. But the difference in this is Babylon didn\'t even give closure to most basic stuff. What happened to Major decisions? Like the suicide law? The summit? Leaving everything to viewer\'s interpretation is poor writing.That being said, Babylon is not a totally bad show. It doesn\'t bring anything to the table. It hides it\'s mediocrity by creating an illusion of moral debate, which ultimately comes to nothing.You will wonder what was the point of it all, but sadly there is none.

This is just my opinion.', ""Babylon is yet the latest in a series of blunders courtesy of the seinen demographic that in many ways sum up exactly why the majority of people shun it in favor of its younger brother in the shonen demographic. It's not that I personally think seinen can't be fantastic; plenty of series have done a marvelous job living up to what the demographic, well, implies and providing interesting characters, a level of maturity not normally found in their younger contemporaries and fantastic storylines. After all, one only needs to look at the likes of Berserk, Vinland Saga, Boogiepop and Others as well as Ghost in...the Shell to know that there are many fantastic titles to find.What Babylon is, however, is a travesty of the highest order, thoroughly incapable of telling any sort of coherent narrative and being thoroughly unsatisfying to watch. On paper, a story covering euthanasia, nihilism and morality sounds like a fantastic narrative that should intrigue even the most uninterested viewers. In practice, however, what is found here is complete and utter drivel.Babylon is essentially a story about a man who's lost several acquaintances to suicide, but the suicide were in some shape or form them being convinced by a lady that life is meaningless and they should off themselves. It'd take an exceptional amount of careful writing to make this work, but thankfully, Babylon proceeds to butcher it through how exactly it treats the subjects it's discussing like a complete joke.Scenes where characters literally jump off rooftops in complete synchronicity. Debates about why people should commit suicide in public. Strawmen being committed ad nauseum about how religions don't condone suicide and how if you're not religious there's no point to life. Entire discussions by various politicians about how euthanasia works which ironically ignore the little misstep where in several countries where it's legalized if you're healthy should visit several mental health clinics and provide evidence of that, and it's not as simple as just going there and killing yourself.This kind of bad writing plagues the entire show from start to finish, and it's clear that the writer has no idea how police works, no idea how the euthanasia debate works and an extremely shallow understanding of contemporary nihilism. And the worst part is, it makes entire segments of the show where characters proceed to end their lives - which you'd expect to be a gutwrenching or painful moment to watch - instead be a complete joke and unintentionally comedic instead.The dialogue is also noteworthy in how dry, bland and soulless it is. There's no personality to the dialogue, merely poorly researched strawman fallacies everywhere when there are discussions, and the characters' personalities never shine through the dialogue either. You could swap characters and have them speak entirely different conversations under this script and yet I promise you wouldn't notice a thing, because the series isn't interested in making its cast shine or the dialogue matter except to infodump about the poorly written setting.The plot is a complete and utter laughable mess as a result of all this, and making things even worse is how uneven the pacing is. And while uneven pacing isn't necessarily something that'd doom the show, there's nothing worse than a show that feels like it's going too fast and too slowly at the same time, and this becomes especially noteworthy when the soulless excuse for a cast get involved.I genuinely have nothing to say about the cast, they can literally be defined in one liners and minus the main villain, none of them had any strength of screen presence or personality worth remembering. They don't drive the plot forward, they exist in service of it; countless times are characters introduced, speak a few lines and then killed either later in the episode or the next episode, as if the audience's sympathy will be won over by just watching some random mook get slaughtered. And the worst thing is that this caused a massive disconnect between me, who didn't care about these dull, soulless one note characters, and the main character who clearly did.A particular mention needs to go for the main villain of this show for being hilariously ridiculous every time she showed up on screen, asking about whether the main character had sex or what his kinks were and always constantly messing with all the characters on screen. She was the sole character that stood out in a sea of dull, boring, empty robots and I'm genuinely glad she was there. Special mention goes for her actions in the last episode and the epilogue to the show, which actually made me lose it laughing my head off.On a technical level, the show is competent; while not much animation or movement exists in the show, special mention needs to go to the direction of the show, which consistently looked good and made a fair few otherwise dull scenes more tolerable. That being said, the direction also made the show hilariously bad at times due to how completely over the top the portrayal of the main villain was, which I'll admit I appreciate and made me look forward to at least seeing her on screen.I never thought the sound design was particularly bad, and while nothing was memorable from the soundtrack I never thought anything was unfitting. It's clear there were some talented staff members behind this project and it's a real shame that this is what they were relegated to work on.The core problem with this show is that by the time I finished, I had no idea what the point of the show was. Many people would proudly mention that this show was this sophisticated commentary on euthanasia and suicide, but truthfully I never felt it was competent in what it was tackling, only that it was mildly entertaining when it starts and slowly but surely fizzled out, like a pretentious old man whose advice no one is interested in hearing because everyone knows it's false. And this, ultimately, makes this show just a complete waste of everyone's time.At best, the show is unintentionally comedic with bland, soulless characters who I never cared for. At worst, this show is a painful slog that I only finished because it was airing and for no other reason other than to see what some people were overhyping all over the internet. And like many a forgotten, boring seinen, it too will be remembered only for having all the same flaws that most other entries in the demographic do, and for similarly having its fanbase in the first few episodes exhibit everything wrong with the kind of people who rally behind these kinds of shows.Your time is better spent watching something else, be it watching a properly done crime thriller, reading some book about euthanasia or nihilism, or doing anything else you find enjoyable. It certainly isn't well spent on this show, and I recommend that if you haven't seen it, to not waste your time doing so.And yes, while I can make this review longer and flesh out my points more, I don't consider this show worth putting in that much effort, because if the writers didn't care about putting any level of effort into what they've done here, why should I? the Shell to know that there are many fantastic titles to find.What Babylon is, however, is a travesty of the highest order, thoroughly incapable of telling any sort of coherent narrative and being thoroughly unsatisfying to watch.

And the worst thing is that this caused a massive disconnect between me, who didn't care about these dull, soulless one note characters, and the main character who clearly did.A particular mention needs to go for the main villain of this show for being hilariously ridiculous every time she showed up on screen, asking about whether the main character had sex or what his kinks were and always constantly messing with all the characters on screen. She was the sole character that stood out in a sea of dull, boring, empty robots and I'm genuinely glad she was there. Special mention goes for her actions in the last episode and the epilogue to the show, which actually made me lose it laughing my head off.On a technical level, the show is competent; while not much animation or movement exists in the show, special mention needs to go to the direction of the show, which consistently looked good and made a fair few otherwise dull scenes more tolerable. That being said, the direction also made the show hilariously bad at times due to how completely over the top the portrayal of the main villain was, which I'll admit I appreciate and made me look forward to at least seeing her on screen.I never thought the sound design was particularly bad, and while nothing was memorable from the soundtrack I never thought anything was unfitting. It's clear there were some talented staff members behind this project and it's a real shame that this is what they were relegated to work on.The core problem with this show is that by the time I finished, I had no idea what the point of the show was. Many people would proudly mention that this show was this sophisticated commentary on euthanasia and suicide, but truthfully I never felt it was competent in what it was tackling, only that it was mildly entertaining when it starts and slowly but surely fizzled out, like a pretentious old man whose advice no one is interested in hearing because everyone knows it's false. And this, ultimately, makes this show just a complete waste of everyone's time.At best, the show is unintentionally comedic with bland, soulless characters who I never cared for. At worst, this show is a painful slog that I only finished because it was airing and for no other reason other than to see what some people were overhyping all over the internet. And like many a forgotten, boring seinen, it too will be remembered only for having all the same flaws that most other entries in the demographic do, and for similarly having its fanbase in the first few episodes exhibit everything wrong with the kind of people who rally behind these kinds of shows.Your time is better spent watching something else, be it watching a properly done crime thriller, reading some book about euthanasia or nihilism, or doing anything else you find enjoyable. It certainly isn't well spent on this show, and I recommend that if you haven't seen it, to not waste your time doing so.And yes, while I can make this review longer and flesh out my points more, I don't consider this show worth putting in that much effort, because if the writers didn't care about putting any level of effort into what they've done here, why should I?"", ""This is my first time watching something new of this genre as it's been airing, and I'm so glad it's this.The characters and setting are really great, and the plot points just leave me wondering what else is going to happen. I honestly get the same vibes as I did while watching Death Note. Not that I'm saying it's the same. But the type of shows in general. I also get the same vibe as a recent movie, but won't mention it for spoiler reasons.  I'd say if you're into crime, drama, and mystery, then you should give this one a shot!The main character...I feel personally is a great character too. Which bodes well for the anime in general. Having a great lead to progress the story forward. With his strong sense of justice, and getting to the bottom of what is going on. A strong headed character that I do enjoy.So I'd say give it a watch! It's a great anime, and I cannot wait to see what else happens next through out the show itself.

Despite my experience in anime, western media, and in real life, I have almost thrown up several times so far.', ""Babylon is like a plane crash. It takes off well, flies in the air for a nice while, but in the  end it just couldn't stick the landing and it just flopped down in an explosion. What could go wrong for a show with such potential, lets find out.Story:Babylon is about a detective who is trying to catch a woman who can kill with her voice. That is it. Imagine Death Note flipped where the main focus is on L who is trying to catch Kira but we never get Kiras perspective. He is just a character who stays in the background. That is...exactly this show. And that might have been its downfall.The rest:Everything besides the storytelling is very good. The sound, art, and characters are all well done. If it was written better this could have been a great anime.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this show until episode 7 where it takes a narrative shift so immense that it wouldn't surprise me if it have been written by a different person. Then it becomes boring and dumb.Overall:I can't forget that 1/2 of it was really good, but that last 1/2 has me switching from a great show to an okay show. What happened to make it change so drastically?The Problems:1: Like I said before, this is a flipped Death Note. Change the perspective to only the main character Zen Seizaki (L) and don't focus on the villain Ai Magase (Kira). Ai can instead of using a death note can use her seductive voice to control people to kill themselves. Cool, right? However it is never explained. It is hinted that there might be drugs that she is using on her victims but that is completely forgotten about and instead suggested that she is like the snake of the garden of Eden (pure seductive evil). In a realistic show you can't just make up reasons for powers. Use the drug angle, or introduce her as the devil from the beginning of the show. Make her a main narrative character to give us some insight. But no, instead make it seem that she just has the power to turn on every possible gender so much that they get so aroused that they just need to kill themselves. That seems legit!? And why would she do it? Because she was born like that? That is terrible writing. They had her go to a shrink, they showed a little back story. That could have been used to see how she turned out like that from a psychological standpoint, but instead, she is the devil and she can apparently shape shift into whoever she wants. That is just lazy writing. Unlike Death Note where you might root for both characters, here there is no perspective from the antagonists, thus there is no reason to be invested in Ai besides for the mystery to be solved and her caught. But since neither happen, she wasn't used to her full potential.2: The narrative shifts from catching her to a political debate over if you can kill yourself. The show depicts this in such an unrealistic and dumb way that it is hard to put it to words. The concept and execution of the debate are just badly handled.I don't like talking about politics because no matter what you say you will cause a fight but I believe most people can agree that this show didn't do a good job depicting the debates between what is good and evil.3: The ending has no satisfying resolution. After the president and Zen confront each other in the last scene before the end credit scene with Ai enjoying the show from the sidelines, it is like they knew they messed up so they just quit trying. I am sure that the White House had plenty of time to find a way to save the president from the possible jump, but besides that, Zen could have shot his leg or arm to stop him from jumping but shoots his chest instead?! Why?! And how would the president not only not fall backwards, but fall forwards instead? If he only injured the president who only afterwards fell because of the shot then the result of suicide wouldn't have been considered because it was murder, and if he didn't fall, then he would have saved his life. There was absolutely no reason to go for the kill shot and he had everything to gain to go for a minor injury. After that, he could of killed Ai right away but he hesitates for no reason. The end is left up to interpretation but the way I see it, Mai not only gets off scott free (because escaping from the White House is as easy as sneaking into it apparently) but there is never any resolution for her character. She just continues her life. The president also didn't get any resolution because he was stopped by Ai before he could benefit from it. The only resolution is for Zen but it was poor because if he did kill himself at the end then not only did he not catch Ai, but he also failed in the narrative because the show was going for the angle of letting go of anger but it also goes nowhere.4: In the end, I didn't see a point in what the show was trying to say. First a mystery thriller which isn't even told in good detective fashion, then a political mess of suicide talks all without a solid piece of perspective from the angle of the antagonists. What were the creators trying to say with this anime? Don't do suicide? You don't need to make an anime about it, but if you do, direct it better than this show.Score: 8 (good and had some great elements but I wouldn't rewatch it). exactly this show.

The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality. And on her forehead was written...a name of mystery: “Babylon the great, mother of prostitutes and of earth’s abominations.” And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.”  (Revelation 17:3–6 ESV)Thriller anime\'s make it or break it point is how well it can balance the dynamic between the protagonist, the antagonist and the philosophical dilemma they both deal with to justify the decision they have made by the end. From the director that brought us, FLCL Alternative & Psycho Pass 2 (not one) comes a new thriller called Babylon where our major philosophical debate is whether people should be allowed to commit suicide, thus making it an universal law. The topic of suicide, assisted suicide, and the whole idea of the justice surrounding it is any philosophy 101\'s students\' wet dream. We think we know what is good and what is evil but as we slowly group and become poisoned by society\'s corruption we learn in order to continue living we must tread on a moral grey line. Although this show had a fine premise and a mystery element surrounding this core theme of suicide with a good protagonist and a very vibrant antagonist, by the end it expanded too much to quickly for it to become the next great Psycho Pass of a show. Fortunately, it did generate ton of controversy, and where there is  controversy, there is popularity. So let\'s discuss why this dark horse of a show had the potential but just like Icarus, it flew too close to the sun of philosophy and burned down to the ashes. Let the fun begin.With a clever title like Babylon, you immediately start thinking of two things, the great kingdom of Babylon or the whore of Babylon (if you know about the Biblical story). For those who don\'t know, the Whore of Babylon is the spirit of seductive culture, actively engaged in the deception and destruction of God’s people. Now without getting into the religious fundamentals, the story\'s central theme is basically justifying what is good and what is evil. Should people be allowed to commit suicide or is it a crime to in general. How do we judge what is good and how do we judge what is evil. Various philosophical issues come to play and this theme is portrayed through the conflict between Zen Seizaki (Prosecutor aka Batman) and Ai Magase (Whore of Babylon aka Joker). If you understand the reference of Batman & Joker dynamic akin to the Dark Knight movie, you\'ll understand better of how the plot is played out without spoiling too much. Essentially the issue arises in a small town of Shiniki, where this young Mayoral candidate Itsuki, proposes that suicide becomes legal. He explains his reasonings and he has Ai Magase carry out the ""suicides"" of the people in the city. For the first arc the show becomes this cat and mouse game of capturing Ai Magase and finding more about her before she ""kills off"" Zen\'s team via the method of suicide. It\'s brutal, thrilling and a nail biter to see who can out wit the other. They even introduced a drug early on, Nyux drug, that people can take to die in peace instead of the usual jumping off or cutting oneself or hanging method. In a nutshell, they were humanizing the process to be more ethical to today\'s standards. Sadly, in the second arc of the story, the suicide law went from a city policy to a universal policy, expanding to countries like Canada, France, Germany, Italy, UK to even USA. We get to see now political leaders of the country getting in on the debate. Oddly this also coincides with when the show went on a long hiatus before returning and it seemed people smoked too much because the whole tone of the show changed. It became too philosophical for its own good and less chaotic battle of wits where the characters were playing 4D chess to outwit one another. It definitely lost its charm and the show ended on an open ending for viewers to decide and talk about to learn more.With a philosophical show as such, it\'s not actions or ""plot"" that attracts the audience, it’s the characters that offer the charm, particularly the villain. In Ai Magase, we see a diluted villain akin to Shogo Makashima of the past. She has this mystical aura with the whole Whore of Babylon biblical allusion as well as the Nine Tails folklore in Japan. She has the power to verbally mindfuck someone to submission to the point of them wanting to commit suicide without actually physically murdering them. On the other hand we have Zen Seizaki, this super moral good guy to the level of Superman and as the show progress we see how he slowly loses his sanity to maintain his core fundamentals so he doesn\'t become the very evil person he puts behind in jail. This Batman vs Joker dynamic is the central conflict in this entire show. Now to foil these characters and flesh out the good vs evil character grid, we have side characters like Detective Kujin, Prosecutor Sekuro, Mayor Itsuki,  even the president of the US all the Americans hope to have, Alexander Wood, and many more. As the show progress, we see these characters give their output on where they stand on the issue and what we need to do as society. Once again, very open ended and lacking the mangaka\'s clear feeling towards this situation.Looking at the technical aspects, this is one of those shows that doesn\'t need Studio Ufotable level animation, nor does it Studio Bones level music to make the show pop. It\'s a thought provoking anime and key people were the seiyuus voicing the characters. The seiyuu of Ai Magase and Zen Seizaki does a phenomenal job conveying the raw emotions and the quirks they have plus more. The OST is alright, nothing too crazy and animation is passable. A few freeze panes here and there but they cleaned it up near the end. Not too shabby overall. The OP and ED songs or rather medleys are alright. Nothing too great. Nothing too memorable.Nevertheless, Babylon is an okay anime at the end of the day. It definitely had a great premise as a mystery thriller where we had to catch the ""Whore of Babylon"" before she corrupted God\'s people and led them to their deaths but it deviated in the second arc to this philosophy 101 bullshit about what is good, what is evil, what is justice and what it means to commit suicide. Not once did they just grow a pair and address the major issue of there is a cult leader, let\'s arrest the cult leader before they convert more to commit a mass murder. Nope, they were too good to do such a thing and as a result only our naïve boy, Seizaki suffers. It sort of mirrors the political climate of Japan in today\'s society where due to their naivety is currently suffering and in a population decline due to their ignorance of core issues early on when the problems were surfacing. So I guess kudos to the mangaka to mirror that. If the anime was stretched to a two cour anime, maybe it would\'ve been far better since people would actually have a proper debate and not one or two lines to debate a serious matter as such. Regardless, viewers who like anime like Psycho Pass or Monster or Parasyte, should give this anime a watch. It\'s not going to be as good as those anime but atleast it will tickle your philosophical bone for a few hours. I\'d never rewatch this anime and I hope there is an OVA to wrap up the loose ends.

Babylon provides a twisted, dark, yet philosophical story that easily sucks its watcher in deeper with each passing episode. I can't recall ever seeing an anime quite like this one.  The pacing for episodes 1-7 is flawless, but 8-12 can feel slow at times if you are only in it for suspense.  Personally, I didn't mind the slower episodes since I found the topics of discussion interesting.  The storyline's clarity (especially the ending)...was what I struggled most with, since at points it's was very vague.  Of course, I think it's highly possible that the level of uncertainty was intended by the writers, but it can leave viewers disappointed.

Good, a classic. Then it veers into political conspiracies, which is still a compatible side plot. However, it is then revealed that the villain\'s ominous plans are 100% supernatural,...which leads to a completely out-of-place gore scene that only serves the purpose of a cliffhanger through shock value. Nothing more than a marketing ploy. After that it shifts gears once more and focusses too much on a completely different character whose personality can be summed up as ""indecisiveness"", so his only function in the plot is wasting/stalling for time.Unless the production ran into problems (I heard that the original manga wasn\'t even finished when they started?) and had to change plans halfway through, I have to assume that the entire series was just designed to create a high stakes Trolley Problem. No other explanation makes sense: If Babylon\'s intent is to start a discussion about suicide, it fails miserably. Contrary to the show\'s depiction, suicide is already legal in almost every single country in the real world (after all, how do you prosecute someone who is dead?). And yet every character acts as if the legality was the only wafer-thin barrier that kept the whole world from killing themselves. It\'s weird that a show which pretends to be sooo intelligent wouldn\'t address this issue at all, and it\'s also weird that it never even touches on the topic of Japanese ritualistic suicide throughout the whole time it\'s struggling to present a discussion about whether suicide is good or bad. Spoiler alert, humanity is universally in agreement that suicide is an unpreferable choice. The related topics of euthanasia and organ donation do get mentioned and for a split second it seems like that might have been the ultimate goal. But nope, the show doesn\'t commit to these topics, so they remain inconsequential. All in all, the whole debate is 100% vacuous.I have big beef with Ai Magase, and that\'s not just because I hate how transparent the ASMR fetishism is (though I bet some people would argue that it\'s not fetishistic even if her MO was squishing people to death with her dirty bare feet).What is Ai Magase\'s goal? She tries to get the US president to commit suicide right after publicly admitting (half in jest) that he would kill himself if he came to the conclusion that it was a good idea, thus making everybody else in the world follow his example. But she already has the power to control anybody she speaks to, so she could\'ve gotten the same result if she had used Itsuki\'s broadcast to tell everybody to kill themselves. So this was just the method to create the circumstances in which Zen has to kill someone to prevent everybody from dying. The notion that anybody would kill themselves just because the president did it for no apparent reason is already absolutely ludicrous. But even if you disregard that nonsense, the plan hinges on too many random factors to work out this exact way. And for what? Just to fuck with Zen, LOLThat\'s why I\'d say, her raison d\'être is: ""What if Johann from Naoki Urasawa\'s \'Monster\' was Junji Ito\'s Tomie and Heath Ledger\'s Joker at the same time?""The show would make at least a little more sense if you replaced her involvement with an ideological cult and Itsuki as the main villain. But then again, you\'d miss out on Satsuki Yukino whispering ""Sssseizaki-ssssan"" into your thirsty earhole, and we can\'t have that.Final thoughts: The visuals are above average, and they spent notable effort into making foreign stuff look more authentic. It\'s a novel idea to depict the US president as a benevolent MMORPG gamer who has less charisma than Jeb Bush and still scored a hot 9ft supermodel wife, but it also completely shatters my suspension of disbelief.

The issue boils down to broken characters.Babylon starts out as a true crime show, then quickly turns into a pseudo-supernatural crime show that supposedly talks about the morals around suicide and whether or not we should allow it.That's if you're giving it the benefit of the doubt, what it actually is is a dumpster fire.Simply put, to make a fleshed out story, the good characters need to be part bad, and the bad characters need to be part good. Otherwise the characters next actions are always predictable, and the viewer can anticipate the entire story...after watching one episode. This show can't even do that right - it just has two dimensional characters that are only bad and only good - then proceeds to comment on it like it's talking about a profound idea to try and trick the audience into thinking it's talking about something deeper.Now after messing up the characters so badly, it's tough to make a great story, so instead it leans on a moral dilemma and straw-manning the audience into a lulled submission.What does the show do right? The animation and music behind it are both at least average, if not above average. This show is fully brought down by its story. after watching one episode.

But this anime approaches this theme very well.In ""Babylon"" , the time location  is in what I can say is a contemporan Japan ( so the contemporan world ) which is perfect for this theme. As for the location itself it\'s a made up one, so by herself it can\'t really give us more context about the actions ( Shiniki - that means the new city )The suicidal theme is approached in a legal way which makes it really interesting as suicide is...not legal ot illegal .

If you should watch the show; defending the show; criticizing the show.Should you watch the show? Pretty simple: Yes. This is the best psychological anime I\'ve seen since Psychopass. I think it\'s even good outside of the realm of just comparing it to anime, but it certainly does things in a way that only anime can.But, the show is graphic. It deals with a lot about suicide. If suicide upsets you in any way, do not watch the show. Otherwise, please go in blind.The rest of this review will contain minor spoilers, but...not in a describing the things that happened kind of way, however it\'s worth noting that even the premise of the show could be perceived as a spoiler to some degree. Unlike some other anime , it\'s not a genre bait and switch but an unraveling mystery that causes the spoilers.I\'ll start by addressing the current top review on this site. No, this show is not pro-suicide. I can see why someone would think that way, but the entire conflict is between characters who are attempting to stop the mainstreaming of suicide and antagonists who have nefarious plans. The very end of the show itself is the rejection of suicide as an option.There are some criticisms people have about the show ignoring the mental health component, and I think that\'s fair. I would counter that the mental health component may be overstated by some people, and that it is somewhat addressed. You have to remember that this is a Japanese show, and it addressed concerns in Japan and with a Japanese understanding. In Asia (and in the rest of the world too) the reason people commit suicide is not always mental health. Monks in Tibet light themselves on fire and burn to death to protest China. In \'ancient\' Japan, Samurai would kill themselves and engage in duels to the death purely for honor. In Japan there is the infamous ""Suicide Forest"". One aspect of how it got its name, is that the elderly people who were unable to care for themselves care for themselves and believed themselves to be a burden to their families would go there to die.Some would cite that last example as depression. I can agree that depression may play into a decision like that, however this is a topic that has been examined in western media as well. In Star Trek: TNG there is an episode called Half Life. It deals with a planet in which the culture of the society is that those over a certain age will kill themselves in a public ceremony, which is considered good and even virtuous. In the film Midsommar there is a cult where the elderly kill themselves, and this cult is not necessarily framed as entirely evil. I don\'t like Star Trek or Midsommar and how you feel about them isn\'t that important either. I\'m just saying that the concept of killing yourself due to being incapable of contributing to society and to stop old age is not some radical, new, Japanese fringe idea. Many people have experiences in which they state they would rather die than continue on with life, such as dementia.The anime does also bring up a number of other points in which someone might, without the aid of mental illness, kill themselves. One example I felt was pretty compelling was father donating his organs to his dying son. Is that really even his son? Is his son dying? You could argue we don\'t actually know but it\'s something of a mute point. The actual argument itself is very adequate regardless of the showmanship around it.Mental Health is brought up when they reference ""running away"". That is the mental health take on suicide, and I do believe that is the common societal view on it in the west as well. However, I don\'t think that suicide is ALWAYS a matter of running away. That is almost the definition of a controversial take, but we can look to countries in which assisted suicide is being discussed or implemented. There are conditions in which some do consider ending your suffering to be a reasonable conclusion to some issues.I also believe there is some element of satire to some of the anti suicide arguments that were brought up. Discussing the GDP of your nation and the effect of suicide on the economy may technically be a valid argument, however it\'s obviously as abhorrent to some people as the idea of being pro-suicide.In general the conversation skewed towards a very Japanese view on things. For example, giving your life for war isn\'t brought up because modern, current day Japan says war is bad. I think that you have to center your criticism a little bit when you\'re remembering this is a Japanese work aimed at Japanese people from a Japanese point of view. It doesn\'t mean you can\'t leverage criticism at it, but you should keep in mind why something is occurring in the first place.There\'s a more general criticism by people that the entire premise of the anime is stupid because you can\'t criminalize killing yourself. Well I\'m sorry to tell you, you\'re wrong if you believe that. In some countries suicide is literally illegal, and you can be punished if you live. Even putting that aside, some would say that locking people up and controlling their right to bodily autonomy is akin to a punishment as well, we just call it treatment or rehabilitation. And if you do believe that suicide is someone\'s right, then it is in fact a punishment. We also often call prisons and parole ""rehabilitation"". So for all intents and purpose to someone who wants to commit suicide, it is illegal. That\'s before you even get into the case of assisted suicide.  The Suicide Law in the anime is about more than just rather or not it\'s illegal however.It\'s about government support. Itsuki says it several times and he is very clear about it. He wants the government to create pills which facilitate a painless, clean suicide. He wants there to be facilities which assist people with their choice to end their lives. He wants a social acceptance of suicide, which will promote the ability for people to publicly discuss rather it\'s the right choice for them without fear of reprisal. Itsuki would like the entire institution and our thoughts on suicide to be changed.Once again, we\'ve entered a Japanese perspective that some westerners are not familiar with. In America at least, we have a very individualistic view towards things. We don\'t like to think about how the state, or law, or elders influence us. However, we do often look to the law as a sign of morality. Many people consider morality and obeying the law to either be the same thing or morally linked. People say things like ""I\'m not breaking any laws am I?"" Beyond that, people look to others for their cue on what is socially acceptable and how to behave. Japan is a society that values how you contribute to it and gel with it possibly more than how you feel as an individual. From a Japanese perspective, doing right by your family and society is more important than your individual thoughts. This is reflected in many anime in which the main character breaks free of those shackles and does whatever he wants. This is reflected in this anime by characters doing the exact opposite of the typical shounen protagonist.Sekuro is just one embodiment of this. She is like the main character. she does not want to be involved in an unlawful conspiracy that goes against her INDIVIDUAL sense of justice. In spite of this, she is pressured by society and her family relations to work for the main character. She does not want to do this but she must. It is both literally and metaphorically her job. The anime is full of people playing their roles, and doing what they believe is right by society in an attempt to find what is right for them. It is most thoroughly reflected in the young girl who commits suicide on the train tracks though. (To address another criticism, this is an actual kind of bridge that exists, not just crazy anime design).Gay rights are brought up a lot in this anime as an example and a counter example. I do not think this is a dig at LGBT people. If you listen to the arguments made for and against suicide in the anime, several of them are arguments previously applied to gay rights. IN AMERICA no less. ""If you legalize or decriminalize homosexuality, then everyone will be free to do it and people will think it\'s okay."" Crazy!  ""You might even encourage children to do it on accident,"" ""Children will be confused,"" ""If children see their idols doing it they will want to imitate it,"" ""It\'s not our place to decide what people do with their bodies,"" ""Times change"".I realize a lot of modern anime viewers are not very old, so some things in this anime don\'t really hit home with them. I\'m 30, I lived through these conversations. In my lifetime you could literally be prosecuted, or treated to electroshock therapy for being gay or transgender. In my life time, I have seen politicians do things similar to what they have done in this anime, to address another criticism of the series. Characters behaving in a way that isn\'t the way you would behave, or a way that you don\'t think is realistic, is not unrealistic or a plot hole. It is a thing that happens in real life. What\'s important in my opinion is that the characters actions are internally congruent and not completely out of place, so let me address some plot specific points (which will contain minor spoilers).There was no security camera in that interrogation room. That is why they had to write everything down, that is why they could not check the security footage to see what Ai did. The reason the main character tolerates the antagonist sending threatening stuff to his house is because he literally has to. At that point not only is he a broken man, he has no authority to go after her. The police and government are covering everything up, and she\'s on the side of the ruling power in the city which even the nation of Japan does not want to go against. This is not a battle shounen, the main character cannot rise up and fight the authority, or overthrow it. Anime of this genre often deal with the system being too powerful to fight against or escape (Ghost in the Shell, Psychopass).There are several points in the show I don\'t care for. While the show is not sexist, it does partake in somewhat sexist writing. The female characters are generally wives or exist to be murdered or flaunting their sexuality. the show does not do any favors to pretty much any female character in it, which is really just frustrating to see. It falls into a lot of bad tropes that plague fiction in all countries and really suck if you\'re a female viewer, or just if you happen to like any of the female characters in the show.The show did skip over some aspects in which I think would have aided its points. It presents the stereotypical ethics questions that plague everything that discusses ethics now (trolley problem, organ transplant lottery), and it handles them fairly well. But, It does not bring up the fact that we celebrate people giving their life every day. If a fire fighter willingly runs into a burning building and gives their life to save a child, would we stop that person from doing it. No man, it\'s not worth it. What about on larger scale issues? In 9-11 and Australian bush fires, fire fighters and first responders literally did give their lives. Regardless of how Japan feels about war, I\'m pretty sure they still have fires and other natural disasters. in a famous Russian nuclear disaster, a diver gave his life on a mission in which he would receive so much radiation poisoning he wouldn\'t survive after to stop the reactor from causing an even more widespread problem.The change to philosophical discussion in the last few episodes is kind of a jarring, potentially even unwelcome change. It really does change the pacing of the show in general. While I felt the debate segment was riveting, I didn\'t really feel that way about the president\'s philosophical musings.Overall though, I think the show handles philosophical questions better than MOST other anime that try. It blows something like Madoka\'s flimsy handling of many topics out of the water. In addition to that, the pacing for most of the show is excellent. It\'s very hard for me to watch TV series these days, and this made me want to binge. I understand the extreme that delays between episodes during its run were incredibly agonizing.The art direction gets very playful at times, and I really found it enjoyable to see a show both with interesting art and substance. I loved the VHS effects during the interrogations, and the way the episodes play with transitions. The use of music was probably better than the music itself, it really punctuated and heightened a lot of moments. The character designs are somewhat bland, I think that really contributes to the normalcy of the world. For much of the anime you wonder rather this is paranormal or not, I think that helps greatly.The characters were all very compelling, which is rare. I even found the antagonists to be people I wanted to know more about. I thought I would hate Nomura and Itsuki, but I didn\'t. While I don\'t care for Ai, I don\'t wish she wasn\'t in the anime (unlike someone such as Fllay in Gundam SEED). This show has a particularly hilarious portrayal of Americans that I think is underappreciated. I can\'t say how well it nailed other countries, but I\'m guessing the people involved have actually been to America. The way the American characters conduct themselves and the conversations they have, even the historical misunderstandings are very... Relatable. Yes, we do eat Pizza on the bed.When the president asked the mayor why he enacted a law, the mayor\'s response killed me. A long diatribe about how Christopher Columbus founded America and the spirit of pioneerism... Then the president just says ""Ah..."". Perfect.The political systems themselves are a little questionable, but if we\'re being real, they aren\'t more questionable than when American films portray any non US government body.The aspect I\'m most ambivalent on is the ambiguity present throughout the series. It\'s used very well to disguise who characters are and what\'s going to come. I almost never knew what was happening next. At the same time, we never learn a lot about the antagonists. A question I saw pop up a lot was ""When if ever is Ai controlling the main character?"" We don\'t even know if she\'s controlling Itsuki. We don\'t know if they\'re equal partners, if someone even can be truly equal to Ai. We don\'t know if that is his son, or if anything Itsuki said is true. We don\'t truly know Ai\'s motives either. That\'s a lot to think about.This ambiguity is reflected even in the ending. Still, I do think you can piece together the ending. Ending things on an ambiguous note is something common in anime and games. Lain, FF7, and Gantz all have very obtuse endings which seem to make little to no sense at first. Each one does have an explanation for it though, which you can either understand by inspecting the series, or the source material. I do believe there is something of a concrete explanation for the ending hidden within the series, but to explain it here would be spoiling it. Several people do have some very good takes though.All in all, this is probably one of the best anime I\'ve seen in a long time. I highly encourage people to watch it, because even if you disagree with things presented in it or don\'t care for the pacing of the last few episodes, you\'ve still seen one of the best thriller/psychological/mystery anime in years. If this were a movie it\'d appear on click-baity top 10 lists for its genre for decades to come. not in a describing the things that happened kind of way, however it\'s worth noting that even the premise of the show could be perceived as a spoiler to some degree.

For example, giving your life for war isn\'t brought up because modern, current day Japan says war is bad. I think that you have to center your criticism a little bit when you\'re remembering this is a Japanese work aimed at Japanese people from a Japanese point of view. It doesn\'t mean you can\'t leverage criticism at it, but you should keep in mind why something is occurring in the first place.There\'s a more general criticism by people that the entire premise of the anime is stupid because you can\'t criminalize killing yourself. Well I\'m sorry to tell you, you\'re wrong if you believe that. In some countries suicide is literally illegal, and you can be punished if you live. Even putting that aside, some would say that locking people up and controlling their right to bodily autonomy is akin to a punishment as well, we just call it treatment or rehabilitation. And if you do believe that suicide is someone\'s right, then it is in fact a punishment. We also often call prisons and parole ""rehabilitation"". So for all intents and purpose to someone who wants to commit suicide, it is illegal. That\'s before you even get into the case of assisted suicide.  The Suicide Law in the anime is about more than just rather or not it\'s illegal however.It\'s about government support. Itsuki says it several times and he is very clear about it. He wants the government to create pills which facilitate a painless, clean suicide. He wants there to be facilities which assist people with their choice to end their lives. He wants a social acceptance of suicide, which will promote the ability for people to publicly discuss rather it\'s the right choice for them without fear of reprisal. Itsuki would like the entire institution and our thoughts on suicide to be changed.Once again, we\'ve entered a Japanese perspective that some westerners are not familiar with. In America at least, we have a very individualistic view towards things. We don\'t like to think about how the state, or law, or elders influence us. However, we do often look to the law as a sign of morality. Many people consider morality and obeying the law to either be the same thing or morally linked. People say things like ""I\'m not breaking any laws am I?"" Beyond that, people look to others for their cue on what is socially acceptable and how to behave. Japan is a society that values how you contribute to it and gel with it possibly more than how you feel as an individual. From a Japanese perspective, doing right by your family and society is more important than your individual thoughts. This is reflected in many anime in which the main character breaks free of those shackles and does whatever he wants. This is reflected in this anime by characters doing the exact opposite of the typical shounen protagonist.Sekuro is just one embodiment of this. She is like the main character. she does not want to be involved in an unlawful conspiracy that goes against her INDIVIDUAL sense of justice. In spite of this, she is pressured by society and her family relations to work for the main character. She does not want to do this but she must. It is both literally and metaphorically her job. The anime is full of people playing their roles, and doing what they believe is right by society in an attempt to find what is right for them. It is most thoroughly reflected in the young girl who commits suicide on the train tracks though. (To address another criticism, this is an actual kind of bridge that exists, not just crazy anime design).Gay rights are brought up a lot in this anime as an example and a counter example. I do not think this is a dig at LGBT people. If you listen to the arguments made for and against suicide in the anime, several of them are arguments previously applied to gay rights. IN AMERICA no less. ""If you legalize or decriminalize homosexuality, then everyone will be free to do it and people will think it\'s okay."" Crazy!  ""You might even encourage children to do it on accident,"" ""Children will be confused,"" ""If children see their idols doing it they will want to imitate it,"" ""It\'s not our place to decide what people do with their bodies,"" ""Times change"".I realize a lot of modern anime viewers are not very old, so some things in this anime don\'t really hit home with them. I\'m 30, I lived through these conversations. In my lifetime you could literally be prosecuted, or treated to electroshock therapy for being gay or transgender. In my life time, I have seen politicians do things similar to what they have done in this anime, to address another criticism of the series. Characters behaving in a way that isn\'t the way you would behave, or a way that you don\'t think is realistic, is not unrealistic or a plot hole. It is a thing that happens in real life. What\'s important in my opinion is that the characters actions are internally congruent and not completely out of place, so let me address some plot specific points (which will contain minor spoilers).There was no security camera in that interrogation room. That is why they had to write everything down, that is why they could not check the security footage to see what Ai did. The reason the main character tolerates the antagonist sending threatening stuff to his house is because he literally has to. At that point not only is he a broken man, he has no authority to go after her. The police and government are covering everything up, and she\'s on the side of the ruling power in the city which even the nation of Japan does not want to go against. This is not a battle shounen, the main character cannot rise up and fight the authority, or overthrow it. Anime of this genre often deal with the system being too powerful to fight against or escape (Ghost in the Shell, Psychopass).There are several points in the show I don\'t care for. While the show is not sexist, it does partake in somewhat sexist writing. The female characters are generally wives or exist to be murdered or flaunting their sexuality. the show does not do any favors to pretty much any female character in it, which is really just frustrating to see. It falls into a lot of bad tropes that plague fiction in all countries and really suck if you\'re a female viewer, or just if you happen to like any of the female characters in the show.The show did skip over some aspects in which I think would have aided its points. It presents the stereotypical ethics questions that plague everything that discusses ethics now (trolley problem, organ transplant lottery), and it handles them fairly well. But, It does not bring up the fact that we celebrate people giving their life every day. If a fire fighter willingly runs into a burning building and gives their life to save a child, would we stop that person from doing it. No man, it\'s not worth it. What about on larger scale issues? In 9-11 and Australian bush fires, fire fighters and first responders literally did give their lives. Regardless of how Japan feels about war, I\'m pretty sure they still have fires and other natural disasters. in a famous Russian nuclear disaster, a diver gave his life on a mission in which he would receive so much radiation poisoning he wouldn\'t survive after to stop the reactor from causing an even more widespread problem.The change to philosophical discussion in the last few episodes is kind of a jarring, potentially even unwelcome change. It really does change the pacing of the show in general. While I felt the debate segment was riveting, I didn\'t really feel that way about the president\'s philosophical musings.Overall though, I think the show handles philosophical questions better than MOST other anime that try. It blows something like Madoka\'s flimsy handling of many topics out of the water. In addition to that, the pacing for most of the show is excellent. It\'s very hard for me to watch TV series these days, and this made me want to binge. I understand the extreme that delays between episodes during its run were incredibly agonizing.The art direction gets very playful at times, and I really found it enjoyable to see a show both with interesting art and substance. I loved the VHS effects during the interrogations, and the way the episodes play with transitions. The use of music was probably better than the music itself, it really punctuated and heightened a lot of moments. The character designs are somewhat bland, I think that really contributes to the normalcy of the world. For much of the anime you wonder rather this is paranormal or not, I think that helps greatly.The characters were all very compelling, which is rare. I even found the antagonists to be people I wanted to know more about. I thought I would hate Nomura and Itsuki, but I didn\'t. While I don\'t care for Ai, I don\'t wish she wasn\'t in the anime (unlike someone such as Fllay in Gundam SEED). This show has a particularly hilarious portrayal of Americans that I think is underappreciated. I can\'t say how well it nailed other countries, but I\'m guessing the people involved have actually been to America. The way the American characters conduct themselves and the conversations they have, even the historical misunderstandings are very... Relatable. Yes, we do eat Pizza on the bed.When the president asked the mayor why he enacted a law, the mayor\'s response killed me. A long diatribe about how Christopher Columbus founded America and the spirit of pioneerism... Then the president just says ""Ah..."". Perfect.The political systems themselves are a little questionable, but if we\'re being real, they aren\'t more questionable than when American films portray any non US government body.The aspect I\'m most ambivalent on is the ambiguity present throughout the series. It\'s used very well to disguise who characters are and what\'s going to come. I almost never knew what was happening next. At the same time, we never learn a lot about the antagonists. A question I saw pop up a lot was ""When if ever is Ai controlling the main character?"" We don\'t even know if she\'s controlling Itsuki. We don\'t know if they\'re equal partners, if someone even can be truly equal to Ai. We don\'t know if that is his son, or if anything Itsuki said is true. We don\'t truly know Ai\'s motives either. That\'s a lot to think about.This ambiguity is reflected even in the ending. Still, I do think you can piece together the ending. Ending things on an ambiguous note is something common in anime and games. Lain, FF7, and Gantz all have very obtuse endings which seem to make little to no sense at first. Each one does have an explanation for it though, which you can either understand by inspecting the series, or the source material. I do believe there is something of a concrete explanation for the ending hidden within the series, but to explain it here would be spoiling it. Several people do have some very good takes though.All in all, this is probably one of the best anime I\'ve seen in a long time. I highly encourage people to watch it, because even if you disagree with things presented in it or don\'t care for the pacing of the last few episodes, you\'ve still seen one of the best thriller/psychological/mystery anime in years. If this were a movie it\'d appear on click-baity top 10 lists for its genre for decades to come.', 'What is good ? What is evil ? What is the meaning of life ? If any of these questions pique your curiosity, I recommend you watch this show.But if you wish you have a wholesome comprehensive dark tale which with a satisfactory conclusive narrative, you are in the wrong place.My reviews would contain spoilers from this point on.So, the ending left people really disappointed. But honestly, the kind of direction this show was going, I was anticipating precisely this. First of all, this is not the kind of story with the most unique premise of 30 episodes with several seasons where we invest...your hearts into. This is a 12 episodes series which is very direct with its philosophy.The idea as it presents is that for the determination of good and evil is not possible, no matter how much science,logic and religions we add, we will keep finding gaps in our explanations. There is no definite answer, a definite truth which answers these questions, there are layers and layers of chaos and imbalance which keeps piling up one after another. What this show attempts is to give generalized answer to the idea of \'good\' and \'evil\'. A simple and direct truth to this issue.And the entire premise is ""have the protagonist go on this journey of discovery"" based on this philosophy. And the entire show executes that through different characters. Notice that almost all the character had this conversation on \'the meaning of GOOD or JUSTICE\' and their perception on the matter.Now, the suicide law itself is not the point of the show but its implications, under the concept of good and evil.The third act of this show is where it genuinely starts to fall apart as the show tries to address it\'s theme of with a bigger scope, but in the grandiosity of the setting loses the authentic and grounded touch. Nevertheless the final scene itself is what pulled me back to it.Why did Zen shoot the president ?So, we see that the president just moments ago convinced the the girl to wait, wait until he comes up with an answer to her question. Now, let me emphasis on the point that this is the freaking POTUS. The most powerful person on this planet. More than just a human, He is a symbol. Is it better to live or to die ? That was the question she asked. Him jumping from the ceiling means he is validating the idea that ""YES, it IS \'good\' to die"". In his last moments he looked at Zen and apologized, because he is putting the burden of killing the president on him because that was the only way to stop him from jumping.And now about Magase Ai, she constantly kept asking Zen, the same 2 questions. What is good ? What is evil? And in the final scene Zen finally came up with an answer, good means to \'continue\' and evil means to \'end\'.That\'s what it all comes down to in the end. Keeping all the sense of self, moral ambiguity,preconceived principles and complexity aside. THIS is the final and direct answer he came up with.Prior to this Magase also said to Zen that evil and good are not that different. To \'continue\' and to \'end\'. They are quite similar actually. It\'s just about what you value more. Magase is pure evil who values the act of ending and Zen values the act of continuation.Also, I ask you as a viewer to throw all your previously conceived beliefs of what good and evil is or this show won\'t make any sense to you. The show tries to make a simplistic statement down to it\'s bare bones, and that may be unsatisfactory to some, I like to see it as another twisted yet primitive outlook of the protagonist.Now, this is show consisted of 3 arcs. And the end of each felt like a conclusion. An end.Everything went upside down. Now what ? is the question I asked after each arc. Zen, a \'good\' guy has been constantly being forced to confront the end, the evil, and in the final episode he took a person\'s life thus finally realizing how closely related these two are.I believe he did shoot Magase in the end. Magase is NOT human. She is an evil incarnate who can possess the body and mind of any woman on this planet. Why do I think so?The little kid in the post credit scene to me looked like the son of Zen, which implies Magase took the body of Zen\'s wife.Zen was not killed either. He is a guy with a gun with literally no one around. He is not a madman. He posed no danger to anyone at that moment after the shooting. The only logical thing the authorities would do is apprehend him,take him into the custody, and interrogate him.But all the things I just said about the ending is MY interpretation.I don\'t know what actually happened to him because the screen cut to black. His character arc was OPEN ENDED which in turn means \'having no predetermined limit or boundary\' which is roughly synonymous to CONTINUATION  which is ironically what this character stands for.On the other hand Magase only prominently appears in the very end. Throughout the show, only in the end of the episodes and the end of each arc.  Thus, it\'s fitting that the show also ENDS with her.And by this show\'s same logic, I\'d like to say: the time a viewer spent watching this show, it was good ( a lot of people kept calling it an underrated gem).  But the end was not conclusive, but it nonetheless is the end. (It is ironic that people are disappointed too by this ending, it cements the very idea it presents).

Literally everything else about this show remained a solid 10/10 for me throughout.You can tell a show’s starting off STRONG when more happens in the first six minutes than other shows in entire episodes. The pacing propels the viewer forward and doesn’t...let up. Ever.The vocal direction in BABYLON is just superb. A lot of the annoying “anime grunts” are cut; the only noises you here are the necessary ones. When a character says a name real slow, he’s focusing on it to benefit the story. When a character stutters before blabbering a weak excuse for poor performance, he’s expressing himself to benefit the story. This show doesn’t have time to waste on filler dialogue and extra sounds. It’s got 12 episodes and it’ll tell its story by the end of ‘em.The two protagonists are good men with very different qualities and skillsets and critical flaws that their wives help them overcome. They are supported by good staff with distinct but not cliché personalities. The antagonist is not only a strategic foil, but a fundamentally moral foil as well.BABYLON’s story starts small, growing to touch towns in major countries around the globe. Political leaders struggle to maintain the spread of the antagonist’s influence. Learned experts grapple with the moral quandary presented to them, unable to dislodge it from the public’s conscience. The mental/moral virus spreads invisibly, easily communicable to random people who showed no warning signs previously.Just sayin’, does this at all sound like the world’s response to this little global pandemic of early 2020?The ethical questions the show asked aren’t supposed to be answered for you by the finale. They’re answered for the characters, yes, but it’s up to you, the viewers, to munch on those thoughts awhile afterwards. It’s not pretentious; it’s provocative.And the show just, looks, dang, artistically interesting. The sex and violence are portrayed with an unnerving lack of gratuity. The imagery complements the themes and the emotions just so well.I got similar vibes to Death Note, but BABYLON does everything better than that. Everything. There’s a mental aspect akin to Mr. Robot. I saw hints of calm, reasoned socio-political ramifications like in Ghost in the Shell. And there’s a cast of characters here with the viability, maturity, and complexity of a Tom Clancy novel. BABYLON’s taken a lot of right choices from other media and stuffed them into these 12, quick episodes.I understand the last 5-ish eps didn’t go over well with most viewers. Fine. But this is the kind of material I want more of, will happily support, will ardently argue in favor of. Would prefer an ambitious title that misses some people, than regular mediocrity that misses me. So, here's my 10. let up. Ever.The vocal direction in BABYLON is just superb.

This is very easy to answer, but when confronted in a universal study, this can lead to ambiguityStarting from a prosecutor who examined the case of the death of a doctor who allegedly committed suicide, felt dissatisfied the prosecutor and his colleagues further investigated the case until known the witnesses who suspected of being involved were named Ai magase.When dealing with ai magase, the prosecutor realized she was dangerous because all her actions, words, and body language could influence others.

This show will fucc you up2. First mystery anime i\'ve watched.3. Don\'t listen to the people trashing Ai\'s power saying ""ughhhh its so unrealistic"" like its a fucking anime not a True Crime documentary. Power in anime isn\'t black and white. Some people have powers, other people don\'t. Literally the isekai mainstay, (MC has no powers, everyone else does)A lot of the people giving this show bad reviews see powers in anime as black or white. Either everyone has powers or they don\'t. All of them think that just because a show has one ""OP"" character and everyone else is regular it...makes terrible and unrealistic.Or they just find one small ass ""easy mystery"" that doesn\'t get solved as fast as they would like it to.I honestly think that this show is an absolute masterpiece.Story: Shows like this literally rely on story instead of action so this is gonna be a long bit. (Tl;DR below)Top tier. Ep 1 starts out as a generic detective cop show with a touch of realism, stuff happens, people get arrested, it\'s one whole ""mystery of the week"" you think to yourself.

If the anime is incredibly stereotypical, it's going to be hard for me to focus on the show without a grip of disgust or irritation. It's a little harder to find these stereotypes in this show, which I'm happy to report.Now, what you care about:The story...is pretty great at the start of the show. They introduce the show and its main characters pretty well, and the progression of the story isn't extremely slow or too fast; it's pretty easy to grasp onto what's going on and apply it to what you already knew about the story.The art is pretty much what you'd expect of an anime in 2019, but I gave it a score of 9 because they put a tiny bit more detail into objects that other artists typically don't in the animes I've seen, (i.e. cars.)The music in the show is recycled, but done very well in my opinion. I find that these songs are very great for both people of Japan and the U.S, because they're sort of a mix of what you would hear from both countries (Though I'm severely uneducated, so take that with a grain of salt.) Some of these songs I could easily see being used as samples for rap songs when they're released for consumers in the future. Great job Yutaka Yamada, you never cease to impress.The character development is very well done, especially in the main character.Overall, this anime is pretty great and I definitely recommend it. You will enjoy yourself. is pretty great at the start of the show.

You will enjoy yourself."", ""This is perhaps the biggest disappointment of 2019 and considering Carole & Tuesday exists, this is saying something. If I ever wanted a prime example of why I show a lot of hesitation to recommend something as a show is airing this is why. So to start properly let's go from the beginning.Babylon started off initially as something that is actually an interesting idea, covering suicide. The way the show treats suicide seems like it'd be very similar to the marijuana debate which is actually a great idea if it wants to present suicide as something inherently morally gray. Especially the proponent of this Kaika...Itsuki. But however this highlights one of the first problems of it is that rather quickly the show will disregard this morally gray stance in favor of what I dub the comic book villain, Ai Magase. So you'd think the story would present Itsuki as the antagonist especially for the protagonist Zen Seizaki but you'd be wrong it's Magase. Magase is just without a doubt evil without the slightest hint of good, she's practically as evil as Dio but Dio being evil made sense, they don't even try showing how Magase ended up being as evil as she ended up being. So naturally in a show like Babylon introducing Magase completely ruins the narrative and why would you do this? It makes no sense.What also makes no sense in the Whore of Babylon which is supposed to be a symbol for Magase and why the show is named Babylon and that symbol is evil as in clearly not good or even in between. It's not only misplaced in this show it makes me hate the name, so this is what Babylon is named after? Wow, I'd rather them not answer that at all. Also, the “Whore Of Babylon” (Magase) has the ability to kill people by speaking vague words into their ear? I know anime isn't reality but I doubt it would go even that far this is just someone taking acid instead of a good writing class. She's definitely the worst offender of the poor characterization in Babylon with Seizaki being up there as he never really changes from being a moral puritan and if he does there aren't any sense of natural progression or an epiphany. The rivalry between Seizaki and Magase in the end feels like an inferior take of the rivalry between Tsunemori and Makishima, if anything this feels like inferior Psycho-Pass.So in this steaming pile of crap that is this show why is it any good? I'll list two things that prevent me from giving it a one. #1 the soundtrack wasn't awful, it's just a shame it couldn't fit the tonally inconsistent mess that is Babylon. #2 the directing which I'd actually praise. The director Kiyotaki Suzuki directed Babylon amazingly well. He experiments with angles, aspect ratios, and even though Magase isn't actually that threatening of a character his direction can make her feel threatening or have quite a presence. I hope he gets better work as he has some amazing talent.My last point of contention is the ending, while I won't spoil it in this review it's basically if Murphy's law could apply to an anime, everything that can go wrong in an ending did. It's a fireworks display of nonsensical debating, complete lunacy and utter mindlessness. It culminates into an epic shitshow that you'd have to see to believe but for now you'd have to believe me because I do not advise anyone to watch this anime at all, I doubt you'd enjoyed it, hell I didn't enjoy this anime at all, it wasn't even hilariously bad just bad. If it gave up taking itself seriously and just became a comedy it could've at least redeemed itself with that but it still would've been a horrible anime. I even enjoyed Carole & Tuesday more than this and that anime had a horrible ending as well. I'd rather watch Goblin Slayer 3 times then watch Babylon ever again.Overall I give this a 2/10 and is one of the worst anime I've had the “honor” of completing. I'd use this as an example of what not to do when writing an anime, especially an anime focused on a morally gray topic.Also this is my 2nd review so any constructive feedback of my review is appreciated, hope you enjoyed my review.

Think about what makes Death Note timeless and Psycho-Pass amazing and kinda throw it all away. The animation and art style and sound and dialogue and the setup are all amazing, but at the middle of the series it all comes down crashing, but not even in a spectacular way but rather in a ""it would be sad if it wasn\'t so funny"" way.So, there is this mysterious woman who apparently kills people by telling them something that makes them commit suicide.Does she carefully analyze her victims\' actions and life to forge a special sentence...that will push a specific ans vulnerable person off the edge? Or did she figure out something deep about the world that disturbs everyone equally? Apparently, we are to think that the latter is the case, but guess what - it is never explain!It sounds, looks, works and feels like magic, but the anime never mentions it even as a possibility, requesting of viewers to suspend their disbelief that there is some magical formula and way of speech that can make ANYONE commit suicide. Do you know why they never reveal what it is that she says to the victims? Why none of the characters share what they heard with anyone before killing themselves? Because nothing like that exists.The secondary antagonist, who is at the beginning implied to work together with the woman, later becomes a literal nobody, nothing about his side story is relevant at the end, just like the family of the protagonist. Everything becomes meaningless in the end, but not in a deep way supposed to show the meaningless of our own lives, but in a boring way.This anime had so much potential and it didn\'t make any use of it. Absolute waste of time unless you really enjoy watching bad stuff to laugh at it. that will push a specific ans vulnerable person off the edge?

I know it\'s an anime where anything can happen, but for anything to happen it would be nice if it actually...made sense within the anime world\'s logic. It\'s not like they wrote this girl to have mind control powers or anything, she\'s just a normal prostitute lady doing unrealistic things within the world they\'ve written.And they keep abusing the die mechanic that shakespeare was so known for abusing.

They kill off random characters and seemingly random times just to try to make the audience ""feel"" something.', 'Babylon is a psychological thriller that emphasizes the psychological factors that the MC (Zen Seizaki) faces in his investigation of the unusual suicidal deaths that have occurred during the mayoral election within the fictional new Shiniki district in Tokyo.Zen Seizaki the MC starts off the anime surrounded by his pack (fellow investigators) and then ends up as a lone wolf, he grows more and more as a character that no longer thinks with logic but with emotion and ends up becoming a character whos only aim is to eradicate Ai-Magase. He has his heartfelt moments like the drinking scene at the bar that shows...how Magase has broken him mentally and physically as a man.Moving onto Ai-Magase, who I believe is a top tier villain in my eyes, has the ability to use her sexual presence and voice to manipulate others into suicide that is difficult to resist. Ai-Magase can also pose as other characters within Shiniki making her extremely hard to track down in order to integrate. As a result, she makes you question every female character that is newly introduced into the anime. You don’t know whether to trust her or not for the basis that she may be Ai-Magase. I believe that she’s possibly referenced to the “whore of Babylon” a symbolic figure mentioned in the book of revelation in the bible who could corrupt people to do evil deeds. Hence, I believe this is where the actual name of the anime came from.The anime does take a very dark turn in a certain episode that is visually depicted like one of those creepy pasta’s you read about that is shown on the dark web.  The way the scene was directed and communicated to the viewers as well as seeing Seisaki expression and body language you can’t just help and imagine what emotional pain he went through during the live stream of the event and the extreme pain and fear that the victim must have felt made it even more difficult for me to witness.In the later episodes of the anime after the dark scene, it does take a slow turn with a new character being introduced as the President of the United States, who himself doesn’t know whether the suicidal law is beneficial or detrimental to the human race. Unfortunately, this is where I believe the anime goes slightly downhill after the promising first half of the anime. During these last few episodes, political leaders are gathered during a summit to discuss the implications of the suicidal law and discussing what makes a choice good or bad which in turn provides knowledge to the president who then gets the answer that he was searching for.The ending for the anime is anti-climactic and does not provide us with a satisfying conclusion, we also never end up getting the true explanation as to how Magase powers worked, was she a supernatural force or just a regular person using drugs to hypnotise her victims into committing suicide. I guess that’s the mystery element to the anime. We will never know unless explicitly mentioned in the future by the writers.Overall, this anime should definitely be watched by viewers who love psychological thrillers and are a fan of political discussions on important social policies and their implications. Babylon was one of the anime’s that I didn’t watch until midway into the Fall 2019 season.

It makes the anime feel more satisfying rather than watching the after credits.I dislike reading and writing too much so this will be brief.The story is interesting. It is quite catastrophic but gives slight hope meanwhile.The characters are not too unique but they\'re not bad....The enjoyment... I don\'t feel the joy but I would feel a lot better if I didn\'t watch the after credits. Therefore my first comment is for your enjoyment.Now my thoughts on the anime\'s goal. I\'m certain it is due to the suicide rates. I believe the author\'s goal was to make us despise the concept of ending one\'s life. It was a kind way of saying ""No"" to suicide (although I almost hated the story).There is a possibility that this anime will frustrate and make you want to say it was a bad story as the main idea of the story gives you that right to say so(this was an inside joke for after you watch Babylon).But I can\'t dismiss it. It was a good anime. Frustrating but still good. The enjoyment... I don\'t feel the joy but I would feel a lot better if I didn\'t watch the after credits.

It all felt cheapBabylon had potential, but it failed at least for me....I always wanted to watch true detective type high quality anime but this just didn't deliver it for me. Of course if you enjoyed or enjoy it good for you. Tastes are different I guess. Quitting it after episode six.

If I could I would give this 0 points, this anime is a total waste of time.You don’t have to believe me, you may still want to start this anime. But when you feel the cringe level rising after 2 or more episodes come back to the spoiler section as no, it will not get better.The voice acting, music and drawing style are reasonably fine, but the action scenes are non-existent, you always arrive afterwards. This might be good enough for a detective show, but...after the first episode the anime is chasing a protagonist and it doesn’t work. There is also a lot of talking, 90% is talking going nowhere.  Making it sound important and complex talking, but it really is not. In the end the anime is a simple childish script to make a dumb point. Whatever they say is mostly not shown nor has any real relevance in the anime.[spoilers warning]The main storyline is the adopting of a suicide law, and if suicide is bad or not.Suicides are messy things, and laws cannot really forbid them. Existing suicide laws make it possible that people can end their lives in a painless civil way. There are requirements of course. Doctors and psychologists have to agree to it and they first check if you can be helped to live further.But that is not researched in this anime, a requirement free law is demanded by letting people jump off of buildings. Democracy at work I’m guessing. The only argument against that law is that everyone will commit suicide on a whim, o the horror being alive really sucks. They act like a lot of people don’t do it because it’s not in the law.The anime story show people committing suicide by jumping and shooting, which are not good ways to go. Someone has to clean the remains, imagine brains, intestines everywhere not to mention the smell. Shooting as shown in the anime is also bad as some people do survive this and end up blind. If you really want to talk about suicide - show the viewers that bloody part, that is what anime is for. Make the characters react on the view. And say without the law you get this bloody mess.But the characters hardly react to the suicides, no one is really shocked or it goes away fast. People die, but no one is arrested because suicide is your own will of course. In this anime world, a sect leader could just do whatever they want and never be convicted.The characters don’t feel real either, Seizaki Zen is portrayed as a good loving husband and a good colleague. But we never see him go home and have some good time with his family. Itsuki Kaika wants the suicide law so he can commit suicide to save his son. How his son feels about that is never explored, the “best dad ever” emotion should collide with “oh no daddy gone forever” emotion. His son goes with his question on the internet that’s all. And couldn’t Itsuki prepare a medical team and use one heart of the orchestrated suicides I’m thinking then, but that’s just me. That kind of logic isn’t for this anime. Although logic is apparently the strongpoint of the US president Alexander Woody, the most elaborated character of the anime. That is saying much, he was of poor health in the past, thinks a lot, plays MMORPG and also has a wife and a son. Very elaborate indeed.Magase Ai is the protagonist of the story. Her powers are immense, she can control you totally with her voice. It’s based on something sexual and it works on all sexes. It works through telecom devices but you can’t record it. She can make herself look different to complete her power. But what are her motives exactly? You can only guess. She shows us what evil is? Is she the whore of Babylon, does she want to create Babylon?Again details apparently, let’s just add some extra meaningless country leaders instead to make our suicide discussion international and by doing that so very important. But this adds difficulties they are clearly not ready for. It just gives you more talking. The script comes to the rescue, Seizaki Zen becomes an FBI-agent and can be at the international meeting.In the end the president comes to his conclusion from a talk with Seizaki Zen. So why not let Zen come to that conclusion, the international thing is such a waste of time.Magase Ai uses her powers and the script does the rest, it looks like everyone can easily walk in and out of the meeting place. They could have done so many things to protect the leaders, like a lockdown, only stun guns, no women allowed, no telecom devices, only using a chat-app to do the communication? Of course this smart anime does nothing of that and lets the president end with an earpiece that is easily accessed by Magase, at the right moment,  so bye bye president.  But not before he can say to us his very smart conclusion, good is continuation of life, bad is end of life.But this message is only for the viewer as the president is on his way to jump off the building.Zen kills the president to stop humanity of thinking that suicide is good. So ending life was good in this case easily contradicting the simple conclusion just made a second before by the thinking president. I rest my case.Then Magase makes Zen kill himself. So what did Magase gain out of this? Ah yes it ends with Magase talking to Zen’s son. I’m guessing his bloodline will not continue. Who cares, the kid is not more interesting than the other suicide victims in this pointless story.I know making something bad also needs effort, being a critic is way easier. If I multiply all the points it's zero in total.My advice is to skip this pretentious anime. Nozaki Mado hasn’t reached the level of a good writer/director yet. The only good thing out of this is that I now know not to watch KADO. after the first episode the anime is chasing a protagonist and it doesn’t work.

In this anime world, a sect leader could just do whatever they want and never be convicted.The characters don’t feel real either, Seizaki Zen is portrayed as a good loving husband and a good colleague. But we never see him go home and have some good time with his family. Itsuki Kaika wants the suicide law so he can commit suicide to save his son. How his son feels about that is never explored, the “best dad ever” emotion should collide with “oh no daddy gone forever” emotion. His son goes with his question on the internet that’s all. And couldn’t Itsuki prepare a medical team and use one heart of the orchestrated suicides I’m thinking then, but that’s just me. That kind of logic isn’t for this anime. Although logic is apparently the strongpoint of the US president Alexander Woody, the most elaborated character of the anime. That is saying much, he was of poor health in the past, thinks a lot, plays MMORPG and also has a wife and a son. Very elaborate indeed.Magase Ai is the protagonist of the story. Her powers are immense, she can control you totally with her voice. It’s based on something sexual and it works on all sexes. It works through telecom devices but you can’t record it. She can make herself look different to complete her power. But what are her motives exactly? You can only guess. She shows us what evil is? Is she the whore of Babylon, does she want to create Babylon?Again details apparently, let’s just add some extra meaningless country leaders instead to make our suicide discussion international and by doing that so very important. But this adds difficulties they are clearly not ready for. It just gives you more talking. The script comes to the rescue, Seizaki Zen becomes an FBI-agent and can be at the international meeting.In the end the president comes to his conclusion from a talk with Seizaki Zen. So why not let Zen come to that conclusion, the international thing is such a waste of time.Magase Ai uses her powers and the script does the rest, it looks like everyone can easily walk in and out of the meeting place. They could have done so many things to protect the leaders, like a lockdown, only stun guns, no women allowed, no telecom devices, only using a chat-app to do the communication? Of course this smart anime does nothing of that and lets the president end with an earpiece that is easily accessed by Magase, at the right moment,  so bye bye president.  But not before he can say to us his very smart conclusion, good is continuation of life, bad is end of life.But this message is only for the viewer as the president is on his way to jump off the building.Zen kills the president to stop humanity of thinking that suicide is good. So ending life was good in this case easily contradicting the simple conclusion just made a second before by the thinking president. I rest my case.Then Magase makes Zen kill himself. So what did Magase gain out of this? Ah yes it ends with Magase talking to Zen’s son. I’m guessing his bloodline will not continue. Who cares, the kid is not more interesting than the other suicide victims in this pointless story.I know making something bad also needs effort, being a critic is way easier. If I multiply all the points it's zero in total.My advice is to skip this pretentious anime. Nozaki Mado hasn’t reached the level of a good writer/director yet. The only good thing out of this is that I now know not to watch KADO."", 'First thing this is my first time to review an anime.For somebody who are planning to watch a kind of psychology or detective anime, this might be yours and seriously u may prepare your mentality becuz this anime may bring u to a view that u would never forget it.

The story revolves around the main protagonist, Zen Seizaki, a public prosecutor investigating a pharmaceutical company involved in a scandal. The anime starts off strong with a gripping storyline that keeps the audience engaged.However, as the series progresses, it begins to lose its focus and the plot becomes convoluted. The pacing of the story is also inconsistent, with some episodes feeling rushed while others drag on. This inconsistency makes it difficult for viewers to remain invested in the story and the characters.Despite these shortcomings, Babylon does...have some redeeming qualities.

Nothing was really bad.Character: 8 - Main character is pretty good, somewhat of a fresh breath of air from your typical school boy saving the world archetype. Main villain has some interesting abilities, however, no real motives are established apart from just being a straight up psychopath.Enjoyment: 5 - Really disliked the whole suicide debate and politics in general. I feel like that...could've been done in a far better way, focusing more on the villain and the politics could be the secondary thing.Overall: 5 - Strong start, some good parts in the middle, but overall the politics kinda ruined it, feel like it could've been done a lot better. Looking forward as to how they're going to end the show.I feel like this show would've been so much better if they've focused more on the main protagonist and the antagonist of  the show, leave the politics as the secondary thing, leave them as something Ai could manipulate and have her way with it. By doing so, you could establish her motives more easily, give her a more fleshed out backstory as to why she's doing what she's doing. Because now it seems like all she wants is chaos. While the pure chaotic antagonist can be cool, she isn't given that much screen time, which is taken up by the politics and the whole suicide debate (which is really stupid in my opinion).Also more fleshed out development on the main character would be appreciated since he goes through some rough shit. He sees almost everyone in his unit wiped out and sees her colleague hacked up into pieces by Ai during her live stream. That ought to fuck shit up for you. Could be good if her wife kinda stepped in, giving him moral support, but that kinda didn't happen, they just hanged out at the zoo without the guy showing any PTSD. You would think after going through what he went through you would have some breakdowns in front of your family, but I guess he's more of a man than me :)The main aspect of the show seems to be the suicide debate, in which recently appointed mayor Itsuki Kaika, has established a suicide law, shortly after, a lot of people jump off a building to their deaths.Weeks later, a debate takes place in a studio in which a few candidates who are against the law make their claims, but all that was swept aside when Kaika's son comes out, saying his dad wants to commit suicide. Then A TWIST happens when Kaika reveals that he is the kids' dad, and he's the one who wants to commit suicide in order to donate his own heart to his son.......... A couple of things that is very, very retarded with this. If i recall correctly, there are these cards in Japan that you can fill and after you die, your organs get donated (no one brought this point up by the way) . You're meaning to tell me, instead of searching for a donor that way, you're just going to straight up sacrifice yourself to the kid?SECOND. A lot of people just suddenly wrote to the live debate saying how they would donate their own heart to the kid too... When was the last time a complete stranger sacrificed himself for another human being? Maybe once since the beginning of time?Before the debate, only 3% of the population were for the law, after the debate, everyone had their hearts moved at the INCREDIBLE arguments presented by Dumbfuck Kaika and now it's half the population in favour of the law.Then on 8th episode it shows one of the best fantasy sections of the anime: a shy computer nerd hooks up with a 10/10 model who he met in game and taught her about the game, who encourages him to be more confident because he's really good at video games and later on that man marries the woman, has a kid with her and becomes the president of the United States. I... don't even know...Before I end, I really liked the feeling of the spell Ai puts men under. Before suicide, one of the colleagues describing the feeling as: Constantly having sex, but not wanting to ejaculate, but at the same time, the climax would be so incredibly good, you cannot just keep going... The sex part is living, the ejaculating part is killing yourself.

The show is about humanity's last Master, Fujimaru Ritsuka, and his main servant Mash as they venture through the 7th singularity and---- wait what? That's the wrong show? ...Ahem.Babylon is a multifaceted show that is a mystery drama, psychological thriller, and political power struggle all stuffed into one show. Our protagonist is Seizaki Zen, the head prosecutor of Japan's Special Investigations Unit. The show follows the entirety of his investigation through a specific incident that ultimately culminates into a quest to define the fundamental nature of good and evil. Without getting...into spoilers, the show is very ambitious and in my opinion fulfills the quota it set for itself and more. Do keep in mind this isn't a show to watch without thinking, as many of the answers have to deduced by the viewer rather than the show just revealing the plot point for free. This actually does include the ending of the show, that's actually much more close-ended when you actually think about it. Bottom line, if you want to watch something that makes you think, this is DEFINITELY the show to watch.I won’t be intentionally spoiling the show, but I will be using major points and other key events of the show as examples to support my reasoning for rating the show as I do. Please be aware.This review will be organized in two parts, mainly touching on everything up to episode 7 and everything after episode 7 due how much the nature of the show differs between those two points. I will not be discussing the Story, Art, Sound, Character, and Enjoyment of the show individually, as these points will be woven into my analysis of the two aforementioned halves of the show. Let's begin.The first half of the show opens up as what appears as mostly a mystery drama and psychological thriller, as Seizaki is looking into some strange incidents and seems to find a loose connection between multiple cases that seemingly lead to dead ends. This stretch of the show really serves to lay the foundation for Seizaki as a character, and part of what makes the show so enjoyable for me was how well developed of a protagonist Seizaki is. Seizaki is a straightforward and principle-driven workaholic, dedicated to catching the bad guys and prosecuting them to the fullest extent of the law. The show does a fantastic job of building Seizaki’s character for us and letting us know what type of person he is. Little things like his coffee mug reading “KEEP CALM AND SERVE JUSTICE” (can we take a moment and appreciate how funny this is?) and larger things like not going home whenever he’s working a case demonstrate that Seizaki is a man on a mission, and his day really only starts when he checks into the office at work. The very first conversation he has on the phone with his wife is a fantastic example of this. Seizaki’s apology for not being able to come home “once again” and his wife’s automatic and supportive response indicates that rather than being a first-time occurrence, working overtime is more of an everyday type of thing for this household. Especially when we learn Seizaki even has a son at home that’s pretty much being solely raised by a mother when daddy is away at work, it’s very clear where Seizaki’s priorities are at. This point is really hammered home in a particular phone conversation between Seizaki and his wife (go figure, they talk on the phone more than they do in person) that doesn’t actually have a shot of either of them talking. Instead, the camera is panning up the staircase in Seizaki’s home, showing the family photos during the conversation. “Family” photos being a loose term here since Seizaki was only in like 2 out of the 5 photos shown, and one of the photos he was in was when his son was really young. This is really just a remarkable demonstration of good directing, as the deliberate arrangement of this shot serves to solidify Seizaki Zen’s character without any exposition at all. Moving to another main plot point, the main antagonist Magase Ai serves as a foil to further strengthen the foundation of Seizaki’s character. Their first meeting during the interrogation room interview is a scene with a ton of depth. Not to mention the really creative shots during the encounter, like point of view shot from Ai’s mouth as a frame looking out at Seizaki, and the unsettling atmosphere created from the emphasis on the unwavering eye contact between the two. The content of the interview itself was mostly Magase asking questions to Seizaki, quite antithetical of a prosecutor interviewing a suspect, and this line of questioning indicate the first seeds of doubt being planted in Seizaki’s other black and white perspective on justice. Up to this point in time, Seizaki has been a by-the-book lawyer with a very conventional sense of unwavering justice, which have contributed to his current position as lead prosecutor. Magase posed very difficult questions, like whether death was evil, that really forced Seizaki to reconsider some of his fundamental beliefs. The plot escalates from this point forward from a minor investigation of cases to involvement in the much bigger Shiniki Project when Seizaki is called to investigate Itsuki Kaika. This leg of the show is the start of the main conflict that plays out in a mystery and political power struggle, now that the character development in the previous arc has set the stage. The Suicide Law introduced by Itsuki’s hijacking of the Shiniki Project is thrust into the center of the show, as the stakes are even further raised to impact the entire country of Japan. This introduces a heavily political tone of the show, as political power and public support now greatly factors into whether this law is enacted or rejected. The show takes advantage of this opportunity to stage the most convincing political debate I’ve ever seen in an anime with some of the most realistic and ideological sound arguments I’ve seen in an anime. There are socioeconomic, ethical, legal, and emotional arguments and counterarguments that were so logically sound that it was an academic treat for anyone with a legal or philosophical education (like me). Aside from how compelling the arguments were, they were also indicative of how a realistic political power struggle would play out, as many of the questions and arguments were posed in a malicious way such to corner the opposition for a decisive blow to their public campaign. This became all the more apparent when an innocent boy who made a viral video on the suicide law was appropriated to make a case against suicide law, and as Itsuki Kaika proceeded to immediately turn the tables and reveal that the boy was in fact his own son that he was prepared to die for in order to give him a needed heart transplant. This level of intense mind games where one party predicts the opponent’s ace card and proceeds to convert that ace card into their own ace card is honestly more epic than an actual full-blown action battle scene to me. The show masterfully takes advantage of the momentum of the turning of tables in the political storyline and directly transitions to Magase turning the tables on Seizaki. Concurrently with this political struggle storyline, the show also runs the more personal storyline of the struggle between Seizaki and Magase, as Seizaki’s investigations team is dismembered (literally) one by one. As gruesome as it is, between the scene before Kujiin’s death where the image of him and Seizaki were shot from a reflection from a pool of his blood and the transition of the dismemberment scene to the ketchup being put over his family’s bento, are examples of very effective visual tools that are yet more testaments to the detailed art direction the show has.The end of episode 7 marks the beginning of more than a month of break in the airing of episodes, and also a stark transition in the tone of the show. Here, Babylon goes full JoJo as the main conflict escalates to an international scale as the majority of the latter part of the show takes place in the United States. The show begins to place a heavy emphasis on the political power struggle part of the show, and also shifts a lot of its focus to resolving the question of fundamental good and evil that was only a light motif during the previous part. While many people disliked this shift in the show’s focus, I’m going to explain here why this shift was necessary, because the show both had nowhere else to go and the show was actually dropping hints that it was going to do something like this. First, the show really had nowhere to go at this point in the Shiniki Project storyline. Any source of opposition to the Shiniki Suicide Law Initiative was so thoroughly trounced and driven to despair, or was dead. The first part of episode 8 demonstrated this very well, and I can say I’ve never quite been so unsettled by a peaceful scene as I was while watching Seizaki at home having quality family time. If the foundation set in the previous part of the show indicates anything at all, the fact that Seizaki is here at home rather than at work means that there is quite literally nothing more he can do about the issue he was investigating, and anyone he was collaborating with before was dead. Thus, the show had nowhere else to go other than expand the scope of the story to an international scale. Addressing the second point, the show was already hinting that it would do something like this. The Suicide Law campaign was portrayed as a very ambitious and deliberate political campaign, and ambitious political campaigns usually don’t just end after succeeding in one city. A much greater scale of the suicide law being enacted all over the world was probably the end goal’s vision. The show had already introduced a lot of political elements with the previous political debate storyline, so adding greater focus to the political power struggle of the suicide law and expanding the scope of said struggle should not have been unexpected. The latter part of the 8th episode introduced Alexander W. Wood, the fictional president of the United States. It is usually quite taboo for a show to add such an important main character this late into the game, but this show pulled it off excellently. While a little forced and out of the blue, the background exposition on the President was extremely detailed and it was very engrossing such that a viewer is placed completely in the mind of Alexander W. Wood and understands exactly how he thinks and how he came to be as he is as a person. Considering how well the show pulled of character development for Seizaki during the first part, the show’s thoughtful handling of character profiles does not change even if the main tone of the show does. The introduction of President Wood serves as a device to smoothly transition to the more philosophical and ideological part of the show. While Seizaki was doing his best to fight against the Suicide Law during the former part of the show, the latter part of the show ponders whether or not the Suicide Law is good or evil. While we see a drastic decline in the amount of suspense and detailed art direction prevalent in the previous part of the show, we see much more ideological clout being touted as the leaders of the world are dragged together to answer the ultimate questions: What is good? What is evil? While not being as entertaining at face value, I personally started watching anime and continue watching anime for shows that have messages that concern the bigger picture. Hence why Madoka Magica is still my favorite show of all time and an uncommon show like Gatchaman Crowds is in my anime top 10. So I found this part of the show equally entertaining as the previous parts of the show, as characters with different experiences and opinions came together to solve the ultimate mystery: defining the fundamental essence of good and evil. I found tuning in every week to this philosophical spectacle to be quite a treat, and anyone else who enjoys pondering this type of academic discourse will as well. Babylon still had one last surprise for us before the show ended, as the global political power struggle over the suicide law drew to a climax. President Wood successfully delayed a young girl from committing suicide with the promise that as soon as he knew whether it was a good or bad thing, he would let her and everyone else in the world know; except, Magase Ai infiltrates the summit where the president is at and mind-controls him to fling himself off the roof while being broadcast on international television. The show once again shows off its excellent scenario writing, creating a situation where the antagonists turn the tables to exploit what was supposed to be an asset of our protagonists. President Wood’s calm demeanor and thoughtful nature renders him invulnerable to the chaos and uproar the suicide law is creating on a global scale, but it also makes him an icon of authority that people look up to. With Magase forcing the President to commit suicide especially after he promised to let everyone know the conclusion he comes to about suicide, the Suicide Law Initiative would steal an overwhelming landslide of a victory and enact global change. This will be the second time I mention how enjoyable this type of mental warfare is, and how a battle of wits this intricate is the most entertaining type of battle I could ask for. Seizaki is aware of Magase’s plans this time around unlike the last time in Japan, and arrives just in time before the President is forced to kill himself. Another very satisfying chain of logic takes place once again, and it becomes frighteningly clear that the only way to prevent a man mind-controlled to commit suicide is to kill him yourself. Seizaki prevents the suicide by making it a murder, and he shoots the President before he can jump off the building. And thus the show comes full circle, as Magase appears before Seizaki, emphasizing how “bad” he currently looks after committing murder as a man named after “good”, as a prosecutor seeking to uphold justice. And she asks him: “What is good? What is evil?”To wrap some loose-ends up, I suppose I haven’t talked about the soundtrack this whole time even though I’ve covered nearly everything else. I think the soundtrack is really good. It is ambient and very appropriate for a show like this. All of the sound, including the OP and ED, is nothing over the top and merely serves to contribute to the general tone of the show.This show is really, really underrated in my opinion. While I understand it was a show that had some shaky development during its air time and it did undergo a drastic tone shift halfway through, it was still really good nonetheless. Just calling it a show that went sour halfway through is really underselling it. It’s definitely one of the most thought-provoking shows I’ve ever watched, next to Madoka Magica. That’s how much impact it made for me personally. I don’t really have a witty way to end off this review like I normally do, so just have my favorite quote from the show which is now probably my favorite quote in all of anime.“I’m still not sure what justice is. I still haven’t found a guideline for judging what’s wrong and what’s right. However, even though I don’t know, there’s still something that I believe is right. It’s continuing to think about what’s right. Even if I arrive at the answer someday, it’s important to not stop thinking about it. Even after you think you know what justice is, it’s important to keep asking yourself forever what justice means. I think that’s what justice is.” -Seizaki ZenP.S. Sorry that this review kinda just ended up reading like a poorly organized book report. I’m still personally letting the show’s ending sink in even as I write this (which goes to show again how deep this show really is), but I wanted to get this review out before this show gets swept under the rug and is never mentioned ever again. It’s one of my favorites and definitely is my favorite show of the previous season. Thanks for reading. into spoilers, the show is very ambitious and in my opinion fulfills the quota it set for itself and more.

Concurrently with this political struggle storyline, the show also runs the more personal storyline of the struggle between Seizaki and Magase, as Seizaki’s investigations team is dismembered (literally) one by one. As gruesome as it is, between the scene before Kujiin’s death where the image of him and Seizaki were shot from a reflection from a pool of his blood and the transition of the dismemberment scene to the ketchup being put over his family’s bento, are examples of very effective visual tools that are yet more testaments to the detailed art direction the show has.The end of episode 7 marks the beginning of more than a month of break in the airing of episodes, and also a stark transition in the tone of the show. Here, Babylon goes full JoJo as the main conflict escalates to an international scale as the majority of the latter part of the show takes place in the United States. The show begins to place a heavy emphasis on the political power struggle part of the show, and also shifts a lot of its focus to resolving the question of fundamental good and evil that was only a light motif during the previous part. While many people disliked this shift in the show’s focus, I’m going to explain here why this shift was necessary, because the show both had nowhere else to go and the show was actually dropping hints that it was going to do something like this. First, the show really had nowhere to go at this point in the Shiniki Project storyline. Any source of opposition to the Shiniki Suicide Law Initiative was so thoroughly trounced and driven to despair, or was dead. The first part of episode 8 demonstrated this very well, and I can say I’ve never quite been so unsettled by a peaceful scene as I was while watching Seizaki at home having quality family time. If the foundation set in the previous part of the show indicates anything at all, the fact that Seizaki is here at home rather than at work means that there is quite literally nothing more he can do about the issue he was investigating, and anyone he was collaborating with before was dead. Thus, the show had nowhere else to go other than expand the scope of the story to an international scale. Addressing the second point, the show was already hinting that it would do something like this. The Suicide Law campaign was portrayed as a very ambitious and deliberate political campaign, and ambitious political campaigns usually don’t just end after succeeding in one city. A much greater scale of the suicide law being enacted all over the world was probably the end goal’s vision. The show had already introduced a lot of political elements with the previous political debate storyline, so adding greater focus to the political power struggle of the suicide law and expanding the scope of said struggle should not have been unexpected. The latter part of the 8th episode introduced Alexander W. Wood, the fictional president of the United States. It is usually quite taboo for a show to add such an important main character this late into the game, but this show pulled it off excellently. While a little forced and out of the blue, the background exposition on the President was extremely detailed and it was very engrossing such that a viewer is placed completely in the mind of Alexander W. Wood and understands exactly how he thinks and how he came to be as he is as a person. Considering how well the show pulled of character development for Seizaki during the first part, the show’s thoughtful handling of character profiles does not change even if the main tone of the show does. The introduction of President Wood serves as a device to smoothly transition to the more philosophical and ideological part of the show. While Seizaki was doing his best to fight against the Suicide Law during the former part of the show, the latter part of the show ponders whether or not the Suicide Law is good or evil. While we see a drastic decline in the amount of suspense and detailed art direction prevalent in the previous part of the show, we see much more ideological clout being touted as the leaders of the world are dragged together to answer the ultimate questions: What is good? What is evil? While not being as entertaining at face value, I personally started watching anime and continue watching anime for shows that have messages that concern the bigger picture. Hence why Madoka Magica is still my favorite show of all time and an uncommon show like Gatchaman Crowds is in my anime top 10. So I found this part of the show equally entertaining as the previous parts of the show, as characters with different experiences and opinions came together to solve the ultimate mystery: defining the fundamental essence of good and evil. I found tuning in every week to this philosophical spectacle to be quite a treat, and anyone else who enjoys pondering this type of academic discourse will as well. Babylon still had one last surprise for us before the show ended, as the global political power struggle over the suicide law drew to a climax. President Wood successfully delayed a young girl from committing suicide with the promise that as soon as he knew whether it was a good or bad thing, he would let her and everyone else in the world know; except, Magase Ai infiltrates the summit where the president is at and mind-controls him to fling himself off the roof while being broadcast on international television. The show once again shows off its excellent scenario writing, creating a situation where the antagonists turn the tables to exploit what was supposed to be an asset of our protagonists. President Wood’s calm demeanor and thoughtful nature renders him invulnerable to the chaos and uproar the suicide law is creating on a global scale, but it also makes him an icon of authority that people look up to. With Magase forcing the President to commit suicide especially after he promised to let everyone know the conclusion he comes to about suicide, the Suicide Law Initiative would steal an overwhelming landslide of a victory and enact global change. This will be the second time I mention how enjoyable this type of mental warfare is, and how a battle of wits this intricate is the most entertaining type of battle I could ask for. Seizaki is aware of Magase’s plans this time around unlike the last time in Japan, and arrives just in time before the President is forced to kill himself. Another very satisfying chain of logic takes place once again, and it becomes frighteningly clear that the only way to prevent a man mind-controlled to commit suicide is to kill him yourself. Seizaki prevents the suicide by making it a murder, and he shoots the President before he can jump off the building. And thus the show comes full circle, as Magase appears before Seizaki, emphasizing how “bad” he currently looks after committing murder as a man named after “good”, as a prosecutor seeking to uphold justice. And she asks him: “What is good? What is evil?”To wrap some loose-ends up, I suppose I haven’t talked about the soundtrack this whole time even though I’ve covered nearly everything else. I think the soundtrack is really good. It is ambient and very appropriate for a show like this. All of the sound, including the OP and ED, is nothing over the top and merely serves to contribute to the general tone of the show.This show is really, really underrated in my opinion. While I understand it was a show that had some shaky development during its air time and it did undergo a drastic tone shift halfway through, it was still really good nonetheless. Just calling it a show that went sour halfway through is really underselling it. It’s definitely one of the most thought-provoking shows I’ve ever watched, next to Madoka Magica. That’s how much impact it made for me personally. I don’t really have a witty way to end off this review like I normally do, so just have my favorite quote from the show which is now probably my favorite quote in all of anime.“I’m still not sure what justice is. I still haven’t found a guideline for judging what’s wrong and what’s right. However, even though I don’t know, there’s still something that I believe is right. It’s continuing to think about what’s right. Even if I arrive at the answer someday, it’s important to not stop thinking about it. Even after you think you know what justice is, it’s important to keep asking yourself forever what justice means. I think that’s what justice is.” -Seizaki ZenP.S. Sorry that this review kinda just ended up reading like a poorly organized book report. I’m still personally letting the show’s ending sink in even as I write this (which goes to show again how deep this show really is), but I wanted to get this review out before this show gets swept under the rug and is never mentioned ever again. It’s one of my favorites and definitely is my favorite show of the previous season. Thanks for reading."", ""Throughout my high school years, I struggled with an illness in my mind I couldn't put into words. The way I thought of it was a roller coaster that I could never get off. My whole life has been a series of peaks and valleys.For weeks, the roller coaster would be at a peak. I would have an endless supply of energy. I was able to make friends and enjoy every day to the fullest. Then everything would crash down and suddenly the roller coaster was stuck in a valley. For weeks, I would be exhausted and depressed. Making friends was the easy part, but...keeping them was hard. During a valley, trying to talk to anyone was as painful as getting a tooth ripped out of your mouth. I had to avoid my friends altogether so I wouldn’t have an angry outburst and ruin our friendship. Growing up, I didn’t have many people in my life because I learned all of this the hard way. Even my family tried subtly avoiding me because they were afraid of sudden mood swings. There were times when the roller coaster was so low I couldn't tell if it'd ever go back up.Babylon is like that roller coaster. It entices you with an interesting premise, it begins at the bottom of the coaster, and gradually rises. It has bursts of greatness, then it suddenly shoots downwards leaving you frustrated and trapped in the headspace of the demonic antagonist. She beckons everyone in the series, including you, to consider suicide as the answer to life-long suffering. Along the way, it touches upon—or rather, beats with a baseball bat—themes of suicide, depression, and morality. It puts a unique spin on the conventional cat &amp; mouse murder mystery, while also tackling politics and the central theme of whether or not suicide should be legalized. Much of the screen time is dedicated to intellectual politicians debating the show’s themes. To the untrained eye, these arguments may seem intelligent, enlightening, and enthralling. Anyone who has ever taken an intro-level philosophy course can tell this entire show is pseudo-philosophical bullshit laden with logical fallacies.It asks questions such as: Is suicide wrong? Should suicide be legal? What if someone could coerce you into killing yourself within seconds? What is it she can say to change your mind? And if you figure it out would you be convinced to join her victims? It begs you to understand these questions. If you don’t get IT, you’re the minority, if you don’t get IT you are not intelligent enough. Politicians, citizens of Japan, and entire countries vote to support the suicide law. But you simply don’t understand why because you are a normal human being. You know what's right from wrong, and you can tell that everything that occurs within the world of Babylon is illogical. Rather than asking questions rooted in modern-day society (such as the legality of euthanasia), the writer discusses the suicide law, an argument no one in the real world would benefit from pondering. No one acts like a real human being in this show. They are all cardboard cutouts existing to preach philosophy from the insidious mind of an uninformed writer.There is no reality in which suicide will be legalized as a law. If someone is determined to take their own life, they will not stop to consider what the government has to say about it. People still have morals and know right from wrong, no decent human being would stand aside and watch a person commit suicide when they have the power to save their life. Meanwhile in the ass-backward world of Babylon... Hundreds of people commit mass suicide and the police do not investigate anything because they “want to avoid a scandal.” What the fuck. This is Japan not fucking North Korea. I find it impossible to believe the police wouldn’t care about a string of violent deaths at the same time in the same place. Babylon imagines a nightmarish perversion of reality where suicide is morally acceptable, encouraged, and the solution to depression. The sun emits a hellish hue of orange, water is colored blood-red, and the many deaths are shown in gruesome detail for shallow shock factor. The deaths also exist to get under your skin, desensitizing you to suicide at a record-breaking speed. If I had to live in a world where suicide is legal, enforced, and considered unimportant to the justice system, I wouldn’t want to live in it either.Suicide is glorified in a way that only someone who has felt suicidal can contextualize. Like an angel of death, the Whore of Babylon whispers sweet nothings into someone’s ear and they commit suicide. Victims become crazed, there’s nothing that can stop them from the uncontrollable urge to die. This is what it is like to struggle against the overwhelming need to release yourself from the pain of life. One victim compares suicide to sex, and the end of his life is the orgasm. At the end of his monologue, he puts a gun to his head and pulls the trigger, blood squirting, but for a brief moment, it appears completely white to finish the sex metaphor. This sort of disgusting self-masturbatory directing is used throughout the show. I cannot fathom how people find this kind of unsubtle imagery remotely good. Babylon targets a large subset of the anime community who seek out mature seinen and psychological-thrillers, I consider myself part of this audience. If an anime has dark themes, dramatic music, and adult characters speaking very seriously, this subset of the community will flock to the anime. Babylon has it all, everything except the execution. I have no ill will towards anyone who likes this anime, after all, it coerces you into believing you are watching a revolutionary work of art. For me, this is one of, if not the worst, anime I have ever watched. None of the philosophical anime I have seen come close to being as pretentious as this one.This show may have redeeming qualities: the music adds suspense, the animation is mostly acceptable, and it has an intriguing premise, but every positive aspect is doused in an impenetrable layer of poison. Babylon is an abyss with nothing at the bottom but despair and hopelessness. It gaslit me into believing its ponderings on suicide were of substance and worth reading into. Perhaps it is because I am in a valley as I write this, but analyzing Babylon made me contemplate suicide as a valid cure to a life of struggling against that roller coaster. I’m sorry this is not like my other reviews, but someone needed to warn people about this vile sack of shit. It’s about time I put this out of my mind for good. I think I’ll go outside today and enjoy the wonderful and beautiful things the world has to offer. Maybe later I will watch a comedy or a relaxing slice-of-life.NOTE: If you have Depression, Bipolar Disorder, experienced suicidal thoughts, or a history of self-harm, please do not watch Babylon.

All I am going to say is that this anime is one of its kind. The storyline is just splendid. The characters, well if you don't know about Ai Magase, I don't know what you are doing with your life. The anime has only 2 episodes remaining and I have absolutely no idea how they are going to end it. The only thing i can see is Ai Magase winning. She is the most sinister person the world has ever see. She is the reincarnation of evil in the form of...a woman. If you think that you should not watch this anime, I would tell you to watch it just because of her. And please, don't stop watching the anime until and unless you have watched the 7th episode at least. It's by far the most disturbing, gruesome and awesome I have ever seen in my life and I say this after having watched Psycho Pass, GoT, The Witcher, Mirai Nikki and many many many other gory animes and shows. Episode 7 disturbed me mentally, it was that good. I have rewatched it twice within 12 hours already. And Seizaki Zen too, not a bad character, a bit normal compared to Magase but also amazing. I love the music and the animation is good too. Don't tell me to compare it with other studios when we all know that Ufotable is the best studio out there. All in all, I would recommend you to watch this anime and I would tell you not to listen to or read the review of anyone who hasn't watched till episode 7 cause that guy/girl is stupid af.PS: I still regret having voted for Overhaul and Askeladd as the best antagonists of 2019.

I watched Babylon a bit late :("", ""I won't start off with the artistic quotes and viewpoints of other reviewers because that is useless. There is no reason to describe an anime in such useless terms. If one were to analyze an anime, do not just pull quotes and supposedly philosophical viewpoints. I will say this bluntly, Babylon was average. It was okay...I loved the beginning. It had numerous interesting twists and turns and kept you on edge. As an audience, we expected many things, and we got more than we wanted. These twists and turns amazed us. They were terrifying, thrilling, and out of this world, but at the same time,...they made sense.Each character was extremely well developed, making me intrigued to find out more about their lives. In addition, this show wasn't afraid to kill its characters. It killed numerous characters, enticing the watchers to learn more about the world and swallowing them into the mystery.The initial conflict between the two characters of Seizaki and Magase was even more interesting. The devilish Magase was a real psychopath that awed me in how terrible she was. In addition, the development of Seizaki helped us feel very sympathetic in his struggles against Magase. The creator developed Magase so well, that she is probably one of the best villains I've ever seen. She's a person I'd love to hate.However, there were some serious problems. We head to the main plot of the story for this.This anime, in essence, is trying to prove a point on suicide. However, the way this main plot is set up is completely messed up and riddled with holes.The debate between the two sides of the argument is riddled with logical fallacies and in the end, can be disproved by anyone with a working brain. I understand that the creator wants to show that suicide has many points of view, but it is very unjustifiable, and the way the creator paints it, makes it even more so.The way the creator tries to prove that suicide is a good thing has way too many flaws. Even the anime itself knows this because the side of the argument that supports suicide refuses to answer many questions that can disprove their argument.Furthermore, the support for suicide completely skips over the psychological and societal factors that contribute to suicide. The argument does not consider why people commit suicide and says that suicide and not committing suicide are the only two answers. Apparently, there is no therapy, medication, and psychiatry in this world.It also further messes up many facts about world religions and governments across the world. It shows many governments approving suicide but without reason. After all, a government's obligation is to protect its people, especially from death.It also messes up the relationship of the U.S government and how it functions and laws concerning murder and suicide.Furthermore, tries to be philosophical and refer to the Bible, incorrectly. Thus, I give the story, especially the reasoning a 4.Everything else was very good. I liked how the opening was only 30 seconds, helping viewers stay on the task at hand (watching the show).It also has very good thriller elements. It is well played there.The art is beautiful and unique and the sound design is as good.The only major problem I have is the logic of the story. I feel like the subplot with Magase and Seizaki is way more interesting than the actual discussion of suicide.

When I started it, it seemed like it had a real chance of becoming one of my top anime of all time, based on the story, characters, and themes. Up to episode 7, I was on the edge of my seat and constantly checking for new episodes because everything about it drew me in: the dynamics between the characters, the air of mystery and intrigue of the psychological thriller, and the open way in which the anime addressed an incredibly serious topic.The story was intriguing...at first, introducing a new special district, in which a newly elected mayor, Itsuki Kaika, breaks with traditional political parties and implements a new, highly controversial law against a backdrop of several mysterious suicides. The second arc of the show focuses on the attempts to remove this apparently loose cannon and reverse his policies, particularly after they almost immediately result in a major tragedy. But at the same time, they challenge current conceptions of morality, at least in-universe, and lead to serious discussions/debate rather than simply waving off something as ""good"" or ""bad"" simply because society has decided it to be so. Itsuki\'s motivations for his actions are clarified in episode 7 and evoke sympathy and understanding in the viewer, both in the anime and beyond the fourth wall, and set up the story to delve more deeply into philosophy and morality. At least in theory: it seems that the producers wanted to go in that direction, but the rest of the story fails to maintain the quality of the first 7 episodes, instead losing much of the tension and resorting to a lower level of discourse.Originally, the characters were also fascinating, particularly Magase Ai. Charming sociopaths/psychopaths are certainly a common theme, particularly in the role of villains, but Magase\'s superhuman ability to charm anyone with just a few words and her unrepentant acknowledgement of her own evil particularly intrigued me. I\'m always interested in looking into characters\' psyches, especially particularly aberrant ones like Magase\'s, to see what sort of things could push them to develop in a certain way. She has a power that could be used for good or evil, but she showed no hesitation in using it for the latter, and I had hoped that the anime might shed more light on why she was using it the way that she was, such as the motivations behind her collaboration with Itsuki, but that would turn out to be a futile hope. At best, she ends the story as a ""Joker""-like character, someone who simply wants to watch the world burn, but she lacks the characterization to give that assigned role any real believability.However, after episode 7, the anime just seems to go into free-fall without any concern for its quality and content. The rest of the anime seems rushed, with developments happening at an unrealistic rate, even taking into account the in-universe reason for them being possible. Furthermore, the ultimate definition of ""good"" and ""evil"" that the anime presents is far too childish. While the ending does make sense on the surface, the anime fails to delve into the the characters, their motivations, and the true complexity of the matter at hand.Instead, the writers seem to simply go for cheap thrills over the measured, deep complexity that characterized the first half of the anime. For example, the episode 12 post-credits scene is certainly important to reveal a key aspect of the interactions and relationship between Magase and Seizaki, but the way that it is presented to the viewers feels like it was done for the shock value and results in more confusion than anything else. It simply introduces another loose end of the many that were already remaining. So many questions about the plot and characters remain unanswered, leaving the watcher unsatisfied. I don\'t have an issue with open-ended endings that encourage the viewer to think and draw their own conclusions (which would probably have been appropriate for this show), but this was not that type of ending. at first, introducing a new special district, in which a newly elected mayor, Itsuki Kaika, breaks with traditional political parties and implements a new, highly controversial law against a backdrop of several mysterious suicides.

She has a power that could be used for good or evil, but she showed no hesitation in using it for the latter, and I had hoped that the anime might shed more light on why she was using it the way that she was, such as the motivations behind her collaboration with Itsuki, but that would turn out to be a futile hope. At best, she ends the story as a ""Joker""-like character, someone who simply wants to watch the world burn, but she lacks the characterization to give that assigned role any real believability.However, after episode 7, the anime just seems to go into free-fall without any concern for its quality and content. The rest of the anime seems rushed, with developments happening at an unrealistic rate, even taking into account the in-universe reason for them being possible. Furthermore, the ultimate definition of ""good"" and ""evil"" that the anime presents is far too childish. While the ending does make sense on the surface, the anime fails to delve into the the characters, their motivations, and the true complexity of the matter at hand.Instead, the writers seem to simply go for cheap thrills over the measured, deep complexity that characterized the first half of the anime. For example, the episode 12 post-credits scene is certainly important to reveal a key aspect of the interactions and relationship between Magase and Seizaki, but the way that it is presented to the viewers feels like it was done for the shock value and results in more confusion than anything else. It simply introduces another loose end of the many that were already remaining. So many questions about the plot and characters remain unanswered, leaving the watcher unsatisfied. I don\'t have an issue with open-ended endings that encourage the viewer to think and draw their own conclusions (which would probably have been appropriate for this show), but this was not that type of ending.', 'LAZYthis is such a badly executed and directed anime, this anime wishes to create a female version of Johan Liebert, a charismatic female who is complex but the issue is this anime has been tried out before.everything is textbook, that\'s the main issue, this anime is unbelievably lazy, there is nothing refreshing.Magase is brought to station to get questioned and during the conversation, she mentions how the name of the Main Character is about justice (textbook and pathetic attempt at hinting the message of the show to the audience), then she says she will cooperate if the MC talks to him about his personal life...(textbook example to make the villain be an existential and identity crisis for the MC), then she just suddenly disappears from a police station (textbook example to make the villain and hero\'s confrontation a cliffhanger for the later episode)you get the point!if i (somebody who doesn\'t know shit about screen writing and anime making) can point out such an obvious copy pasted writing in this anime then there is no hope.this anime keeps making its secondary characters to keep saying ""is suicide that bad"", ""maybe we should just kill ourselves"",...HOW LAZY CAN YOU BE?do not watch this pure crap, doesn\'t worth it (textbook example to make the villain be an existential and identity crisis for the MC), then she just suddenly disappears from a police station (textbook example to make the villain and hero\'s confrontation a cliffhanger for the later episode)you get the point!if i (somebody who doesn\'t know shit about screen writing and anime making) can point out such an obvious copy pasted writing in this anime then there is no hope.this anime keeps making its secondary characters to keep saying ""is suicide that bad"", ""maybe we should just kill ourselves"",...HOW LAZY CAN YOU BE?do not watch this pure crap, doesn\'t worth it', ""What is justice?How do we determine what's good and evil?Is suicide right or wrong?Can people with different views understand each other?These are the core topics presented to us in Babylon and give the anime meaning, something not found very often in today’s shows, making it stand head and shoulders above most anime. Talking about a serious matter like suicide and trying to justify it being moral is a huge task, and Babylon does not disappoint. It does this by having our characters justify their position in a political and legal manner, rather than in a pure moral one. Throughout the show, you will be...coming up with complex explanations defending your stance on suicide. This allows the viewers to feel, to a certain degree, involved in the series.So, is Babylon good or bad?Well, despite what most people say, Babylon is an anime that is well executed in that it possesses compelling characters, an intriguing plot, but unfortunately, an unsatisfying ending, which is something I will get to later. Now, I am someone who didn’t enjoy Promised Neverland, another thriller mystery anime. I tend to gravitate towards seinen, which is what Babylon is, rather than shonen (Promised Neverland). So, don’t expect to see over the top characters who are extremely intelligent and possesses genius level IQs. Instead, you’re getting yourself into a gritty, dark, and at times uncomfortable series where not everything goes how you want it to.So, let’s begin.Story: 10/10The main story starts off cliché and predictable: a couple of investigators discover a government conspiracy concerning Japan’s newly formed Shiniki district of Tokyo that is meant to be an experimental city of sorts. However, the end of the first episode suggests something larger is at hand and the reason for it all is a mysterious and seductive woman named Ai Magase who can make a person commit suicide thinking it’s “good” just by speaking to them as well as when Itsuki, the newly elected mayor of Shiniki, legalizes suicide and is in cohorts with Ai. Throughout the series we watch our protagonist, Zen Seizaki, question what justice is to him as he begins to fall from grace due to many traumatic events. The key elements within the story are the thriller and philosophical moments. There will be episodes that remind me of Overlord where it’s just a character or two thinking about the situation, trying to come up with an answer to the dilemma they are presented: is the right to die good or bad? Now, at first, you’ll there’s no way someone can justify suicide. Well, that’s where you’re mistaken, Babylon discusses suicide like an investigation: you need proof or evidence of why suicide is immoral. This makes it difficult, as there is little to no evidence in famous texts like the Bible supporting the idea that suicide is a sin. Another aspect to consider is that many people tend to categorize the first half of the show as a thriller, whereas the second half is more philosophical as it turns to the political situation regarding the suicide law and focuses on the President of the United States and how he deals with the ongoing debate over the suicide law. Now, the change in mood isn’t entirely false, however, there are still very exciting moments that get your blood pumping such as the last episode towards the end. Now you’re thinking: “I thought you said the ending sucked?” Time to address that. To put it simply, the ending of the series is too open-ended and ambiguous. While we certainly can assume what occurred and most likely we would be right, we don’t get to see this play out, therefore we never truly know whether we’re right or not. While still thrilling, this results in an anticlimactic feel to the end of the show. There are times I like ambiguous endings, however, when the aspect that is left open-ended is a game changer, it becomes difficult interpret the message being sent to the audience. There are also some plot holes that, if cleared up, would greatly enhance the story by allowing us to gain a better understanding of certain characters. These plot holes could’ve been addressed easily, even if it meant straying from the source material, and would’ve given us more time to spend with characters we are supposed to care about. Overall, Babylon’s plot is top tier and is the highlight of the series.Art: 8/10In the very first scene we are shown several prosecutors/investigators barging into a pharmaceutical company’s office to confiscate documents and place certain people under arrest. Now, at first glance I wasn’t into the art style at all. It wasn’t until Ai Magase’s character design was revealed and the background art became very exotic that I appreciated the art. In the show, it is said that even her presence is so seductive it makes people feel violated, and the animation shows that perfectly. Her walk is captivating, her face is cute yet mature, not full of innocence, her body is that of a model’s yet still possesses curves. Essentially, the art makes the idea that Ai can seduce anyone with a whisper into killing themselves believable. Put simply, the art feels mature with its art style, which makes the plot feel more serious and realistic when the characters look their age while also being distinguishable from others. While not at the level of certain studios, Babylon certainly doesn’t disappoint.Sound: 8/10Starting off with the music in Babylon, it can be said that the opening, while unique and gets you ready for the thriller, is extremely short. However, this is a pro rather than a con because it sets the mood with as little time as possible. On the other hand, none of the OPs or EDs are memorable in the traditional manner. The OST itself does a fine job in establishing the serious nature of the events, it can either be fast paced or slowed down in order to establish a different tone. Interesting enough, the studio does this without blasting it in ears. Moving on to the voice acting, our two main characters have the best voices: Zen sounds experienced but not old, which is part of his character, Ai has a cute and soft voice that, once again, could seduce anyone in the world. Even more so, Ai’s voice, whenever heard, can make the viewer uncomfortable as it almost always sounds like she’s violating you, even if she’s speaking as normal as possible, thus, allowing the plot developments to feel authentic. So, I must applaud Ai’s VA, Satsuki Yukino, for putting on a remarkable performance.Characters: 7/10While this score is the lowest of the bunch, by no means are the characters lacking in any manner. Instead, it’s because the series is only 12 episodes long and is more plot focused that the show’s characters don’t receive as much development, other than Ai, Zen, and Alexander Wood. Even though the Ai is developed tremendously well, the story doesn’t delve too deep into her backstory and origin other than a single episode and her constant references of RPGs. The lack of an origin story results in us questioning the cause for Ai’s motivation to be understood as an evil person; that different people can come to understand one another. Now, this seems crazy and incomprehensible in our eyes and we are quick to dismiss it. That's the point. We are unable to understand Ai's motivation because we are different, however, we begin to understand the point she's trying to make, and the final episode does this perfectly. In addition, it can be inferred that her seductive ability is not some supernatural power but rather just her being proficient in that area, however, it might’ve been nice if the show made it clear as many viewers have criticized it for not being explained. However, Ai is still one of my favorite villains of all time because of how much I despise her, yet at the same time she’s not written cheaply like those bully archetypes who exist to make the MC’s life hell for no good reason. Instead, Ai has a reason, while cliché, it works due to the theme and symbolism of Zen representing good, and Ai representing evil. Our last main character is the Alexander Wood, who is introduced in a very strange and unexpected manner where it goes through his backstory of him being a shut-in playing RPGs, eventually meeting his gorgeous wife, and how he’s decided that the only way to solve something is to think until he arrives at an answer he is comfortable with, like why his wife decided to marry him and the suicide law. While he’s not charismatic in the traditional way, he can be very convincing with his manner of speaking and ideas. He doesn’t hold any predisposed beliefs regarding the suicide law, instead he says he will support it if it’s good and oppose it if it’s bad. The supporting cast mainly revolves around Zen’s squad of prosecutors who you will come to like because of their likable personalities like the laid back Shinobu Kujiin and the calm and collected Hiasa Sekuro. Now, for the most part they’re static, however, there are times where their character is developed, such as their morals or beliefs allowing them to not feel flat by having them stand opposed to the suicide law. While generic and easy, the fact that they address this tells us this person is not just Squad Member A but that there’s at least some personality within them. However, the supporting cast is quite small due to having only 12 episodes, but still avoids making them flat when most writers would fail.Enjoyment: 10/10To be honest, your enjoyment depends on how much of a fan you are of the seinen genre and your ability to be open about not suicide necessarily, but that someone has a different opinion than regarding suicide. I say this because I have heard many people say that no sane person would ever justify suicide in a moral debate, well this is politics and the people arguing in the show require organized arguments that contain some sort of evidence, whether it be pathos, ethos, or logos. This turns out to be more difficult than expected because the counterargument that supports suicide has rebuttals prepared for common arguments that most of us come up with, promptly shutting us down as a result. In this debate, we cannot simply say “suicide is wrong because it’s immoral and messed up”, instead, we need evidence and validity. So, how did I enjoy it? I loved every second of it, other than the open-ended ending. Also, the it wasn’t the last episode that was poor, it was more so the last 3 minutes, as everything up to that point had me at the edgy of my seat, yelling “oh s**t, oh s**t, oh s**t!” I am a huge fan of the seinen genre and seeing how formidable a challenge Zen must overcome is gripping because we don’t know if he’ll succeed. The show itself is unpredictable, but it never feels like the writer is making it up as he goes along so you can’t predict anything. Instead, you will come close with your prediction, only to get one aspect wrong and seeing how unexpectedly the events turn out. Not to mention the moral and philosophical debate regarding suicide is engaging. While most of us know what the right answer is, Babylon presents a “what-if” if you will and executes that hypothetical perfectly. I had extremely fun watching and I plan on watching it again despite the poor ending. Before I wrap this up, I want to clear up a misconception about the ending: the problem lies in the ambiguity and a decision that makes us frustrated. You could edit the last 2 minutes ever so slightly and the result would be perfect in terms of theme, character motivation, and our understanding of the situation.Overall, Babylon is tremendously underrated, I was planning on giving this anime a 10/10 but due to it being unclear whether the source material will get a 4th volume or not as well the poorly executed ending, I had to drop a point, giving it a 9/10. However, a second season or some sort of special to revise or clear up the ending can easily make this a 10 if done well enough. I am not one of those people who believe an ending can make or break a series, I believe that is conceited because it is essentially a small percentage of the whole show and disregards everything the anime did up to that point. While a good ending can certainly improve the quality of a show, it doesn’t send it to the stratosphere. There are also some comparisons to its style to that of Death Note. While mostly true, it is a lot less overblown and focuses solely on one side rather than both. Babylon is like Death Note in that in each episode it focuses on a single issue only for it to evolve into another one, therefore ending on a cliffhanger to make you continue watching. So, do you like seinen? Do you like thrillers? How about themes? Symbolism? If so, go watch Babylon, if not you’re probably better off watching something like Promised Neverland. coming up with complex explanations defending your stance on suicide. This allows the viewers to feel, to a certain degree, involved in the series.So, is Babylon good or bad?Well, despite what most people say, Babylon is an anime that is well executed in that it possesses compelling characters, an intriguing plot, but unfortunately, an unsatisfying ending, which is something I will get to later.

I got a lot of what I tend to look for in a show of this genre although minor issues here or there holds me back from giving it a perfect score.The story follows the protagonist, Zen Seizaki as he tries to get to the bottom of a case he is currently working on but as he finds one answer, more questions start to pop up in it\'s place and soon the story turns into finding the person responsible for the string of events happening in the Shiniki district. This makes for...a very compelling game of cat and mouse between Seizaki and the antagonist. This was probably my favorite part of the show as every week I was eagerly looking forward to what crazy turns would occur as I watched Babylon. At the end of the seventh episode a certain event happens and then from the next episode onward, the focus of the show changes to the concept of what constitutes good and evil. I don\'t think this shift is necessarily bad as it was introduced earlier in the show and it formed the basis behind how Seizaki and the protagonist interacted. However at that point in the show you realize all the previous seven episodes were just a really long prologue and then you begin to worry if the show will be able to conclude in a satisfactory manner. By the end, my worries were abated for the most part although maybe I wasn\'t all that impressed with how the religious symbolism was done. I was surprised with the ending that we got but was also appreciative of it as well.The art of Babylon was solid and this type of show doesn\'t really need amazing animation. There are however, several well directed cuts of animation that help enhance the scenes in which they were in. Most of those being scenes where the antagonist is on the screen and is displaying her ""power"".The soundtrack is great and does a fine job of building a tense and eerie environment for Babylon. I also thought how the soundtrack was directed along with the sound effects was well done.The characters in Babylon are fine with not much to complain about. The standout character by far in my opinion though, is the antagonist of the story. She is quite the intriguing villain although one can certainly argue that her character is a double-edged sword for the show. The characteristics of her ""power"" is what makes her so dangerous and interesting, but because everything else in the show remains relatively grounded in reality, the believability of the story is lessened slightly. Also for better or for worse, the show doesn\'t do much in removing the mystique behind the antagonist\'s ""power""Babylon is an anime I got a lot of enjoyment from and although I have a strong feeling that enjoyment won\'t be universal here, I think the show is done well enough to warrant a recommendation from me.With this show alongside Seikaisuru Kado, Mado Nozaki(the original creator) now has two stories in his collection that I enjoyed.

I look forward to future adaptations of his work or even just reading those works myself eventually.', 'Started with good art and seemingly an interestingly story, then it developed as something not quite right on its own idea, as you never get to know if it is fantasy, Science fiction or a medical thriller. It has some gruelling parts, on one episode, with a quite unnecessary cruel scene, given the ""powers""of the strange villain making that scene just a twisted fanservice to gore lovers, and in the end it got really lost, with a particular confuse philosophical idea, and an end which has no reason nor real purpose, which was not a real end.The character motivations, especially the villainess, are never really...explained nor have any logic or connection, and the last characters were nearly senselles, like the US President.I really regret having started it, and aside the art, which is good but not ground breaking, this is a totally forgetable piece, without any sense, purpose or logic, not even in entertainment value terms.I watched it to its end trying to get the idea of the series, but it was just wasting of time at the end.And the conclusion is, Humanity there would be extinct in a decade or so, just because of the villainness, which has no purpose nor objectives other than bring death with her powers, which work even via electronic means. Just a simple Live Speach would have brought MILLIONS to death, as no one was able to withstand her.

It\'s a compelling, tense drama that poses interesting moral and philosophical questions about justice, suicide, and how we decide what\'s right and wrong. Stop after episode 7.The rest is babby\'s first philosophy, and the conclusions are insanely stupid. Imagine having an international policy summit where no world leader present knows what the train dilemma is. Then a second analogy has to be made to explain the morality of the train dilemma further. That\'s a real thing that happens in this show.Babylon is excellent up to a point. It had tons of potential...tossed unceremoniously out the window in the third act, which was jam-packed with lame analogies and moral relativism under the guise of political drama. Good and evil are reduced to ""living is good, and dying is bad"" because it aligns with the villain\'s morality.Much like B: the Beginning\'s garbage ending ruined everything that preceded it, Babylon\'s conclusion takes the wind out of the sails of what should have been a tense, climactic, and shocking ending. You have to sit through several episodes of brainlet-tier philosophizing to get to a conclusion that is ultimately pointless. tossed unceremoniously out the window in the third act, which was jam-packed with lame analogies and moral relativism under the guise of political drama.

When implemented correctly, you get Johan Liebert from Naoki Urusawa\'s Monster, one of the most prolific embodiments of evil in anime history! When done correctly, the quintessence of said character can come to reflect the hopelessness, and often powerlessness, of the audience. Despite the naysayers of the series, Babylon was able to poke that specific agitation in my own soul, and did much more than I could have anticipated!⚠️ It\'s difficult to explain why I loved all of the series, as well as the controversial ending, so I will put up hazard signs...when I dig into the pit of ice cream that serves as my justification for it ⚠️—Story/CharactersThe single cour adaptation of the best-selling novel series, written by Mado Nozaki, starts off strong with a noir investigation underfoot. As the series progresses, Zen Seizaki\'s revelations become more and more shocking, as he pulls the veil off of the ever-illustrious and evil, Ai Magase. In the bone-chilling investigation of her disposable alias, Magase plays mind games with her interrogators. The scene where Magase mocks Inspector Seizaki\'s first name ""Zen"", still sticks clearly in my brain. He explains that the characters (禅) have a righteous meaning, causing Magase to giggle, saying, ""Why would ever name your child that?""Throughout the series, Magase constantly inverts Seizaki\'s expectations and renders him incompetent, in an attempt to break his will. Her voice instantly drives men mad with desire, but it doesn\'t work on Zen. Towards the ending of the series, we are introduced to the President of the United States. An introspective man, who is highly empathetic and gets lost in his own thoughts, who believes Inspector Seizaki\'s narrative. The President is more susceptible to Zen\'s paranoia towards Magase, after experiencing a growing sentiment to legalize suicide in the States. Death being something that Magase can easily manipulate a normal person into lusting after.The ending has the partnership of the President and Seizaki fall through when Magase\'s entrancing powers work on the American President, after she tempts him with the Fruit of Knowledge. Valuing his perspicaciousness as much as his own family, Alexander W. Wood is mentally dominated by Magase\'s allure, giving in because of the sympathy he feel towards her. While, Zen Seizaki is able to stay ardent in his hatred towards Magase\'s evil, he finally surrenders and commits suicide in the end.On Alexander W. Wood, many people thought that the North American chapter of the story dragged and while it was relatively slow-paced, we got to know the ins and outs of the President\'s personality. And because of the glance into his daily life, I almost cried when he sacrificed himself in the last episode. I think I was sad over it, too, because I have a similar over-thinking, introverted type of personality, so I understood the President on more of a deeper level than most.—Why Does the Virtuous Zen Seizaki Kill Himself?1. In Episode 7, Ai Magase says that there\'s always a reason for evil.2. Zen is put in a situation where he is forced to kill the president, for the greater good of society.3. Realizing that what Magase said was true, Inspector Seizaki realizes that after committing evil himself. His existence is rendered hypocritical. His stance on purging the evils from the world, then included himself.The final scene was very controversial and had a lot of people online saying that it was stupid, but (in a literary sense), it connected perfectly with what I think makes a great story. Ai Magase was so evil, that she was able to subvert the logic of the most strait-laced, Japanese man. The adaptation isn\'t perfect, but it ennobles the theme and the essence of the Whore of Babylon. Though cynical, it\'s an interesting analysis on the nature and existence of evil.—Biblical Similarities Between Ai Magase and the Whore of Babylon:""And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication""Book of Revelation, Chapter 17:4Commentary: The scarlet part is interesting, because at the climax of the series, Ai Magase is naturally shown having a purple color scheme, and scarlet strands in her hair.""And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration""Book of Revelation, Chapter 17:6""And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space""Book of Revelation, Chapter 17:10Commentary: Zen Seizaki and President Alexander W. Wood can be seen as martyrs. President Wood is even established as a Christian and reads the Bible religiously. People often interpret the ""kings"" in the Bible to be equivocated with our modern-day leaders.""And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth""Book of Revelation, Chapter 17:18Commentary: It is implied that Ai Magase is puppet-mastering the Prime Minister of Japan to pass the suicide legislation, with her alms of temptation. It is unclear whether the Prime Minister is meant to be an Antichrist-type figure, or just a fallen king.Finally, I had a few debates online with people saying that the femme fatale stereotype that Ai Magase is personifying is sexist to women. My response, as someone born female, is this:1. Biblically, The Whore of Babylon is the apocalyptic version of the Jezabel spirit, right? She promiscuous and promotes sinfulness by temptation, just as Eve did in the Garden of Eden.2. If you\'re not religious, you can think of her character in terms of a mythological archetype. Saying that the Whore of Babylon is offensive because she\'s a sexually evocative spirit, is like saying that Mordred Pendragon is an offensive stereotype because he\'s angry, irreverent, and exudes the spirit of toxic masculinity.—TechnicalKiyotaka Suzuki (director), notable works:* FLCL Alternative* Infini-T Force* Psycho-Pass 2Commentary: I consider Mr. Suzuki to be a relatively good director, I still remember scenes very clearly from Psycho-Pass 2 and Infini-T Force, unfortunately, the scripts and the budgets that he\'s been given... have been considerably awful.Jin Aketagawa (sound director), notable works:* AKB0048* Aldnoah.Zero* Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, a.k.a.

It\'s not very often that we are able to see Biblical mythos being used as anything more than a tagline or an extended metaphor for something or another, in Japanese fiction it\'s very rare to see such a direct religious interpretation. From what I can tell, out of anime that I\'ve seen, this is the closest series that resembles something like The Omen or Rosemary\'s Baby.

It tries to be both a serious political/philosophical drama and a detective thriller and it fails at both.The detective vs serial killer thriller route fails because the main character is never given a chance to solve the mystery. We have an interesting premise to stew on for way too short an amount of time before a group of politicians literally sits the MC down to give him all the answers, including the identity and abilities of the main villain. The villain, their past, and their powers don't fit...in to the world of the story and are never explained.The political/philosophical drama fails because it's all fake-deep. The show focuses more on politics as it progresses, and with that comes several rounds of debates between world leaders. A show this dialogue-heavy should really have invested more brainpower into actually writing interesting dialogue. Instead, we sit through mind-numbing ramblings of characters who apparently only discovered introductory philosophy the day before (they beat the trolley problem to death) and are high off the fumes of their own self-importance. One politician becomes obsessed with defining good vs evil; his conclusion, reached through agonizing episodes of deliberation, is so bad it was actually hilarious.These two story aspects are thrown haphazardly together and don't mesh at all. Both sides of the story, already poorly written on their own, are even weaker for having been combined. in to the world of the story and are never explained.The political/philosophical drama fails because it's all fake-deep.

It is also the tale of an implausible, excruciating, and above all evil woman, who wishes for nothing more than to turn the world and the man's heart into a dark and broken mirror of her own twisted desires.Ai Magase is...Love twisted into its most evil form. She is lust made manifest, and she revels in her own wickedness. If Zen represents the ego, then Ai is nothing but pure id. And it would seem her goal was to consume the super-ego and become a sort of super-id for the entire human race. To face her is to have your morality challenged by the intoxicating promise of absolute pleasure. To face her, means to face the temptation of death.The way the story unfolds is slow and methodic, but also unrelenting. There is no breathing room, there is no respite. Tension runs throughout the entire plot, from the second Ai's shadow enters the world until the very last scene, and just when you think you've finally been released, she is there, waiting in the shadows, ready to twist the knife again. There is no happy ending to this story.When confronted by absolute evil, all that Zen can do is to keep the light of hope from dying a little longer, by throwing his own life away so that the entire world may live. He is not alone in this, but as one by one the champions of good fall, he is left with the impossible task of shouldering their weight and his own sins against an enemy he can neither stop nor understand.In an era like ours, where the very pillars of morality we share as a species would threaten to crumble, Ai Magase is there to topple them one by one, while Zen is left with the choice to use his own body as the foundation atop which the people of this new world may rebuild. In the end, he realizes what's right is to throw away his own life in order to save countless others, even if doing so would stand in direct opposition to his original goal.Such paradox is the crux of Babylon. Committing murder is evil, and committing suicide is not any less wrong, but choosing to die so that others may live is the most virtuous thing a man can do. It is the path of a saint.Ai, Zen, and the whole of Babylon will linger in the back of my mind for a long time to come, giving me much to think about. Thankfully, I can take my time, but when I do come to a conclusion, I'll make sure to let you know. Love twisted into its most evil form. She is lust made manifest, and she revels in her own wickedness. If Zen represents the ego, then Ai is nothing but pure id. And it would seem her goal was to consume the super-ego and become a sort of super-id for the entire human race. To face her is to have your morality challenged by the intoxicating promise of absolute pleasure.

I dont understand what was the need for this anime.After what ai did to his partners we wished she...would die a painful death and thats why i kept on watching this anime but NO they fucking killed the hero in the last, WHY?? only the writer knows why he wrote such a fucked up storyBut it was consistent in being fucked up after ep 3 so thats something we should learn from it would die a painful death and thats why i kept on watching this anime but NO they fucking killed the hero in the last, WHY?? only the writer knows why he wrote such a fucked up storyBut it was consistent in being fucked up after ep 3 so thats something we should learn from it', 'Phylosophical judgment for myself:Most of people didn\'t seem to catch the actual message of the story and think Babylon is some kind of pro-suicide propaganda made unintentionally or intentionally. I\'m not trying to deny it has plot holes tho.Babylon tries to explain why suicide is bad, not with the subjectiveness and phylosophical relativity of morals, but with logic and natural laws. Of course, it fails on developing that message since it\'s challenging (incorrect and impossible to find I would say) to find an absolute answer to ""why suicide is bad"" since it depends on the situation and the logic applied will always be contradictory, just...like the example in the story: Is it bad to commit suicide if with this you save a life? If someone else needs a transplant, heart for example, is it bad to give your life to save him? Is that person and its descendants going to use their lifes better than mine if I choose to live and not to save him? Because, if suicide is bad because the meaning of life is to keep evolving and developing, which would be the right choice? Babylon tries to explain something unexplainable and that\'s why it fails, but at least tries to think a logical answer in a world where people follow the morals without asking themselves why they do. like the example in the story: Is it bad to commit suicide if with this you save a life?

I decided to write one as I think it is one of the hidden gems and I wanted to indicate my reasoning for it. Although, If you are a type of anime watchers who likes clear and cut answers that is nicely plated for you, I suppose this is not the anime for you.I have written so that it is absolutely spoiler free. If you want to read my review including the spoiler, I suppose you can scroll down for a bit.In my opinion, I find the story,...art, and sound to be spectacular. The story is written in a way so that it makes the viewers think as they watch but also keeping them on edge in anticipation of what to come next. The art, animation and music was executed beautifully in a way that it really draws you in to that scene. As for the character, I didn\'t feel that there was any significant character developments despite all the questioning that the anime threw at the MC (and us viewers). The characters did reach an answer but I did not feel that the answer caused some character development.The finale, which I\'m sure a lot of viewers are hanged up on, left us with many questions unanswered. But all of that is story-focused questions such as ""What happened in the end?"", ""Why did that have to happen?"", etc. While I believe that it will be nice if those questions are answered, I don\'t find those questions to be crucial. The core of this anime is lies in making us think. To make us keep on thinking about it. The characters reached an answer, but I believe that is only one of the potential answers. To keep us thinking even after the finale of the anime, that final scene existed: to make us think whether that really is the answer.I don\'t even know if this review is making sense, but I do hope that people will give it a try.REVIEW WITH SPOILERSSo, the core of the questions that was being thrown at us is ""What is good? What is bad?"". The MC reached the conclusion that ""good"" is ""to continue"" and that ""bad"" is ""to end"". But, is that all there is to it? In the finale, the MC shot Alex to prevent the world from thinking that suicide is a ""good"" thing. For the ""good"" of the world, the MC did something ""bad"". Then, we are shown with Magase still alive. If she is alive, does that she is ""good""? I\'m sure that most of us disagree with that. In the end, the anime gave us one potential answer to the question of ""What is good? What is bad?"" but meanwhile making us continue thinking if that really is the case. That is precisely the point. In that regard, I think this anime is spectacular.Yes, there are many unanswered questions such as ""What is Magase\'s power? Why does she have that?"".

Although I don\'t recommend you watch this show, spoilers will be mentioned in the event that you choose to do so. This will also be long as I have a lot of feelings after viewing Babylon.There are very few times that an anime can elicit a significant emotional reaction from me. If an anime can make me laugh until it hurts or cry until I can\'t anymore, I know it\'s something special. In the case of Babylon, my significant emotional reaction almost made me put my fist through my monitor. Not even Charlotte in all of its terribleness has...made me this heated.Babylon is one anime that on every technical level, sells. The art and backgrounds are excellent, and help to bolster the generally okay animation. The soundtrack is absolutely kickass and subtly boosts every scene with a feeling of adrenaline. Whether that adrenaline comes from exhilaration at an action scene or anxiety at the unknown showcases the expert craft and how effective an OST can be in making or breaking an anime. The cinematography was also pretty good. In a series with a lot of grey and white tones, you need that little extra to keep your viewers\' attention glued to the screen.The first six or so episodes are expertly crafted. With an eerie, almost placid quality to the likes of Terror in Resonance, the anime draws you in. The first episode wastes no time in presenting the dilemma at hand. A doctor is found dead of an apparent anesthesia overdose, or was it? Past experience in such mysteries would indicate that the man was murdered, which is only confirmed by the presence of two people seen on a security camera shortly before his death.The series then takes a sudden and shocking turn by killing off one of the supposed protagonists right at the end of episode one. Still, you are convinced something happened to him and the intrigue keeps you going until you reach the end of episode three and you desperately want to know how the deaths of dozens of people can all be linked back together. This pace is kept up to episode six, and the political thriller becomes a deftly woven web of cat and mouse between the investigation unit and the duo-team of a young politician and a mysterious woman.Then episode seven happens. An episode that I can only compare on equal setup to The Tragedy from the Danganronpa franchise. In one series, a girl convinces people to kill each other; in the other, she convinces people to kill themselves. All this to cause despair. For all intents and purposes, these episodes are exactly the same. It\'s at this point that we conclusively see that the mysterious woman is one of the most psychotic anime characters ever to twistedly grace the silver screen.So after all this, why did I give this the lowest score I\'ve ever given an anime? To be perfectly blunt, this might be one of the single most offensive examples of fiction that I have ever seen, not just including anime. In fact, I was so thoroughly incensed by this, that I\'m not even sure where to start.I think the first thing I can think of right off the bat is the entire moral problem the show tries to discuss, or the concept of legalized suicide through the idealized lens of freedom. In episode six, the main opponents of ""The Suicide Law"" as it\'s put, discuss why legally endorsing such a practice would be wrong, and the (at this point) supposed primary antagonist rattles off a bunch of weak arguments, which is then subsequently treated as him ""fighting off all the main points.""Are you fucking kidding me? That\'s it? You have an insane argument that some lunatic is making through the veneer of moral neutrality and you as critical thinkers can\'t come up with any rebuttals? What kind of politicians are you? Then the asshole goes into a big grandstanding of moral preaching of how ""the option of suicide is good actually because then we can have organ donors!"" Yes, this is actually an argument made that is presented as completely sound and rational and not like it\'s being made from an institutionalized patient. (Also ""parallels"" to legally assisted suicide are made to both homosexuality and the legalization of marijuana as if it\'s just a society\'s change of morals just as another fyi).The characters in this show have such baffling reasonings behind their positions, that I can\'t even continue with the logic behind them. So much so that I found myself screaming, ""Real people don\'t fucking think like this! This isn\'t how the real world works!"" I mean, how can anyone that isn\'t a nihilist think that the legalization of literal suicide drugs would be a net positive for society?Any reasonable person who watches this will come to the completely normal conclusion that suicide is universally bad for everyone involved. But yet the show tries to question what good and bad are so that they can hamfistedly answer if the concept of legally assisted suicide is good or not, only to state objectively that if something is good, it continues, and if it\'s bad, it ends. Bullshit. Plenty of evil things in this world still continue and plenty of good comes out of the ending of bad things. (I also found this entire scene incredibly ironic since I had just recently discussed Euthyphro\'s dilemma about goodness in my philosophy class and about how hard it was to come to a solution. The idea that objectivity could be found in a philosophical concept like this is laughable).Speaking of evil things still continuing, let\'s talk about the mysterious woman. It\'s heavily implied from episode six onward that she is a supernatural being of some sort, being able to convince people to off themselves with nothing more than a few words. By episode eleven, the anime\'s title comes to light and aptly compares her to the Whore of Babylon, something that only then seems to make perfect sense since she visibly seems to have been the anthropomorphization of suicidal thoughts and the euphoria at the resolve to die. Not only that, but just like the suicides, she had no rational motivation. At. All.We never find out why she wanted to do any of this. Why she wreaked so much havoc and destroyed so many lives. It is completely chalked up to the psychopathic nature of her being. The writing of the second half of this series is so bad that the previously interesting villain\'s primary motivation is completely handwaved. (We also never have any indication of what became of the Suicide Law. There is never a resolution).To be fair, we never get answers to a lot of things in this show. What started off as two simple prompts (What is good/bad? Is legalized suicide morally acceptable?), metastasized into an enormous mess of unanswered questions. This anime literally leaves you with more questions than it does answers, which to be fair wasn\'t hard to do because it didn\'t answer anything anyway. (Adding salt to the wound, neither of the initial prompts are answered either).(Also as an aside, the anime tries to take a religious approach to the concept of suicide and comes to the extremely offensive and wrong take that suicide should be a-ok in the eyes of Christians since the Bible never explicitly says anything about suicide and tries to play it off as investigative thinking. I\'d like to think that even non-religious or non-Christian people could come to the conclusion that Christians still view suicide as a form of murder and morally wrong. The idea that a supposedly ""strong"" ""Catholic"" character could even entertain the idea is repugnant and borderline blasphemous).Anything worth while the anime tried to build up comes crashing down and the viewer is left with the lingering sensation that trying to defeat suicidal thoughts is an impossible and ultimately meaningless task to pursue. I\'ve been fortunate enough to not have had such struggles, but I know people who have. To be told that nothing will ever be enough and death is the only euphoric solution is nothing short of heinous.Concluding this review, Babylon represents everything I hate. The disgusting and distortive take of liberty and freedom; the hopeless and bleak outlook on life and depression; perversion of societal morals; the complete lack of critical thinking; an utter disregard for meaningful storytelling, the list goes on. This show was an absolute waste of time, and I felt like absolutely nothing was gained from having watched it. It is not thought-provoking in any meaningful sense, and those who say it is are either lying or incredibly blinded to the spectacle.I apologize for the length, but I needed to get this off of my chest and there was no way that such a heavy topic was going to have a short and trite review.Thank you for reading.(And know that you are loved by someone in your life; suicide will never be the answer). made me this heated.Babylon is one anime that on every technical level, sells.

The idea that a supposedly ""strong"" ""Catholic"" character could even entertain the idea is repugnant and borderline blasphemous).Anything worth while the anime tried to build up comes crashing down and the viewer is left with the lingering sensation that trying to defeat suicidal thoughts is an impossible and ultimately meaningless task to pursue. I\'ve been fortunate enough to not have had such struggles, but I know people who have. To be told that nothing will ever be enough and death is the only euphoric solution is nothing short of heinous.Concluding this review, Babylon represents everything I hate. The disgusting and distortive take of liberty and freedom; the hopeless and bleak outlook on life and depression; perversion of societal morals; the complete lack of critical thinking; an utter disregard for meaningful storytelling, the list goes on. This show was an absolute waste of time, and I felt like absolutely nothing was gained from having watched it. It is not thought-provoking in any meaningful sense, and those who say it is are either lying or incredibly blinded to the spectacle.I apologize for the length, but I needed to get this off of my chest and there was no way that such a heavy topic was going to have a short and trite review.Thank you for reading.(And know that you are loved by someone in your life; suicide will never be the answer).', ""This will be a short one. So the show had a lot of potential, the first 3 episodes blew me away and made me want more, then when the law going world wide? no... just no. Honestly what made me not give as bad of an rating is because of the animation and the concept aswell as Ai Magase (mommy).What could've been done better? IDK (LOL) I watched this show knowing that its going to be visually appealing but pre shit in terms of the story, it had potential ok? But the author fumbled... like Kazuya (hehe) but fr tho who let him cookThe...anime had it's moments. It was like watching one of those tv shows, where you think you know what's going to happen next but it goes the other direction.

I haven\'t, but Bablyon poses this question anyways.Personally, I have never been quite conflicted about a show like I do with Babylon. At its best, Babylon is definitely a 9, but at its worst, it\'s probably a 5 or lower. This show has a heavy emphasis on philosophical themes like justice and ""what is the difference between good and evil,"" and my mere closeted weeaboo mind can only think so deeply. Nevertheless, despite having many interesting aspects, Babylon has noticeable flaws.Pros:The conflict between Zen Seizaki, the main protagonist, and Ai Magase, the main antagonist. This...conflict is the many focus in the first half of the show, and this is when the show really shines. Magase has a surprisingly little amount of screentime in the show, but her influence and threat is made so real and apparent through both the excellent voice acting and cinematography. The cat-and-mouse game between Zen and Magase makes the stakes much more interesting. Magase is a top tier villain despite having a superpower that remains unexplained for the entirety of the show. And Zen is a great counterpart to this villain.Cons:Philosophy mumbo jumbo. The show makes a sharp turn half way through and puts more focus on the philosophical elements of the plot. Characters just start to have talks about this stuff and kinda just sit around and think. This choice puts a screechingly halt on the intensity and excitement and basically forces you to read Plato\'s Republic. The show keeps hinting at a final answer to all the questions, but by the end, the answers are very unfulfilling. The show attempts to makes these ideas sound so deep, but in the end only simplifies these arguments and trivializes the idea of suicide.Some people claim that this show is an amazing crime thriller. Others may say it\'s kinda dumb. And in all honesty, it is both. It is very easy to either hate or love this show, but at the very least, Babylon provides a rather peculiar thought-provoking experience. conflict is the many focus in the first half of the show, and this is when the show really shines.

Anime will pass for a good psychological thriller that you\'re itching for after watching a lot of other boring anime.It starts out as a typical police procedural and then shifts into what seems to be one more decently produced ""crimes in high places"" mystery.By the end of Episode 3 we realize this show is going to be something else entirely....Production wise the animation and artwork are good.Recommended if you\'re looking for something to binge watch.Don\'t forget! The simping kills! Production wise the animation and artwork are good.Recommended if you\'re looking for something to binge watch.Don\'t forget! The simping kills!', 'What the hell was this show? A thriller? A mystery? A philosophical examination of morality? It failed at all of those things so I\'m not really sure. Babylon is like going into a college political theory class and expecting some deep insights into laws and the morality behind it, only for the professor to end up going off on a random tangent about the morality of slavery, or what qualifies as self defense, or whether we should have taxes.And that\'s just describes the philosophical sections of the show, which are the most prevalent in my mind right now; because if you started this show, you...wouldn\'t believe it has anything to do with that as it begins as a classic murder mystery. What starts out as an interesting discovery of a connection between several deaths and the creation of a new city to test new laws and its connection to several murders, quickly turns into the writer fervently jacking himself off as he creates intentionally bad arguments about suicide to have his villains break down, and even more quickly turns into the writer jacking himself off so hard he rips his dick out of his body as he examines the same boring, tired, and overused arguments as he creates new world leaders to talk about ""what is truly good and evil"" as if he just opened up a book written by Hobbes and he has to declare it out to the world.Philosophy is not bad, these discussions are not bad, but where is the story I was watching during episodes 1-6? Where is the intrigue, where is the character, where is the mystery and suspense? This shows falls once again into the same pitfalls that KATO (same author) did.The interesting premise you created at the start does not need to be sidelined in order to pose questions and discussion about interesting subjects, (those these subjects were pretty bad) these things can go hand in hand, but NOPE gotta do a complete 180 and take the story somewhere else entirely.

God bless u', 'I went into this series completely blind and have to say that I am pretty glad I did. The series revolves heavily around the concept of suicide which by all means is not an easy topic to address.The series starts out pretty strong with its first few opening episodes by establishing the world’s setting and characters. However, the story’s narrative did leave much to be desired The primus of analyzing suicide through a country’s legal system is certainly an interesting way to put this topic on display.At the beginning of the show, the main characters were put into a situation where they were...tasked with investigating a newly forming independent prefecture that was being established during a high profile political election. It was quickly addressed that this newly forming prefecture was being formed in order to circumvent the country’s legal system in an attempt to allow Japan to test out experimental laws/procedures that could not be implemented in a normal government structured society. Specifically, this new prefecture wanted to start the distribution of an experimental drug that induce death upon its consumption. Along with this the prefecture enacted a law that legalized suicide and this was the main starting point for the series.At this point in the story I was assuming the series was going to continue down the path of a legal/political debates that would eventually result in the main characters of the series not only trying to find the political members of this independent prefecture guilty of a crime but also ways to try and convict them. However the narrative devolves down the path of a conspiracy that revolves around one person somehow having the absurd ability to convince anyone to commit suicide simply with their presence which end up revolting around a series of mass suicides.The series definitely has a problem with keeping its focus during the series later half and this result in the series having a terrible ending. With all of that being said, I still did find this series quite entertaining and enjoyable as I watched through the series runtime. I really do find that the series presented the topic of suicide in a very interesting manner but it certainly could have been executed much better.If you find you can stomach watching a series that revolves around the concept of suicide and if you are interested in seeing a somewhat unique perspective on the concept, I think it may be worth giving this series a try if you are looking for something to watch. tasked with investigating a newly forming independent prefecture that was being established during a high profile political election.

Just skip this one if you think suicide as a topic might be triggering to you in any way.!This review will contain some spoilers!Babylon centers around Zen, a police officer that is following a case related to an upcoming election in the fictional Shiniki district. As it turns out, the...new major of the district is aiming to legalize suicide. Zen comes across a mysterious woman named Magase Ai who seems to be able to hypnotize people into taking their own lives.Babylon starts off super promising, well paced and intriguing. When I first started watching the first few episodes, I was immediately hooked and thought I had finally found the psychological murder mystery I had been looking for. This was, sadly, not the case.The story takes an immediate turn in episode 4 and after this, the topic of suicide turns into the main focus of the story. The show starts bringing in a philosophical aspect that questions the moral standpoint of taking one’s own life. What they were trying to do with this subject, I still have no idea.While I was sceptical of the new direction of the show, I was still mesmerized by the storytelling and suspense of the story, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and continued watching to see where they would take it.Up until episode 8 the show was still looking pretty promising to me. Despite the bizarre story, it was something new and unpredictable. The psychological thriller aspects also had its moments to shine and was executed in a way that made me feel a terror and adrenaline rush that I haven’t felt from an anime in ages. There were parts of the show that were so well made that I truly thought this might go on to be one of my favourites. This anticipation only made the fall worse once the show went downhill.Unfortunately in episode 8 everything takes a turn for the worse when international politics get introduced. The last four episodes of the show are mainly a try at a philosophical discussion on what is good and what it evil, and if committing suicide is morally right or not. It feels like the creators were trying to be really deep and controversial but it all just feels laughably stupid and frustrating. It feels like a dragged out debate on something that didn’t need to be debated in the first place. Why would the world’s leaders be discussing the moral aspect of suicide instead of looking at a way to reduce them? The fact that the topic of mental health is only brought up once (in the very last episode), in a show which main focus is suicide is just flat out riddiculus.In the end, the whole show just feels like propaganda. The conclusion to the questions that have been asked continuously throughout the show is vague but it still feels like you’re being told that “suicide is an okay way to go”. The last two episodes were just highly unsettling and felt like a big headache. It gave you the feeling of trying to be deep and philosophical while just spouting bullshit.The show left with way an unsatisfying ending and way too many loose ends. I think they were going for an “open ending” that would leave the viewer thinking about the show’s (disturbing and propaganda-like) message but after the mental strain this show put on my poor brain, I never want to think about it again. It left off in an unsatisfying way that left me with way too many questions.In conclusion this show was a rollercoaster that started off really promising and got gradually worse. It tried to be deep and new-thinking but just came across as disturbing pro-suicide propaganda once the story spiraled out of controll.Never has a show left me with this much frustration.

The discussion of suicide law, and good vs evil was stupid thereafter.I did enjoyed the show a lot, as I enjoy thriller and mystery show. I was hoping for a decent conclusion to the character of the evil woman, and better dialogues from her, which can justify how she drives people to suicide with few words. But it was not given.Don\'t waste time on this show. ', 'Forewarning, this review does contain some minor spoilers!With that out of the way, let me say this: I\'m disappointed. The story starts with a great bang, great twist at the end of the very first episode that draws you in, and consistently till episode 7 you will be just astounded by the main villain of the story and how mysterious but deadly they are. After Ep7 though, it all falls a bit flat.Unfortunately, the main villain seems to occupy only half of the story, the dynamic between them and the main cast will keep you intrigued but there is a second half to this anime...- Political intrigue mixed with philosophical discourse. Unfortunately that part is so unrealistic and so basic in it\'s own concept it just doesn\'t hold up. The main philosophical question of this series is supposed to be ""what is good"" and ""what is evil"", but unfortunately it centres that question on ""is suicide good"" and ""should it be legal"" (It actually IS legal at this moment in all the countries involved in this anime). And even though it mulls over an answer for that question for 12 episodes, you\'re only graced with vague pseudo-answer that adds nothing new to the table and coincidentally is absolutely wrong in some cases (speaking from medical perspective here).I\'m incredibly disappointed because it felt like there was something more to the story, something hiding behind the mystery of the main villain, a deep intrigue to be discovered and explored. But there\'s none of that. Visually and musically stunning, but lacks substance, it\'s essentially empty story-wise.You had my curiosity after first episode, you had my attention... And it didn\'t pay off at all... I\'m pretty sure every single employee of a suicide telephone helpline has a better story to tell than this anime. - Political intrigue mixed with philosophical discourse.

It spends hours hashing out whether or not suicide is the right moral choice, but, also skips over fundamental aspects of the story like telling you the motivations of the villain, Ai Magase.  It will spend entire episodes philosophically trying to determine the meaning of ""good vs. evil"", but doesn\'t even bother telling you what Ai is, or why she can do what she does to people.SPOILERS AHEAD... AND BEFORE I BEGIN: PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS ANIME IF YOU HAVE...A HISTORY OF SUICIDAL THOUGHTS OR WANT TO HARM YOURSELF. SEEK HELP.Babylon is a 12 episode discussion about a crisis facing Japan: Suicide.  This is framed within the opening of a new city in Japan called Shiniki.  A city established by powerful politicians with motives to create a better society unencumbered by regulations in Tokyo. But it\'s quickly hijacked by the politician they picked to be the Mayor: Kaika Itsuki. Itsuki, with Ai Magase (The main villain of the plot) quickly form a political suicide cult and pass a suicide law, allowing people to kill themselves with dignity.Herein lies the first problem, because the law sounds like it\'s making suicide legal, but how can you outlaw suicide in the first place? What are you going to do? Arrest the corpses?  So, you pretty much have to add your own logic to the plot here and just decide they\'re talking about assisted suicide, even though most of the people killing themselves are doing so without any assistance.In the midst of all this, the protagonist Zen, is drawn in.  What starts off as an investigation into the powerful politicians who violated the law to create Shiniki and manipulate its elections, quickly turns into Zen trying to find a way to take down Itsuki and Magase.  And that is where the anime shines.  Right in those middle episodes where it\'s more of a detective drama, with Zen and his team of prosecutors trying to find a way to bring down Itsuki and Magase, which is difficult as they can\'t prove they\'ve actually broken any laws by passing the law for dignified (assisted) suicide.This part of the anime was BRILLIANT, and I would put it on the same level as the anime ""Monster"" or the first season of ""Psycho Pass"".  It was tight, dramatic, mysterious and intriguing.  The investigators discover that Magase has the ability to influence people to commit suicide and desire death just by speaking to them. And they are determined to take her down, culminating in a tense standoff at a political debate over the Suicide Law.  These episodes were excellent.And then it went off the rails...Things start to go wrong in the aftermath of Zen\'s team trying to take matters into their own hands to stop Itsuki and Magase.  Things don\'t go as they plan, to say the least.  But, After these events and their fallout concludes, the story switches to the United States and starts following the President Alex Wood, instead of Zen.  The story shifts to more and more cities adopting the Suicide Law, and follows ""The Thinker"" doing WAY too much thinking, about how America is going to respond.The idea that a small, new city in Japan passing an (assisted) suicide law, would suddenly become a point of global concern that would include the UN, CIA and FBI was ludicrous.  As more cities began passing the law, it became less ludicrous, but they kept raising the bar of ridiculousness, going as far as having the Prime Minister of the UK threaten War against other countries if they supported laws allowing their OWN citizens to die. (What?) and having a scene where the President is called upon to talk a citizen of Shiniki down from the ledge of a building on live T.V.  Just super unrealistic for what was such an intelligent thriller.Still, it wasn\'t so bad that it destroyed the anime, but it definitely pulled it from the ranks of ""Monster"" and ""Psycho Pass"" easily.  But, the story really suffered from switching the focus from Zen to Wood.  It was a very odd choice to push the MC, chasing down a criminal, to the back of the anime to focus on the strained musings of a new, somewhat boring character. But, that\'s what they did.  Just very long conversations with the President talking to pastors, world leaders, Zen....mayors....his staff......his wife.......his kid......himself........a random stray cat.....about suicide and good and evil. For days, man. HE DID THIS FOR DAYS.In the midst of this, however, there\'s still Zen tracking down the ever mysterious and supernaturally powerful Magase.  It became a bit frustrating, as those parts were good, but they were so sparse, because the director felt we needed to see President Wood touch his nose for the 193rd time while saying ""Hmmmm..."". And what made it even more irritating is that after he would think for DAYS on something, he would get an epiphany that was totally mundane.  If you think for days about a problem, and then your ""Aha"" moment is: ""Wait, I don\'t have to worry about this at all, THEY can handle it!""? You\'re an idiot.  ""Thinker""? No. ""Idiot."".At any rate, it all comes to a head when the G7 come together to discuss the suicide laws, at the same time Itsuki convenes a summit between the 7 cities who passed the suicide laws in Shiniki. (Which leads to the aforementioned moment of the President talking the girl off the building.). Ai Magase makes her move against the President of the United States and that leads to a pretty shocking, but deeply unfulfilling conclusion and the biggest problem with Babylon: crucial elements of the story went completely unexplained.Who was Ai Magase?  You get the idea that they wanted you to think she was Lucifer in female form. Evil incarnate. And that\'s why she could merely whisper a suggestion to mankind, and make them kill themselves and could change her appearance completely. One problem with that: They ruined that explanation by having Zen meet her Uncle, so she was a normal human being.  So, exactly how could she do what she does as a normal human? Explain it.Why did Ai Magase do what she did?  What was her motivation?  They explained Itsuki\'s motivation through his Son, but what was the plan with her brainwashing other city leaders to pass this law?  They kept talking about Magase and Itsuki\'s grand global scheme, but it was never really revealed. Did Magase want the whole world to be under the suicide law and then convince everyone to kill themselves? If so, why? We don\'t know. What did she even want? Why even bother with a law when you can just whisper and get people to commit suicide with or without a law? Why did she target Zen? Just because his name meant ""Good""?All of this went unexplained because they tried to be ""clever"" with a Sopranos style ending. A stand off between Magase and Zen, that ends with a ""bang"" to black and a post-credit scene with Magase getting off of a bus later on.  I guess they did not get the memo that people did NOT like the way the Sopranos ended.  And this ending sucked, too.  What happened to Zen?  How did she escape?  Who was she? What the hell was it all for?!  I guess they\'ve left it up to us to figure out.  And that\'s just lazy storytelling cloaking itself in ""mystery"".In the end, this was an anime trying too hard to be intelligent and philosophical, and forgot to perform the basic tenants of story telling.  It\'s like if Plato couldn\'t walk and chew bubblegum at the same time.  It\'s disappointing really, because if they just kept this in Japan, had Zen and Magase work towards a final standoff inside of Shiniki and explained key elements of Magase\'s character and agenda, this probably could\'ve been an Anime of the Year candidate.  It was too smart for its own good and thought itself out of being a top tier anime. A HISTORY OF SUICIDAL THOUGHTS OR WANT TO HARM YOURSELF. SEEK HELP.Babylon is a 12 episode discussion about a crisis facing Japan: Suicide.  This is framed within the opening of a new city in Japan called Shiniki.  A city established by powerful politicians with motives to create a better society unencumbered by regulations in Tokyo. But it\'s quickly hijacked by the politician they picked to be the Mayor: Kaika Itsuki. Itsuki, with Ai Magase (The main villain of the plot) quickly form a political suicide cult and pass a suicide law, allowing people to kill themselves with dignity.Herein lies the first problem, because the law sounds like it\'s making suicide legal, but how can you outlaw suicide in the first place? What are you going to do? Arrest the corpses?  So, you pretty much have to add your own logic to the plot here and just decide they\'re talking about assisted suicide, even though most of the people killing themselves are doing so without any assistance.In the midst of all this, the protagonist Zen, is drawn in.  What starts off as an investigation into the powerful politicians who violated the law to create Shiniki and manipulate its elections, quickly turns into Zen trying to find a way to take down Itsuki and Magase.  And that is where the anime shines.  Right in those middle episodes where it\'s more of a detective drama, with Zen and his team of prosecutors trying to find a way to bring down Itsuki and Magase, which is difficult as they can\'t prove they\'ve actually broken any laws by passing the law for dignified (assisted) suicide.This part of the anime was BRILLIANT, and I would put it on the same level as the anime ""Monster"" or the first season of ""Psycho Pass"".  It was tight, dramatic, mysterious and intriguing.  The investigators discover that Magase has the ability to influence people to commit suicide and desire death just by speaking to them. And they are determined to take her down, culminating in a tense standoff at a political debate over the Suicide Law.  These episodes were excellent.And then it went off the rails...Things start to go wrong in the aftermath of Zen\'s team trying to take matters into their own hands to stop Itsuki and Magase.  Things don\'t go as they plan, to say the least.  But, After these events and their fallout concludes, the story switches to the United States and starts following the President Alex Wood, instead of Zen.  The story shifts to more and more cities adopting the Suicide Law, and follows ""The Thinker"" doing WAY too much thinking, about how America is going to respond.The idea that a small, new city in Japan passing an (assisted) suicide law, would suddenly become a point of global concern that would include the UN, CIA and FBI was ludicrous.  As more cities began passing the law, it became less ludicrous, but they kept raising the bar of ridiculousness, going as far as having the Prime Minister of the UK threaten War against other countries if they supported laws allowing their OWN citizens to die. (What?) and having a scene where the President is called upon to talk a citizen of Shiniki down from the ledge of a building on live T.V.  Just super unrealistic for what was such an intelligent thriller.Still, it wasn\'t so bad that it destroyed the anime, but it definitely pulled it from the ranks of ""Monster"" and ""Psycho Pass"" easily.  But, the story really suffered from switching the focus from Zen to Wood.  It was a very odd choice to push the MC, chasing down a criminal, to the back of the anime to focus on the strained musings of a new, somewhat boring character. But, that\'s what they did.  Just very long conversations with the President talking to pastors, world leaders, Zen....mayors....his staff......his wife.......his kid......himself........a random stray cat.....about suicide and good and evil. For days, man. HE DID THIS FOR DAYS.In the midst of this, however, there\'s still Zen tracking down the ever mysterious and supernaturally powerful Magase.  It became a bit frustrating, as those parts were good, but they were so sparse, because the director felt we needed to see President Wood touch his nose for the 193rd time while saying ""Hmmmm..."". And what made it even more irritating is that after he would think for DAYS on something, he would get an epiphany that was totally mundane.  If you think for days about a problem, and then your ""Aha"" moment is: ""Wait, I don\'t have to worry about this at all, THEY can handle it!""? You\'re an idiot.  ""Thinker""? No. ""Idiot."".At any rate, it all comes to a head when the G7 come together to discuss the suicide laws, at the same time Itsuki convenes a summit between the 7 cities who passed the suicide laws in Shiniki.

If you are looking for an action packed anime (nothing wrong with that) then go watch something else, most of the anime is dialogue between characters.Overall, a great anime. I wasn't feeling it at first, but I eventually...got hooked after episode 8. The story has some great twists, and manages to introduce a lot of interesting characters even with the limited time it has.

They are far and few between. The one that comes up to mind is Death Note. That was a pretty good psychological thriller. It delves into psychological strategies, battles, and how character react. Very good.Of course, I\'m missing one thing essential to a psychological thriller: the thrill. You really want to know what\'s going to happen. What exactly is happening? What\'s going to happen? What will this character end up being?Well, I\'ll have to say, Babylon does execute this pretty well through the anime. But honestly, it\'s a pile of...garbage. Just because it\'s a suspenseful pile of garbage doesn\'t make it good, if I\'m being totally honest.I think the biggest problem with this show is definitely consistency of plot, mood, and characters. It loves to jump ALL over the place, just to create a feeling of suspense. First, you\'re jumping into a suicide case, and a suicide case of a police officer. Clues are found, and everything progresses slowly. Politicians, corruption, and manipulation behind the scenes. A typical, yet well executed police mystery case. But then, you just have a sort of random supernatural girl that can basically do anything, which throws the entire plot into complete haywire. Any semblance of logical series of events and character depiction are thrown out the window. Pacing? What\'s that? Hey, how about talking about a suicide law now?  How about we just kill everyone, and then have essentially a completely different arc because we feel like it? And then focus on that completely different arc for a good 6 episodes, before spending the last 10 minutes connecting it back to the previous plot. Seriously. The latter half of this show is a complete joke.And before I talk about the latter half, l\'d have to talk about the suicide law being mentioned. What\'s the point of this being brought up like, at all? It\'s essentially an edgy plot device to draw suspense. It brings absolutely nothing to the table except shock factor and moral implications which are continuously explored for no real reason. Anyways, now we can talk about the second half of the show. It\'s about international countries thinking about the suicide law, and whether or not it\'s ethical. Then, evil girl kills everyone. WOW!!! Very cool! First and foremost, just the fact that people supported the suicide law without any sort of reason gets attributed to supernatural powers of persuasion of the girl (remember that plot point?) just means that it\'s lazy plot hole fixing. I think it\'s really just an excuse to have an extremely ""intellectual"" debate about what is good and evil. I bet the author was giving a pat on his back when he talks about the ""true"" origins of good and evil. Basically, politics, country interests, military tensions, or basically anything realistic is not there because of the supernatural powers of the evil girl. How convenient.So, let me recap, because it is quite a bit of information to digest. It\'s a confusing storyline for sure. I mean, that\'s basically the reason why it\'s thrilling to watch in the first place. A sort of random adding of events to make you want to know what happens next.So first, it\'s a super gritty, realisitc, slow paced, police mystery thriller about strange murder cases. Then, it moves onto a girl that has powers to kill anyone, essentially. She kills every police force member other than the MC investigating it. And then, the girl just randomly supports this random guy to create a suicide law, so that suicide is now legal and normalized. THEN, the anime goes into a super long like 4-6 episode tangent on international figures such as the prime minister, president, etc, dealing and trying to figure out whether or not suicide is bad. Probably because the author had to put in new characters since he just killed all the old ones. In the end, bad girl kills everyone because of shock value. And of course, main character dies.That\'s a mouthful for a 12 episode anime. The story just moves on, and on, and on, with no real logic or meaningfulness. It\'s fuel is confusion, and that confusion creates a thrill. And that was why I watched this in one session.

But it turns out to be a supernatural case with a debate about some morals questions.Honestly I don\'t know where this story going. It\'s interesting but at the same time baffling. Need to mention that some scenes are hard to watch, because it horrendous and very shady...Art : 7/10Not much animation, essentially discussion and some running animations but that\'s it. Can\'t fail something if there nothing to fail lol.There sure some action scenes but they are very short and it won\'t be for the animation that will watch this anime.Sound : 6/10Nothing particular. OP and ED are mainly instrumental, OST is basic (didn\'t remember any of them, the seiyuus are good.Character : 7/10All characters are more or less realistic, except antagonists. Their mindsets are obviously twisted but don\'t know what they really seek it\'s the sole purpose of this show. To know what they want to accomplish.Enjoyment - EDITED 27/01/19 : 6/10>2/10 (Just feel I have been hard trolled at the end...)In the beginning I find it enjoyable. But more the plot develop, less I find it interesting. I put some hope in this show, but unfortunately the supernatural things had broke it.I still watch the anime because I want to see how this will end. I almost sure I\'ll be dissapointed but a man can dream.Overall - EDITED 27/01/19 : 7/10>3/10 (Just fuck this, all the debate feel worthless seeing the end - just my f*cking biaised point of view).This score will drastically change dependent of the end of the story. For now I\'ll give a 7, but I have suspicions it\'ll have fall short...Because of that I can\'t really recommend this anime.

It's also slow there's little action. I watched this in 2.5x speed and I didn't miss reading any of the subtitles.

He then starts investigating the larger thing and is then put on a collision course with a woman who proceeded to turn his life upside down. The central conflict of Babylon was something called the 'Suicide law' and the debates for and against it. The anime had an ambitious idea and it had a philosophy which it was trying to pass: what is good? What is evil? Is suicide wrong? Is suicide for the benefit of another, wrong? All these interesting ideas were examined in...the anime. At the same time, it also gave us one of the best villains from the past year in Ai Magase. Ai was terrifying. She was that weird mix of Isabella from Promised Neverland and Johan from Monster.The protagonist was sorta bland (tbf so was the protagonist from Monster) but I think this was on purpose as the contrast of a stuck up do-gooder and a maniacal woman who could kill anyone by simply spending a few moments with them was fascinating to watch. I also liked the animation and the dull colors and stocky character designs lent itself well to the setting and tone of the series. With that said, it missed the mark for me. While the ideas were and philosophies were ambitious, they ultimately started to feel too much and the story was lost. The final two episodes were a barrage of dialogue that was so wordy and devoid of fun that it started to hurt just thinking about it. It didn't help that the end was unsatisfying. I feel Babylon could have benefitted from more episodes to truly build up to its conclusion, however, as it stands, it just feels like a decent anime that started making monumental leaps towards the end.If you like thriller anime, you might get a kick out of this, and as mentioned before the villain is awesome.

But I doubt I'll want to watch this again."", 'I wanted so desperately to enjoy Babylon. I was a ravenous, starving dog scraping meat from bones long picked clean trying to convince myself every single week that I was finally feasting for the first time in ages. For more than half of its run, I had it in my head that it was all part of the plan. “Don’t worry,” I would tell myself, “all of this is dress rehearsal for the real performance that’s set to start any time now and blow us all away.” It did not take the remainder of the series run for me to stop lying to myself. Babylon...is all bluster and no muster. There is no kind way to dance around it.As its namesake implies, Babylon is a story, in part, about religious allegory. Shiniki is a new sovereign community with new rules set to ‘lead the good people astray’, if you will. Tall, Babel-esque skyscrapers dot the landscape in our very own version of the city of evil. The primary moral contention of the series is the legalization and virtue (or lack thereof) surrounding suicide. And at the center of it all is The Whore of Babylon herself, Magase Ai, whose function and symbolism should be crystal clear if you are at all familiar with biblical literature. Temptation, idolatry, falsehood; you get the picture. If we aren’t being on the nose enough for you yet, our protagonist, Zen, will come right out and tell you that the characters in his name mean “good” and “correct”. It’s likely not mentioned in show to my memory, but Ai’s name conversely contains the characters for “love”, “perverse”, and “world”. I’m not necessarily against being less than subtle though, so we’ll move on.A narrative, as difficult as a compelling one can be to write, has a myriad of paths to success, because it can mean so many things to so many people. In an anime like Babylon, it would seem obvious that the path it would most obviously try to take would be to explore the philosphical underpinings of its central dilema, and it certainly does a lot of talking about it, that’s for sure. A lot of the same banal talking over and over again. Lonely monologues and full blown on-air debates abound, with very little of substance actually said during any of them. You can blame part of that on the fact that much of the early series is spent debating the legality of an issue that has almost no outright recourse that can be taken against those people that have committed it rather than the more complex ethical side of the issue, and you can blame part of it on the “baby’s first philosophy paper” style argumentation most of the public forums devolve into. The latter half of the series does try to take a crack at the obvious and more interesting part of the question, with even more laughable results, somehow. ""We have to let people commit suicide, we let people be gay, after all!"" screams one man, ""Are you saying that you disliking us allowing suicide means you\'re going to go to war with us!?"" shouts another. If you haven\'t started wondering yet, yes, you are at the circus, and no, I have no idea how the writers haven\'t yet been fined for not having a tent.Another, more central character tries to ruminate on the issue for almost the entirety of the second half in a more serious way, only to blue ball the viewer at the end of the series with his conclusion. I’ll save you the spoilers, but the spark-notes version is that he didn’t really come to much of an answer. It was all very “1 = 1, it is because it is; it is not because it is not” type stuff. To make the elements of the show work, you have to read into them so hard that you’re basically making the arguments for the characters in ways that they couldn’t express succinctly enough themselves by hoping they meant words they didn\'t actually say.Thematically, the shows only interesting moment occurs in relation to a topic it wasn’t even really trying to address upfront. Around the midpoint, we actually get a solid couple of moments that force Zen to question how gray “unlawful” actions have the potential to be, and that assigning the worst possible motivations to someone he has already decided in his head is a criminal is potentially a recipe for disaster when it comes to forming a profile of perpetrator, understanding them, and being able to maneuver around their actions. If he wants to be a successful detective, he has to treat them like they\'re people with feelings and motivations that likely mirror everyone else. It felt very middle-era Batman.Take a step back, and the charitable among you might be thinking that all of this might still be salvageable with an engaging cast of characters and an intense thriller element. You’re in the wrong town for that, too, pal. Babylon’s cast is so thoroughly nondescript and flat that it borders on parody. Between painfully bland character designs and personalities that...kind of don’t even register as personalities most of the time, I found myself remembering most of the cast exclusively by their seiyuu. “Oh yeah, that’s the guy voiced by Sakurai!” basically. Boiling down characters to a single personality trait is almost charitable, and what traits they did possess aren’t especially interesting. The president likes to think while playing runescape. Zen likes justice. Supporting cast politician whose name I forget is a supporting cast politician. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, is secondary in scope and charisma to Ai. She is the single mildly entertaining piece in this puzzle. She has every scene worth a damn in terms of direction. She has almost every memorable piece of dialogue. She’s the single element that holds even a modicum of this together. Even if she’s kind of entirely conceptual and lot of what she can physically do borders on breaking what should and should not be possible even in a world where she’s just as magic as everyone is afraid she is, she’s at least not boring. I want really, really badly to say she deserved a better show, but I’m not even convinced I can say that at this point.On the production side of things, there’s considerably less to digest. The spooky, whispery audio work was occasionally interesting, but the show was largely devoid of stand out music or sound design that would reach out and grab you. The animation is less-than-good even for a show with a ton of stationary scenes and very little kinetic energy floating around. The full 5 weeks off between episodes 7 and 8 are likely indicative that the series was laughably far behind schedule even while it was airing, so this really shouldn’t come as a surprise, I guess.The post credits scene that is our goodbye to the series only raises more questions, and what answers it does allow us to infer are likely to fill you with disappointment more than anything else. It’s the kind of thing that someone would do if they really hated M. Night Shyamalan, boiled his style down to the zeitgeist “plot twist for the sake of it” and wrote a parody film in his name to ruin his reputation. But hey, that’s fine, really. If that’s how Babylon wants to go out, more power to it. I won’t feel nearly as bad not caring about it in its twilight as I did hoping it would be something of worth in its infancy.

Also adding that you can deal with so many police officers at the same time is also convenient.In conclusion babylon seems to me to have tremendous potential but in the end it does not solve absolutely anything, the anti-suicide law takes a back seat, the conclusions of Alex, Magase and Seizaki are incredibly basic and unsatisfactory.Magase ai never has a logical development, in general I am really disappointed in an anime that had a lot of potential and I waste it ""evil"" is to end?the anime speaks to you with certainty about these characters and supposedly found the correct answerand you as a spectator must assume that all the development was for that ambiguous and vague answer, it\'s a joke?.2- The other topic that I want to deal with is the one related to the answer of ""good and"" bad "", if the answer is as easy as saying that good is to continue living and evil is to die, then what is the meaning of the existence of the morality of the anti-suicide law?3-the appearance of alex is an excuse, alex fulfills the only role of empathizing with Seizaki,they constantly show it to the president lost in his thoughts to demonstrate the difficulty of his decision but it is irrelevant because his conclusion is very poor.4- Magase Ai existence like ""evil"" is ridiculous in the anime, she is a totally empty character and I can explain it.Magase is presented as an ""evil"" character and that therefore his actions carry the opposite of what would be ""correct"",she wants Seizaki to discover what is the difference between these two opposite poles since she says in chapter 7 that ""evil has a meaning"",the problem comes when the meaning in ""evil"" is never explained, they are just words that sound great since Magase is ""evil"" because it sounds good and nothing else, it has no reason to be pure evil, it does not have a past that ends it corrupting, that\'s why I think it\'s a worthless evil in anime5-Finally I want to refer to the development of the events in this anime, I find it ridiculous how easy the anime script facilitates situations for Magase simply to make her look like an intriguing character which is not true, she has the ability to induce suicide to all the people just by speaking but this could be more credible if in the end they gave you a somewhat reasonable explanation.Another absurdly convenient point is the ease with which she appears on both the newscast and the Presidents\' Summit and is not caught.

They could have gone through the way of the investigation about that psycho-killer and the dark side of politic, bribery, prostitution etc etc. But sadly they went to the plot about that suicide law, which is so stupid in my opinion because it was enough just legalizing euthanasia all around the world, it's the same principle of self-choice.The character development is also poor, the...main antagonist is not developed in all the anime, she is just another psycho because she wanted, and you can not become a bad person just because yo want to, that depends of the different situations you have livedThe protagonist is just interestic because he always think about justice and it real meaning which is a behavior very human because we always think about thinks we don't know or things we are not sure, and her revenge wish is understable because the villain induced a lot of their friends to suicidethe secondary characters doesn't get any development even when some of them were soo interestic, the only supporting who was a good character was the U S president, because he always think before to do something, he understand his position as a politician, he tries to understand everyone opinion, sadly he ended on that wayAnd the WORST aspect of this anime is the way that the antagonist induced people to suicide, because it was too convenient and stupid, the sex appeal doesn't have that power and it was a resource too poor and pathetic because it become an unwieldy power to the author because whoever she whisper at his/her ear will suicide no matter what, just because she was too sexy??Anyway, babylon, good idea, badly executed, btw the soundtrack was so good, the best thing of the animeSorry if its too difficult to understand me, english is not my main language main antagonist is not developed in all the anime, she is just another psycho because she wanted, and you can not become a bad person just because yo want to, that depends of the different situations you have livedThe protagonist is just interestic because he always think about justice and it real meaning which is a behavior very human because we always think about thinks we don't know or things we are not sure, and her revenge wish is understable because the villain induced a lot of their friends to suicidethe secondary characters doesn't get any development even when some of them were soo interestic, the only supporting who was a good character was the U S president, because he always think before to do something, he understand his position as a politician, he tries to understand everyone opinion, sadly he ended on that wayAnd the WORST aspect of this anime is the way that the antagonist induced people to suicide, because it was too convenient and stupid, the sex appeal doesn't have that power and it was a resource too poor and pathetic because it become an unwieldy power to the author because whoever she whisper at his/her ear will suicide no matter what, just because she was too sexy??Anyway, babylon, good idea, badly executed, btw the soundtrack was so good, the best thing of the animeSorry if its too difficult to understand me, english is not my main language"", ""The show started out amazing, with so much happening in only a few episodes I felt so thrilled to see more of how our main character fights for justice in a seemingly impossible situation. As the story continued from around the 7th episode onwards I felt like the plot just stopped. there was absolutely nothing happening, we got pointless flashbacks to the US presidents MMO playing times and how he got a wife which has nothing to do with the entire story of the anime, the story just got stuck at a point where politicians are debating for 4 episodes straight what is good and...what is bad and it didn't once feel like a meaningful conversation that transcends the shows run time and contemplate it yourself. it felt like a bunch of stalling and stalling for something huge but that turn of events never came to be. It started out as a very exciting crime investigation story but as it came closer and closer to the end it flattened out and felt like a chore to finish each episode. what is bad and it didn't once feel like a meaningful conversation that transcends the shows run time and contemplate it yourself. it felt like a bunch of stalling and stalling for something huge but that turn of events never came to be.

I did not even know what the show was supposed to be until the end, less from a very minor hint in episode 2. Because of the total disconnect of everything else and end, everything else ended up being uninteresting and illogical, because it assumed a set of constrains as dictated by the end, as well as not serving its function of substantiating the end/conclusion, which was actually pretty good, thus making everything else look worse.So why am I still giving this a 7? Because i resonate to an extent about the show's conclusion and its characterization of the female protagonist, and i will explain the show's conclusion below. But first, you don't really need to understand the character's discussions in leading to the show's conclusion, they can be rather messy and hard to follow, and sometimes maybe a little illogical, though that is exactly how a person first grappling with certain issues will think, only having the clarity of mind to explain themselves after having experienced said issues. And if you can understand the author's reasoning and thought process, then this show would likely have a moreprofound impact on you. But you can always just pick yourself up a philosophy textbook and have the benefit of structured and opposing viewpoints to help guide in your understanding. Also, try not to understand his thought process too much if it may lead you to suicide, cause that's exactly what its meant to do.So, to begin, when the protagonist started inquiry after inquiry, the MC found himself unable to substantiate with reason himself at all, with his only method of counter-arguing being his fervent support for his assumptions, which is when the serpent like voice started to get into him. And now, fast forward to the end because everything else is useless, someone has came up with an answer to the problem, and said someone then proceeds to attempt to commit suicide because he has now ascended into enlightenment. What exactly is this enlightenment? Note that this is my own interpretation of the show and was'nt actually referenced to in the show.It is the ability to verbalize your beliefs, and to realize that once your beliefs are stripped of their accompanying self-justified, raging emotions, they are simply a fact, and there is the phenomenon of such facts, thus robbing your belief of its sacredness and legitimacy. It is akin to a child realizing a wider world out there, outside of his self-centred emotions which demands the world to contour around him, and to start contouring himself around the demands and facts of this world. And what happens when this concept is extrapolated to the idea of life and death? Youundermine the reasons for survival, and suddenly suiciding and living seem to be one and the same. Encouraged by this notion, many characters feel a sudden sense of liberation, and proceed to commit the action which is representative of this feeling.I also really like how the author portrayed the protagonist to be a morally detached person, who is easy-going in every sense of her, as this corroborates with the concepts i mentioned earlier. She is basically theincarnation of knowledge/ self-discovery , which is why she gets all kinds of stupid abilities and plot amour, because she is a representation of an idea, and not an actual person.So basically, this show is meant to be a psychological thriller/ philo inquiry, meant to influence your way of thinking, either by adding or detracting from your current way of thinking. So if you don't understand the philosophical ideas behind this show, then it's all for naught, much like evagelion. Though i feel the author really could've explained himself better by having a better build-up to the climax and had the characters have a better discussion at the end.Also, the art, direction, and music were really nice though i am not a film buff so i cant say much about those. The characters were essentially mouthpieces for the concepts, or just part of the blatantly useless plot in the front, so they aren't really expected to endear the viewer, and thus cant be given a rating.Do let me know what you think about my analysis and ideas of the core concepts of the show.Cheers just been scraped off for having misled the audience and wasting their time. I did not even know what the show was supposed to be until the end, less from a very minor hint in episode 2. Because of the total disconnect of everything else and end, everything else ended up being uninteresting and illogical, because it assumed a set of constrains as dictated by the end, as well as not serving its function of substantiating the end/conclusion, which was actually pretty good, thus making everything else look worse.So why am I still giving this a 7? Because i resonate to an extent about the show's conclusion and its characterization of the female protagonist, and i will explain the show's conclusion below. But first, you don't really need to understand the character's discussions in leading to the show's conclusion, they can be rather messy and hard to follow, and sometimes maybe a little illogical, though that is exactly how a person first grappling with certain issues will think, only having the clarity of mind to explain themselves after having experienced said issues. And if you can understand the author's reasoning and thought process, then this show would likely have a moreprofound impact on you.

The original intention of the work...is that the ""Suicide Law"" is a law that allows humans to face the definition of death, opens up new freedoms and rights, and enters a new era of life values. The main thrust of the ""Suicide Law"" is that everyone has the right to choose to end their lives. He also believes that the law will not bring negative effects. The work even uses the legalization of marijuana in Canada as an example. He believes that the ""Suicide Act"" will not lead to an increase in the number of suicides, but will guide people to calmly think about suicide options and greatly reduce impulse. The possibility of suicide.But is it so?From a legal point of view, China is also like Japan. Suicide alone is not against the law, but it is not the same if it involves others, including ""Commissioned Homicide"", ""Commitment to Murder"", ""Suicide Instigation"" and ""Help ""The Crime of Suicide"" means that it is wrong to sit back and watch suicide regardless of being positioned, and it is illegal, but people can decide their own life and death. However, people do not have the right to commit suicide, because the state can stop it if necessary.However, so far, please understand that I do not think the ""Suicide Law"" is correct.From the psychological aspect, once the ""Suicide Law"" is implemented, the number of suicides will definitely increase. It is not as if Ai Magase is acting like a demon-like the original work. In fact, no matter whether Ai Magase exists or not, the number of suicides will increase. The following are the reasons I think:1. People will start thinking about the option of suicide. One of the special features of human psychology is that it is easy to be provoked. It does not refer to everyone, but it refers to some people. When people realize that they have more options, they will think more. So maybe some people who do not have such extreme negative thoughts will start to choose this method to end themselves The problem.2. The voluntary suicide of others will bring psychological effects. Not only family and friends, but also the people they see will be affected, because human beings have the ability to empathize, and there are only a few of them. When people see the same kind of death with their own eyes, the psychological shock is only slightly lower than the shock of personal killing. Therefore, once the ""Suicide Law"" is established, it will increase mental health problems in society and become a continuous negative impact.3. I think the ""Suicide Law"" will be maliciously used to affect economic stability and increase market uncertainty. As a simple example, suicide has become a weapon that people can use. Once the ""Suicide Law"" is established, people have no right to prevent the life and death of others, and people can threaten many things with their own lives.Not to mention that suicide will cause social inconvenience, inconvenient transportation, and work progress may be delayed because members commit suicide. From this point of view, the ""Suicide Law"" causes evil completely beyond good.Therefore, it is not recommended for minors or people with imperfect Three Views and a weak mental state to watch ""Babylon"" because the logic can be easily distorted secretly. After seeing this, I think this episode is really nonsense, Ai Magase kinda drag your IQ down to hell while you watching this.I am even more opposed to the practice of suicide, not against suicide, but against suicide. Before, I was confused as to whether people should weigh the value of their own lives. However, now I think that negative mental illness, like any other physical illness, will cause death, just like you have cancer or infection. They will all lament that they are unfortunate. When encountering this kind of a mess, the mental illness is the same, but people don’t know it, because human consciousness can be said to be just a program, and a program will always have bugs, and people cannot completely deny the value of his life just because of a bug.看着巴比伦这作品，开始希望和同样看过/未看过的同龄人，或未成年人更是，好好谈谈《自杀法》这个事。其实动漫底下评论，赞成与不赞成也是五五开，但这不是我所希望看到的结果。首先让我们谈谈自杀法本身，作品原意为，《自杀法》为使人类直面死亡这个定义，开拓新自由，新权利，为人类进入生命价值观新纪元的一项法律。《自杀法》的主旨为，所有人都有权利选择结束自己的生命。并且认为该法不会带来负面影响，作品内甚至以加拿大的大麻合法化来做举例，认为《自杀法》不会导致自杀数量增加，更会引导人们冷静思考自杀的选项，而大大减少冲动自杀的可能。那么是否是这样呢？就法律角度上说，目前我国也如同日本一样，单纯自杀是不犯法的，但牵涉进他人便不一样，其中包括《委托杀人罪》、《承诺杀人罪》、《自杀教唆罪》以及《帮助自杀罪》，也就是说对于自杀这件事坐视不管被定位是错误的，犯法的，但人可以决定自己生死。只不过，人确实没有自杀权，因为如果有必要，国家是可以制止的。然而目前为止，请明白，我并非认为《自杀法》是正确的。就心理方面来说，一旦《自杀法》真正实行，自杀数目是必定会增长的，并非像原作仿佛就只是曲世爱在作妖，实际上，不管曲世爱是否存在，自杀数目都会增长，以下是我所认为的原因：一、人会开始思考自杀这条选项。人的心理有这样特殊的一点，就是很容易被挑拨。并非是指所有人，但是指一部分人，当人意识到自己多了这条选项后便会去多加思考，所以也许有些人本身没有如此极端的消极想法也会开始选择用这一方法来结束自己的问题。二、他人的随意自杀会带来心理影响。不仅是家人朋友，看到的人也会被影响，因为人类拥有共情的能力，其中只有多少之分。在人亲眼看到同类死亡时，其带来的心理震撼只是稍稍低于亲手杀人的震撼，因此《自杀法》一旦成立，会增长社会上的心理健康问题，会成为连续的负面影响。三、我认为《自杀法》会被恶意加以利用，影响经济稳定，增长市场的不确定性。做个简单的例子，自杀成了人可以加以利用的武器。一旦《自杀法》成立，人便无权阻止他人的生死，人可以拿自己的性命来威胁很多事。之后更别提自杀会引起社会上的不便性，交通不便，工作进度也可能会因为成员自杀而拖延，在此看来《自杀法》所造成的恶完全超过善。所以在此不建议未成年人或者三观不完善，心理状态不坚强的人去看《巴比伦》，因为逻辑很容易被暗地里扭曲，看到后来我就觉得这个番真的是乱讲，曲世爱带你强迫降智。我也更是反对赞成自杀的这一做法，不是反对自杀，而是反对赞成自杀。先前我也有过迷茫，人是否该有权衡自己生命的价值，然而现在我认为，负面的心理疾病和其他任何生理疾病一样，都是会带来死亡，就像你生了癌，得了感染病，都会感叹是自己不幸，遇到这种破事，心理疾病也是一样，只是人们自己不清楚而已，因为人的意识可以说只是一个程序，而一个程序总是会出现bug的，人不能因为一个bug而彻底否认自己的生命价值。 is that the ""Suicide Law"" is a law that allows humans to face the definition of death, opens up new freedoms and rights, and enters a new era of life values.

At its core, this show is a well done suspense / thriller. The first half of the show primarily deals with this aspect of the show, the premise is exciting - it's a public prosecutor trying to unravel a mystery. But, the narrative is filled generously with interesting and unexpected twists while the pacing is quick and excellent. The villain in the show is also quite unique.But this show goes beyond just being a thriller. It also works in the philosophical debates of what even is 'good' and what even is...'bad' and is suicide good or bad. While anybody highly experienced with philosophy might scoff at the level of argumentation and point out logical fallacies, I argue here for the generic viewer, this is actually a great entry into the philosophical arguments behind suicide, and is probably a gateway into somebody researching the works on suicide, morality, good vs bad by Camus, Cioran, Critchley, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Faulkner, Kant among many others.Overall, this was one of the most unique shows that I have ever watched, and as someone who primarily watches feel good/ comedy animes, this was a nice change of pace.

The anime starts off alright. Art is fine, characters are believable and the story has some intrigue. However, as the story progresses, we start to lose track of the characters, and we get wrapped up in ethical discussions that try to appear deep, but ultimately sound like they were formulated by a child, and we end up with a somewhat expected conclusion. This could have been a much better story, but as one reviewer...put it, your best bet is to stop at episode 7, though I personally recommend you don't even bother starting.It reminded me of Death Note because of the themes it considered and the way it started somewhat strong and ended much weaker, but even still Death Note was stronger in its start and finish. I never leave reviews, but this was so bad that I couldn't resist. Save yourself the hours, don't waste your time. Watch literally anything else.If you want some suspense/drama/ethical dilemma types of anime, just watch Pet, Death Note, Code Geass, Monster, Parasyte, or even Tokyo Ghoul (I highly recommend you just read the manga for Tokyo Ghoul though, the anime is terrible and does the show a massive injustice, and I'm not even a fan of reading manga). put it, your best bet is to stop at episode 7, though I personally recommend you don't even bother starting.It reminded me of Death Note because of the themes it considered and the way it started somewhat strong and ended much weaker, but even still Death Note was stronger in its start and finish.

It's like watching some TV series. It's predictable, but there were some unexpected moments. You think it's something small and ordinary, but it turns out to be big and much bigger and in the end it covers everything. I felt like I was watching Death Note again. The topic is interesting and unknown. It's unlikely to happen in the real world, but it's interesting. I do not want to give spoilers, so I will leave it aside. To tell you the truth, I spat on my anime and I didn't know what it was about. I did not read the info. I just heard...it's great. I was expecting some magic because of the name and the poster, but I got Law and Order on steroids.There were hints of the crime scene as well. Let's talk about heroes and villains. I won't talk much about the characters. I will just say that most of them stand and support something that does not exist and end up in worse ways without seeing their full potential, and the villains are cherries. There are two. The first is the young Donald Trump, but with black hair, and the second is the grown-up Yono by Mirai Nikki, who I think sympathized with the main characters all the time. For a clearer description, I would describe her as Purple-Man from Marvel comics and Jessica Jones. He'll serve you one of the most heinous murders on a tray. She and the main character were like Batman and the Joker.There was a lot of speculation about the anime, but I know what the hemisphere is. The simping kills. The main character was not a sympathizer. He was a great Ace Attorney. Then things became Hawaii Five-0 for him. Finally, to express my opinion about the uping and ending. Definitely the upinning is in my Top 10 because the music that brings you into the world of Babylon and the style of painting. I didn't expect to have 3 endings. And they were all good. The music, style and sound effects were really good from start to finish. That's all I can say. Just to mention that the second character is the cutest I've ever seen, and the ending of the anime wasn't so bad. Don't forget! The simping kills! it's great.

Its a mega lopsided good that\'s carried HARD by its first seven episodes.The sound and art is good--alrighty that is covered. The direction specifically for the first 7 episodes is fantastic. So lets start with the real pros. If you can not tell already, the real pros are everything with the first seven episodes. I will be honest when I say that I thought Babylon was on the verge of being one of my frontrunners for AOTY and AOTS...for Fall 2019. The plot was phenomenal. The general intensity that kept you on the edge of your seat was top notch psychological thriller leading up to the craziness that was the end of episode 7. Magase was a character that interested you and also intimidated you in a unique way. Seizaki was a great character to follow during his battle with hunting down Magase for the first seven episodes.And then the hiatus happened...At first, I thought this was fine because episode 7 STICKS HARD. So surely the events to follow would follow the same intense psychological thriller setup from before...NOPEThings went to poop. The psychological aspect of Babylon shifted from ""intriguing takes on suicide and crazy female antagonist to ramp up the psychological warfare x1000""  to ""the president who likes to touch his nose who tries to deeply reconstruct the meaning of good"". Magase is like a cameo character after episode 7, and the intense psychological thriller changed to something an substitute teacher shows to a english class when they have nothing on the lesson plan.*I\'m not going to talk about the ending because I do not want to get carpal tunnel from me ranting more about my disappointment*The takeaway from this is that I still think that Babylon is good even after me bashing the second half so hard. The first half of the series REALLY is that special to me. Magase and Seizaki are unique characters to become invested into. The second half really weighs it down with a 4.5/10 performance. But the first half brings up to a 7 for me. Try the series out, but do not get your hopes up for a thrilling/meaningful series after episode 7. for Fall 2019. The plot was phenomenal.

This is a traditionalist story tackling a complex issue. And then painting it as inherently bad. The answer to whether suicide is good or bad is not what is important to me right now. It\'s why does it happen? The answer to this question is ignored by this anime. It\'s easy to see death as a bad thing if from your view point life is good. But what if life was not so great... People that are willing to listen to this are going to, and the rest that won\'t , won\'t.This anime is highly political. It dives into things it\'s not ready for,...and then when questioned cops out. I hate fake depth, so much... And it did not have to be this way, because the beginning showed such promise.

""I can\'t watch this any longer"" I am not interested in one-sided and mindless anti-anti life propaganda that pretends to hold meaning, when all it\'s really doing is using something with something else to prove a point. Similar to a strawman argument.If you\'re going to argue over the values of life and the validity of suicide, please don\'t use anime as your source of knowledge. It\'s entertainment and I won\'t take you seriously. The animation, sound and everything else visually are above average, and that\'s about it really.

The experts had long time to inform themselves and make good points and failed massively in doing so. I've seen/participated in better...discussions on that topic in college classes.When they revealed the father of the son I was perplexed, because it just didn't make sense.You wanna tell me no one realized he's the son of the other politician? No one doing any background checks?The debating on what is good or evil when deciding on suicide law was too far stretched.We lacked critical background motives etc. from Magase or the political party involved.So many suicides were just ignored, without doing proper investigation.The ending was? Like what happened to him, did he kill himself, because of Magase?Was he shot by a security, when he saw him holding a gun at another person?Did he shoot Magase, but she survived or can't be killed by something like that and is now in prison or something?What does she plan on doing with his son? discussions on that topic in college classes.When they revealed the father of the son I was perplexed, because it just didn't make sense.You wanna tell me no one realized he's the son of the other politician?

I found this fun and a nice thing to think about after, so i can say that it left a great impression.The thing that stops this show from breaking into a 10/10 is simply its reluctance to show any seriously affecting imagery and the inability to go any deeper into its messages. I mean they...have a character they LITERALLY call the ""Thinker"" like modern Socrates over here should be going real deep.The good side is when the imagery is really meant to affect me, it really did. The images of like **** blowing his brains out or **** and **** explaining how out of control they felt or **** getting fucking gored on stream or **** slowly losing touch as the story went on, that stuck with me but, those moments were too scarce.Edit:After coming back to the show, it makes me realise that this show is an absolute cock tease, and the only reason i chose to give a good score was due to how well it cracks the idea of an audio-visual medium. Where this story fails is in the same vein as Erased, it becomes content that its imagery is subtle and deep enough and fails to break into the next barrier of depth.The reason it was so successful was purely based on its audio and visuals.

And WHY!? Personally, I really loved that one scene with the eggs. And the investigation scene in ep 2 or 3 was really some top-notch writing.However, soon it took an absolute U-Turn in the story and all the politics and world politics was brought in which wasn't really needed. Ai Magase could've been the next Makishima (from Psycho-Pass) and Johan (from Monster) but pfft...I...had such high hopes for Babylon.

The series is extremely pretentious and fails completely at many times (in its second half it is a Jumping the Shark); However, it is refreshing to see a series that dares to enter such danger land without any complex.At first, the series is content to ask ourselves existential questions with greater or lesser subtlety, but in its second half it dares even to try to answer them; This has always seemed to me a mistake in science fiction since I think that genre should make the viewer reflect and not try to impose answers.However this are no longer seen in our days, as was the case in the past where new genres such as the nekketsu with dragon ball were created or revolutionary series like evangelion. Not, now everything is a typical, more of the same, the anime that stood out most last year was kimetsu simply for its production however everything else is a formula of success and sure, but for me it has much more value the bravery  babylon for his premise. but the interesting thing about this series is not its plot but also its message, that everything is subject to an attempt to reflect on life, suicide, good, evil and other great issues.

It has a bit of the mystery side to it, though, with the mid-season revelation, it lost that mystery edge to it. But let\'s talk about myself before discussing Babylon.I am a student who is very interested in 2 subjects: Psychology and Philosophy, though I don\'t major in it. I don\'t major in it, because I am a Computer Science major. I major in a...very logical subject, but enjoy discussing people\'s emotions and thinking line. It sounds contradictory, but to me, it means I can try to understand people in 2 different ways, and modify the 2 assessments to create my own profile of peopleI am a free-thinker. That means I don\'t really believe in Buddhism, or Islam, or Christianity, or whatever higher beings there are. I do, however, understand their teachings, and do believe in certain teachings, as long as it doesn\'t infringe on my acceptable moral compass.I watch anime. This is because to me, anime is a landscape for people to create things not humanly possible (there are CGI, but try making CGIs, and you will see the insane costs and time it would take. This is not a knack on anime being less time-consuming, but creating 3D high quality objects is certainly easier). Anime (and likely Korean and Chinese cartoons) can be distinctualize from Western cartoons on the basis of trends and public opinion. Western comics are generally viewed by people with a bigger lens, undergo more public criticism, and usually are subjected to more trends than normal. I cannot name you a lot of Western cartoons that are not kid-friendly, because those I can name are household name that can stand the tides of time (Family Guy, Simpsons, etc.). I am saying all these, because Japan really doesn\'t give a damn what they can do. I mean, Redo of Healer was a whole situation over there. Violence, gore, and uncomfortable moments are not too out of line for anime. This means that the landscape is truly free (as long as you don\'t put overly horrible things on there, though you can discuss that Youjo Senki and Attack on Titans literally involves Nazi).Now, why am I saying all this?Because I am an (objectively) truly free thinker, and Babylon is an objectively truly free anime, composed of discussions not fitting the medium (unless the medium you know is Serial Experiment Lain and Elfen Lied), and go deep into those discussions. It has gotten me questioned a lot about my beliefs, and if this can get to a bigger stage, it can really be an interesting talking point.Let\'s get quickly through my ratings (according to MAL standard)Story: 8. I will get to why it\'s not 10.Art: 6. The art is a punk-esque style, and it looks cool. I like it. But beyond punk, not much more.Sound: 8. Love the OSTs. Fits the bill. The OP and ED definitely doesn\'t fit though. This ain\'t no kid show.Character: 3. I will get to why it\'s 3.Enjoyment: 9. Not 10 because of character, though I don\'t really care too much about that to begin with.Now, why 8 for story?The story is not perfect. There are illogical situations happening around the world, though that can be excused by the supernatural element that is not shown in the tag list. But no story is truly perfect, because perfection is objective.So, let\'s talk about then ending (no spoilers) of Babylon.Short version: It\'s a free get-out-of-jail card.Long version: It has been a discussion thrill ride up until the end, but again, the logic bend strikes again. I usually don\'t care for logic bending situations, but I cannot stress enough how this is not a brilliant idea to end the story with another situation like this. Let\'s remember, no one is omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent. That\'s for the possibility of conjuring up such a plan.Now, let\'s talk about pure good versus pure evil.A common idea is that nothing is every truly good, nothing is every truly evil. This is because pure evil is thought to mean that all actions befit neither the society, not the commitor (for this discussion, we will not discuss depravity, or whatever positive emotion can be emitted by the act of killing itself, for this is not the point).However, I don\'t believe in this. When broken down to the basic-est, humans can feel 2 core emotions: love, and fear. Love enables human to continue, and fear enables human to not stop. To me, a pure good person is motivated by these 2 core values, and no additional feeling. They love people, they love their lives, they love their job, they fear crimes, they fear their phobias, etc. A mental patient can be pure good, blinded by an additional emotion/history that pushed them over the edge. A pure evil person doesn\'t have fear, and only have 1 type of love: DESIRE. They desire to kill, they desire for chaos, they desire for understander. This is why pure good is so easily tempt-able, because if they cannot balance love and fear, a small tip in one direction can shoot people in an entirely different polarity. Especially, a pure evil person, with a passion for chaos, knows best what can change a person.Why did I go on this tangent about pure good versus pure evil, other than the main character?With no spoiler, all I will say is that,Now, why a 3 for character?Short version: If person A used a Nietzsche quote, A is not Nietzsche.Long version: I don\'t enjoy the story because of the characters, I enjoy the story because of the discussion I can have with friends and myself. You have Zen Seizaki, the embodiment of pure good, and Ai Magase, the embodiment of pure evil. The rest? Gore material (that rhymes). It is really easy to attach a character to an archetype - regardless of their niche, but it\'s also very easy to only envision a character as that archetype. The breakout moment is any actions that doesn\'t befit this archetype, and is not expected - both of which these 2 characters (and others) doesn\'t do. You can argue the ending was unexpected, but let\'s be real, if you watch this, you can see that from a mile away.You can also argue that, hey, Ai Magase is pure evil, and her actions are really random (ok it\'s just a bit random, but this is a segue into my next point), and that\'s not really true.Introducing Chaos Theory, a theory that proposes that there are no randomness. Any actions can be explained, has a cause, and has a reason to it. A random function in code can be 10 loops stopping as fast as possible, but their result is varied by the computational time, hence the supposed ""randomness."" Dice rolls are not random, they are based on the angles the die hits the surface. Wheel of prizes are not random, because the strength of pins between each prize, or the ink distribution weighing something down more than other. There are patterns in everything. That\'s chaos theory. That\'s the basis for the actions of, not Ai Magase, but the idea of pure evil.These characters, for all the outstanding things they did, doesn\'t extend beyond their embodiment.the review box is too small. very logical subject, but enjoy discussing people\'s emotions and thinking line.

You can argue the ending was unexpected, but let\'s be real, if you watch this, you can see that from a mile away.You can also argue that, hey, Ai Magase is pure evil, and her actions are really random (ok it\'s just a bit random, but this is a segue into my next point), and that\'s not really true.Introducing Chaos Theory, a theory that proposes that there are no randomness. Any actions can be explained, has a cause, and has a reason to it. A random function in code can be 10 loops stopping as fast as possible, but their result is varied by the computational time, hence the supposed ""randomness."" Dice rolls are not random, they are based on the angles the die hits the surface. Wheel of prizes are not random, because the strength of pins between each prize, or the ink distribution weighing something down more than other. There are patterns in everything. That\'s chaos theory. That\'s the basis for the actions of, not Ai Magase, but the idea of pure evil.These characters, for all the outstanding things they did, doesn\'t extend beyond their embodiment.the review box is too small.', ""Babylon is a political mystery thriller that centres on Zen Seizaki, a public prosecutor in the newly created Shiniki district near Tokyo. While investigating a pharmaceutical company for a defective drug, he stumbles upon a mysterious death that leads him to a deeper conspiracy involving mayoral elections and legislation to legalize suicide.Considering the premise, the anime is naturally dialogue-centric. What starts as a story focused on a corruption investigation in local elections unravels into a deeper philosophical tale about the meaning of life and death, the benefits and pitfalls of legalized suicide on society and civilization, and the age-old battle between good and evil.The anime...consists of several characters at the highest position of power within their jurisdictions that drive the contemplations of the plot points and themes of the story. It’s one of the highlights of the experience as witnessing a public prosecutor or a mayor or a prime minister or a president ponder and brainstorm the conundrum to find a solution adds intrigue and entertainment that otherwise would not exist had the main set of characters been average joes.Some suspension of disbelief is required, though, to accept the depiction of the real world and politics. It is sometimes strained but the story and the characters warrant acceptance because of the enjoyment they elicit. For example, an actual thinking and smart president trying to do a good job for the people doesn’t seem all too real considering the contemporary political landscape, but you accept it because the characters themselves are interesting to watch and move the plot nicely.The masses and their inclinations on the subject of suicide swayed by politicians might seem too simplistic and unrealistic but again, considering modern group thinking and how easily people are reeled in by false promises, regurgitation of popular talking points, and affirmations of their beliefs by public office holders and candidates, forming tribal behaviours in an increasingly politically polarized world, it doesn't become impossible to accept that this too can happen.Now, the 12-episode run is divided into two major chunks. The first part climaxes in episode 7 and the remaining portion heavily shifts gears. Before watching Babylon, I read some opinions and the general sentiment praised the first portion while the second portion was heavily criticized due to a shift in focus and setting where the ending, in particular, was almost unanimously panned because of its abrupt nature.My experience didn’t reciprocate that sentiment — by and large — as I thoroughly enjoyed it but I do agree with the ending being abrupt or lacking closure. The rushed pacing in the second part of the anime could have at least used two more episodes to flesh it out, as well as provide some form of closure at the end. It would have also divided the two segments equally (7 episodes each).All of it is packaged in a solid audiovisual presentation. The animation is clean and the motion is often detailed and fluid. The music aptly aids the ponderings and eeriness of the story.So all in all, while I knew somewhat about what I was getting into with Babylon, I did not expect the twists and turns that the anime ultimately threw at me and I was on board for them all. The philosophy can be too preachy and the conclusions are heavy-handed but they are also an interesting perspective. Within the confines of the premise and the story, they fit nicely. Not to mention that regardless of the answers the story comes up with and your personal opinion, the viewing undoubtedly makes you contemplate long after the final episode has ended (unless you loathed it, then you’ll be seething with anger instead).I would recommend Babylon. It’s a miniseries anime so it only takes about 4 hours to finish. It’s a polarizing watch from the consensus on it and you probably will land on the negative end but the story, characters and themes make it worth a try. And if I were to rate it, I’d give it an 8/10.If you want, you can check out my Spoilers-filled thoughts on Babylon on Medium. It's where I post everything first.

The problem about this anime are the later episodes, as they kinda start a whole new arc to the story, with forgetting the initial plot to the story. I heard that the manga only went until episode 7 or something. If that's true, i can understand why it takes such a bad turn in the later stages. The ending would have been a nice cliffhanger, if there would be a season 2 to it. But if it is meant to be a ending, it's bad, not only because...it was just bad, but because the whole story just got put aside and they never even showed how the story evolved after that last episode etc.I somewhere read, that the author is going to release a light novel volume of babylon, so maybe the story isn't completely finished, but either way, the anime couldn't hold the high standards the first couple episodes set, which is sad to see, as i really enjoyed watching that.If they would do a second season or some kind of ova, i would probably watch it just to see how they move the story forward. it was just bad, but because the whole story just got put aside and they never even showed how the story evolved after that last episode etc.I somewhere read, that the author is going to release a light novel volume of babylon, so maybe the story isn't completely finished, but either way, the anime couldn't hold the high standards the first couple episodes set, which is sad to see, as i really enjoyed watching that.If they would do a second season or some kind of ova, i would probably watch it just to see how they move the story forward."", 'CONTAINS SOME SPOILERSTo begin with, very unsatisfying, frustrating ending. It feels that the ending was rushed. More episodes could be added. Perhaps they are planning to release a sequel? Nonetheless, such a potentially super anime is turned into sh*t. The first 8 episodes are fine, with high pace, but the last 4 are a bit dull and slow-paced.The main story is very interesting and philosophical; whether suicide should be allowed and legalised because it is good/moral (or not). However, the implementation is weak. If you want to conduct such a philosophical story, then you must go all-in. It is nice that some aspects are discussed...from different ethical perspectives (these are things that get taught in courses like Harvard Justice course). Unfortunately, it is very stupid to try to find answers against suicide without considering what other religions also have to say. The anime only (briefly) discusses some Christian point of view. For example more episodes could be made and there could be extended discussions from the perspective of Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. So this is a major drawback. It is just very frustrating that by the end of anime no character (or group of characters) can come up with a convincing reason why suicide is bad. The only ""convincing"" reason that the anime seemingly comes up with at the end is that the word ""good"" is meant for ""continuity"", and thus continuity of human life is prevented by suicide, consequently rendering suicide as bad. I don\'t think this will convince people in real life (or even in the anime).It is also stupid that the anime assumes that all nations on earth will start adopting the suicide law but most people on earth are religious and they won\'t do this. Unfortunately, the anime does not give screen time to those countries who have a mostly religious population. Perhaps such characters could be created and their opinions be heard. But the creators of this anime did not study and research hard enough on the main topic.For example, if someone believes in God, then they acknowledge that God is the creator and owner of everything. (And based on Islam for example) your body is also a belonging of the God and you are just a temporary guest inside it. Killing yourself is equivalent to killing someone else. And prophet Muhammad (pbuh) says that killing a single person is like killing mankind. This is a great sin to bear, and knowing that an endless, permanent afterlife exists with heaven and hell, there is a good reason not to suicide. This discussion can be much longer but it is not needed here. Guessing that other religions have similar viewpoints, solid arguments can be made against suicide for those who believe in God. And then, as one of the methods (probably the most powerful one) for trying to argue against suicide, people can be taught about why God exists and what is the purpose that he created us. But, the anime does not discuss that.However, even bigger stupidity is what the main antagonist is capable of doing. She can simply cause people to commit suicide by whispering to them. First of all, if this was some sort of sci-fi movie/series with superhero characters, I would understand this ability. BUT IT IS FKING NOT!!!! Supposedly, when she whispers, the victims get some sort of feeling equivalent to that of climax during sex, but in a way that makes them want to orgasm by suiciding. How stupid is this! We even don\'t know what she has to whisper to create this effect; what are the key words? Why do everyone get effected from this? Can\'t some people simply be resistant to this ability? Or maybe only men should get effected? So this is a super stupid and frustrating ability that breaks the anime (in my honest opinion).

The elements interweave extremely well, hovering around a suicide law that some are proposing, but who's in charge? The popular man who seems to think suicide is genuinely a good idea? Or the woman who has the supernatural ability to make people kill themselves, and does so seemingly because it's fun? It...has a great atmosphere, and the sixth episode is phenomenal, exploding in a jaw-dropping way that makes you realize just how powerful the enemy is.After that, however, the show crumbles. The main threat, Magasei Ai, with her uncanny ability for inducing suicide, is somehow tucked away, and the focus shifts to several world governments contemplating the suicide law. The immersion fades big time, considering I doubt these world leaders have the power to just change the law with a fingersnap, nor would any rational human being equate a government figure with a studied philosopher. And again, shouldn't more effort be spent nailing the person who can make people kill themselves with a whisper? Isn't that a bigger threat than legalizing suicide?Too much time is given to people sitting around and talking about morality. It's hard to play along because you have to follow every logical step if you want to stay in tune with the show, but there are far, far too many places to get derailed in their reasoning.

First, I can\'t believe nobody pointed out that these people didn\'t willingly commit suicide and were influenced by Ai Magase. manipulating people to kill themselves is murder and doesn\'t need to be discussed as suicide. Second, there are some crystal clear and basic arguments about why suicide is not the best decision and none of them were mentioned during the debates or other conversations! Things like some people may commit suicide on a whim and regret it later, I\'ve heard so many stories about people who try to die but then...when somehow they\'re saved, they\'re grateful and want to start anew while holding life dear. Death is unavoidable and everybody will die sooner o later and since no one knows what comes after death for sure, we might as well enjoy and use the time we have at hand and try to make the most of it, and that\'s human nature. True that, if people actually knew what comes after death they\'d never tolerate the pain and struggles of this world, but in this story\'s case, nothing like that is said either! Now I\'m not completely against suicide myself but I believe one needs true reasons or true melancholy to commit it which in this story was never the case and not even mentioned. I\'m bothered by the fact that the author of this story only talked about suicide from the Bible\'s perspective when they could find so many better arguments in other cultures and religions as well, It feels like they didn\'t do a good job researching for their work which is unfortunate because the idea was good enough to make a provoking and amazing story. Anyone could choose to die the second they face slight hardship or even boredom but our mood and situation changes, we can fight whatever\'s bothering or hurting us and keep on living, and eventually, we will face death and the joy that may come with or after it, no need to rush.Another reason for suicide that was mentioned during the story, was when Itsuki wanted to give his heart to his son which to me is a noble and understandable act, but it just doesn\'t make sense to create a rule for it. needless to say, it was only political games, and what a dirty game he played. But imagine making a rule out of it and the pressure it puts on family members. Everything with their whole ideology is so obviously wrong that isn\'t even worth digging in too deep, while they could come up with better philosophies to create a fictional society that acknowledges suicide and treasures it.Edit:Just finished the last episode and wanted to add something nice to my rather harsh review, to be honest, the ending was satisfying. They made their point in an effective way. What bothered me was that they took too long to reach their conclusion. All these ups and downs for something that should\'ve been their first argument. ""To live and to continue is valuable. Life is valuable, and it\'s the natural instinct of all creatures.""Now I can point out some brilliant things that happened, like through the story Ai changed appearances, had an alluring aura, and a few more details and hints to suggest her as a symbol of evil and not only a person. and I\'d like to think that\'s the reason she didn\'t die because it\'s simply impossible to destroy the evil from the root, the concept will forever remain. At the same time, zen who was the symbol of goodness won the battle by becoming evil which actually is a common trope in fiction. when somehow they\'re saved, they\'re grateful and want to start anew while holding life dear.

There seems to be a constant disappointment in the change of pace and ending of the series, and even of how unrealistic it is. Yes, it isn\'t the perfect anime and has many errors, but it isn\'t as bad as the general reviews make it seem.Babylon is a great anime regarding originality in the story and amazing animation, it isn\'t a regular action anime where all there is being violence, but Babylon in the change of pace, makes...you question what good and evil actually are.I believe Babylon even though it isn\'t that realistic and it may seem ""boring"" after the 7th episode, it isn\'t as bad as many reviews make it seem. If you are looking for a mature anime with suspense and ideological views I recommend giving Babylon a chance. you question what good and evil actually are.I believe Babylon even though it isn\'t that realistic and it may seem ""boring"" after the 7th episode, it isn\'t as bad as many reviews make it seem.

It's one of my favorite genres, but this anime kind...of ruined it.  I don't know.  I'm really annoyed.  ha ha ha of ruined it.  I don't know.  I'm really annoyed.  ha ha ha"", ""Note: This is my first review and I ramble a lot. I wasn't planning on ever reviewing but I felt like I had to.What I recommend: Read the negative reviews, not just the positive ones. And, don't ignore them, like I did. If you are suffering from a mental illness (especially a mood/anxiety disorder) do not watch this, if you struggle with suicidal thoughts and self-harm don't watch them and seek help. If you've struggled in the past with suicidal thoughts, I don't recommend watching this.My thought was, it can't be that bad. I was wrong.If this was a three episode anime,...then I'd be fine. My rating would have been 7 or 10. But, after that after episode 7 it goes completely downhill. Episode 4 till 7 is what got me to hate this anime, though.Story :  2It was intense and nightmarish at times. Which is why it has two and not a one. Besides that, it was complete waste of my time.Art    : 6I actually watched this for the art.  Not the greatest but heck it. There were times I felt they could have done so much better, overall there was nothing amazing about it.Sound : 7I disliked the opening it was just mundane in my eyes (or ears). But, other than that the sound quality was good. In my opinion, that was the best component of the the show.Character: 6The characters were interesting, at least some of them were. I dislike the fact that the characters representing good were morally gray. Yet, here we have a pure evil villain. Does that make sense? The characters don't blend with the story at times. Near the ending it seemed like the story was good vs evil. But, wasn't this supposed to be morally-gray world?  The characters at times seemed unjustifiable. There should've been more character development for at least Zen's buddies, but there wasn't. After a while, the amount of deaths just seemed like for the sake of increasing the kill count.Overall : 4.4I don't recommend watching it at all.*SPOILER AHEAD*||||||||Sacrifice and Suicide are not the same. What Itsuki wanted to do was sacrifice himself in order to save his son...unless, he was just using his son's heart as an EXCUSE to end his life. Then it was suicide.The intention is what makes the difference. One is for the greater good, the other is your own evaluation of whether you believe your life is worth living.Never is suicide morally acceptable. Unless, you are nearing your death bed. Then, that's when the euthanasia debate comes forth. Sacrifice is debatable. Suicide isn't in the most general circumstance.Babylon does not get the message across to everyone. Hell, what was the message? At times, it seems like it's glorifying suicide. Sure, it wasn't intentional but hell some viewers came to the conclusion that the suicide law is a good thing. Ai Magase is complete evil. So what is this good vs evil? What happened to the whole morally gray component of this anime? And, what is morally gray when nobody even understands the meaning of suicide.I'm highly disappointed. then I'd be fine. My rating would have been 7 or 10.

But, other than that the sound quality was good. In my opinion, that was the best component of the the show.Character: 6The characters were interesting, at least some of them were. I dislike the fact that the characters representing good were morally gray. Yet, here we have a pure evil villain. Does that make sense? The characters don't blend with the story at times. Near the ending it seemed like the story was good vs evil. But, wasn't this supposed to be morally-gray world?  The characters at times seemed unjustifiable. There should've been more character development for at least Zen's buddies, but there wasn't. After a while, the amount of deaths just seemed like for the sake of increasing the kill count.Overall : 4.4I don't recommend watching it at all.*SPOILER AHEAD*||||||||Sacrifice and Suicide are not the same. What Itsuki wanted to do was sacrifice himself in order to save his son...unless, he was just using his son's heart as an EXCUSE to end his life. Then it was suicide.The intention is what makes the difference. One is for the greater good, the other is your own evaluation of whether you believe your life is worth living.Never is suicide morally acceptable. Unless, you are nearing your death bed. Then, that's when the euthanasia debate comes forth. Sacrifice is debatable. Suicide isn't in the most general circumstance.Babylon does not get the message across to everyone. Hell, what was the message? At times, it seems like it's glorifying suicide. Sure, it wasn't intentional but hell some viewers came to the conclusion that the suicide law is a good thing. Ai Magase is complete evil. So what is this good vs evil? What happened to the whole morally gray component of this anime? And, what is morally gray when nobody even understands the meaning of suicide.I'm highly disappointed."", ""The anime starts off okay, it seems to have a good antagonist, but it becomes a lot more pretentious and nonsensical as the show progresses, the ending, I won't spoil, other than to say its a bad ending. After maybe around the halfway mark or so I got the feeling that the show was kinda wasting my time, and well, yeah it turns out it did. I suppose there is always an exception to the 3 episode rule. Some might get to an okay point by then and then become much worse later on. This was one such example.Mal demands I write more so...I suppose I will, one of the biggest gripes i have with the anime is how difficult it is to become immersed in it. Its hard to suspend disbelief about the world's leader discussing moral philosophy knowing full well polititians tend to be amoral cluster b personality types, ASPD and Narcicissts. Suspending disbelief about the antagonists superpower to seduce men into commiting suicide is also difficult, and the link between her and the polititian, how closely they are working together, and the nature of their relationship is never really fully explored or explained.I could list off some other complaints that I have, but I think this is more than what needs to be said. I'd have said it in a better way probably, if it had been my intention from the start to write a lengthy review, but i wasn't aware that there was a minimum word/character requirement until i tried to submit this review, so uh. well enjoy the jumbled mess, hopefully its less of one than this anime's plot.

It took me two weeks to finish this anime, and I'm happy I did. It had me thinking about a lot of stuff, which I'll get into now.The anime basics. The Story; although it seems to be all over the place it actually follows a man who's trying to discover something. Whats right and wrong/ Through many twists and turns you follow Zen Seizaki around, trying to figure out what good and evil, what makes something right to do and if human...morals get in the way of our freedom as human beings. I appreciated the story and what it was aiming for, but because of the plot it tired me out not letting me finish the anime as quickly as I'd like... haa haa. The Art; very clean and straight forward, unlike the feelings and emotions after you watch this anime. The Sound; because of the plot I can understand why they wouldn't have a song/singer that would associate with the anime, but I wish was a little something that made me want to watch it more (I love me a good OST). My favourite part about this anime was the Characters; you get attached to a bunch of people and just never know if you'll lose them or not (it's like TWD).Overall, I wouldn't say I hate this anime but I didn't throughly enjoy it ether. Watching this brought me back to Psychology class in College when we'd sit in a room, all the students would be facing each-other and then having to discuss a topic thats controversial; whats is good and evil. I love the topic, but the fact that an anime made me think so hard about it kind of turned me off in a way? I don't know how to explain it, but thats how I feel.WARNING: I highly suggest you don't watch this anime if you're suffering from depression or have been feeling suicidal. It's safer if you don't touch this anime.SUGGESTION: If you're in a Psychology class is College suggest this to your Prof... maybe you can watch it as a class and have an interesting discussion on it?! morals get in the way of our freedom as human beings.

Thats interesting if you're... Japanese I guess? This show itself did present suicide not as a uniquely Japanese problem, but as an especially Japanese problem, some naval gazing was involved.The writing was outstanding in comparison, some fun scenes, good dialogue, facile characters.I do have a problem with the fact that most of the plot was driven by a certain character's deus ex machina ability to just make anyone commit suicide. Kinda had a death note vibe with poorer career...goals.Overall I'd have a hard time recommending this show to anyone unless they were extremely bored.People who arent interested in suicide might be mildly entertained by the writing and some of the scenes, but a lot of it is just going to miss the mark topically.People who ARE interested in suicide Im certainly not going to encourage by giving them fetish material. goals.Overall I'd have a hard time recommending this show to anyone unless they were extremely bored.People who arent interested in suicide might be mildly entertained by the writing and some of the scenes, but a lot of it is just going to miss the mark topically.People who ARE interested in suicide Im certainly not going to encourage by giving them fetish material."", ""Babylon is a nice psychological/political detective  anime. An okay anime that could have actually been great, in an imaginary alternate realm where Babylon instead focused on the direction that gave it so much intricate quality with intense atmosphere, and less on the direction that made it a pretentious show that aims to indulge itself in unnecessary moralizationsStory and themes-------------------------The premise of Babylon  promises a thrilling detective anime where the stakes are high in getting closer and closer to the truth of an organized crime conspiracy. Our MC, Sen Seizaki is almost the walking pinnacle of justice as he strives for nothing but...the truth and pursuit of justice. He is thrown into a massive conspiracy involving pharmaceutical agents and the government, in pushing to distribute a drug for taking one’s life. This premise could lead one to expect this anime to be akin to psycho pass, as the truth is initially very obscure, the main characters are resourceful at finding clues and each discovery promised even more shock down the road. The anime then creates a special element to spice things up. An antagonist who is probably evil incarnate, who will give Sen a good run for his money. This anime ultimately develops a sort of death note model, a cat and mouse chase between Sen and the antagonist, Ai Magase. When the anime focuses on aspects like these, it thrives.Ai is crucial to the themes of this show. She adequately fits her role and makes the anime a proxy battle between good and evil to see who will come out on top. Ai is cunning, intelligent and overwhelming. By the time her link to the organized crime conspiracy is revealed it becomes obvious just how formidable she is. One would thus think that this anime is primed for a complex and tense battle of good and evil with Sen and his allies fighting Ai and her political ally Kaiko Itsuki. For about 7 episodes and part of the second half of the show this is the case and the show is very good, however the anime has other plans that I initially thought were side themes, until Babylon became dedicated to indulge in them.The anime decides to indulge itself in a sub theme which, in my opinion, is a redundant and pretentious excuse to play moral philosopher. Babylon decides to put focus on the concept of suicide and whether it is wrong or right to legalize it because plans are being made to make a special city in Japan where suicide will not only be legalized, but essentially supported. Firstly this seems too far fetched to take seriously because such an act, in most cases, is not really something a person will seek permission and support from the state to do. Secondly the anime makes it abundantly clear that by the  3rd episode antagonist Ai has the ability to hypnotize people and make them commit suicide. The anime has more important things to focus on but it decides to spend so much time in contemplating the right and wrongs of suicide, increasingly as the show progresses. This makes for such a waste of an interesting premise, seeing just how this anime takes a turn towards a less genuine route.Characters and Production--------------------------------------For the most part the characters are well laid out and fit their roles in the anime. The unspeakable does happen in the show, as the anime decides to dispose of many key characters and  put focus away from Japan and introduce a new set of characters in the show's second half , with Sen and Ai being the part of the few to continue on in the show. This anime thus makes a habit to achieve greatness with its story and characters, only to throw it away for what seems to be a direction the show wanted to go all along that honestly feels like an awkward left turn into an accident. This accident is a shift in theme to a global political philosophical route. I might have enjoyed this route if they didn't have to destroy the old one to get to this one.Production wise, the anime is pretty good. For the most part character designs are distinct and well drawn, Landscapes achieve the urban and serious feel the show wants. The music fits the themes of the show well and the voice acting is generally excellent as all dramatizations and dialogues  hit the right spot when they need to. The minor downside of the anime in this department is that on a number of occasions still frames and motionless characters are used, making a lot of scenes and backgrounds feel lifeless.  The anime might not have had the biggest budget, but for the most part the bar is set high in production.Overall---------------Overall Babylon is a bit disappointing in light of what it could have been. I still have aspects to praise the show for, because it honestly  has so much undeniable quality sprinkled in, but instead decides to douse bland characters and pretentious plot lines into the plot progression, which ultimately is the biggest anti climatic factor this anime suffers from. the truth and pursuit of justice.

The character building is top notch, in particular the conflict between the morals of main protagonist and antagonist.After the plot picks up, each episode is filled with heavy dialogues on judicial systems and human rights, which at times are quite difficult to follow if not focused. However, the dialogues are needed to establish what I feel this series wants to convey, as it is not an action-packed crime thriller.Unfortunately, irregular screening time and quite large gaps in between, the original excitement soon died down. Also, with...how closely this series questions what we consider good or bad, and the importance of life in the hands of each individual, we are compelled to reflect on our own view on life.Babylon is definitely not something to watch to be enjoyed lightly. While it is set on a very uncomfortable topic, we cannot deny that it is actually a quality anime series. Here I am setting my overall score based on what I feel about Babylon as an entire work of creativity, and I have to admit that most of my decision comes from my view on morality and faith.Another reviewer has already pointed out that people suffering from depression and similar are advised to steer clear from Babylon, and I couldn't agree more. Please talk to someone if you are suffering from depression; it doesn't have to be a professional, but please remember that all lives, without exception and no matter how difficult things may be, are valuable. how closely this series questions what we consider good or bad, and the importance of life in the hands of each individual, we are compelled to reflect on our own view on life.Babylon is definitely not something to watch to be enjoyed lightly.

Por exemplo como a vilã manipulava suas vítimas?  Itsuki agia por vontade própria ou era apenas manipulado por Magase?Deixando os pontos negativos de lado.

about this anime and i saw a lot of reviews mostly negative but lets be honest here , this anime is amazing its not perfect or masterpiece but is absolutely amazing and dopenot gonna lie this show talking about some personal subjects about some serious issues in our society talking about real humanity problems and gave us the definition of the most and  biggest ugly bad thing ( the suicide) and to be honest this anime not for all kind or for all ages...or something is for mature not teenager not underage.so the question here why the negative rates and why all these negative reviews ?i ll answer that quickly , because the anime community in the west thats it , most of fan here are kids , they like cutie things / the superpowers and otherstuff, regardless there is bunch of people are mature but they are fewso those underage fan they dont know anything about these problemsanyways , lets continue our reviewthis anime is dark theme is psychology and thriller so they need some real sad and dark ost and thats what the studio did and good joob team work ,the animation was fantastic even the anime wasnt an action tho, the anime start with a short intro  , the anime is isnt colory or shiny and that what a dark theme need , the studio show us how the characters developed with the time and the events i mean what happened in the anime all make sens there is logic here you need just to focus to understand whats going on there .the first 2 ep were great two death give us some mystery , there is an episode that bothered me and ive no idea why they made it in the first time like ep 8 they took half of ep time or maybe more just to introduce that american dude in the toilette tbh that was redicilous they can just tell us he is the usa president we dont need to know his romance story ,otherwise the story was goodthere is some stupid things like how ZEn had become a special FBI agent and how AI Magasi cant puch people tp Committing suicide that kinda stupid and she convince other countries to make suicide law , i wished the story was just in japan no in the worldnow lets jump into last episode the end , its kinda puzzle for some but for my opinion i guess she convinced Zen to suicide  so he killed his self and she travled to japan to kill his family too , and suicide law become something normal and AI magasi she wonso the question here is , does the suicide good or bad , can people puch th other to do that , that question is obvious is the suicide is bad and people can puch the others , we live once enjoy with your life and if you have sometrouble call the emergency or talk to peoplea wise man said ( the problem become much eaiser if you talk about it ) or something is for mature not teenager not underage.so the question here why

if you want the summary of my review without spoiling:Shit ending, or in longer form: the end is just a shit, last couple of episodes was running while I was playing. The story started dull but enhanced in the middle, after the cops mass suicide, the story just drops to a series of meh events.The art style is good, characters are good, short opening which is good, skippable ending. The story is a gem in the hand coal digger. Why magase killed the female offers instead of telling her to commit suicide? No body knows, and that event had...nothing to do in the story later.To those who expect philosophical dialogue: there is no “Aha”s, only “meh”s nothing to do in the story later.To those who expect philosophical dialogue: there is no “Aha”s, only “meh”s', 'This Review has SPOILERS but they are spoilers that talk about the show\'s theme in general which is set in the later episodes. The spoiler sections have ""SPOILER"" heading on them so you can skip that section if needed.This show was truly good, but its not a show for everyone. Definitely if you have a history of depression or anxiety, or suicidal thoughts, never, I DO MEAN NEVER watch this show. This should not even be touched in that case. This type of show should have serious warnings publicly written for this.Aside from that, this show had an extremely extremely amazing plot, at least in...the start. Episode 1 and 2 made me think that I had probably found a 10/10  gem and by episode 7, it was still a solid 9, but then it does go downhill. It establishes a really nice mystery with it, and its almost to the point of perfect, but then it doesn\'t really develop on it and shifts to something else.I did not really dislike the new plot, it was kind of a ""oh, I wasn\'t expecting this. It is good, but its not as amazing as I thought this mystery would be"". The show explains nothing and whatever basic characterization or things are given to you, show bases everything else off that.Inconclusive endings are not something I appreciate, but there are some shows where I can understand having an inconclusive ending.__________________________________________________________________________SPOILERS BELOWThe inconclusive ending really portrays the theme of the show nicely. What is good ? What is evil ? nobody can define them, all of them are attached to many other things, morals, responsibilities, your life experiences, its different for everyone. And with that inconclusive ending, who won ? Seizaki ? Ai Magase ? I can\'t say for certain. The show definitely has a protagonist and antagonist so there definitely are good and evil characters but the show doesn\'t really end with only one of them winning. The post credits may say that one side won, but what the other side did also stopped a much bigger collapse from happening. The story never finished though, and we will most likely never get a conclusion about the actual law. But considering the theme of the show, I can really understand having an inconclusive ending due to the inherent nature of good and evil.__________________________________________________________________________Its still a good show, but give a really deep thought about watching it, because its one of those that can genuinely affect your mind.MAL doesn\'t have a system of decimal score, but this show will be 7.5 for me. It was great on the initial story, but did go down compared to what I was expecting it to be.EDIT: After careful thought, I have come to realization that I really enjoyed this show much more than what I originally rated it at. I would give this a solid 9, but I will agree that the last arc was not that great. Still I believe it wasn\'t that bad, it was just, I had hoped for better. But it was a good arc for me. So instead of 7.5, I am giving it an 8.5Also not to mention, how amazing Ai Magase\'s voice actor was. The voice acting was genuinely 11/10 for me. the start. Episode 1 and 2 made me think that I had probably found a 10/10  gem and by episode 7, it was still a solid 9, but then it does go downhill. It establishes a really nice mystery with it, and its almost to the point of perfect, but then it doesn\'t really develop on it and shifts to something else.I did not really dislike the new plot, it was kind of a ""oh, I wasn\'t expecting this. It is good, but its not as amazing as I thought this mystery would be"". The show explains nothing and whatever basic characterization or things are given to you, show bases everything else off that.Inconclusive endings are not something I appreciate, but there are some shows where I can understand having an inconclusive ending.__________________________________________________________________________SPOILERS BELOWThe inconclusive ending really portrays the theme of the show nicely. What is good ? What is evil ? nobody can define them, all of them are attached to many other things, morals, responsibilities, your life experiences, its different for everyone. And with that inconclusive ending, who won ? Seizaki ? Ai Magase ? I can\'t say for certain. The show definitely has a protagonist and antagonist so there definitely are good and evil characters but the show doesn\'t really end with only one of them winning.
