Dokidoki! Precure,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16419/Dokidoki_Precure,"[""Doki Doki is the worst season of Pretty Cure in the franchise. It would already be a bad enough show on its own but also decides to tread on the spirit of Pretty Cure, be something it's not, and ends up as everything a season of Pretty Cure shouldn't be.The show is much more plot focused than any other season and here is the first major problem. While heavy focus on the plot isn't inherently a bad thing, in Doki's case it unfortunately comes at the cost of developing the characters and their relationships with each other, especially in the first half of the...show. And despite the creators trying to make a more complex story they fall flat on their face and Doki ends up having numerous plot holes in addition to the ones you'd commonly see in any other season. It's a kids show built around selling merchandise and they simply tried to do to much with it and failed, there are numerous concepts and ideas brought up that never really get expanded on. The pacing in the show feels like they just tried to cram in as much stuff as possible without allowing for any breather room or for things to naturally develop. There are so many plot devices and power ups that come out of nowhere with no or very little build up or foreshadowing. Pretty Cure usually has this to some degree but Doki takes it to a completely new level.The Cures themselves are mostly okay characters. The problem is what the show does with them. You'll never see a Cure more poorly treated and wasted than Cure Sword. She is a veteran warrior from the devastated Trump Kingdom but the show has no idea what to do with her or how to keep her relevant later on. Diamond and Rosetta similarly get the short end of the stick, especially in the first half once again.The fairies are okay for the most part, Davi is in fact one of the better ones from the franchise I think, but they and their relationships with the Cures aren't well developed and for the longest time they don't really feel like friends or even partners with their Cure. Ai-chan unfortunately never stops feeling like she's a plot device more than a character.When it comes to comedy the show is a little weird. At times it tries to emulate the wacky and silly style common in Fresh or Smile but with far less success. There's a lot of really out of place stuff poorly integrated into otherwise serious episodes and it kind of ruins the atmosphere or just comes across as dumb. It has plenty of fun moments and episodes still but a lot of stuff feels like it would've been better or fit in more in a different season.The villains are the Jikochu. The minions in the show are boring. They follow a seven deadly sins theme but it never amounts to more than a one-note character trait at best or at worst having nothing to do with them at all. Bel is an okay villain but keeps going back and forth between comic relief and serious threat and excelling at neither. Anything set up with the minions never really amounts to anything good.Regina starts off as the only entertaining villain the show has but what the show does with her quickly becomes repetitive, annoying, and boring. The main villain of the show is King Jikochu and he is surprisingly a pretty interesting and entertaining villain through the whole show. It would be too big of a spoiler but he's rather unique for a few reasons.The monsters of the week are okay. Some of them have pretty interesting designs and gimmicks and are pretty funny. A lot unfortunately don't really get to shine and there are barely any remotely good fights against them.The fighting in the show is on the whole very weak. Poor animation quality during the fights leave most of it unremarkable and without any impact. Doki does have quite a few silly and unusual fights to somewhat make up for it but it's never great at that. There is a lot of strategy used in some fights and the properties of what a Jikochu is made from sometimes factor into it. For instance a Jikochu made from a stereo runs out of batteries when it's not plugged in. But this happens less as the show goes on and it becomes more straight-forward action. Which is unfortunate because it still isn't good.The general soundtrack is good, the opening and endings just okay.The stock footage in the show is bland. All but one of the transformations are terrible. The one good one is so good it looks like it should be in a different show. The attacks are nothing special, some bad and some okay ones.Possibly the biggest problem with Doki is its main character. Aida Mana, Cure Heart. The show completely revolves around her. Instead of it being about friendships and bonds between all the Cures it's all about how everyone loves Mana and that's why it's everything Pretty Cure shouldn't be. She's completely perfect from the beginning of the show and doesn't grow or learn anything at all. Any supposed lessons she learns are forgotten and repeated later. The show sets up things like how her amazing selflessness might cause problems for her but nothing ever comes of this. Everyone loves her and she never fails. She's completely uncompelling and unrealistic and even worse is a terrible role model for children. Even when she shouldn't be the center of attention or have something in the plot revolve around her it happens anyways because she's the creators favorite. Add to that she's also just a terribly written character as her intelligence and fighting ability fluctuate episode by episode. She is the worst Cure of the franchise because everything she's about spits on what it means to be a Cure.The finale of the show is strange. It's not good by any means. It's hilarious in the same way a particularly bad movie is hilarious. There are some nice moments in it and some nice ideas are used but there is also plenty of dumb stuff, out of place comedy, terrible plot devices, a shoehorned in final fight that makes no sense, and generally poor animation quality and action that ruins it. The finale leaves one wondering where the animation budget went as despite there being some good moments it's really not that good looking and neither were the episodes leading up to it.So Doki Doki is the worst season of the franchise. At most times mediocre, sometimes terrible, never that great, with boring villains, and with the worst lead Cure ever. show.

At most times mediocre, sometimes terrible, never that great, with boring villains, and with the worst lead Cure ever."", 'There is a natural human tendency to be complacent and repeat the same formula over and over again.  This includes the Precure franchise with the previous Smile Precure being nothing more than a rehashed Yes5, according to reliable sources.  The inability to adapt to a changing world has been the cause of failure of governments, corporations and society.  Dokidoki has shown that even a well-established franchise is able to change with the times and cater to Generation Z children who have evolving and different needs.The first and foremost difference is that the Pink cure, Mana takes a far stronger leadership role in...this series compared to the past.  In the run-up to Dokidoki, Japan has faced a leadership crisis, having 6 different Prime Ministers in as many years.  Mana is a kind, but domineering character who knows no fear of attempting the impossible.  Mana\'s ultimate dream of becoming a Prime Minister is no coincidence and her character is an inspiration to the children of Japan to take more risks, and get the job done in an otherwise risk-averse society.Despite Mana\'s superb level of competancy in many things, one that children should aspire for through diligence and hard work, it is strongly emphasized that she is only human and is imperfect.  At one point, Mana loses motivation and a new character, much like the political opposition takes over the leadership role for a while, developing Mana and the cast until Mana is well again.  This really draws paralells with the second coming of Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, who after a weak first stint, has returned with strength, dominance and assertiveness not seen since the Koizumi era.That said, governments are essentially a team who need excellent leaders and followers.  The cast knows when to stand up and lead, and when to provide excellent support to Mana.  Even the said opposition is able to accomplish both roles, a life skill that is necessary for everyone.Dokidoki also takes a concept that is very relevant in life; selfishness.  This relatability is a change from fantasy elements such as music, flowers and fairy tales.  Almost every episode involves a person having selfish desires.  Even the smallest selfish thought can escalate into something big, and Dokidoki shows how such thoughts can be suppressed, a crucial life skill that children need.Each member of the cast faces their own relatable trials and challenges in life and is given time for growth and development.  An excellent example of this is the exploration of the theme of conflicting friendships.  Little girls have a tendency to become upset when their best friend decides to get to know a new person.  They become lonely and jealous, resulting in petty arguments along the lines of ""I\'m her best friend, how dare you take her away from me?""  Dokidoki recreates this situation and provides a viable resolution.The theme of separation is also explored like never before in previous Precure seasons, something very relevant to the globalizing world.  The Children of today are more likely to part ways and travel to far-flung places in their lives than ever before.  The common reaction of sadness and depression is a strong theme and Dokidoki provides meaningful advice to children in the same situation in order to stand up, keep going, finding happy things in life and getting the job done.Another big theme is brainwashing.  In this information age, we have easy access to a wide range of different sources, including less reputable ones.  Children are especially vulnerable when it comes to listening to an unreliable source.  Dokidoki explores one character who faces such a situation and the amount of love and care that is needed in order to restore and rehabilitate such children who take the wrong path in life.Last but not least, Dokidoki\'s plot has so many twists and turns that will put Code Geass to shame, catering perfectly to a generation that has ever-shortening attention spans.  The wide range of themes that are covered, and the sudden changes in the predicament of the cures will put anyone at the edge of their seats.  The transformation scenes are no-nonsense and different background music is substituted in to convey the mood of the situation, in what must be a first for the franchise and is rarely seen in the Mahou Shoujo genre.  The endgame also takes a shocking twist which would leave the audience in awe.Combined with a character design that is easy on the eyes, consistently high quality artwork, animation and effective use of music, Dokidoki is a series that has succesfully managed to move on and adapt with the times. This is evidenced by a YouTube reaction video of a 5 year old who is fully engaged with the series, and is shocked and awed by the attention-seeking techniques that Toei animation has used in order to keep today\'s audience glued to their screens.The antithesis to Dokidoki is the ""Aria the Animation"" franchise.  This series should never be watched as it was made for a previous generation born in the 1990s and is familiar with devices such as the VHS and the floppy disk.  These devices are common in the fact that they are slow, and will sedate anyone from the 2000s generation into boredom and sleep. this series compared to the past.

If we\'re to go back to the present and you asked a general Precure fan what the worst season is, you\'ll probably hear them say DokiDoki, except for very, very good reasons.DokiDoki Precure is a Precure season that not only fails to be a good show in general, but it fails to be a good show for this franchise in...general. When I say that, I mean that there are general things in Precure that makes the franchise very worthwhile, and DokiDoki fails at even delivering those.While the plot of this season appears to be a simplistic one, the show is intent on continuing to expand upon the plot until many holes begin to to show up and many things are left both unexplained or are given improper care time. People praised DokiDoki in the beginning for being more plot-centric than past seasons, though DokiDoki ultimately suffers from this formula.Since the plot and characters go hand in hand, let\'s discuss the characters too. The reason DokiDoki suffers from its plot-centric formula is because it shafts its characters, their development and their interactions in favor of things like a badly done plot point or more time for our main character. (whom I\'ll rant about later) There is one characters whose school uniform we don\'t get to see until episode 49. The last episode. That\'s how long it takes.The show also made two instances of randomly introducing new characters into the plot in the middle of the show. First case was with a poorly-done character, Regina, who basically starts off as a bad guy, decides she\'s pretty much in love with our main girls, tries to become good, becomes bad again, becomes good again, then becomes brainwashed into being bad and we don\'t see her again for about 20 episodes since they decide to shoehorn in another character who we had no indication of appearing prior. This character is Madoka Aguri, Cure Ace.Fun fact: There\'s a video up on YouTube where a 5 year old girl who watches the episode that Ace debuts is very confused and upset because of how random her appearance is. That\'s how bad it is. Ace is, essentially, an over-powered 10 year old who had no foreshadowing of appearing and is there to basically lecture the other girls into ""getting stronger"" and takes credit for a lot of their development episodes. She is bound by a time limit which the plot removes when they need it too, and is basically the second strongest character next to the over-overpowered main lead.Speaking of this main lead... Mana Aida. In some seasons, there is definitely some leader bias, but never before has it been this bad. The worst part is that Mana is bland. She is bland, she is flawless according to the show, the show never acknowledges her flawed logic, and she is given everything. Mana has all the other Cures transfer THEIR power to HER. Teamwork? Who needs that, just give all the power to Mana! Most of their combo attacks revolve around giving Mana the power and her taking them out. She is loved by everyone. She is the student council president, has a bunch of friends, and when she outs her Cure identity everyone is okay with it.Mana is also the only one who gets a leader upgrade at the end of the season. She single handedly takes out the big bad using everyone elses\' power. She is the one who basically restores everything. All the Cures\' and their resolves revolve around Mana. Their reason to fight? Mana. It\'s all about Mana and it\'s terrible, because this show has 5 other characters, 3 of which are already shafted as it is, that it could focus on and develop but it instead focuses on and DOESN\'T develop the overpowered and generic main lead.Other Cure leaders may have been some spotlight hogs, but at least they had some good interactions and growth with their friends. At least it somewhat made sense that Nagisa had a lot of attention since there WERE only two cures (eventually three) in that season. There is no excuse here, just bias, and it results in an extremely bland main character who gets everything without reason and sucks everything away from all the other characters who deserve it. When the show didn\'t focus too much on Mana, it focused too much on Reginas\' shoddily written character arc that relied on shifting her sides when the plot demanded it, or too much on Ace, who bossed the Cures\' around and took credit for their growth and served as a deus ex machina plot device.The villains, honestly, the only one with actual character was probably Ira. He had one interaction episode with Rikka, one that had lots of great potential with her, only for that episode to end and for it to never be directly spoken about again. Its implied a few times in the finale, yes, but overall his time with her is wasted in favor of, you guessed it, more Mana.Basically, the plot is a big mess that ends up shafting a bunch of characters in exchange of more Mana, Ace, Regina, or some other plot points that they feel like bringing up to expand things more that only result in everything becoming more confusing and unnecessarily complicated and stupid.Art and sound are mediocre. The transformations, aside from Ace, are extremely average at best and are very dynamic and honestly pretty boring. The endings have some nice artwork and some catchy tunes, though nothing else really stood out besides that. There\'s quite a lot of QUALITY inducing scenes within the show, but the overall art isn\'t exactly that bad.I mean, as someone who likes mahou shoujo, I enjoyed it.. to an extent. Sort of. Though honestly, there was nothing appealing in this season. A plot centric season? Yeah, a BADLY written plot-centric season. Character centric? Well, it was Mana centric, where none of the girls\' interactions with Mana went outside of \'we need you.\'DokiDoki has nothing going for it, nothing at all. Not as a show in general, or as a Precure season. When it fails on both accounts, there\'s nothing really worth watching here. If you want to start Precure, go with any other season that isn\'t Max Heart or GoGo!. (They\'re sequels) Just don\'t start with this, there is nothing to gain from this season of Precure and let\'s just hope the next season succeeds in the things DokiDoki didn\'t. general.

For those of you who are unfamiliar, Precure or Pretty Cure  is a long running magical girl franchise from Toei animation. It all started with Futari wa Pretty Cure and the most recent installment is Happiness Charge Precure, which is currently ongoing. Most of the series within the frranchise don't have anything to do with one another aside from a similar aesthetic and Doki Doki Precure is the tenth series within the franchise. The writing for this one was handled by Yamaguchi Ryota,...who anime fans may recognise as the writer behind the Escaflowne anime. So, how does this one hold up?Story:Our story opens with a Precure, we later learn that her name is Cure Sword, fighting monsters in a desolate landscape. Skip ahead to a group of students on a field trip and student council President Aida Mana's efforts to keep order. Their trip is interrupted when a teal-haired boy creates a monster from a person's heart which attacks the area. Mana is told that she can transform, which she does, enabling her to save the day. She finds out that the monsters are called the Selfish and they're attempting to gather dark energy to unseal their ruler, King Selfish, who was trapped in stone during the Selfish's invasion of the Trump Kingdom.It's a pretty standard magical girl plot. So, the question becomes, how well is it executed? Well, let's start with the positive aspects. The way the Selfish turn people into monsters is interesting and I do like  that they always use the kinds of selfish thoughts that we all have at times. The antagonists in general are well handled, not being portrayed as outright evil but more as inconsiderate jerks which both makes for an interesting conflict and opens up the possibility of redemption, which is definitely taken full advantage of. The story also has some really good twists which are hinted at but are still difficult to anticipate. There are some excellent humourous moments as well and quite a few superb heartwarming moments. The series also manages some crowning moments of awesome.So, with all that going for it, what are the weaknesses? The truth is that there's only one major flaw to the storytelling. There are five episodes towards the end of the series (34-38) that have no bearing on the plot and are just kind of filler. Now, that probably doesn't sound that bad. But these episodes are just annoying. The character interactions in them are weak. They lack the good humour of the rest of the series and four of the five put the focus on the worst character in the series, but we'll get to her later.Characters:Most of the characters in this series are really lovable and just generally amazing. Mana, Rikka, Alice, Makoto and Regina are all great characters who interact perfectly with one another and they're a lot of fun to watch. Most of the side characters are quite enjoyable as well, especially Sebastian. (I wouldn't mind seeing more of that charming man and his epic mustache.) There are really two weaknesses here. The first is Aguri. She is a severely under-developed character. Whereas the other girls act and feel like actual girls, Aguri is just kind of two-dimensional. Her main defining characteristics are that she scolds people and  likes sweets. Her scolding can also get a little grating at times. That being said, Aguri is not that bad. The series has Ai for that.Ai is the exceedingly obnoxious character I mentioned earlier who gets the focus for four of those five bad episodes. Most of the time Ai stays, thankfully, in the background, but there are moments when she comes into the forefront and she spends all her time there crying, throwing tantrums or just being generally the most obnoxious thing since Navi. Now, some of you are probably thinking “she's a baby character, aren't you being harsh?” No, no I'm not. There are two main reasons. One, she frequently doesn't even act like a real baby so you can't say “well, it's a realistic portrayal of an infant.” It's like she was deliberately written just to be annoying. Two, she is a pointless character. I'm not even kidding. The explanation they give to justify her existence in the story is really flimsy. You could literally replace her with a black Labrador and the story would still be just as cohesive, if not more so since most of the stupid and pointless episodes would be gone.Art:The art is done in kind of a cutesy style, which does work perfectly for the aesthetic of the series. I do appreciate that the girls look very different when they transform into Precures, which makes it realistic that they wouldn't have their identities discovered. Unlike some magical girl series where they're just wearing different outfits. I love Sailor Moon, but it's a prime example of that as a problem. The monster designs are strange. There's a mailbox goat, a stoplight monster and many others that are just weird. That being said, the designs are creative and I rather like most of them. Sure, a lot of them are silly but that works for the franchise.The usual transformation and special attack stock footage are present and they're just as lazy as they usually are. In all fairness, however, they aren't bad sequences in the slightest. The special attacks are dynamic and the transformations, except possibly Aguri's, do look good. I will give the series credit for its action sequences, a good percentage of the special moves involve actual weapons instead of wands, microphones, castanets and the like. The action sequences also involve actual fighting moves with punches and kicks. The combination of that with the stock attacks does make the action scenes a lot more dynamic and interesting.Most of the action sequences are really good, but there are some that move up into excellent. I don't want to give anything major away, but I will give one example. There's a particular scene where an enemy breaks Alice's shield in half. In a true crowning moment of awesomeness, she actually grabs the pieces and uses them like swords. It is just as cool as it sounds and definitely ranks among the best action sequences I've ever seen in a magical girl anime.Sound:Doki Doki Precure has some really talented actors. Mana is voiced by Nabatame Hitomi (Gokujou Seitokai's Kanade.) The other main characters, Rikka, Makoto, Alice and Regina, are voiced by Kotobuki Minako (K-on's Mugi), Miyamoto Kanako (who I have not heard in any other major roles), Fuchigami Mai (Girls Und Panzer's Miho), and Watanabe Kumiko (Sailor Moon's JunJun.) They all give good performances. The music is really good. Especially Makoto's songs.That being said, it's not all positive. The faeries all have verbal ticks that can get kind of annoying. Ai doesn't get much dialogue aside from her usual shrill screaming, but when she does it's pretty grating. The unfortunate task of voicing her went to Imai Yuka, who is not a bad actor by any means. You can even tell that from this series since she also voices Princess Ange, who is not obnoxious to listen to.Ho-Yay:You know, I've seen a lot of anime with shoujo-ai subtext, subtext so blatant it might as well be text and text. This is the first time I've seen a series that has a shoujo-ai poly-amorous five-some. Mana, Rikka, Alica, Makoto and Regina all seem to be into one another, all of them but Regina even come out and say they love all the others. Regina only ever says that she loves Mana, but there are some really homo-erotic scenes where the other three reach her heart, particularly Makoto and Alice. You also get some lovely scenes wherein Rikka is said to be an ideal wife for Mana, which Mana agrees with, and wherein Makoto and Mana are likened to a newlywed couple. Some of you are probably wondering which pairing makes the most sense when it comes to those five? The answer really is a poly-amorous grouping. All five of these girls are incredibly homo-erotic with one another, and I respect their decision.That isn't even the extent of the les-yay in this series. Even Aguri gets some homo-erotic scenes with one of her classmates, Eru. It's also heavily implied that Makoto had a crush on Princess Ange before the Trump Kingdom fell and, unlike some magical girl anime, there are no gratuitous male love interests to try and disguise it. The Ho-yay is at a solid 7/10 for a huge number of really cute scenes.Final Thoughts:This anime is cutesy, overly optimistic, kind of cheesy and I absolutely love it. It's a highly enjoyable series with some great characters who have awesome interactions, surprisingly epic scenes, and some amazing tender scenes. It's just a delight to watch. That being said, it does suffer from Ai, five bad episodes, Ai, a reliance on stock footage and, of course, Ai. Fortunately, those aren't major problems since Ai is mostly kept to the background, and the bad episodes can be easily skipped without losing anything of value. I do highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the magical girl aesthetic. Unless you're one of those people who thinks that the worst trope commonly used in magical girl anime is the shoujo ai subtext (yes, those people do exist. No, I don't understand it either) because there is a massive amount of it in this series. For myself, I give it a 9/10. Next week I'll take a look at Sword Art Online now if you'll excuse me I'm going to look for plushies of Mana, Rikka, Alice, Makoto and Regina. who anime fans may recognise as the writer behind the Escaflowne anime. So, how does this one hold up?Story:Our story opens with a Precure, we later learn that her name is Cure Sword, fighting monsters in a desolate landscape. Skip ahead to a group of students on a field trip and student council President Aida Mana's efforts to keep order. Their trip is interrupted when a teal-haired boy creates a monster from a person's heart which attacks the area. Mana is told that she can transform, which she does, enabling her to save the day. She finds out that the monsters are called the Selfish and they're attempting to gather dark energy to unseal their ruler, King Selfish, who was trapped in stone during the Selfish's invasion of the Trump Kingdom.It's a pretty standard magical girl plot. So, the question becomes, how well is it executed? Well, let's start with the positive aspects. The way the Selfish turn people into monsters is interesting and I do like  that they always use the kinds of selfish thoughts that we all have at times.

Even putting aside my lack of experience with the franchise, I had no idea what would drive me to think so negatively about a light hearted kid's show with healthy morals. Even when I went and watched past seasons that were looked upon unfavourably I still enjoyed them for what they were despite their flaws. And now we come to the present day. While I've still yet to make my way through every past season of the show, I can now confidently answer...the previous question of what the worst Precure season is. And despite what people would have said before Doki aired, it isn't Suite or Smile.Despite the fact that I enjoy the Precure franchise in general, I will freely admit that the basic plot structure of each season is somewhat predictable. But when it comes down to it you can't really criticise the franchise for being predictable when you consider the target audience. So by that logic does that make DokiDoki bulletproof? Well, not quite. When it comes down to it the execution is what matters the most. Despite being aimed at a younger audience it hasn't stopped Precure from excelling in different areas and it doesn't stop DokiDoki from being great either. What stops DokiDoki from being great is DokiDoki itself.With the initial character introductions the main cast comes off as likeable. However despite a good chunk of the show supposedly being devoted to character development the fruits of their labour are never really felt. While they gain a multitude of new powers and save the Earth from certain doom they're pretty much the exact same people they were 48 episodes before. Especially when it comes to Mana, Rikka and Alice who, while not particularly unlikeable, are privileged and flawless and about as far removed from relatable as you can get. Even when it comes to the characters that initially had a lot of potential they suffer greatly due to the lack of focusWhen such flawed characters this leads to a lot of other problems. Monster of the week episodes which previous seasons used for character development are just mindless filler and nothing more. Whether the plot developments are hits or misses doesn't really matter because the characters will remain stagnant regardless. No matter how substantial, the moral lessons contained in each episode all feel hollow considering they rarely contribute to the character's development or the overall plot. Even putting aside the characters and plot the action scenes which take up at least half of each episode mainly consist of the characters spamming their bland magic attacks. No fisticuffs, no surprises, just repeated animation.The animation budget seems to significantly lower than previous seasons with a plethora of QUALITY moments. The art isn't offensively bad but the animation is very sub par by modern standards. The transformation sequences are an integral part of magical girl anime and often quite well done but the ones in Doki had me clicking the fast forward button almost every time.On the topic of sound, the OST isn't obnoxiously bad and has some nice songs but is often times repetitive and forgettable. The OP sequence used for the show is also somewhat forgettable but catchy enough to fulfil its purpose. And if it wasn't the boredom that made me want to see the end of an episode, it was the one of the two glorious CG ED themes by now series regular Hitomi Yoshida. The voice acting was also of a high standard with famous VAs such as Rie Kugimiya (Except this time not a tsundere), Mayumi Tanaka (Luffy from One Piece), Minako Kotobuki (Mugi from K-ON and member of idol group Sphere) among others.I will say that I enjoyed DokiDoki for the basic reasons I enjoy the mahou shoujo genre in general. But that's about it. While I was somewhat entertained by the beginning and the ending a large portion of the show had me wishing I was watching something else. So overall, I guess I didn't really enjoy my time with DokiDoki even though it has the sentimental value of being the first Precure Season I watched as it aired. In fact, I'd go as far as saying the show is noticeably quite boring.If you want a good magical girl series, DokiDoki doesn't deliver. If you want a nice kid's show that teaches healthy moral lessons about eating vitamins and saying prayers, you won't get that either. If you were expecting quality entertainment, then boy have you ever come to the wrong place. DokiDoki Precure is your typical mediocre and completely forgettable kid's show from a franchise that is anything but mediocre and forgettable.

Many fans dislike her because of she gets the most focus, but she's really an awesome character. I like the specific combat roles of the characters and I like the heavy les yay moments.The story is heavily focus on the plot and has very little fillers. The season also introduces my favorite villain, Regina. "", 'When I started watching this series, I was aware of how most people consider it ""the worst Precure series ever"". However, I didn\'t feel it that way. I enjoyed the series from start to finish. The characters are loveable, the story advances in a quick pace and even though there are some flaws, I can let them slide.The story focuses on two opposite human emotions: selfishness and love. If the villains try to take over the world by manipulating people\'s selfishness, then the Precure counter it with love. As the series goes on, we see that almost everyone has a bit of selfishness in...their hearts, including the Precures, but they can overcome it by love.This is a series with a meaningful message and it is my second favourite Precure series after Fresh. their hearts, including the Precures, but they can overcome it by love.This is a series with a meaningful message and it is my second favourite Precure series after Fresh.', '(spoilerish)I\'m not gonna lie, this was a terrible show that I enjoyed sitting through. But it. Was terrible.If you\'re unfamiliar with Precure, I\'ll give you a rundown: Toei Magical Girl Cash Cow about girls who fight evil by utilizing powers bestowed onto them by little floaty creatures that are usually some brand of sugary cute. It\'s standard shoujo, extremely formulaic, and often features stories of friendship and Girl Power (tm). Think Sailor Moon, but with new stories and continuities every season. You\'re free to look up the movie poster for Pretty Cure All Stars Haru no Carnival♪ if you want to know the beast...you\'re dealing with.Mind you, standard Mahou Shoujo isn\'t a /bad/ thing. Don\'t let any fans of the Seinen variations tell you otherwise. Is it feminist inherently? No, of course no - arguably, it isn\'t feminist at all. But, in it\'s purest state, there is nothing wrong with little girl animes for little girls. The issue comes in when producers underestimate the intelligence of their audience, or get a bit too creative while also trying to appeal to their audience. And failing. Badly.DokiDoki! Precure is the latter case.This season mixes the creative minds behind The Visions of Escaflowne and One Piece, to create a truly bizarre hybrid of shoujo and shounen that comes out incomprehensible and disappointing.DokiDoki! Precure revolves (and I do mean /revolves/) around Aida Mana and her friends Hishikawa Rikka and Yotsuba Alice, and additionally big-name idol Kenzaki Makoto after she warms up to the gang. As Precures, they fight the Selfish, who are...selfish. This season\'s visual theme is Poker. I wish that was an exaggeration. Everything else you can probably look up. Technically, every episode in this 49-episode season is plot related, which means you have to decide for yourself what\'s filler and what\'s not. I did not know this coming into DokiDoki! Precure.The Plot is pretty much about a single person. Who is actually three people. Yeah, we\'re at that level of convolution. In a time of trouble, the individual divided her soul into two parts, and her body reincarnated as a freakish baby. The majority of the plot points revolve around at least one part of this trinity, and it really is exhausting. Due to this focus on this character & triad, every other character\'s development suffers. Unless that character is Mana, of course, as this series suffers from serious Pink Shoujo Protagonist syndrome (the pink protag is a huge, powerful mary sue that nobody ever faults, even if they are acting like a huge jerk). We\'re sorry, Makoto. You didn\'t deserve this treatment.The animation is extremely variable, but the art is bogged down by busy character designs and dead eyes. You see, they decided to go with a design theme of asymmetricality, but they just didn\'t know when to stop. It\'s something you just have to ignore while watching, so if you\'re really particulate about art, stay far away. You can tell exactly where they allocated their budget, and man, is it unequal. There are /visible/ animation bumps and valleys, to the point of disorientation. It\'s like being in a car with a teenager learning how to drive, who\'s too afraid to get in an accident, so they\'re constantly slamming on the breaks every second. When it\'s good, it\'s REALLY good. When it\'s bad, it\'s REALLY bad. If you care about design aesthetics, stay away from Doki. For your own sake.The music, for Precure, stands brightly. Hiroshi Takaki did the BG music (the wikipedia article is inconsistent on who did the music, and lists Hiroshi Takagi. Which is physically impossible), and did a heck of a job. Although some of the tracks are somewhat bland, the transformation music blares triumphantly and memorably. If there was any music in Doki I didn\'t like, it was Kenzaki Makoto\'s idol songs. Oh, she\'s an idol, by the way. Her singing isn\'t...great. Besides that, Takaki managed to make something good for something that probably didn\'t deserve his composing.Now, onto the main reason why I wanted to shit out this review: Cure Ace.I\'ll start by saying that she\'s...extremely attractive, in my opinion. Yes, your character design is excessively busy and doesn\'t make much sense geometrically, and you kind of resemble an arrowhead for some reason, but I\'d still take you out for dinner and treat you in a respectful manner. However, that\'s kind of the problem. The character who is Cure Ace? A ten year old who ages up in transformation.Now, a lot of magical girls have age up transformations. A lot of magical girls have age up transformations into overtly sexualized women. However, those are typically in Seinen, where it\'s at least logical for that genre. Mind you, Cure Ace\'s outfit is more going for beautiful than """"sexy"""", but her demeanor during attacks and transformations shows a flirtatiousness that\'s out of place with her comrades. Out of place for someone who\'s actually /ten/. It makes things extremely awkward, from seeing her at one moment applying magical lipstick and blowing out a death kiss, to drawing a picture of her mom for an elementary school project and refusing to eat carrots. Like, it might have been one thing if she were a high schooler, much like Cure Moonlight from Heartcatch, but...she\'s a little girl.This seems just like whiny feminist complaining on my part, but she gets almost all the animation bumps. Her transformation sequence is honestly one of my favorites, and her attacks are fun as hell to watch, but WHY does she get so many animation bumps? As a character, she\'s extremely obnoxious and show stealing, and pretty much all attention is directed to her after her introduction. Her extremely shounen introduction of showing up out of nowhere, blasting the guts out of a strong opponent, then leaving immediately. She constantly bosses around the other characters, and takes credit for their character non-developments. So, clearly this treatment isn\'t due to her lovely personality.It should be important to note that the writers originally planned to have Mana in a relationship with a man twice her age, but the female writers smacked that idea down fast. With that in mind, the coquettish focus on Cure Ace, reveals not only pandering to the adult audience of Precure, but a strange preoccupation with the sexualization of girls. This probably leads back to the idea that girls should follow gender roles and tolerate the advances of creepy men (Joe is a creep, I will always stand by that). However, maybe I\'m just reading too much into it. We could talk about the character Regina, who stole almost as much time as Cure Ace did, but we\'d be here longer.The story has convoluted plot twists, the characters are poorly developed, the art lacks consistency and flow, and the people in charge seemed to care too much about what they wanted (or what they thought the audience wanted) to actually produce something good. Is the show enjoyable though? Honestly, it\'s a guilty pleasure. Are there episodes I will always skip? God yes, even with all the plotty episodes. Are there characters I thoroughly wish didn\'t exist? Several. Would I sit through Dokidoki! again? Maaaaaybe. Is it the worst Precure? No.The season didn\'t become awful until half-way through, which gave enough time for the characters to endear themselves to me. It lacks the hammered heteronormativity of Yes Precure 5, and not everyone is annoying like in Happiness Charge. Although there was a definite \'darker and edgier\' feel, it didn\'t really cut out the show enjoyment. Belo and his evil gang were entertaining, and though their schtick was tired after a while, they kept me going. So, yes, I did enjoy Dokidoki! Precure. Even though it\'s a pile of crap.And since it is an enjoyable pile of crap, I\'ll give it a 4.5/10. you\'re dealing with.Mind you, standard Mahou Shoujo isn\'t a /bad/ thing. Don\'t let any fans of the Seinen variations tell you otherwise. Is it feminist inherently? No, of course no - arguably, it isn\'t feminist at all. But, in it\'s purest state, there is nothing wrong with little girl animes for little girls. The issue comes in when producers underestimate the intelligence of their audience, or get a bit too creative while also trying to appeal to their audience. And failing. Badly.DokiDoki! Precure is the latter case.This season mixes the creative minds behind The Visions of Escaflowne and One Piece, to create a truly bizarre hybrid of shoujo and shounen that comes out incomprehensible and disappointing.DokiDoki! Precure revolves (and I do mean /revolves/) around Aida Mana and her friends Hishikawa Rikka and Yotsuba Alice, and additionally big-name idol Kenzaki Makoto after she warms up to the gang. As Precures, they fight the Selfish, who are...selfish. This season\'s visual theme is Poker. I wish that was an exaggeration. Everything else you can probably look up. Technically, every episode in this 49-episode season is plot related, which means you have to decide for yourself what\'s filler and what\'s not. I did not know this coming into DokiDoki! Precure.The Plot is pretty much about a single person. Who is actually three people. Yeah, we\'re at that level of convolution. In a time of trouble, the individual divided her soul into two parts, and her body reincarnated as a freakish baby. The majority of the plot points revolve around at least one part of this trinity, and it really is exhausting. Due to this focus on this character & triad, every other character\'s development suffers. Unless that character is Mana, of course, as this series suffers from serious Pink Shoujo Protagonist syndrome (the pink protag is a huge, powerful mary sue that nobody ever faults, even if they are acting like a huge jerk). We\'re sorry, Makoto. You didn\'t deserve this treatment.The animation is extremely variable, but the art is bogged down by busy character designs and dead eyes. You see, they decided to go with a design theme of asymmetricality, but they just didn\'t know when to stop. It\'s something you just have to ignore while watching, so if you\'re really particulate about art, stay far away. You can tell exactly where they allocated their budget, and man, is it unequal. There are /visible/ animation bumps and valleys, to the point of disorientation. It\'s like being in a car with a teenager learning how to drive, who\'s too afraid to get in an accident, so they\'re constantly slamming on the breaks every second. When it\'s good, it\'s REALLY good. When it\'s bad, it\'s REALLY bad. If you care about design aesthetics, stay away from Doki. For your own sake.The music, for Precure, stands brightly. Hiroshi Takaki did the BG music (the wikipedia article is inconsistent on who did the music, and lists Hiroshi Takagi. Which is physically impossible), and did a heck of a job. Although some of the tracks are somewhat bland, the transformation music blares triumphantly and memorably. If there was any music in Doki I didn\'t like, it was Kenzaki Makoto\'s idol songs. Oh, she\'s an idol, by the way. Her singing isn\'t...great. Besides that, Takaki managed to make something good for something that probably didn\'t deserve his composing.Now, onto the main reason why I wanted to shit out this review: Cure Ace.I\'ll start by saying that she\'s...extremely attractive, in my opinion. Yes, your character design is excessively busy and doesn\'t make much sense geometrically, and you kind of resemble an arrowhead for some reason, but I\'d still take you out for dinner and treat you in a respectful manner. However, that\'s kind of the problem. The character who is Cure Ace? A ten year old who ages up in transformation.Now, a lot of magical girls have age up transformations. A lot of magical girls have age up transformations into overtly sexualized women. However, those are typically in Seinen, where it\'s at least logical for that genre. Mind you, Cure Ace\'s outfit is more going for beautiful than """"sexy"""", but her demeanor during attacks and transformations shows a flirtatiousness that\'s out of place with her comrades. Out of place for someone who\'s actually /ten/. It makes things extremely awkward, from seeing her at one moment applying magical lipstick and blowing out a death kiss, to drawing a picture of her mom for an elementary school project and refusing to eat carrots. Like, it might have been one thing if she were a high schooler, much like Cure Moonlight from Heartcatch, but...she\'s a little girl.This seems just like whiny feminist complaining on my part, but she gets almost all the animation bumps. Her transformation sequence is honestly one of my favorites, and her attacks are fun as hell to watch, but WHY does she get so many animation bumps? As a character, she\'s extremely obnoxious and show stealing, and pretty much all attention is directed to her after her introduction. Her extremely shounen introduction of showing up out of nowhere, blasting the guts out of a strong opponent, then leaving immediately. She constantly bosses around the other characters, and takes credit for their character non-developments. So, clearly this treatment isn\'t due to her lovely personality.It should be important to note that the writers originally planned to have Mana in a relationship with a man twice her age, but the female writers smacked that idea down fast. With that in mind, the coquettish focus on Cure Ace, reveals not only pandering to the adult audience of Precure, but a strange preoccupation with the sexualization of girls. This probably leads back to the idea that girls should follow gender roles and tolerate the advances of creepy men (Joe is a creep, I will always stand by that). However, maybe I\'m just reading too much into it. We could talk about the character Regina, who stole almost as much time as Cure Ace did, but we\'d be here longer.The story has convoluted plot twists, the characters are poorly developed, the art lacks consistency and flow, and the people in charge seemed to care too much about what they wanted (or what they thought the audience wanted) to actually produce something good. Is the show enjoyable though? Honestly, it\'s a guilty pleasure. Are there episodes I will always skip? God yes, even with all the plotty episodes. Are there characters I thoroughly wish didn\'t exist? Several. Would I sit through Dokidoki! again? Maaaaaybe. Is it the worst Precure? No.The season didn\'t become awful until half-way through, which gave enough time for the characters to endear themselves to me. It lacks the hammered heteronormativity of Yes Precure 5, and not everyone is annoying like in Happiness Charge. Although there was a definite \'darker and edgier\' feel, it didn\'t really cut out the show enjoyment. Belo and his evil gang were entertaining, and though their schtick was tired after a while, they kept me going. So, yes, I did enjoy Dokidoki! Precure. Even though it\'s a pile of crap.And since it is an enjoyable pile of crap, I\'ll give it a 4.5/10.', ""Dokidoki Precure is a typical shoujo anime, involving a young girl who transforms and fights evil. Full of predictable outcomes, fillers and frustrating transformations, this show certainly just floats with the rest of the like.Story (4)Like previously stated, this story is too typical. It concerns a young girl who discovers her ability to become a PreCure. With her newfound ability, she influences her friends to join her as they fight the evil Selfish. Nothing really struck me nor was it awful, but it has just been done too many times before, and like mentioned above, it consists of way too many fillers. Actually, it's basically...a replica of all the other Precures.Art (9)I think the only pro of this series would be the art. Each detail is drawn skillfully and intricately.Sound (7)The music from this anime isn't at all bad, especially considering that it's catered to little girls. However, its rating isn't too optimistic because generally, the music is rather ordinary.Characters (8)In the beginning, each character is terribly common but PERFECT (negatively). The main character is the student council president that FINDS PLEASURE in helping people, her best friend is a studious girl and her close friend is an extremely polite rich girl. Though these 3 characters are rather unrealistic, there is 1 character that intrigues me, especially taking into account that this is a rather childish anime. Regina, the daughter of the leading villain befriends these legendary heroic PreCures. This intrigued me for it somehow symbolized how children aren't always like their parents.Enjoyment (6)I personally didn't quite breathe in entertainment while watching this anime. Perhaps it's because of my age that the colorful transformations bore me or that the predictable triumphs of the PreCures occurred during practically every episode. Maybe a little girl aged 10 and below would love this, but for a teenager, not so much.Overall (5)Dokidoki Precure is a medicore anime. The reason I yearn for anime is the deep and mysterious plot it supposedly possesses (in general) and the tragic and dramatic plot twists that greatly relate to present day adolescence. DokiDoki, however took these away. For a 10-year-old, this would be great, but for teenagers, this show is unfortunately a waste of time, that I had dropped it. a replica of all the other Precures.Art (9)I think the only pro of this series would be the art.

The overall tone of this show is uniquely happy and up lifting. All of the protagonists carry this optimistic attitude towards achieving their goals. Aida especially is a great role-model for both child and adult viewers with her forgiving nature and constant desire to help others. She's the perfect type of person to lead a group of heroes. Although I typically don't enjoy lackeys of the main villain in anime, my personal favorite character is Ira. His smug...attitude is very entertaining thanks to both the show's writing and the Japanese vocal performance by Tanaka Mayumi. The art is beautiful with distinct designs for each Precure and villain. The action is well choreographed, as it is in the rest of the Precure franchise. Though the Precure typical monster of the week plot line, the characters and their strong friendship with one another keep every episode engaging. The messages this show gives to their audience about friendships and other relationships are very well presented and are applicable in the real world. I would highly recommend Doki Doki Precure to any fan of the magical girl genre. This was my introduction to Precure, and as long as you don't watch the English dub, I believe that it's a great starting point for anyone hoping the get into this franchise. attitude is very entertaining thanks to both the show's writing and the Japanese vocal performance by Tanaka Mayumi.

Boring. But over all, pretty good, just the story was too easy to catch on to. I knew what was going to happen because in Glitter Force, this is the same thing.

Ive created an entire squad of glitter force ocs, and instead of the blue haired girl always being smart, I made mine an airhead. Instead of the pink haired (the pink one for mind has blue hair actually) being...helpful, mines a bit sarcastic. helpful, mines a bit sarcastic.', ""The first Pretty Cure series I watched all the way through was Heartcatch. I got into it because of a blogger's recommendation, and I never looked back. I recently got into the Pretty Cure fandom last year, and as of now, Doki Doki is the 4th Pretty Cure season I finished. It would have been 3rd had Suite not completely won me over. I've seen a lot of hate for this series, and...well, in some ways I can agree on some things. I agree that there's a lot of potential that it could have used but wind up becoming completely wasted because of other things....Some series focus too much on different things, which affect the story in the process. Doki Doki, on the other hand, is very plot focused...which is great, but in this case it winds up being its downfall.One thing you'll notice is that the main character isn't an idiotic ditz. Instead, she's a competent, reliable, and capable girl named Mana who's the president of the student council, and is always helping people out. One day a man gives her something called a lovead. Later on, she witnesses a warrior named Cure Sword fighting something called a Jikochuu. She becomes the warrior named Cure Heart and joins in the fight against the Selfish. Cure Sword's homeland, the Trump Kingdom, was taken over by the Jikochuu, and she needs to find the princess or else both worlds are in danger. Joining them are Mana's childhood friends Rikka and Alice, Cures Diamond and Rosetta, and a strange baby they name Ai-chan. Later on they're joined by another enigmatic warrior named Cure Ace, who's hiding a lot of mysteries.The animation for the show is...eh, okay. The character designs are sleek and decent, but movement is rather limited except in some fight scenes, and even those come off as a little bit sub par. I do like the character designs though. For their civilian forms anyway. Their cure forms look a bit tacky. My favorite out of all of them is Rosetta's Cure design. She definitely looks the cutest. The music, on the other hand, is quite good. Not as good as other soundtracks, but it does its job decently, at best.DokiDoki could have been a great series. Unfortunately, it has many flaws that really bog it down. One of its biggest issues is its major focus on developing its story. It's like Escaflowne where every episode moves the plot forward, with there being little to no filler. This series could really have benefitted from some filler episodes, because its intense focus on its story wound up costing it time to focus on its main characters and their personal lives. Makoto and Alice are the characters that have been hit the hardest by this, as they get the least screentime and the least amount of meaningful character development. I like them as characters, but I would have liked to see more of their personal lives, such as Makoto's life in the Trump Kingdom before it got invaded and where Alice goes to school.Another big reason for this is the show's intense focus on its main character, Mana Aida aka Cure Heart. Now don't get me wrong. I like her for not being a ditz who's dumber than a sack of bricks like most characters in the Pretty Cure franchise. She's smart, reliable, and reasonably competent. But...the problem is, as much as I like her, the creators loved her too much and pretty much turned her into an overly perfect Mary Sue spotlight hog. She's loved by everyone, she has no real character flaws, she gets whatever she wants, all the other characters give her their powers so she can use the final finishing move, and she gets all the power-ups while everyone else gets the shaft. I personally don't hate her like most people do, but I agree with them in that the creators should have focused far less on Mana and more on characters like Alice, Rikka, and Makoto.It doesn't help that there's a lot of plot holes that never get properly explained or expanded upon, such as the royal crystals and the previous Precure before them, and the things the creators do to make every episode contribute to the story end up inevitably bogging it down. I won't go into much for the sake of spoilers, but Doki Doki really could have been better had it left out certain elements. But it's not a bad show by any means. It still retains Precure's messages of hope, friendship, redemption, etc. The music is reasonably good, albeit it not very memorable, and for the most part, it takes itself seriously and doesn't try to dumb itself down for its audience. It's a shame the show came out so convoluted as a result.Doki Doki isn't the best Precure season, nor will it ever be. It's not bad, but again, it could have been a lot better had some elements been removed and had the creators focused less on Mana all the time.

Mana and her friends all have dreams and motivations, the villains are interesting, and I liked Regina's characterization. Dokidoki showed promise from the first few episodes, but the second half of the series is where it all goes downhill.Let's address the elephant in the room: Cure Ace. Cure Ace's addition really takes away from the story. It really feels like she was added for marketing  purposes, and the...story would have been stronger overall without her. Other seasons such as Smile and Yes 5 focused on a group of 5 cures, and were great. The main difference however was that characters are established early on. Cure Ace being added near the mid/end part of the anime honestly just disturbs the flow of the story. When so much is established near the beginning,It doesn't help that Ace herself is a horrible character. She is bratty, bossy, irrational, reckless, and really never feels like she's learned anything. The moment where she blows up on Mana simply for being sad at the loss of a friend and steals her powers just shows the essence of what this character is about. She doesn't even think about how her actions can have consequences, which made her thoroughly unlikable for me. Also, why does she need to change age when she transforms? It's just a pointless change that still fails to make her stand out in a positive way.Ace being added makes the other characters suffer as well. While we do see the start of certain arcs, they feel undercooked. We know that Alice wants to be able to protect her loved ones for a change, that Rikka wants to become a great doctor, and that Regina is treated poorly by her father. These ideas don't really get expanded upon, most likely because the writers were trying to shoehorn Ace into everything. Other plot points, like what happened between Ira and Rikka, are all but abandoned. What was the point of Leva and Gula? They added nothing to the story, appear like twice, and then die.There are good points of the anime. The art was nice, and the soundtrack was great!

While arguably not too bad in of itself, several contributing factors to the story lead to its downfall.The first thing to note right off the bat is the main character, Mana. Mana has nearly all the standard tendencies and traits associated with a Mary Sue: namely, she\'s the only one who gets power-ups (evident even in the finale, where the other girls do next to nothing), she winds up taking control of many of the girl\'s focus episodes, and everyone...mindlessly supports her. Furthermore, she\'s seemingly incapable of feeling emotional distress or doubt beyond a temporary form, which extends so far as to her even purifying her own Psyche in the season finale, a feat which was never attempted or even foreshadowed at all. Mana is also uncharacteristically responsible, always staying calm and smiling and never having a moment of doubt while she helps every single person in Japan methodically.This could be understood at least if it was the only problem and the girls got some development. However, the other girls are remarkably underdeveloped; this is partly due to the aforementioned Mana stealing their spotlight episodes but has more bearing on the series not wanting to work on the girls; only Cure Ace is the other character with a concrete personality, and she\'s on shaky ground as well (will get more into this later.) Makopi\'s trauma over losing the Trump Kingdom (and by extension, Princess Ange as it allegedly explains) is near completely skipped over and ignored at every possible turn, the writers typically showing a tendency to favor Mana. Off the top of my head, Makopi gets maybe 2-3 episodes to herself, the supposed ""veteran Cure.""Not even just this, but the girls powers are extremely unbalanced; they go from defeating the Selfish members easily to struggling against monsters they\'ve fought already. I would pass this off as simply the series being inconsistent, but it\'s really difficult to look past; this is especially true when you note how ""overpowered"" Cure Ace initially is, before her power scale is pulled back to a point where she\'s arguably weaker than the other girls, before suddenly becoming powerful again in important moments.There are a lot of plot inconsistencies that tend to be written off, but they deserve merit in mentioning. There\'s a problem when it becomes a recurring theme. As some examples: Regina\'s redemption arc is nearly forgotten completely for about five episodes, and the girls don\'t even bother to mention her nor does she appear whatsoever. Regina is corrupted by one of the Royal Crystals for a reason that\'s seemingly forgotten about until it\'s shoehorned into the season finale. All of the Selfish trio use their ""Ultimate form: Beast Mode"" once and completely forget about it, with Bel taking an alternative stronger form later in the series. Ira\'s redemption arc is nearly completely forgotten about, and even direct interactions with Rikka don\'t even acknowledge the events happened, aside from the finale. These are just a few, but some other examples include Alice\'s forgotten and seemingly tragic past, Ai\'s arc where she has to ""mature,"" and others.The series also relies on a lot of convenient timing; events seem to randomly show up or take place only when the show needs them to that couldn\'t possibly be coordinated as well otherwise and the series pretends all of Japan\'s citizens are idiots; people are frequently attacked by monsters in plain daylight, witness the Cures battling (sometimes even captured on recording) and brushed off; everyone pretends it was a dream despite witnessing it directly in front of them several times, except for the finale.Another big issue is that despite being a magical girl fighting series, the fighting is noticeable lacking here. Only two villains are killed off, and they\'re killed by their own teamMost of the villains are reformed and purified, even the big bad, which is a concept I tend to disagree with. It makes the assumption that nobody is truly evil, but it also takes away from a series that\'s about defeating evil and implies that someone evil is just a suffering person in need of help. Let\'s take a real-world example: almost nobody would want to ""save"" say, Hitler, Stalin, or the like. Furthermore, past season final bosses were killed off rather mercilessly with few exceptions, leading to a bit of a grey moral situation and rendering the other past seasons looking bad.There are many more reasons why this season is not one I recommend at all, Precure or otherwise; if you are a hardcore Precure fan who will take anything from their favorite franchise no matter the quality, I can\'t stop you from watching it. To pretty much anyone else....steer clear. 3/10. mindlessly supports her. Furthermore, she\'s seemingly incapable of feeling emotional distress or doubt beyond a temporary form, which extends so far as to her even purifying her own Psyche in the season finale, a feat which was never attempted or even foreshadowed at all. Mana is also uncharacteristically responsible, always staying calm and smiling and never having a moment of doubt while she helps every single person in Japan methodically.This could be understood at least if it was the only problem and the girls got some development.

Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16355/Dansai_Bunri_no_Crime_Edge,"['If you thought long hair was something of an eye catcher, get a load of this. Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge features a mysterious girl who has probably the longest hair length of almost any anime I\'ve seen. I don\'t know if that\'s any sort of accomplishment, but this series takes strange to a new level as there\'s a particular young boy who is obsessed with the idea of cutting hair. Now the formula is complete with a young boy who wants to cut hair and a girl who has long hair. Oh but that\'s just the tip of the iceberg. Beyond that mountain of...hair also lies danger for our two adorable friends. That doesn\'t stop the hair-crossed duo though because in Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge, there\'s more than just meets the eye beyond that hair.Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge (also known as The Severing Crime Edge) is an animated series adapted from the manga of the same name written by Tatsuhiko Hikagi. The series starts out in a mysterious way but later turns into a dangerous game scenario. The \'game\' involves whoever can kill the “Hair Queen” and the victor would get a glorious prize for his or her efforts. Sounds catchy right? Well, that would be the case but this series here takes that theme and twist it in a way that can swift from adorable to murderous in just a matter of moments. Talk about change...For starters, the series introduces more of a fantasy theme. The mystical encounter between our main protagonists of the story, Kiri Haimura and Iwai Mushanokoji, is quite unusual. It\'s not every day that we see people get connected by hair. In fact, what\'s even more strange is the length of Iwai\'s hair that seemingly is longer than herself. On the other hand, Kiri who seems like a normal boy quickly becomes entranced by that hair. This strange obsession with hair can be traced to borderline fetish as he seemingly can\'t take his eyes off of it. It\'s the beginning of this relationship connected by hair that sets them as the dynamic duo of this murderous game.For the game itself, it seems to follow a winner takes all scenario meaning that it\'s every man for themselves. That means one thing: you can\'t really trust anyone because of the fear of betrayal. And of course, anime series involving a game scenario similar to this is nothing new. Series such as Mirai Nikki, Btooom!, Fate/Stay Night, Rozen Maiden, etc all follow this sort of format where the ultimate winner of the game is decided based on completing specific requirements. For our adorable Iwai though, the requirement is to kill her. That might sound gruesome but it gets worse because the majority of the contestants are nothing like Kiri. In fact, they can be literally tagged as serial killers. It also doesn\'t help the fact that Kiri himself has an origin related to them. The good news is that he seems to be on Iwai\'s side more than just that borderline fetish for hair. The bad news? Everyone else seemingly wants our adorable Hair Queen\'s head on a plate.Although I find the adorable duo to be somewhat compatible, their relationship seems way more like fantasy than anything else. After all, they are connected by a strange encounter in the first place in that western-like mansion. Furthermore though, the two quickly becomes close despite the fact that Iwai is a potential candidate to win the game. He even proves it too as in the beginning, Kiri is able to take on six-foot tall man with just his scissors. He seemingly plays the role of the \'knight in shining armor\' for our adorable Hair Queen. On the other hand, there\'s Iwai who seems to be the mascot of this show. She is so adorable that everyone seems to frown over her cuteness such as her classmates. She has the traits too with those long hair, those moe like eyes, the little fang-shaped teeth, and heart melting smile. However, she lacks the skill or power to protect herself during many situations. Oh and regarding that hair, it\'s of course not normal. It has \'magic\' written all over it and we can see exactly why Kiri-kun seems to be so fascinated by it.The people who are hunting down Iwai are known as \'Authors\' which is a strange name at that. Going by the game scenario though, it\'s quite obvious that the Authors wants Iwai dead. The Authors themselves as mentioned earlier before are comparable to professional killers, skilled individuals who kills for his or her own reasons with efficient skill. These individuals themselves are also armed with dangerous weapons known as the \'killing goods\'. Going by the trademarks, these tools are instruments of killing. In fact, many of the objects in this series are designed in a way to harm people. For example, there\'s Kiri and his scissors that also designates the title of the series: the Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge. Then there are the other killing goods that comes in all shapes and sizes such as an injection needle, ropes, and sharp knives. It\'s not doubt that these weapons are designed to kill. Yikes, talk about Iwai in a situation of life and death here. But thankfully she has her knight in shining armor right?Well that might somewhat be true but it\'s clearly seen throughout the series that the duo struggles in their survival against the Authors. Is it because they are weak or because the Authors are too damn strong? I can barely tell since we don\'t see much back story of either character besides the basic origins. That\'s one of the weaknesses of this show as the connection built by Kiri and Iwai seems too unbelievable. They are connected based on a fascination of \'hair\' in a fantasy like romance. Speaking of which, the romance between the duo seems to be rather strange. It\'s obvious Iwai is attracted to Kiri as well as vice versa. However, neither of them initiates the first move directly but rather expressed through teases; again involving....the magic word \'hair\'. There\'s also hinted romance by another character towards Kiri throughout the series but the kid\'s too dense to realize it. Maybe, he\'s just too into the hair? I wonder.The way the series is structured also seems to follow the typical \'monster of the week\' format. This is expressed by the way in which some Authors make their debut but then some of them disappears to be never seen or heard of again. Then, there\'s the case of Kiri-kun who uses his killing good to protect Iwai. Being her knight in shining armor, Kiri plays the role of the hero kid who tries to do everything by himself. Most of the time he seems to succeed but other times seems to be on the falling edge. While I do like the fact that he isn\'t a coward, the way Kiri succeeds sometimes is also a bit unbelievable. Of course, he doesn\'t always succeed through Gary Stu-like scenarios but his abilities are quite a sight for the other Authors. He\'s proved himself many times already. On the other hand, the Authors who threatens their lives are constant on odds as they struggle to achieve the task of killing the Hair Queen. Their appearances may be diverse but their insights are not as most of their personalities are dull and lacking flavor from my perspective.There\'s also fan service in this series of course. For whatever reason, the teases in this series expands to not just hair but also in the form of an injection as well. The way in which two particular character behaves in such scenes involving the injection shows a rather lewd way of \'bonding\'. Then of course, there\'s Iwai who sometimes isn\'t full dressed and blushes out of nowhere for some eye candy scenes.The artwork of this series seems magical. At some stances, it falls under the fantasy theme with the Western-like mansion, the Alice in Wonderland-like field, and stage plays. At other times, it brings out the more modern themes with the school and shopping malls. Then, there\'s our characters who are designed to look like normal people but have abnormal ways of expressing themselves. The most noticeable style of artwork is Iwai and her long hair that is eye catching for nearly anyone. Then, there are the Authors. Some of them are designed to look normal and innocent. Others are designed to really look like killers on the loose.For soundtrack though, Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge actually has a catchy OST. It\'s catchy enough to maintain that magical theme through tense moments as well as those that are intimate. In one particular moment in one of the later episodes, there\'s a slow melody that is played to show how far Kiri and Iwai have connected in their relationship. Speaking of which, the voices for our main protagonists expresses themselves well for characters of their age. The OP song ""Unmei no Ori"" by Aimi shows montages of the various characters. Its tone is expressed in moments in which we see most of the Authors seemingly enduring the situations they are in. Then at the end of each song, there\'s the echo of \'Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge\' giving off a more grim feeling of the series.This series can be a hit or miss for potential fans from my perspective. For me, it was a bit of in between but leans more to the mediocre. Aside from the bizarre hair fascination and the weakly structured plot, the series does have some entertainment values at some occasions. It\'s also adorable with some of the moments our main two protagonists share throughout the series. At other instances, it becomes old quickly and rather forced rather than expressive. The Authors themselves may distinguish themselves from each other but they don\'t have much insight to go on. Ultimately though, the winner of the game will gain glory. What did I gain from Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge? Well, just a barely tolerable experience. hair also lies danger for our two adorable friends.

As you have guessed these special properties are a means to power and conflict erupts when you fight to the death for a wish granted through a lowly murder leaving you in the end with some questions and...hopes for the future.Ominous soundtracks back up the very well made fighting scenes that keep up the suspense and sometimes induce the owners feelings.Artwork is a pretty impressive work of light and color that create a grand stage for the characters to perform on. Sparing no detail, be it architecture or natural scenery it is really meant to produce an impact on the viewer.Characters are properly made to express their role through a stunning image, take the Hair Queen for example or Haimura under Graylands influence.To my enjoyment all the fighting and suspense really mixed up with the fan service even though it had its own pathetic or odd moments.

Personally I believe the feelings of people to be a good template for stories since they can be very powerful and sometimes they exceed the boundaries of human comprehension.', ""Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge is a rather recent anime based on a manga by Hikagi Tatsuhiko. The anime was handled by Studio Gokumi, a studio I only know from their work on A Channel. They don't really have many works yet since they're a pretty new studio, their first work wasn't even four years ago. This will be the second anime I've seen from them. Let's see how it compares to the first.Our story opens with Kiri, our protagonist, going to the house of a rumoured spirit with long hair because... that's his fetish. I'm not even kidding. He goes because he has...a hair fetish. When he gets there he finds a petite girl roughly his age with hair down to her feet. He decides to stare at her, scissors in hand while breathing heavily. Contrary to common sense or basic survival skills, the girl, Iwai, decides that the best way to handle the situation is to invite him inside. Because in the land of poorly written characters, actions don't need to remotely resemble what anyone with a single functional brain cell would do. It turns out that Iwai has cursed hair that can't be cut. In spite of Kiri trying several pairs of scissors from her drawer. But that's okay because his pair is magical as it was a murder weapon at some point and it can cut her hair. The worst part is that that isn't even the stupidest aspect of this series. That's right, my friends, the idiocy escalates. It turns out that there are lots of people out there with magical murder weapons called authors and if any of them manages to kill Iwai, the “hair queen” they can get any wish they want and escape the spirit of the original murderer that still possesses the weapon. Kiri decides to protect her because she's surprisingly uncreeped out by him. The series from there follows the pair as they try to fend off a bunch of “authors” who either want to kill Iwai or Kiri. There are many problems that plague the narrative. The most obvious being that the premise is really stupid. Even if it was well-executed, which it isn't, it would still be just an absurdly stupid premise. Which might work in a parody but they play it seriously and try to play up the “drama.” Which is terribly written and the romance is cringe worthy to the point where it would fit into a Stephanie Meyer novel. I have nothing positive to say about the story. It starts out as mind-numbingly stupid and only gets worse eventually ending on an expositional onslaught about how much more there is to come.The characters in this are horribly written. Their actions and motivations have no verisimilitude whatsoever. Kiri has a hair cutting fetish and protects Iwai because he's in love with her based on her hair. Iwai is an archetypal damsel in distress who spends her time either fixated on her love interest, crying or yelling for help. Most of the characters are defined entirely by exaggerated fetishes and the rest are just one-dimensional. The best characters are the dogs that appear briefly in two or three scenes. Just because they're the only characters who never do anything grossly stupid or incredibly annoying. To make things even worse, character motivations and actions change quite a bit in this for really flimsy reasons. They really couldn't use actual character reasons since the characters in this have less personality than a half leaf of lettuce so they have to resort to the tired “characters change because the plot says so.”The art is meh. It's not as bad as the rest of the series, but it's nothing special. The character designs are pretty standard. The action sequences tend towards the slow, dragged out and uninteresting. They also mute the colours when things get violent. Having fetishy characters, including a pedophile, running around is fine, but showing blood would just be going too far. (Facepalm) There's really nothing visually interesting about the series.The voice acting is pretty bad. Not because of the cast, I've heard most of them deliver good performances before, but because the characters have nothing to them. And actors can't make something out of nothing. As a result, the performances are pretty flat and the actors frequently just sound dis-interested. The music is okay.The ho-yay factor is a 3/10. There are a couple homo-erotic scenes between two girls. Unfortunately, those girls are twin sisters. So it just ends up being disgusting. What is with creepy terrible writers and adding romantic subtext to relationships between twins? Looking at you too, Bendis.This anime is horrendous. There's really nothing I can recommend it based on. The writing is terrible, the plot is stupid, the characters are bland at best and downright unpleasant at worst. I could only recommend this one to someone I hated and you're all such lovely people that I couldn't do that to you. Final rating 1/10. Next week I'll take a look at 5 centimetres per second. I know, it's not on my request queue, but I'm trying to finish Legend of the Galactic Heroes and it's quite long. Unfortunately, I don't have anymore requests that are short enough to watch in the meantime. Thank you all for being patient with me. This Friday I'll do a little something special for all of you. It's something I've wanted to do for a while and now seems a good time. And no, it's not images of myself in lingerie for Valentine's. I'm sure most of you would not be interested in seeing that anyway. a hair fetish. When he gets there he finds a petite girl roughly his age with hair down to her feet.

Which might work in a parody but they play it seriously and try to play up the “drama.” Which is terribly written and the romance is cringe worthy to the point where it would fit into a Stephanie Meyer novel. I have nothing positive to say about the story. It starts out as mind-numbingly stupid and only gets worse eventually ending on an expositional onslaught about how much more there is to come.The characters in this are horribly written. Their actions and motivations have no verisimilitude whatsoever. Kiri has a hair cutting fetish and protects Iwai because he's in love with her based on her hair. Iwai is an archetypal damsel in distress who spends her time either fixated on her love interest, crying or yelling for help. Most of the characters are defined entirely by exaggerated fetishes and the rest are just one-dimensional. The best characters are the dogs that appear briefly in two or three scenes. Just because they're the only characters who never do anything grossly stupid or incredibly annoying. To make things even worse, character motivations and actions change quite a bit in this for really flimsy reasons. They really couldn't use actual character reasons since the characters in this have less personality than a half leaf of lettuce so they have to resort to the tired “characters change because the plot says so.”The art is meh. It's not as bad as the rest of the series, but it's nothing special. The character designs are pretty standard. The action sequences tend towards the slow, dragged out and uninteresting. They also mute the colours when things get violent. Having fetishy characters, including a pedophile, running around is fine, but showing blood would just be going too far. (Facepalm) There's really nothing visually interesting about the series.The voice acting is pretty bad. Not because of the cast, I've heard most of them deliver good performances before, but because the characters have nothing to them. And actors can't make something out of nothing. As a result, the performances are pretty flat and the actors frequently just sound dis-interested. The music is okay.The ho-yay factor is a 3/10. There are a couple homo-erotic scenes between two girls. Unfortunately, those girls are twin sisters. So it just ends up being disgusting. What is with creepy terrible writers and adding romantic subtext to relationships between twins? Looking at you too, Bendis.This anime is horrendous. There's really nothing I can recommend it based on. The writing is terrible, the plot is stupid, the characters are bland at best and downright unpleasant at worst. I could only recommend this one to someone I hated and you're all such lovely people that I couldn't do that to you. Final rating 1/10. Next week I'll take a look at 5 centimetres per second. I know, it's not on my request queue, but I'm trying to finish Legend of the Galactic Heroes and it's quite long. Unfortunately, I don't have anymore requests that are short enough to watch in the meantime. Thank you all for being patient with me. This Friday I'll do a little something special for all of you. It's something I've wanted to do for a while and now seems a good time. And no, it's not images of myself in lingerie for Valentine's. I'm sure most of you would not be interested in seeing that anyway."", 'When you take bananas,  macaronni and cheese, pizza, pinnapples, yogurt, carrots, and some jamaican patties put it all into a blender, what would you expect it to taste like.... well if your any person with a normal tastebud then you would say like shit yet this is what this anime blatanly does; Ladies and gents welcome to the anime called Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge other wise known as the severing and dismembering crime edge.Kiri Haimura is a seemingly ordinary boy with one slight problem: he is obsessed with cutting other people\'s hair.

Most of the enjoyable moments for me was when the girl\'s hair is being cut as i know that at this very second there are people watching this using it as masturbation material as the scenes which the girls hair is getting cut is highly sexualized and romanticized like to the point where you think the characters are about to bust a load if Kiri-kun takes one more snip of hair.Overall (5) this is what i feel is a BAD anime that just tries on to many different things all at the same time without having an objective of what it wants to be.This anime is nothing special and ultimately was destined to fail even prior to the release of its 3rd episode as it was imminent that the staff couldn\'t focus on a goal for this show. cut her hair because of an inherited curse.

You get Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge, one of the most awkward anime series I\'ve seen in quite some time. Awkward and campy are the best ways to describe it since trying to put this series into one genre is a damn near impossibility, on top of the odd elements this series tries to explore.The series revolves around a rather strange junior high student with a hair fetish named Kiri Haimura, a possessor of a pair of scissors known as...a Killing Good. These Killing Goods are murder weapons for killers in the past and are passed down to their kin throughout the ages. Kiri isn\'t the most accepting of his Killing Good, but his opinion quickly changes of it when he encounters a sheltered girl with extremely long hair named Iwai Mushiyanokouji. Upon meeting her, he learns that she is cursed and her hair cannot be cut. She is known as the Hair Queen and that she is the target of a group named Gossip. Since he possesses a pair of scissors with a unique circumstance, he attempts to cut her hair with it...and their adventures begin from there.Overall, I found the strongest aspect of this series was the atmosphere built from the great animation and music. This series did a masterful job of balancing out the comedy, romance, and thriller elements to make for a strangely intriguing series. The ""awkwardness"" of this series is actually what I thought to be its greatest strength. It\'s rare to find an anime that tries to blend the genres like Crime Edge attempted, and to some extent, it succeeded. While the atmosphere was fantastic for Crime Edge, it had a lot of flaws.Generally, the characters I thought were good, but underdeveloped. Kiri was an interesting lead as an awkward, but likable protagonist. However, considering his background, I wanted to know more about his back story as well as his relationship with his father. It\'s a subject that\'s barely touched upon in the first episode and we don\'t ever see it again throughout the series. We do see some interactions between Kiri and his grandfather, but it doesn\'t do much to develop Kiri\'s character. Unfortunately, Iwai\'s character suffered the same problem. She is a likable character, but unfortunately her back story is not very well developed even though the series does give some general explanations early on and also later on in the series. Even then, it was still lacking. In my opinion, the relationship development between Kiri and Iwai was extremely awkward, almost seeming as if the director wasn\'t sure if he should be more aggressive or passive in their development...and in the end, it turns out being just awkward. The supporting cast I found to be okay. I wouldn\'t say there are a lot of memorable characters, but I will admit there are some that have interesting personality quirks. A few examples include Yamane with her awkwardly serious behavior, Emily\'s rather bipolar behavior, as well as the intriguing duo of Seigi and Kozakura, an Author with a jaded sense of justice and an Instead on a mission to keep him inline. Don\'t get me started on Kanae either, a mysterious character with...oddly enough, a lolita complex.While I did think the animation was the strongest aspect of this series, the direction of it was a bit off-putting. There are some anime out there that you can consider ecchi...and then there\'s Crime Edge...which beats you over the head with a 2x4 of ecchi and fan service. While I don\'t mind the ecchi at times and found it to work in some instances, it seems like this series went WAY overboard with it. It\'s one thing to have ecchi with older, high school characters or adults, but it\'s a completely other thing when a majority of the ecchi is revolving around children that are 14-years-old or younger. There were times I seriously felt dirty for watching this knowing the characters were so young and are being so exposed. Like I said, there were times when the ecchi and fan service worked in the context of the series, but the producers seemed to hammer it in when they didn\'t need to. I\'d even go so far as to call the production staff behind this series downright perverts.As far as the plot and story are concerned, I did find it interesting, or at the very least, interesting enough to hold my attention. However, I felt this series didn\'t quite do enough to cover the bases in regards to explaining the Murderer\'s Game. It\'s explanation is extremely fragmented and round-a-bout. While it\'s explanation does make sense, it seems very impractical and I found myself groaning at just how stupid Gossip\'s logic was concerning the Murderer\'s Game.My general thoughts on this series are...meh, it\'s okay. This series has an interesting aura about it with a nice blend of lighthearted atmosphere with extremely dark moments. It\'s animation (when taking the story seriously) is very good and the soundtrack is haunting at times. However, for everything good the atmosphere does with this series, it manages to always seem to take a step back with its horrifically padded fan service and unnecessary ecchi...thus, also resulting in some underdeveloped characters. This is a series that really had me hooked early on and kept me interested throughout, but as the series wore on, so did my patience with the director\'s antics. This series had the potential to be really good and it turned out being just average. On top of that, it left us on a mini-cliffhanger for a 2nd season. While I wasn\'t blown away by Crime Edge, I\'d be interested in checking out a 2nd season if it does happen. Recommending this series to anyone would be difficult though considering how blended the genres are in this series. If you liked a show like Tasogare Otome x Amnesia or Sankarea, you might enjoy a series like this. Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge, despite its flaws, is a rather unique series. Overall, I\'d call it average though. You can certainly do better than this series and you can certainly do worse as well. Still, it\'s at least worth trying out a few episodes to see if it is your cup of tea. a Killing Good.

The anime has a creepy theme where everything is nice and happy yet you know that something is up. The anime ties is many themes, and this makes it watchable for all audiences.Story: 7/10The story is of very mixed-genre that ties in many common anime themes. The show starts out with a creepy slice-of-life theme that is so sweet and cute, but then gains a shonen aspect that involves something like a Mirai Nikki killing game. The...show is very mixed and while bloody and creepy, it is also sweet and adorable. But unfortunately sometimes the story can get mushy and lame, so the battling and romance are inconsistent.Art: 8/10It's modern animation. Lots of colors. Not much to say here but the artwork is very good. it exceeds almost everything before its time.Sound: 8/10The soundtrack is what ties in the themes of the anime. The sound consists of slow jazz that speeds up during the creepy parts. Because of this, the music ties in perfectly with the setting and alters itself with the setting. The opening isn't much to brag about though.Character: 7/10The character designs are great. They fit the part exactly. The main character's face looks exactly like Edward Elric's. One interesting thing is that there isn't a whole lot of character background for the protagonist. We know that he likes to cut hair but we don't know much about school or anything. I kinda like this, as it makes the story stick to the plotEnjoyment: 7/10My favorite genre is shonen or action. However, I like romance as well, as long as there's no drama. This was why I loved SAO so much as it was a fantasy action theme but there was some cute love story inside of it. The Severing Crime Edge is just the same. It harbors a creepy action plot but the protagonist is doing everything for the sake of a girl that he is trying to help just to be a nice guy.Overall I really enjoyed this anime.

Did any of these words attribute to what you read the synopsis or upon first glance of the accompanying image? Well this is what the anime is truly about, not some oversimplified plot where a guy with a hair-cutting fetish protects a girl who has long uncuttable hair. That\'s just the pretence set by the first episode, and due to this pretence it shatters the actual story of the anime; a murderous life-threatening game of protector vs protectorates or the so-called Gossip.Story. If you watched the first episode, it doesn\'t do ANY justice to this anime whatsoever. The story is not about...some maniac who wants to cut hair to the point where the stupidly ignores reality. No, this story is about how ordinary people who learn about their criminal ancestors get thrown into a game of life-and-death, and the consequences stemming from each decision. But also, it is a story of Romance. Romance is portrayed quite readily throughout the anime, as a soothing position between the violence. The romantic link between the two main characters, strengthens the story\'s credibility, meaning that the boy with the hair-fetish, isn\'t protecting a girl out of simple interest of cutting hair, no that\'s just not credible. Although I\'m making a few round-a-bout points, the simple statement is thus. The story is not about what the first episode implies, it\'s much more than that. And it\'s so refreshing to see that the main character isn\'t some push-over chump who gets beaten to a pulp by every villian he encounters; he\'s actually quite a \'badass.\' So for those of you who want to watch a gore anime filled with violence, romance, and fantasy. I invite you to watch this anime.Moving on, the Art in this anime is quite buoyant (cute) in that it seems much more \'kinder\' and attempts to reconcile it\'s very dark themes with a familiarity of simpletonism (gullibility that the world is kind). In that it tries to warm the audience to the very troubling, gore scenes of the anime that nobody would\'ve guessed would become due to the very contradictory first episode. I think this is a small mistake, but in all honesty, it doesn\'t detract much from the anime much. For example, the main character, who is probably the most \'evil\' person in the anime, doesn\'t appear evil in fact he seems like a wimp more than a brute. But that\'s just a minor detail.Sound is quite well done in the anime, there are times where I felt my heart skip a beat due the circumstances of the situation, and then I realised, it was the music. The ending and opening seem to be quite well done, but it was quite confusing, for the same reason as above, it seems so melodramatic for seemingly for reason, but made perfect sense as the anime progressed.Kiri-kun, the main character. I liked the fact that he was such a strong protagonist as he started off, but in all honesty, it made no sense why he was so powerful the moment he started fighting, though the anime explains it in terms of \'killing goods\' and bloodlust and etc. It didn\'t all mesh together quite nicely. But it did explain \'kind of\' how Kiri was so strong as he started fighting the \'authors\' after his precious queen. The characterisation seems to quite strange, in that he was able to so easily move from normal life to killing and bloodshed with no conscience and then ironically in the final episode states that authors have ""no sense of life and death."" It pricked my sides a bit in that regard, but just another minor detail. On a side note, the narrator at times seems to be quite worthless, and side characters in the anime seem to be almost ephemeral, you only ever see them once. The characterisation of the \'hair queen\' seems to be almost impossible, how could a girl who has never had outside contact with the rest of the world, magically blend in to society within hours? And then go on to having a boyfriend, and becoming a popular girl a school. Very incredible. But she was no doubt crucial to the story, I believe the author wanted to show that she was re-integrating into society, but at such a fast rate seems to be impossible. While it did try and show her struggling at times, it didn\'t seem to be any difficult hurdle; in that it was passed almost instantaneously. Lastly though, Kiri-kun simply becomes another overpowered character such as ichigo in Bleach, while it\'s awesome to see strong characters, allowing them to actually have wit in fighting situations or overcome difficult fights without giving another power would be much more interesting. So characterisation is very poorly done.Enjoyment, I loved the anime, though I can see its innumerable flaws. It has many, many mistakes which detracted the feel of the anime, and for some scenes it seems like it was entirely useless in explaining the anime\'s story or revealing the past. So I can say that I really enjoyed the anime, its story, and the romance and to a lesser extent its characters.So the verdict. Due to the impossible characterisation of the characters, as well as the purposeless art details, I would give the anime a 5. But the anime has quite a good story, it had great depth, and had a thorough explanation of everything that occurred in the anime, as in it explained the enemies\' powers, whom they got it from, etc. It had great detail and put great effort into putting detail into its story and overall the anime is a 8.If you\'ve read this far, as always, thanks you for reading! some maniac who wants to cut hair to the point where the stupidly ignores reality. No, this story is about how ordinary people who learn about their criminal ancestors get thrown into a game of life-and-death, and the consequences stemming from each decision.

I liked the fact that he was such a strong protagonist as he started off, but in all honesty, it made no sense why he was so powerful the moment he started fighting, though the anime explains it in terms of \'killing goods\' and bloodlust and etc. It didn\'t all mesh together quite nicely. But it did explain \'kind of\' how Kiri was so strong as he started fighting the \'authors\' after his precious queen. The characterisation seems to quite strange, in that he was able to so easily move from normal life to killing and bloodshed with no conscience and then ironically in the final episode states that authors have ""no sense of life and death."" It pricked my sides a bit in that regard, but just another minor detail. On a side note, the narrator at times seems to be quite worthless, and side characters in the anime seem to be almost ephemeral, you only ever see them once. The characterisation of the \'hair queen\' seems to be almost impossible, how could a girl who has never had outside contact with the rest of the world, magically blend in to society within hours? And then go on to having a boyfriend, and becoming a popular girl a school. Very incredible. But she was no doubt crucial to the story, I believe the author wanted to show that she was re-integrating into society, but at such a fast rate seems to be impossible. While it did try and show her struggling at times, it didn\'t seem to be any difficult hurdle; in that it was passed almost instantaneously. Lastly though, Kiri-kun simply becomes another overpowered character such as ichigo in Bleach, while it\'s awesome to see strong characters, allowing them to actually have wit in fighting situations or overcome difficult fights without giving another power would be much more interesting. So characterisation is very poorly done.Enjoyment, I loved the anime, though I can see its innumerable flaws. It has many, many mistakes which detracted the feel of the anime, and for some scenes it seems like it was entirely useless in explaining the anime\'s story or revealing the past. So I can say that I really enjoyed the anime, its story, and the romance and to a lesser extent its characters.So the verdict. Due to the impossible characterisation of the characters, as well as the purposeless art details, I would give the anime a 5. But the anime has quite a good story, it had great depth, and had a thorough explanation of everything that occurred in the anime, as in it explained the enemies\' powers, whom they got it from, etc. It had great detail and put great effort into putting detail into its story and overall the anime is a 8.If you\'ve read this far, as always, thanks you for reading!', '“Kiri-kun, you’re the first one to kill me!”If I had to describe this anime in 3 words, it’d easily be “out of place”. It seems they tried to incorporate so many things into this short series, leaving you with a very fast-paced, poorly executed mess of out-of-place fanservice, actions, animations, and story elements.Story: (4 / 10)If you read the synopsis for this series, and you’re expecting an intense killing game involving these cursed “killing goods”, then you might as well leave right away, because this is not at all what the show is about.Well, that’s not completely true as this deadly game is...the underlying (or overlying?) plot for most things that happen in the series, but there’s no progression in the story, or any kind of wrap-up at the end.In each episode, the two main characters, Kiri & Iwai, will go somewhere, be attacked by an author (an owner of killing goods), defeat them, and then it’s over.The story is littered with plot-holes, and out-of-place events, but one thing that really bugs me is how all the authors talk about how they must be the one killing the Hair Queen (since killing her will grant you any wish), but none of them actually do anything...There’s more or less one character in the entire show who actually tries to kill Iwai, but he has about 5 minutes of screen time, tops, and not a single line of dialog. All of the other characters just seem to dawdle, or just attack Kiri instead.As an example, Byouinzaka and her sister took care of, and were the only ones (of the authors atleast) who knew the whereabouts of Iwai, yet for years they didn’t ever think about killing her, and when Kiri shows up they’re actively trying to protect her instead?The plot is filled with things like this, and there were several times where the MC should’ve died, but he didn’t because then they obviously couldn’t continue the series...Art: (4 / 10)This series was at most pretty average looking. There’s really not that much detail in neither backgrounds nor characters, and for a show so focused on hair, it doesn’t feel like they put much time into making it look good at all.Yet again, a lot of animations feel very out-of-place, and don’t fit in with the voicing or with what’s currently going on. In fact, it made for a pretty annoying experience, having these “off”-feeling animations constantly ruin any mood or tension set by the ongoing events.Another thing that bothered me was the fact that every fighting scene in the first 3/4 would be saturated, with only a tint of color, which would vary from fight to fight. Then, when the fight was over, all color would return. Was this the effect of the killing goods, because if it was, that’s yet another thing that was never explained. However, it seems during the final few fights, they dropped this effect, and just kept all the color.And then ofcourse we have the fanservice. Oh god, the amount of fanservice in this show completely ruin the notion of it all being a dark killing game, and it makes for pretty awkward situations.Sound: (5 / 10)The opening theme, “Unmei no Ori” performed by Aimi, would be perfect at setting the tone for the anime, if the show was actually as dark and sinister as it tries to be. The ending theme, on the other hand, is a rather happy song, yet it feels more fitting to the series, than the opening does.As for the voice acting, I can’t really say it was very good, to be honest. As I mentioned earlier, a lot of the voicing didn’t fit in with the animations, but even at other times there were times when it would just feel off.I think the biggest cause of this was that the voice actors were all very “stale”, as if they were actually trying to hold in the emotions that they should’ve used. There’s barely any emotion among any of the characters (with some exceptions, ofcourse), a lot of the dialog just feels dull, and coupled with the out-of-place animations, it all makes for an almost painful experience...Characters: (4 / 10)Honestly, the characters aren’t anything spectacular either. There’s barely any development, and a lot of interactions between characters are just weird. It seems they tried to give each character their own unique characteristic, and they really try to force it onto you, so that you’ll really notice it.For instance, Kiri’s obsession with hair (and not just cutting it, as is first implied), is often forced into scenes, and he will kiss & lick it, among other things, which makes for even more out-of-place content. In fact, there’s quite a lot of random licking in this show...It also seems like they wanted to fit in as many stereotypes as they could manage. Ranging from the lolicon professor, to the cold-hearted sister, to a cute and innocent police officer, as well as the tsundere classmate, just to name a few. The problem with this, is that most of them are so poorly done.A perfect example is the tsundere classmate. At completely inappropriate situations, she will shout some generic tsundere line, with the most emotionless voice acting and most off animations ever, and it’s very painful to watch, every time she does this...Enjoyment: (3 / 10)I feel like the concept of this show really had potential, and it’s really too bad to see it ruined by the sloppy writing and execution. I think it needed to not be nearly as fast paced, and thus also be longer (~24 episodes), while also fixing much of the out-of-place stuff that plagues the series.Granted, there were some characters (Emily) I liked, and some of the fighting scenes and abilities shown were pretty cool (Rulebook), but it all fell apart, sadly.There were also a few funny moments for me, but unfortunately I can’t say these were probably intended by the creators, as it was more about the less than average execution of some scenes...So, this is yet another show I personally wouldn’t even touch with a 10-foot pole... the underlying (or overlying?) plot for most things that happen in the series, but there’s no progression in the story, or any kind of wrap-up at the end.In each episode, the two main characters, Kiri & Iwai, will go somewhere, be attacked by an author (an owner of killing goods), defeat them, and then it’s over.The story is littered with plot-holes, and out-of-place events, but one thing that really bugs me is how all the authors talk about how they must be the one killing the Hair Queen (since killing her will grant you any wish), but none of them actually do anything...There’s more or less one character in the entire show who actually tries to kill Iwai, but he has about 5 minutes of screen time, tops, and not a single line of dialog.

As well as refraining from using strict numbers.Story: Good (about a 7)The storyline is actually not that bad, and it doesnt contain a mountain of plot-holes like in other series. The concept is rather interesting as well, as the person who kills the ""Hair Queen"" gets their wish fulfilled, and this is turned into a game to see who kills her. Though the concept of a murder game is not original, at all, because anime...like Deadman Wonderland and Mirai Nikki came first, and honestly are a lot more brutal and nerve-wrecking than Crime Edge. However, the story wont fail to entertain you and it still creates a nice blend of macabre-like themes and dark elements adding its flavor to the show, and giving it more of a murder game feel.Another aspect of the story that adds to Crime Edge\'s appeal is how the characters fight...as they wield a murdering tool from one of their ancestors....and fights range from people using knives...to people fighting with syringes and scissors.Though this concept is not completely original  either, its taken into a new light and adds nice suspense to the story. Though, the reason im giving it this score is because of 2 things: 1) even though they are middle schoolers, this anime has an unbelievable amount of sexual innuendos leading to things that shouldnt be censored, censored; and 2) The first 3 episodes of the anime were honestly, a turn-off. You must bear for those 3, before wanting to drop, and continue to watch, it gets better.Art: Good ( about a 7)the art style for this anime fit the overall mood. the art was down in dark, sometimes gloomy colors, adding to the macabre-like appeal to the show.The animation is not disappointing and it rather remarkable when it comes to the fight scenes which really is exciting. Though, if you notice, on some backgrounds they were kinda ""lazy"" and inconsistent in quality on and that also applies to the background characters too.Sound: Good (about a 7)the sound is pretty good overall. the OP fits the show and is actually quite catchy, as you would want to listen to it every single time you watch the anime...and not skip over it. The ED is so-and-so, you can love it or hate it. The OST is not too shabby, though some music seems a bit out of place during key scenes. The voices for the characters are not bad, Iwai\'s voice is probably the best overall, and the other voices are not annoying or atrocious so its fine in that department.Character: Very Good (about an 8)Dansai Buri no Crime Edge is soo weird to tell you the truth. But its out of this weirdness that these characters are oddly appealing. Its hard to put into words why you like these characters so much but you just do for whoever knows why. The character\'s personalities themselves are not too special, though they are different and you have to appreciate that. You have Kiri here who will do anything for Iwai to save her, a true gentleman in that regard, but has an extreme hair fetish, like he REALLY loves hair, no joke. This is just an example of the quirkiness of these characters, yet you dont hate or dislike Kiri, but you guiltily like him, if you know what i mean?Enjoyment: Very Good (about an 8)i do say, this was a weirdly enjoyable series. Despite its overly use of sexual innuendos and ""secretly sexually-appealing"" female characters ( i use quotes because they are not really sexually appealing, or at least you dont want to think of them in that way, yet they are)....Dansai Buri no Crime Edge is a great watch. It has a nice blend of serious, plot driven scenes, and good humor that isnt forced or out of place. The fight scenes are really something to see, as the fluid animation really perks up these key scenes; plus its really cool seeing someone fight deathmatches with a pair of scissors.Overall: Very Good (about an 8)mentioned before about the characters, the same is with the whole series. You dont know why you like it, you just do. its weirdness and eccentric-ness latches onto you and before you know it you are hooked. Like a guilty pleasure of an anime to watch. I will admit, i had my doubts that i would like it this much, but dont take my word on it, watch it for yourself and see what you think. I will say this series is a memorable one and is personally one of my tops. This will be memorable for you too; for better,or for worst.So think you for reading my review and i hoped it helped you in your anime watching decisions. like Deadman Wonderland and Mirai Nikki came first, and honestly are a lot more brutal and nerve-wrecking than Crime Edge.

Kiri has magical scissors which allow him to cut the Hair Queens very long non-cutable hair. Through this they become a semi couple and Kiri...has to protect her against her enemies, other people with so called Killing Goods, just like Kiris magical scissors.Problem though is, that this game of hunters trying to kill the Hair Queen is presented in a very strange way, as Dansai Bunri switches from dark to light in a blink of an eye.The characters do silly moe reactions, the overall tone is inconsistent and borderline retarded at times.If this was some silly school anime with cute girls doing cute things it would have been okay.But the themes in Dansai Bunri try to be more serious and on the darker side, so it utterly fails to create any sort of atmosphere.The pacing is pretty bad, switching from very slow to very fast, but overall felt rushed by the end. The makers come along as amateurs who have no idea how to properly tell a story, stretching some scenes into infinite while rushing everything else as if they were in a hurry.Not only that but they also have a hard time giving the themes and world enough time to sink properly in. Not that it would matter if we knew more about the lore behind it since the show throws it all out at any point in time they squeeze in slapstick and moe jokes...Because of that the overall plot feels very weak and nonsensical. And not only that it also ends in a preview for a second season...Good though were some of the darker elements of the show, it had plenty of blood and A LOT of sexual tension.It was my personal guilty pleasure of the show, since it was pretty bold and would fit in into a gothic like show like Dansai Bunri tries to be. But as mentioned it couldn't really deliver in that department.Characters:Kiri is our protagonist, a middleschooler with magic scissors and a Hairfetish (how convenient).There isn't much to say about him, we don’t really know much about his life or ideals, other than his past has something to do with the most brutal murderer of all history and he is love with the main heroine Iwai. His character is very childish and naive and I cannot say he is a good protagonist.Iwai is the so called Hairqueen and besides being nice to people who try to kill her, she is also in love with Kiri. She is weak and never does anything throughout the show but being saved by Kiri.There are also a bunch of different characters but I don’t really find it necessary to mention any of them, as they are all quite dull and only have their gimmicks that define their characters. Most of them don’t even show up more than 1 or a few times.The entire cast feels very childish and panders to a younger audience, or mental children, since the themes of the show are not suited for kids.It’s such a strange dichotomy. The show has all this sexual tension, gore and darkness going on, but is presented in such a moe, slice of life way. The cast is retarded and they all act so cartoony it’s really weird.Art and AnimationThe art in Dansai Bunri is nothing to be in awe. Everything looks very generic and bland, no great talents worked on this and Studio Gokumi isn't really known for their high profile stuff.The animation quality isn't bad but also not great. It has some good action scenes here and there but mostly wastes its screen time on fanservice and silly chibi faces.The backgrounds are all totally uninteresting and just blur in with the rest, no effort was made to create an immersive world with great gothic art that fits its themes.The worst though must be the character designs. They all look really cheap. Their faces totally deformed and some of the look just atrocious.Why does Kiri have such a bad haircut if he is into cutting hair?I credit them for giving Iwai a different hairstyle every other episode, but that’s it. The character designs are really bad and childish looking. At least they are sometimes moe.Besides the bad character designs, the censoring (in the TV version) is also terrible. Bloody scenes were in black and white, and the fanservice we got had “magical white light” shining over it so we don’t see what’s going on... sad sad sad. But I will check out the BD version to see if at least that one has no censorship.Sound:At least the sound department doesn't suck.We get okay voice actors nothing great to mention here.But the opening is one of my favorites of the season, it’s not great or anything but pretty catchy. The ending was also quite okay, but not as good as the openingThe rest of the soundtrack was neither bad nor good, it was quite solid but not really outstanding or worth listening to.Enjoyment:Though Dansai Bunri was a pretty bad show with a lot of problems I still could enjoy it here and there.At one point I almost dropped it but the Loli Arc got me into it again.The best was probably the fanservice and sexual tension it had to offer. Some really weird fetishes were going on here and the scenes were sometimes pretty intense. Too bad it was censored.It was also quite reckless with killing people or at least injuring them really badly. For such a childish show it was pretty grim, I enjoyed that as well.Scores:Story 2/10Premise and Setting 0 (silly premise with bad execution)Pacing -1 (rushed)Complexity 0 (so simple and unexplored)Plausibility -1 (plotholes and overall coherent issues)Conclusion -1 (No real ending just a preview for season 2)Characters 4/10Personality -1 (weak)Behavior and Chemistry 0 (silly but sometimes enjoyable)Development and Progression 0 (very undetectable, but not entirely absent)Motivation and Backdrop 0 (also weak but there)Likability 0 (no one stood out)Art and Animation 3/10Artstyle 0 (generic)Quality 0 (okay)Background -1 (so boring)Character Designs -1 (really bad)Visual Effects 0 (okay but censorship was annoying!)Sound 5/10Voice Acting 0 (standard)Opening and Ending 0 (solid opening and ending song)Soundtrack 0 ( not great but listenable)Sound Effects 0 (average)Enjoyment 4/10Art and Animation -1 (too cheap to enjoy)Sound 0 (too average to enjoy)Story and Content 0 (mess but fanservice kept me going)Characters 0 (so-so)Value 0 (forgettable)Conclusion:Wasted ideas and themes is all that Dansai Bunri is. If you are looking for a good action show, turn away. If you want some weird fanservice you might get something out of this. But overall it was a pretty bad show.Pros:+ Bold sexual scenes+ sometimes bad ass violence and actionCons:- weak story presentation- amateurish production values- bland characters- no real ending3,6/10~4/10  (Bad) has to protect her against her enemies, other people with so called Killing Goods, just like Kiris magical scissors.Problem though is, that this game of hunters trying to kill the Hair Queen is presented in a very strange way, as Dansai Bunri switches from dark to light in a blink of an eye.The characters do silly moe reactions, the overall tone is inconsistent and borderline retarded at times.If this was some silly school anime with cute girls doing cute things it would have been okay.But the themes in Dansai Bunri try to be more serious and on the darker side, so it utterly fails to create any sort of atmosphere.The pacing is pretty bad, switching from very slow to very fast, but overall felt rushed by the end.

For such a childish show it was pretty grim, I enjoyed that as well.Scores:Story 2/10Premise and Setting 0 (silly premise with bad execution)Pacing -1 (rushed)Complexity 0 (so simple and unexplored)Plausibility -1 (plotholes and overall coherent issues)Conclusion -1 (No real ending just a preview for season 2)Characters 4/10Personality -1 (weak)Behavior and Chemistry 0 (silly but sometimes enjoyable)Development and Progression 0 (very undetectable, but not entirely absent)Motivation and Backdrop 0 (also weak but there)Likability 0 (no one stood out)Art and Animation 3/10Artstyle 0 (generic)Quality 0 (okay)Background -1 (so boring)Character Designs -1 (really bad)Visual Effects 0 (okay but censorship was annoying!)Sound 5/10Voice Acting 0 (standard)Opening and Ending 0 (solid opening and ending song)Soundtrack 0 ( not great but listenable)Sound Effects 0 (average)Enjoyment 4/10Art and Animation -1 (too cheap to enjoy)Sound 0 (too average to enjoy)Story and Content 0 (mess but fanservice kept me going)Characters 0 (so-so)Value 0 (forgettable)Conclusion:Wasted ideas and themes is all that Dansai Bunri is. If you are looking for a good action show, turn away. If you want some weird fanservice you might get something out of this. But overall it was a pretty bad show.Pros:+ Bold sexual scenes+ sometimes bad ass violence and actionCons:- weak story presentation- amateurish production values- bland characters- no real ending3,6/10~4/10  (Bad)"", '.........Hummm, that was interesting to watch, so how could I describe this dark drama, I\'d probably say that it\'s fair enough to watch. Anyways (oops, my bad the adverb ""anyway""  wasn\'t suppose to pluralize)I kinda find this dark drama a bit interesting since this anime has a combination of the following: S & M, perverse simulated sex, suspense and horror all combine to make up for this anime\'s story, which is why I call it a ""Dark Drama,"" thought the subjects of this anime\'s focus was on the curse objects called ""Killing Goods"" one can\'t help that the main feature was on Iwai. Now...the story may have some similarities with your usual damsel in distress,  Iwai fate was a bit different since there are some episode where she has to save her knight in shinning scissor, Kiri. I did mentioned about this anime\'s combinations of its story, the S & M part here is about them author satisfying their blood lust on their instead, now that where the perverse simulated sex comes to play, the problem is  that it\'s just wasn\'t intense enough though it was a bit gruesome to see them instead taking the suffering and not getting killed, then again watching such scene was like watching porn were the orgasm was obviously fake. So let\'s get down to my rating for each of this anime\'s category:Story, art, overall: Fair 6.At one point I really like the story\'s dark drama theme, however, there are thing that where not explain, like, how did Iwai\'s hair stopped growing in ep. 10 and what are the factors that dictate as to how her cursed hair grows? Why didn\'t the Byōinzaka sisters do way with Iwai in the first place and take the wish for themselves? Also, why does the Byōinzaka sisters refers to themselves as twins (ep. 2) when they\'re neither identical nor fraternal? Overall, though the anime is good, it has a lot of loose ends, for the art.....I just have nothing much to say, though the Iwai is cute, her fanservice was just too pervasive for me.Sound, character and enjoyment: Good 7.I like the opening theme, but not the closing. I like the VA\'s who did Kiri, Iwai, Hoko and Emi. The character\'s....... well, I like it that Iwai is this cute damsel in distress and Kiri being this knight holding a shiny scissor. but as for the Byōinzaka sisters, one can\'t determine if they\'re the good girls or bad girls waiting for the right moment, same with the professor, let\'s face most of the characters here are also part of this anime\'s loose ends, even so, this anime still has that sweet side of Iwai that make this anime good enough to enjoy.So, will this anime have a season 2, well, it looks like it.

The animation quality isn't eye catching at all, somehow around the ending episodes of the anime they added so much 'shine' to the character' eyes that it would just look out of place. The characters are; overall, pretty good. I cant complain, they're down to earth (most of them) and seem relatable.When ep1 came out it seemed pretty normal and basic to me. Around ep3 or it went into that 'kill the other guys...that are like you' plot *cough* Mirai Nikki *cough*; then my enjoyment picked up because I find killing games entertaining. All in all, the anime overall was pretty good it all flowed nicely; and if there was a season two I would watch it. that are like you' plot *cough* Mirai Nikki *cough*; then my enjoyment picked up because I find killing games entertaining.

He wants to cut sweet lady hair to satisfy himself and for that purpose he carries a scissor And one day he meets The Queen of Hair- a girl who couldn't cut her hair. Sounds like a perfect match right?Story: This story is one of those that messes up the audiences emotions, it's hard to think that the mangaka pitied any of the characters. The story elements fits together and have enormous plot twists. The Romance scenes...of this one is very superb. Like it or not hints of ecchi and harem can be found. The whole story is a balance between horror,cuteness and psychology-an unusual combination. However,Combined together it gave out an interesting story which cannot be found everyday. Also Sadism plays a significant role in the story setting- so seeing very cute characters in a way that you can't expect is very rare and ironical. Horror is also main conduit in here- however i think it's because of the character setting it didn't seem to be scary but rather mind boggling.Art: Art is good. There was a tokyo ghoul reference-- i won't mention which episode. Characters were drawn beautifully- i especially liked Iwa's eyes and hair- that unique rich green colour was so eye candy. The atmosphere around this one was very strong- the scenic pieces were drawn well and it's hard to explain but you just got to feel it to know it yourself.Sound: The opening and ending were average- nevertheless had a good meaning. Some of the soundtracks were created to suit the emotions and the atmosphere. The Seiyus did well on this one- especially Kiri's voice was done very well.Character: Unless you count Gasai Yuno it's very hard to find Yandere characters in random anime. Mostly because when involving that type you gotta deal with a lot of settings change and mood. There were characters that looked minor but played the most important roles in the anime like that Police lady is a good example. Most characters were simply adorable and the male lead was a gentleman he vaguely reminded me of Maebara Keiichi. Also sadists/masochists/perverts/witches and religious freaks can be found so prepare yourself for a good mind boggle. Latter to be said about the two main characters- the hair goddess is a very cute- caring girl who is cursed. The severing scissor guy is the most surprising.Enjoyment: Due to the setting changes and epic plot twists i'd have to say i really enjoyed this one even though it was very fast paced. There was some light humour and reverse scenes which you would never expect and of course would make you vomit(I'm not literally talking about the gore here)Overall: The whole anime puts out the moral that some obsessions are genetic than habitual, actually it could be true. It also derived a huge realities in life which conflicted with the fantasy elements. You could say that the mangaka is very judgemental and open minded about the society.  Obviously there was an epic cliffhanger in the last two episodes and as this was a promotive piece so you couldn't expect much.

It got a bit predictable towards the end, but there are plenty of unexpected surprises that make up for it. The episodes all felt connected, and the right amount of comedic moments were mixed in with action scenes, yet the plot continuously moved on. Some topics explored...in the anime may make some people uncomfortable, but can usually be overlooked. Overall, the ending was pretty good and delivered enough closure, but it hinted at a second season that has yet to be announced (unfortunately).The style of the art is nothing too special, but it is memorable and the characters are recognizable. Personally, I feel that the style matches the storyline pretty well, and the designs for each character were drawn well. They were unique as well, so it was easy to tell different characters apart. The only thing I have to complain about is that most of the fight scenes were not fully colored, and only used a few basic shades of color. The animators probably did that for effect (or they got lazy), but either way, I would've liked to see the fight scenes colored.The theme song for this anime is one of the best that I've ever heard. The sound effects are done well, and the background music doesn't take away from the dialogue either. It was nothing breathtaking, but nothing to complain about either.Most of the characters were easily likable, even the ones that appear to be 'evil'. None of them were Mary Sues or Gary Stus, and they each had their own flaws and special characteristics. The amount of characters was just enough so that I didn't have to scramble around to remember everyone's name.Honestly speaking, this is one of my favorite animes by far. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn't have too many triggers they need to be wary of, and I think that many people would enjoy this series. Everyone I've recommended this anime to so far has come back to be with positive response. Unfortunately, the fanbase for this anime isn't very large since it's not that popular, but hopefully people will continue to enjoy it. in the anime may make some people uncomfortable, but can usually be overlooked.

It takes the typical “people battle to the death” concept that we’ve seen with Fate/Zero and Mirai Nikki and makes it unique. Whether that’s bad or good has completely polarized the few people that bothered watching this. Though the viewers who would argue that Crime Edge is a “bad” show have taken majority, I take my place with my minority.I’m not going to argue with the majority because Crime Edge really is chocked full with flaws. Regarding the plot, well, it’s essentially pretty poorly told. The story is full of rushed and vague plot points that are...never fully explained, let alone even made use of. It brings up seemingly important characters and scenes that never amount to anything in the end. Essentially, the writing for the story was pretty lazy and it left a lot to be desired and not in a good way.The show also gets way too caught up with its own fetishes. It’s not Highschool of the Dead bad, but it’s just up there. It breaks a lot of the tension and it’s quite uncomfortable watching whole scenes dedicated to them. I don’t want to see couples licking whips or girls licking syringe wounds alright?So even with that said, why did I fall in the minority? Why was I able to finish this show?Because everything about the show, aside from the plot, is so oddly enthralling. The atmosphere is ambiguous and mystifying. The delicately crisp animation, the beautiful dream-like artwork and use of monochromatic color palettes, the edgy cinematography and an absolutely gorgeous soundtrack drew me in. Every character intrigued me with their own quirky feats and Kiri and Iwai certainly made a very charming couple. Antagonists and side characters are well characterized and given enough depth to draw them away from merely being plot devices. The action scenes are also really well choreographed and they never last longer than they need to. The show is loaded with a lot of energy, a lot of charm and a lot of heart.From what I thought would only be mindless entertainment, it had much more substance than I thought and some truly beautiful moments.Do I recommend?: Crime Edge suffers from a very weak and underwhelming story and it tends to get too caught up with its fetishes. However, the show has enough charm and heart and it never has a dull moment. If you can tolerate a weak story and fetishes then Crime Edge is worth watching. never fully explained, let alone even made use of.

I suppose it\'s because I didn\'t hear anything terrible about it, and it exceeded most people\'s expectations (granted, nobody had high expectations from this show to begin with). But after 10 episodes I can honestly say this is a very average series.The plot of this show is what makes it stand out from the rest: it\'s about people with weird fetishes fighting each other with special ""killing goods"" to save/kill a princess. I\'ll admit that doesn\'t sound all that bad, but sadly after 10 episodes it just didn\'t go anywhere. With each passing episode the...show got more and more boring, more and more stale, until I just forgot about it. If you are someone who isn\'t all that interested in the plot, do yourself a favor and save some time by watching something else. The plot doesn\'t get any better than what you see in the summary.The characters aren\'t very memorable. Aside from Iwai who is cute as hell, nobody else stands out at all. Kiri isn\'t very interesting, the two sisters have a decent backstory but aside from that fail to entertain, and nobody else gets much screen time. None of the villains so far are any good either (except maybe that blind girl we meet in episode 4, but she hasn\'t shown up in the last 6 episodes).The production values on this show are higher than I expected. It has very nice animation and a pretty decent soundtrack. I especially like the opening song. Sadly, this isn\'t enough to make up for the lackluster story and characters though.Don\'t get me wrong, this isn\'t a bad show or anything, I just wouldn\'t spend my time watching it. There are literally hundreds of shows that deserve your time more than this. If you have nothing, and I mean nothing else to watch, you won\'t hate this show, but you\'ll probably leave not all that happy with it either.Overall: 63/100 show got more and more boring, more and more stale, until I just forgot about it.

Case in point: Madoka (2011), Attack on Titan (2013), and Kill La Kill (2013). Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge however, is not one of those animes.Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge was the least entertaining anime of Spring 2013. I will give the originality of the story credit, sadly though originality alone is not enough to make this an even decent anime. The beginning three-fourths of the show walk the line between entertaining and complete boredom. Only after episode 8 do you finally realize that you\'re...completely tired of this show but your so invested in it that you can\'t help but watch it till the end. Besides for the execution of the story, the characters that are suppose to drive the story fail to connect emotionally on any basic level. The main hero of the show Kiri and his matching scissor that can cut anything bring nothing to the show but an example that even the weak can put up a fight when their love is in danger. When it comes to the Queen of hair her inability to protect herself plus her constant cries of Kiri Kun make you wish that writers will just get rid of her. It\'s rare that by the end of an anime I find myself wishing both the main characters would just die. The other minor characters, though far more interesting and less annoying then the two main characters, provide little to nothing to the story and after awhile become forgettable. The fight scenes, though animated decently, barely provide enough excitement to keep interest in the show. No matter how hard you try finding a good point about this show is almost impossible. If there was one good point about Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge is as previously stated is the concept of the show and the originality of the story.The tragedy that was Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge is enough to temporarily turn anyone away from shows in which a scissor is used as either a weapon or a plot driver. For those who haven\'t seen Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge but are thinking of watching it I sincerely recommend watching something else. completely tired of this show but your so invested in it that you can\'t help but watch it till the end.

But sadly, it did'nt live to those expectations.Dansai buri no Crime edge has a really unique story you won't necessarily see very commonly. Coming back from oxford, i'd like to say that this anime deserves more than just a merit, it is unique but however can be considered REALLY weird as it is mainly about people with killing goods, and so the main male protagonist has to protect his loving cutesy girl Iwai from being killed by the cursed people with killing goods.Story 10: Mentioned above, being lazy...as i am today.IN A NUTSHELL VERSION= WEIRD BOY LIKES TO CUT HAIR OF LONG HAIR GIRL AND KILLS PEOPLE WITH SCISSORS/FETISH FOR HAIR CUTTINGArt 9: The art is respectable and beautiful at times, but not to the wonderful or perhaps trash extent.Sound 5: One of its biggest issues, i've never encountered any good music so far and this is a big problem. I would not like to hear the cutting of hair every episode as it makes me feel REALLY gay.Character 7: Main boy character, brave at times, Sadly weird fetish is weird.Iwai the girl with a curse of long growing hair is quite annoying and sexual at times, providing the viewers with a weird/ yet good feeling.Enjoyment 7: Was weird at first, but then got better, leading to a overall of 8.

Lol~"", ""Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge (The Serving Crime Edge) is a dramatic battle series submersed in a number of sexual fetishes. Despite that last statement, this series isn't really ecchi except for a few select moments. Gotta admit, I like this series even though it is pretty cheesy in many instances. The action is pretty over exaggerated which is somewhat funny but adds great entertainment. You'll get a kick out of this series for it's exaggerated fight scenes and budding romance.Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge primarily focuses on character development more than it does on fighting scenes. Maybe it would of been a better...idea to focus more on the action and survival. The characters are made up of your basic cast from most shonen series. the headstrong white knight MC (Kiri) and the helpless danzel in distress (Iwai). The arch nemesis that has never really tried to kill the main characters but constantly says they're enemies along with a loyal and mentally disturbed partner (Byouinzaka sisters). There are a cast of other below average characters and the only ones that seem to really stand out to me is the blind pianist Hitomi and her deaf Instead, Houichi. Sadly neither of them get any real screen time and are just seen for about eight minutes in total. The characters don't really stand out and are each pretty generic including the cheesy  romance between Kiri and Iwai. Their relationship is exactly what you would expect from your average action/romance series. Alone, each character aren't exactly anything special but their interactions is where the entertainment comes in.Despite how serious Crime Edge attempts to be, what really seems to be the most enjoyable part of the show are the slightly comical battles. The fight scenes are actually somewhat funny. Just imagine seeing a dramatic battle set in a dark hallway at sundown between a guy holding a pair of scissors and a girl holding a needle. That's pretty much the first battle in this series and it might be as funny as what you're imagining. Crime Edge is actually a pretty enjoyable show to watch if you're not a hardcore shonen anime viewer or a very critical judge of anime. It's a bunch of fun to watch and I recommend it.

I had a difficult time watching it without having thoughts that distracted from the show:  thoughts that contained words like ""contrived"" and ""juvenile"".  It just seems amateurish.Some shows can mix multiple genres and come out okay.  This one doesn\'t.  The shifts from one thing to the next are so sudden they destroy any attempt at suspension of disbelief.  I would try to develop the idea that I liked the show.  That idea was repeatedly repulsed when the show...shifted.  For example, one minute the show may be trying a sweet, innocent teenage romance thing.  The next minute it is sexualizing bizarre things like scissors, hair, strangulation, and riding crops.  The breath fog only makes it seem more perverse.For me, that was the biggest issue.

I was sold pretty much by synopsis read on MyAnimeList and how my friend described it – along with a video excerpt. It looked and sounded like it would be a very interesting decent fantasy romp but it failed in all the right places in the wrongest of ways.You've probably read the synopsis. Interesting, no? Well, that’s all Crime Edge has going for itself.First of all, as interesting as the story is, it manages to seriously hamper it’s fresh plot with cliches and plot devices one can normally see in 3rd-rate Shounen anime and manga. The setting is basically for...a ‘survival game’ so you know this is a Seinen production. Not only the characters but the plot devices also have some of the mos ridiculous names I’ve ever heard even by Japanese standards. One of the main characters’ name is Mushiyanokouji. Why? The weapons used by characters are called ‘Killing Goods’. Ew. And the Killing Goods have their own stupid names: ‘The Sledgehammer of Decomposition/Obliteration’, ‘The Fucking Name of the Anime’, etc. What is going on here?!The concept of the show is interesting for a survival game but the plot is all sorts of fucked up and not fully thought out. Contradictions in the plot here and there are very obvious. Melodramatic scenes are shoehorned in for the sake of plot advancement but it instead just devalues the characters motivations for participation. My biggest problem with the show is that at many points the MC is shown to be having a conflict with his urge to kill (caused by his Killing Goods) but this is massively shat on in the second last episode when he powers up and gives in to his urges but… his new power is augmented pain. Talk about an anti-climax.The characters also cast a huge shadow on the worth of this show. They feel like mannequins that are easily manipulated to go out of character to suit the show’s emotional ‘twists’. There’s barely any fleshing out of the characters and development is almost non-existent.The animation is decent. Nothing special. Though I guess this is the place to voice some idiotic design concerns. The scissor the MC uses (his Killing Goods) has to be the lamest weapon I’ve ever seen. They are the bluntest sharp object I’ve ever seen. Making it scissor-COMB was also a dumb also. You’re telling me a murderer went around cutting up people with a damned scissor-COMB? What? And the MC is practically hopping all over the place cutting enemies up like a samurai.Also, the fan-service is annoying. Jiggly breasts, domination, lewd blood transfusions, sensual hair cutting, LICKING HAIR, and a 5 minute scene with a bandaged naked loli playing around with a bare Mushiankhsadhkaswhateverthenameis. I don’t mind fan-service (and most of the time even welcome it) but this is just tasteless.The music is also pretty meh. I guess. I don’t know.

I, like many others, love the first season of The Devil is a Part-Timer. It was a genuinely funny and quirky breath of fresh air in the isekai/reverse isekai space with loveable characters and beautiful animation and it still is a classic standing on its merit. But I was sniffing a lot of copium during the first part of season two and my supplies have run out for part two so at some point during episode three I realised that I just don’t care about this series anymore.Of course, animation played a huge role in my...disinterest. Gone are White Fox Studio’s gorgeous and expressive character animations only to be replaced by Studio 3Hz’s flat, lifeless storyboarding and bland, barely scribbled-together character designs. The Devil is a Part-Timer doesn’t just look like every other cash-grab light novel isekai now, but it also feels like one. It happily blends in with the other low-effort isekai trash airing this summer season and that's sad.The voice actors are trying their best to keep the original spirit of the first season alive and they do to some extent because they are excellent, but the damage has already been done. Characters just feel awkward to look at now like they’re doppelgängers trying to convince us they’re the originals. Even the pacing has degraded. I’m not sure if that's entirely the anime’s fault or if that’s just how the light novel goes, but the story has become so bland I can barely stop myself from spacing out or skipping dialogue.I truly think we as an anime community might be to blame for collectively wishing on that cursed monkey's paw. Maybe The Devil is a Part-Timer should've stayed dead? Well, at least we have the first season to watch and we can pretend the second was made by… I don’t know, Redditers? They seem to like ruining things.4/10 Disappointment disinterest.

Oh, how wrong we are, and not in a good way.The biggest development when it comes to the entirety of Season 2, has only been the *nudge, nudge* ""love"" interest of Chiho Sasaki, as now she\'s completely wrapped in the messy matters of Ente Isla that\'s the same never-ending war between angels and demons. And guess what, even if the anime has literally adapted the LN to its halfway point as of Season 2\'s sequel a.k.a Season 2, Part 2 here, I don\'t think I can stomach yet another season if the same treatment is going to be given for the ludicrous ambition to adapt the LN all the way to the end (which LN readers will already know what\'s up since it ended in 2020). It\'s clear that the new faces joining the staff team\'s reprisal had no idea of how the source material is so beloved, that they did a complete 180 to butcher the anime adaptation to the best of their abilities, possibility ignoring all advice that has been set from its predecessor.I don\'t really care for nano.RIPE\'s OP nor Liyuu\'s ED either, just plain forgettable at best.I think that we, as the anime community, can collectively agree that if there was a show that HAD to be locked up in the past and stayed dead to preserve its fame and recognition, it\'s Hataraku Maou-sama!!. So much for being a fan who is SO hyped about Season 2, only to see and watch it being a shadow of its former self.No more, just no more. Please, anime gods? Just let Hataraku Maou-sama!! rest in its rightful grave, not the abomination that was resurrected just to destroy people\'s high expectations. Just pretend that Season 1 only existed and let Season 2 be the forgettable dud, the biggest colossal failure in the history of AniManga. who loves Season 1 when it aired back in Spring 2013, to see the Les Misérables of an esteemed work continue with a story that sounds indifferent from many contemporaries from its time and even now, it feels like I (and many others) being shamed for the (now false) hope that Studio 3Hz\'s treatment in 2023 will be a modern version of studio White Fox\'s impeccable showing. Oh, how wrong we are, and not in a good way.The biggest development when it comes to the entirety of Season 2, has only been the *nudge, nudge* ""love"" interest of Chiho Sasaki, as now she\'s completely wrapped in the messy matters of Ente Isla that\'s the same never-ending war between angels and demons. And guess what, even if the anime has literally adapted the LN to its halfway point as of Season 2\'s sequel a.k.a Season 2, Part 2 here, I don\'t think I can stomach yet another season if the same treatment is going to be given for the ludicrous ambition to adapt the LN all the way to the end (which LN readers will already know what\'s up since it ended in 2020). It\'s clear that the new faces joining the staff team\'s reprisal had no idea of how the source material is so beloved, that they did a complete 180 to butcher the anime adaptation to the best of their abilities, possibility ignoring all advice that has been set from its predecessor.I don\'t really care for nano.RIPE\'s OP nor Liyuu\'s ED either, just plain forgettable at best.I think that we, as the anime community, can collectively agree that if there was a show that HAD to be locked up in the past and stayed dead to preserve its fame and recognition, it\'s Hataraku Maou-sama!!.

The story in season 2 part 2 (really hate the part system) has picked up in pace from part 1, and even though it hasn't regained it's full grasp it had in season 1, I had found it to be enjoyable.Whether you continue to watch after this point is hinged entirely on if you're hooked into the story or not, since this seems to be one of...those stories that seems to do better when its more episodic and humorous as opposed to the over arcing storyline with a grand epic to tell. If these newer seasons don't spark joy, just feel free to watch season 1 again and forget the rest existed.At this point, I'm mostly just watching to find out more about the sephirot that they're drip feeding us and whether it will actually have a meaningful payoff after all this buildup. those stories that seems to do better when its more episodic and humorous as opposed to the over arcing storyline with a grand epic to tell.

This is actually the best the story has been since its inception and I had a lot of fun with it.I know, I know. Hatamou season 1 is a classic for many younger anime fans who had it as one of their first anime or grew up with it. For me, it never had that significance. I was never hooked by the story or the characters and while the White Fox art style was solid, changing to Studio 3hz didn’t bother me. Season...1 was a solid, but not amazing watch. Season 2 part 1 was one of the most forgettable batch of 12 episodes I’ve ever seen.The story was bland, characters were flat and there was no incentive to stay engaged with the story. I haven’t read the LN, so I’m not sure if that was because of the source being weaker or if it was just a bad adaptation. However, totally different case this time around. There’s way more lore that gets expanded upon, action, romance developing, etc. And we finally get to see the old world for Christ’s sake! it’s just a totally different experience that resonated with me much more than last cour.There’s a lot more action in this one. Between the Ente Isla, Heaven and real world drama I was hooked. The characters are actually challenged for once and have to overcome some difficult odds. The story expands upon the lore and goes a lot deeper into the fantasy element of the story which was very underused in previous seasons. There’s only so many McRonald jokes I can take, so it’s nice to see them building on the world.The other big selling point of this cour is the changes that Maou, Emi and other characters undergo. At this point, they’ve been on earth for a while and have started to become more Japanese than demon/hero. There’s subtle and overt hints at these changes throughout the show and I enjoyed that a lot. It makes all of them feel more authentic, and is a pretty realistic effect of being in another world for so long. The romantic subtext is a lot stronger in this one as well. Shippers backing both Emi and Chiho will have plenty of cute moments to be excited for. While it was always subtly hinted at, it’s a lot stronger in this cour.I’m aware that my opinion is the minority and that many people just can’t get with the new art style and storytelling, but for me it worked. Hatamou S2 Part 2 feels like a proper fantasy story for once instead of a one-trick pony meme fest. There’s a real antagonist, hardship and some really sweet moments.

I\'m no active manga reader so I can\'t talk about whether or not the anime adaptation is any better or any worse. It\'s a comedy/fantasy with a hint of slice-of-life and surprisingly kind-of-but-maybe-not-so-accurate biblical accuracy that made me genuinely curious enough to research the mythological references on multiple occasions. That being said, the story is simple and easy-to-follow, allowing a casual viewing experience and rewarding you for not taking it so seriously.The characters are funny and the demon dudes are quick to retort with simple-but-effective comebacks to make the angel gals blush up and pout. It\'s...not knee-slapper comedy, but it\'s certainly given me a few occasional wide smiles.I do much prefer the current studio\'s (3Hz) art style over the previous (White Fox\'s) despite it being just as simple and generic; it\'s softer and more pleasant to look at, and the girls got a very cute glow-up.And the negatives...The characters have abysmal growth. After two full seasons and some change, they might act slightly different around one another but there\'s still that looming sense of ""you\'re my mortal enemy and I don\'t entirely trust you."" Emilia is the biggest example of this. You get this feeling every episode that she might turn a new leaf and accept Maou as being just a ""good guy"" and even admit feelings despite the strenuous amount of romantic tension forced onto the viewer via Chiho, but it just never happens. It\'s even more apparent since the beginning of the second season where they\'re now literally raising a child together, albeit with the help of Shirou and friends.And, ah, Chiho. From kind-of-cute side character to Mary Sue. She was a useless character in need of saving, but now she\'s even BETTER! A character with newfound powers who is quick to learn and has innate talent, but is also useless and always in need of saving. I was on the fence about her and was just about to admit I liked her as a character until this season.Lastly, I want to highlight the biggest issues I have with a lot of shows: consequences. I can understand writers not wanting to throw away or kill-off characters, but it feels wrong for such massive problems to have such little permanent consequences on the group.TL;DRThe show is fine if you can overlook what I personally think is appallingly slow character growth between the beginning of season two and now. Even so, it\'s an entertaining watch and I\'d even go so far as to say I love it despite its flaws. So I\'m not gonna go against recommending it, but I can say with certainty it\'s one of those shows that has a great first season to hook you in but disappointing sequels if you hold high standards and overhype.That being said, this is really a review of the second season + the three episodes we\'ve seen so far, so I won\'t be so quick to judge negatively. It\'s at least worth a 5/10, but because I still really do love the show, it deserves another point. not knee-slapper comedy, but it\'s certainly given me a few occasional wide smiles.I do much prefer the current studio\'s (3Hz) art style over the previous (White Fox\'s) despite it being just as simple and generic; it\'s softer and more pleasant to look at, and the girls got a very cute glow-up.And the negatives...The characters have abysmal growth.

If anything the first season, while good, failed to really deliver any sense of continuity in a meaningful way. Yes, it was fun and quirky, and was a herald of the reverse isekai as a genre; but beyond that what did it actually deliver? Nothing of any real substance that couldn\'t be delivered in one season, while leaving...the viewers with a cliffhanger of an ending that promised a continuity of the story that was delivered far too late to remain relevant.As such, the Second season as a whole, will always fail to deliver on the expectations that people have for something that has been held with such strong cultural regard. Even if the same studio had been animating the second season, even if the second season delivered a truly phenomenal story never before seen by the eyes of any anime fan, it would still be considered some kind of mistake by the people who believe that what they ""expect"" something to be, is what it ""should"" be.Thinking about the second season as if there were no decade-long gap between releases, and removing any sense of cultural significance that the first season has, we are left with a strong follow-up season to a pretty strong first season. The story and the characters get the development that is really needed for this kind of story.Beyond that, the themes of the show and what it represents are further driven home and expanded upon. On top of that, we have a trickling of interesting lore being fed to us via the story in a way that is both compelling and keeps things interesting. But, most importantly, above that, we have complex themes and storytelling, and yet, this anime remains what it is supposed to be, a comedy. The laughs were good, and the writing was light-hearted enough to carry it.My critique would be, that at times, the second season seemed to drift and the pacing became a tad too slow in places. That said, that wasn\'t as big a problem as it could have been, because while the drifting is evident, it\'s at least enjoyable to watch. I would also have liked to have seen more consistent animating styles between the first and second seasons. While the art was different, it was still good, but at times the animation quality wasn\'t quite where it needed to be to deliver on some of the more important moments of the story.All in all...this is worth the watch. the viewers with a cliffhanger of an ending that promised a continuity of the story that was delivered far too late to remain relevant.As such, the Second season as a whole, will always fail to deliver on the expectations that people have for something that has been held with such strong cultural regard.

I\'m not a passionate writer, much less a competent one.I hate judging anime publicly because judgments can change with time and experience. A 9-star rating 10 years ago may not have the same meaning as a 9-star rating now. And I\'m too lazy to constantly change my MAL for these kinds of things.Still, ""Hataraku Maou-sama!"" is an anime I kept close to my heart since I watched the first season 10 years ago and went as far as to convince all my Japanese class friends to watch it in one of our all-together anime afternoons....And the ""Reverse Isekai"" is a sub-genre I adore. Blame this anime, ""Keroro Gunso"" and, to a certain extent, ""Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri"" for that.That said, I should give my say regarding ""Hataraku Maou-sama!! 2nd Season"".- First: I hate that the first season ended in the weirdest cliffhanger of all: ending with the first and most mundane episode of, what should be, the next season!!!- Second: As a result, I\'m glad this third season ended with the story properly wrapped up, even though there are plenty of unanswered questions and unresolved conflicts. It\'s a situation where the battle is over, but the war is still ongoing. **But**, the **battle* is over. We can rest before the next march if we are drafted to fight again.I\'m giving a ""Mixed Feelings"" recommendation because your mileage may vary with the three existing seasons of ""Hataruku Maou-sama!""This season, much like the previous one, is a mixed bag of passable animation, a rushed story, weird pacing and fights too simple, quick and ""easy"" to give any sense of tension. The humour regarding the interaction of the Ente Islanders with ""our world"" doesn\'t have the same impact as the first season, and it\'s mostly about Sadao Maou having too little money and barely managing himself.But the slice-of-life episodes were still solid enough, there was good and positive character growth and the logic behind the behaviour and thought process of our main characters made sense and didn\'t break my suspension of disbelief.Whether or not you\'ll be able to enjoy or be appalled by the second and third seasons of this anime will depend a lot on how much you enjoyed the first season and if you can put up with an ""OK"" execution of the anime after that. This **is not* AOTY material. Far from it. But if it made me laugh, cry and have fun, it might be good enough for you. Just don\'t approach it with high expectations or you might regret it.To finish my review, does this anime have space for further development? Yes.Does it need to? No. Unless a very competent studio and writer picks it up in the future.Will that happen? Probably not.Am I ok with that? Yes. Like I said, it\'s thanks to how this season ended.

This is shown differently throughout the arcs, where some are more focused on Earth, some Ente Isla and some building a bridge between them. We are also shown how the characters plan to implement some of the things they have learned, either on Earth or Ente Isla.The season also looks more into the relation between the Demon...Army and The Heroes Party, and asks questions as to what that relation should actually be. Which leads to some great moments for the characters to learn and having to adapt to the world they now are in.One thing that might disinterest some people from the season, is that there is less focus on their everyday life on Earth, and more focus on bigger plots throughout the season. So if you really wanted to see more of the slice of life type of plots, would this season probably not be as interesting for you.I would overall recommend this season, since it shows some great moments for the characters, and shows some great arcs between the two worlds.

Such was the case when I found myself in the quaint little town of Willowbrook, a place far removed from the touristy spots that often dominate travel itineraries. This impromptu adventure turned out to be a serendipitous discovery, and I\'m here to share my thoughts on what can only be described as a truly random experience.The Journey BeginsMy journey to Willowbrook was far from intentional. I had set out on a road trip with no particular destination in mind, hoping...to embrace spontaneity. After several hours of driving, I saw a sign for Willowbrook and decided to take a detour. Little did I know that this would lead me to an unforgettable encounter.The Charming Quirkiness of WillowbrookUpon arriving in Willowbrook, I was struck by its charming quirkiness. The town square featured colorful buildings with mismatched facades, each telling a story of its own. The streets were narrow and winding, reminiscent of a time when urban planning was less about efficiency and more about character.Local Eateries and Culinary DelightsOne of the most delightful surprises in Willowbrook was its culinary scene. I stumbled upon a small, family-owned café called ""Mabel\'s Place."" The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, drawing me in. The interior was cozy and inviting, with mismatched furniture and vintage décor that added to the town\'s eccentric charm.I decided to try their signature dish, the ""Willowbrook Special,"" a mouthwatering blend of locally sourced ingredients. Each bite was a revelation, and I couldn\'t help but wonder how many travelers had missed out on this culinary gem simply because it wasn\'t listed in any guidebook.Exploring the UnusualAfter savoring every last morsel of the Willowbrook Special, I set out to explore the town\'s unusual attractions. My wanderings led me to the Willowbrook Oddities Museum, a place dedicated to collecting and showcasing the town\'s quirkiest and most bizarre artifacts. From a two-headed taxidermy squirrel to a jar of rare, luminescent algae, the museum was a treasure trove of the unexpected.As I wandered through the exhibits, I couldn\'t help but be captivated by the curator\'s enthusiasm and encyclopedic knowledge of these oddities. It was clear that this museum was a labor of love, and I felt privileged to have stumbled upon it.The Unexpected FriendshipsOne of the most beautiful aspects of random discoveries is the people you meet along the way. In Willowbrook, I had the chance to strike up conversations with locals who were more than willing to share their stories. Their genuine warmth and hospitality made me feel like I had found a second home in this offbeat town.ConclusionMy random adventure in Willowbrook taught me that sometimes the best experiences are the ones you never planned for.

It was frankly super boring and uninteresting.The biggest flack I have for this show is that it was not really comedic. For a comedy show you cannot have 2/3rds of the season being a super dramatic and nonsensical fight drama.Speaking of the fighting, when they went back to the Ente Isla it was super boring. The main problem is that there was no weightage. Who were the villains?

Juubee Ninpuuchou: Ryuuhougyoku-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/618/Juubee_Ninpuuchou__Ryuuhougyoku-hen,"[""After watching the original movie and falling in absolute love with it I learned of the TV series.  I was so ecstatic to watch what I thought would be an incredible series, to say I was dissapointed would be an understatement.Story:  This isn't where this anime fails. In fact I don't even mind the story, it's interesting but not incredibly original.  Everyone wants to kill Shigure and there's only Jubei and two minor characters to protect her.  Storyline progression isn't that great, I found myself in the 5th episode going &quot;is something going to happen?&quot;Animation:  Watching this anime...didn't make my eyes carefully try to understand what I was seeing.  Sometimes when I'm watching an anime (mainly Gankutsuou) I read the subtitles as quickly as possible so i can appreciate the art.  Not so here.Sound/Music: Honestly, when it comes to anime I believe that music is one of those subtle things that makes a great anime even greater, or a terrible anime much worse.  Or whichever combination you like.  I actually enjoyed the music in this, it did suit the feel of this anime.Characters:  Here is where this anime fails miserably.  For people who have seen the movie you'll definitely recognize the monk and Jubei.  The other characters are all new.  The characters are all one-dimensional.  I never found myself rooting for any character because the outcome, I knew, was going to be the same.  All enemy ninjas bored me, every single one of them.  I'm not a huge fan of monsters in a ninja series, i like them to be more human. I mean sure, throw in a couple monsters, but....when every character except the main party are monsters...it gets really boring.  And they're all the stereotypes.  I felt all the characters to be very Trigun-ish and when i looked it up, the character designer for Ninja Scroll was also the designer for Trigun.  It worked for Trigun, it doesn't work for Ninja Scroll.Enjoyment:  I almost didn't want to finish this series.  13 episodes long, a little over 4 hours and i didn't want to finish it.  I chuckled a few times, was entertained for a little bit each episode. But not nearly enough for me to actually have a good opinion of it.Overall: A series which, compared to the film it was based off of, is horrible.  If you haven't seen the movie you might disagree &quot;I think your opinion is terrible, I quite enjoyed this series.&quot;  I came in expecting to see something that would satisfy me the same way the movie did, and it didn't. I would however, recommend this if you're just needing some ninja-action. didn't make my eyes carefully try to understand what I was seeing.

Ninja Scroll: The Series is beyond the scope of simple definitions such as good or bad. It is B-movie! The only, and best, way to describe this anime is through comparing it to classic American B-movies, so I'd say you could call it B-anime.Most of you will be going into the series after watching the movie, which I admit was much better, and so will most likely be disappointed. That's because you'll also expect the same quality, but I'm warning you that you'll...discover something entirely different. And that's whether your sense of humor can overcome your sense of quality. I guess mine can occasionally experience a power surge, because the Ninja Scroll series made me laugh out loud on countless occasions. The cheesy and cliched lines, quirky humor , the repulsive monsters, the gore, the occasional nudity, this all equates to your average modus operandi of a good B-class movie, and Ninja Scroll's got it all baby.With the plot being pretty basic, ok terrible, it's left up to the characters to keep this train on the rails...and they kinda do. I'd have to give Tsubute(young thief with stupid bandage) credit here for cracking some smart-ass lines and generally inserting a bit of classic light comedy, whereas Jubei(wise-ass ninja dude) masterfully utilizes all the great sarcastic hero jibe to poke at all the small 'inconsistencies' of evil-doers.The animation was passable, with the enemy's character designs getting quite interesting, but mention must be made of the soundtrack which at times reminded me of Mortal Kombat and the like. However this wasn't the only reason I gave sound a 7, the voice actors were also a classic form of 'bad'(english dub), but it was in a funny and fitting way. So before you begin ranting about seven being way to high for the quality, I'll remind you that all sevens given in this review were purely from a comedic-B-movie-enjoyment perspective.In the end I was quite satisfied, although I don't know whether that was because of the series, or because it finished. It was still a decent piece of easy watching, reminded me of the good old morning cartoon watching days(but slightly more adult; not really in the area themes). Your enjoyment of this series will definitely depend on what you find funny, but if you're a fan of B-movies, definitely give this one a try. discover something entirely different.

Boy I was in for a major disappointment. The anime takes place fourteen years after the movie following Kibagami Jubei who's still roaming Japan and meets Shigure a priestess and things go down hill fast from there. Ninja Scroll the movie was a classic. The story was concise, the animation was great, the action was exciting and the characters were interesting. The series on the other hand was the complete reverse. The story was unbelievable and the tone of the anime had no drama for...the story. The animation wasn't very good. The music was good, and that's the only thin that kept it from getting the one. The characters weren't interesting and you couldn't care about, even Jubei was one of those characters.

If you liked jubei and want to see him fight some more while hanging around a familiar old face (that he does not remember) it is worth it to watch. The fights were slick looking and not drawn out and out of all that is different jubei's attitude remains the same and that puts a smile on my face. "", 'I actually enjoyed this anime...well I found it \'somewhat\' entertaining to be exact. I\'d rate it overall as a 6.8/10.The story is pretty basic if you\'re familiar with this type of ronin/ninja genre in anime. Princess is being chased by bad guys, runs into a strong ninja/samurai and they end up journeying together while he protects her. Then some others end up tagging along with them on their journey. Im sort of fan of this type of thing so you can count that as part of why I found this entertaining when some others did not.I have to admit the story dosent draw...you in all that much but there\'s definitely a progressive story holding everything together. This is probably because for an anime with a progressive storyline, it feels very episodic. Most of the episodes seemed put together simply to feature the new bad-guy(s)-of-the-day that Jubei must defeat. These battles are well animated and its interesting to watch how Jubei will go about defeating his new foe though a good portion of them end quick via a single strike from Jubei (his quick draw move a.k.a Wind Slash Technique).Sound isnt anything special but nothing bad either. The anime\'s intro uses an instrumental which serves as a theme throught the anime. Its a little catchy but really not anything special and can be easily forgotten. Voice acting is good as well as the various sound effects in the anime.Character is one of the reasons I watch these type of anime. The Jubei type character often draw my attention. Carefree & loves to relax until he gets drawn into battle where his strength and quick wits are revealed. The princess was a \'meh\' character for me. Just someone trying understand more about why she\'s being chased. Then theres a boy thief and some mysterious old man some might be familiar with if they\'ve seen the movie. The other main character draw here are the foes they encounter. They are mostly monstrous oddities with special abilities. Some come with a story while others are just a Jubei slash away before they are forgotten. Either way I found them entertaining.So there you have it. If your a fan of historical/wuxia anime with samurais/ninjas cutting up stuff I\'d recommend this to you as a way to pass some time. Other than that I\'d say its just some good ol ""saturday morning cartoon"" like a reviewer before mentioned.

First of which is that it\'s being made by a different company. Studio 3Hz which seem to specialize in chibi girls with overly large and vacant eyes!- Headache 1, animation and art style.While the difference in the character\'s style is a bit of a shock you will get over it as the series progresses. The animation however is the main issue. Overly exaggerated responses all the time, very odd angles that make them seem almost alien, poorly choregraphed fight...scenes, cheap and dated animation, still shots to cut costs. Sad part?

Well now it\'s full blown Middle schooler panic every time he breathes the same air as they do!Shirou plays the housewife role and is very frugal? Petty cash is his one and only concern in life now.Maou teased Emi now and again? Well, have him call her flat chested out of the blue in the first episode. Very in-character for someone who\'s personality is ""mature and responsible"".Combine this with exaggerated responses, voice actors shrieking their lines to match the animation and you have something very unpleasant on screen.-Headache 3, Plot.Season one = Demon King was Isekaied to our world and works in a MC parody.Season two = try to summarize it. I dare you!The focus seems to be on the romance angle. The studio is also trying to turn Alas Ramus into the next  Anya from Spy x Family. Just pushing the ""oh cute widdle kiddie"" angle. Sadly the art style and animation make her seem creepy and unnatural so.... ew....Because the focus is quite literally ""shipping"" the story as well as the interactions between the characters suffer.Summery.This was cheaply & poorly made.

Which lead to the changes in the character designs.Studio 3Hz is the studio which has made this season, it is a studio which has done only a hand full of animations most of which are average. Which is why i believe that they are not experienced enough to make this project.In the MAL profile for this anime we can see that there are several...producers involved but they are mostly related to music or audio services, even after that I feel that they did not properly use the money properly for this project or just didn't use it because they knew this series was popular and viewers would still watch it no matter what quality they presented.Bad points:-1) The character designs especially that of the female characters is too different from that of the first season. Which really took away  the cuteness from the characters and makes them look like different charecters.2) The opening song is not as good as the previous season (Personal Opinion) even after having so many music industries producing it.3) I know that an anime can't put everything which is in the manga or light novel (LN )into animation but there were some dialogs  and scenes in the manga  and LN which they skipped out on which i fell would have made it better.Good points:-1) Voice Actors (VA), the VA have done an exemplary job, making the story funny as the first season.2) Related to the first point the audio quality of the overall anime is good.3) Reaction scenes , some of the reaction scenes they drew have made the story more enjoyable.I am a big fan of the series and have re-watched it a few times and even read the Light Novel and Manga, I wanted to see how it would get adapted this season, but this season just did not meet up to my expectations especially after waiting for 9 years. I don't know how many will read this or how many will agree with it but to me it was bit of a disappointment and can only hope the quality will get slightly better in the upcoming episodes. for those who have watched the first  season and are planning to watch the 2nd hope this review helps. producers involved but they are mostly related to music or audio services, even after that I feel that they did not properly use the money properly for this project or just didn't use it because they knew this series was popular and viewers would still watch it no matter what quality they presented.Bad points:-1) The character designs especially that of the female characters is too different from that of the first season.

It’s great that highly respected titles in the anime community are making a comeback after years of waiting, and that might inspire future sequels to come, for shows like No Game No Life, or Land of the Lustrous for example.The Devil is a Part-Timer was a top-tier isekai I watched perhaps a year ago for the first time. It had a solid premise, good comedy,...and was animated by studio White Fox, a rather top-tier studio. When Season 2 was announced, and that there was a studio change, to Studio 3Hz, I was skeptical, but of course I’d give it a try. The character designs were certainly a step down from Season 1 (which already didn’t have the greatest designs), and with time, the animation degraded immensely. It wasn’t just the production that took a nosedive though, the plot did too, and it became quite the snoozefest at times.My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20STORY: 7.5/25Was this show always this slow and was it really a slice-of-life? There were a few interesting plot points to be explored, but they never really went to solid detail with them. There was the introduction of a new character, Alas=Ramus, who was the new Anya Forger of the season in her cuteness, but where she came from, and who she really is wasn’t really explored well. I remember that Season 1 at least had some fight scenes and villains, but in this season, there was barely anything going to advance the plot, a lot of meandering, random romance elements, and not enough mention of Heaven or Ente Isla to keep things intriguing. This was not the show I remember, I don’t remember it being this boring.ART: 3/10The character designs don’t really feel like designs you’d see in a fantasy anime, but more like designs you’d see in CGDCT or slice of life show. They also looked very flat and round at the same time, which was weird. The fight scenes were very disappointing, with a lot of still imagery and janky movement. The production continued to degrade with time, and even simple movements became very awkward.MUSIC: 6.5/10Not very stand-out at all, OP and ED were your sub-par songs, and the soundtrack was quite unnoticeable.CHARACTERS: 7/20The characters were very flat this season, with not much development whatsoever. There was a huge emphasis on romance (even between side characters), and that was quite insignificant and unnecessary. With a weak plot, the characters wouldn’t be very good either obviously, and none of them really added anything to the table this season.ENJOYMENT: 6/15Quite the snoozefest at times, considerably more boring than Season 1.THEMATIC EXECUTION: 7.5/20I mean, the comedy is still ok, but everything else, such as the romance and action themes were in the mud this season. It’s mostly the bad production that hurts how the themes were executed, but the plot has really degraded as well, and with that, you can’t expect the themes to be done right.OVERALL: 37.5/100A huge shame honestly, 9 long years, and this is what fans got. Should this season have been made in the first place? Yes and no. There’s some nostalgia to be had here, but not much more than that, and with the supposed bad LN ending that fans were talking about from what I heard, right now, this series is in the mud, and that’s just incredibly unfortunate. and was animated by studio White Fox, a rather top-tier studio. When Season 2 was announced, and that there was a studio change, to Studio 3Hz, I was skeptical, but of course I’d give it a try. The character designs were certainly a step down from Season 1 (which already didn’t have the greatest designs), and with time, the animation degraded immensely. It wasn’t just the production that took a nosedive though, the plot did too, and it became quite the snoozefest at times.My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20STORY: 7.5/25Was this show always this slow and was it really a slice-of-life? There were a few interesting plot points to be explored, but they never really went to solid detail with them. There was the introduction of a new character, Alas=Ramus, who was the new Anya Forger of the season in her cuteness, but where she came from, and who she really is wasn’t really explored well. I remember that Season 1 at least had some fight scenes and villains, but in this season, there was barely anything going to advance the plot, a lot of meandering, random romance elements, and not enough mention of Heaven or Ente Isla to keep things intriguing. This was not the show I remember, I don’t remember it being this boring.ART: 3/10The character designs don’t really feel like designs you’d see in a fantasy anime, but more like designs you’d see in CGDCT or slice of life show. They also looked very flat and round at the same time, which was weird. The fight scenes were very disappointing, with a lot of still imagery and janky movement.

NOT WORTH! You done messed up, Studio 3Hz.  Everything about the show screams poorly constructed, from overblown reactions to bizarre camera angles to malformed appearances to cheap animation. It felt like the show was made in the early 2010s. You know you\'ve fucked up when the sequel to KanoKari outperforms you. It makes me wonder if S2 should have existed at all.Let\'s start with the obvious downgrade in art style and animation. While the differences in the art styles of the characters are...initially shocking, they will fade as the story progresses and you will grow accustomed to them. However, most people would agree that the biggest problem is the animation. Episode 4 marked the beginning of the animation\'s demise. The animation appeared to be melting in that episode, especially during the entire Gabriel confrontation sequence, as not only was the art style changed. This episode appeared to have been produced by amateurs who were thrown together at random, and the episode was completed simply to have something to show for it. The unfortunate part is that the art style and animation only get worse as the show progresses, and I\'m too lazy to list every flaw and discrepancy I\'ve noticed. In general, the show was extremely difficult to watch and felt like a chore.This season has squandered the characters and stories established in S1, making them appear completely inferior and those that are classified as Made in China, essentially cheap and off-brand product marketed at a low cost, as one might say. Majority of the casts in S1 received no development and have had their personalities degraded. Take Shirou as an example. In S1, his persona was built up to be that of a housewife, with being good with household chores and handling funds, being thrifty and all, but now he\'s only concerned with pocket change, and has turned into a nagging granny who no one wants to listen to. The comedy is simply not working, the characters aren\'t as amusing, and all of the gimmicks have worn out. There is none of S1\'s charm or wit to be found. The characters spent the majority of their time babysitting a random child named Alas Ramus thrown into the mix. The show literally transitioned from a show about magical powers and actions to a slice of life and romcom. What\'s worse is that the entire ordeal surrounding Gabriel was left unresolved and a new problem has already emerged. It is like throwing random ingredients into a hotpot and expecting it to taste delicious. Furthermore, a new romance angle emerged from what had previously been a subpar love triangle angle among the main casts, leaving us viewers perplexed as to what exactly is going on in the show. How are we supposed to believe that Rika suddenly likes Shirou and has a huge crush on him? Like where did the romance even sprung up from? It was as if I were watching a teen romance written by someone who has no idea what love works. Honestly the entire season felt like a filler and setup for a sequel, a throwaway basically. The show\'s finale didn\'t help matters either, as it was too anticlimactic, leaving many questions unanswered.The only thing I can say about the show that I like is the sound, with the VAs doing their jobs with the roles their characters play, and even then, I find them irritating with the way the show tries to portray and present their characters. The OP and ED are nice. You\'ll become more invested in them as the season progresses. The show\'s audio is the only winner, and everything else is a loser.The trailer alone should have been a warning sign for what was to come this season and to skip the sequel, but I chose to stick with the show, and this is what I got in return. DISAPPOINTMENT and more DISAPPOINTMENT. I considered dropping the show several times during its run, but decided to endure what felt like an eternity of anguish.If you\'ve just finished S1 of the show and are thinking, ""Hey, I want to watch S2 to learn more about the casts and the story to see what happens"", I recommend you don\'t. You\'ll be thoroughly disappointed, just like the majority of people, and this is coming from someone who loved S1 and doesn\'t mind mediocre art and animation in S2. This anime had so much potential, but it was sadly wasted.PERSONAL REQUEST: PLEASE REPLACE THE STUDIO IN CHARGE. initially shocking, they will fade as the story progresses and you will grow accustomed to them.

However, it was unfortunately not as good as everyone hoped. Unlike the first season, this time the anime likes to fall flat at times, and the comedy, in general, isn’t as enjoyable. It kind of feels like it can’t choose when to be serious or funny at the right times, which wasn’t an issue during season 1, so this anime being underwhelming was honestly a bit of a surprise. Other than that the main storyline this season just kind of wasn’t that interesting.Art: 5This was kind of a letdown. For an anime with this much hype,...you would think the art would be a little better. For starters, the music really wasn’t that good this time around as I didn’t really enjoy the opening, ending, or ost. Then there's the new character designs and art in general, yes it's a cleaner art style, but it makes the characters seem blander. The worst part though is the animation. At times it just looked downright bad. I just expected it to be better overall.Characters: 8The one saving grace for this anime is the cast. If the main group didn’t mesh as well with each other as it does, then this anime would've been a lot worse. The characters are still really enjoyable to watch and we get some development on them throughout the season, but unfortunately, the comedic timing on a lot of the jokes just wasn’t that good which makes me downgrade the score a little.Story: 5I’ve got only one word to describe the story this season and it's boring. Unfortunately, the serious directions that this anime tries to take dont hit that well, and with the antagonists being kind of goofy when the jokes dont hit, the show just becomes uninteresting and bland to watch. I really wanted more from this anime, but I can only give it 6 Yesod shards out of 10. you would think the art would be a little better.

We got AoT S4P2, Made in Abyss S2, Kaguya S3, COTE S2, RaG S2 and we still have Mob S3 and MHA S6 to end the year with. It might be an exaggeration but, 2022 is definitely a year of sequels. But out of all these announcements, what I really was excited about was for Devil is a part-timer S2. When I completed S1 almost a year ago, I pretty much left all hope that this would never get a sequel and I was...thrilled when it got announced. And I\'m really glad this got a S2 but I can\'t help but be a bit disappointed, since the series kinda lost its charm it previously had.A lot of subtle changes were missing. One of the best things in S1 is that it gives personality to the characters with some small movements. Like that one scene in S1, where Emi moves her eye in sarcasm when Mao asks Bell to work for MgRonalds while not recognising that Chiho\'s feelings for him, which is hilarious and her dead face that follows that scene is hilarious too. But this doesn\'t exist in S2. Instead they gave some extra thick plot to Chiho\'s big rack which was already big enough in S1. And there\'s this shiny egg effect on female characters that you would see normally in something like an ecchi anime. These small & subtle things make you wonder if you\'re still watching the same characters. Emi, Sadou, Ashiya & Rika, these are all working adults who were portrayed as such in S1, now they look more like high schoolers which is off putting. These aren\'t the only things that bothered me. In episode 3, Sadou & Emi were talking about Ente Esla stuff while standing next to a normal human, which is weird that she didn\'t at least react to it. I don\'t remember talking shit about generic fantasy stuff like demon lords, angels and isekai being normalised in this world. Though its ironically normalised in the community.Now all this isn\'t meant to say that this season is bad. The new moe-ish comedy has its own charm and Studio 3Hz is doing their best to deliver the fun. The VAs were still doing their good job to bring back our favorite charismatic & funny ""Sadou Mao"" the MgRonald employee, ""Yusa Emi"" the call centre hero, ""Ashiya"" the housewife General and so are the rest. And I see no problems in pacing or story so far. I heard there\'s some dispute among LN fans that the ending isn\'t good or something. I don\'t know anything about it but hopefully, they\'ll rectify that... hopefully.While a bit disappointed, I\'m just glad we got the continuation we wanted. thrilled when it got announced.

What in the scribbledydoodyloo happened? Please, if you enjoyed season 1 of this show, stay far, far away from this monstrosity. This review will contain a few spoilers but honestly, I doubt it matters because nothing makes sense anyway.Where to even start? Probably the art style and animation. Considering it's been nine years since The Devil Is A Part Timer's original release, me and probably many others were hyped to see an updated art style, along with smoother animations. Instead we got, well... Whatever this was? The art style looks more simple that it used to, and the character...designs were never very detailed to begin with. It feels like I'm watching a children's show. Especially when the baby (is she a baby? or like a toddler? who knows, not me) gets introduced - I know children have a bigger head and all, but this child's head is about as big as Emi's entire upper body. I also feel like Ashiya took a big hit especially. Somehow the combination of his hair, face and posture in the new art style did him so dirty. He always just looks like a long noodle with eyes at any place except where they're supposed to be (okay, I might be exaggerating a bit there, but just believe me when I say this season is not a good look for him). Also - and we'll get to this once I start talking about the animation - clearly there was either no budget or time to do proper drawing. Why are their eyes so far apart in some frames? Why are the proportions so weird in others? Help, get me out of here.However, if you consider the art to be bad, then the animation is very very very very very bad. I cannot tell you the amount of times I've taken a video of an animation in this series and sent it to friends just so they can laugh at me for still continuing to watch this dogpile shit of a series. Gabriel's head just completely changes size when he looks up a little?? Characters shaking is just them moving back and forth in a frame?? I'm so lost. I don't even know how to explain how bad it looks. Weird angles make the characters' faces just completely deformed and all their movements look like they've peed themselves and are trying to hide it. The fights (there are like, what, 3 in total? are painful to watch. Sometimes animations just completely get skipped; when Chiho sees something on the tv and then passes out, we don't even get to see her pass out. We literally see her react to the tv, and then we cut to her already unconsciously lying against the back of the couch in an awkward position. I just really cannot convey how bad the animation is for a 2022 anime with such a big name attached to it.But, season 1 did a good job with the story, right? It was funny, had intriguing characters and a good plot, right? Season 2 is based on the same material so the story must still be good, right? Right...? Yeah no. Episode 12 is called 'The Devil and the Hero Focus on What's Happening Right Now' and I think the fact that they only start to focus on what's happening in the last episode pretty much sums this series up. Sure, there is somewhat of a plot, but it is executed so poorly that it becomes impossible to follow at some point. Who is trying to fight who? Is Olba still involved and if yes, how? What are the stones of Yesod or whatever they're called? Maybe these questions are actually easy to answer if you really tried, but at least for me this series failed to make me give a shit. Not only did I not care for the plotline, the comedy that made The Devil Is A Part Timer's first season so good has vanished. The jokes are still good in theory, but they don't land. It feels like while the first season was targeted at an audience that has some experience in part-time jobs or are at least in the age range to understand why it's funny to see the Devil work at the McDonalds, the second season was aimed at 5-year olds. The jokes were executed as if they were trying to copy the Teletubbies.It probably doesn't help that the most important new character that gets introduced this season is a literal toddler. She is called Alus Ramus (that is her entire first name and dear god, does it get annoying at some point - imagine a supposedly epic moment where they have to yell out that whole-ass name? (Okay I've started nit-picking now but I assure you that this name is too long for its own good)). It got a chuckle out of me when she first appeared, but it didn't take long for her to become the most frustrating aspect of the series. She's never funny and I don't understand what the appeal is supposed to be. It is also impossible to tell how old/smart Alus Ramus is, because sometimes she barely knows words yet, but at other times she seems to grasp the situation perfectly and tell the gang what she thinks they should do.The other characters luckily haven't changed too much in their essence. They are a little one-dimensional, but I can't say that's much different from season 1 and it honestly doesn't bother me incredibly. It would be nice, however, to get a little more grasp on their motivations. Is Maou trying to take over Japan? Is he trying to go back to Ente Isla and take that over? Does he just want to live a peaceful life in Japan? The question gets brought up several times, but is never properly answered for as far as I could tell.The only redeeming quality for season 2 is really its sound. The voice-actors from season 1 reprised their roles in season 2, and thank the lord for that. They all did a great job and were the one thing that kept some emotion in the series. Though it did make the disparity between their skills and the awful animation even worse. The openings and endings were, well, decent - not much more to say about them than that.All in all, it's sad to see a fun series like The Devil Is A Part-timer turn into this crap. Especially when fans have been waiting this long for its return. Unless you're a completionist that can't stop themselves like myself, I'd really recommend staying away from this one. Sorry to all the season 2 fans out there.Is there a season 3 coming up? Yes. Is it likely to be better than season 2? No. Am I still gonna be watching it? Sigh. Yes.Thank you for reading if you somehow made it to the end of this - have a good day :). designs were never very detailed to begin with. It feels like I'm watching a children's show.

It was otherwise nothing special, just another adaptation of a light novel and a 5/10 at best. For a decade many were constantly requesting another season, and were really excited when they finally heard it’s coming. No joke, they hyped the living hell out of this show before it came out. Then as soon as the first episode aired the entire community forgot its existence. How is that possible when they were so hyped up about it? It’s...not because there were a lot of better shows for them to follow in the same season, because that’s what had happened with the first season as well (Attack on Titan came around the same time).The answer is a lot funnier than that, it’s because what they were actually interested in was getting another season and not to actually watch another season. That’s what the mentality of always being hyped for more products leads you to. It’s not about liking the product. It’s about getting it and then be excited for more products. That it obviously not true for all products, as actually good series will be enjoyed by a lot of people. But in this case we don’t have a good show; we have yet another passable light novel adaptation.And now for the actual problem with the show that has nothing to do with external stuff such as hype. The sequel is simply not as good as the first season. It had a different artstyle and alienated the older fans. Iit had a lower budget and drove away the newer fans. Its plot was dumber by including a comic relief baby that nobody liked. Its story moved away from the devil flipping burgers to whatever nonsense the author could come up with, which made the show to feel like any other plotless school comedy.All that aside, the people who once liked it grew up, watched better reverse isekai during it decade of absence (let’s say, Recreators), and moved on with their lives. Even the most dedicated ones who bothered to read the ending of the novel found it to be terrible (mostly for the shipping not going the way they assumed) and also stopped caring about it.So basically, everything was against this anime for not doing something better than the first season and the hype only enlarged the disappointment. Just another sequel that failed to live up to its expectations, the same way most sequels fail (One Punch Man season 2 anyone?). It was once again proven that there is no point in being hyped for what is to come, since it is almost certain that it will never going to be as good as you think it’s going to be. You should enjoy what you have now and in case there is more to come, you should have no expectations so you won’t be disappointed even if it’s worse, which it most likely going to be (hello there, Promised Neverland season 2). Screw being excited for stuff that haven’t come out yet, and screw theorycrafting regarding what you think will happen. The less you act like a monkey on heat, the more you will actually enjoy the final product. not because there were a lot of better shows for them to follow in the same season, because that’s what had happened with the first season as well (Attack on Titan came around the same time).The answer is a lot funnier than that, it’s because what they were actually interested in was getting another season and not to actually watch another season. That’s what the mentality of always being hyped for more products leads you to. It’s not about liking the product. It’s about getting it and then be excited for more products. That it obviously not true for all products, as actually good series will be enjoyed by a lot of people. But in this case we don’t have a good show; we have yet another passable light novel adaptation.And now for the actual problem with the show that has nothing to do with external stuff such as hype. The sequel is simply not as good as the first season. It had a different artstyle and alienated the older fans. Iit had a lower budget and drove away the newer fans.

It was famous and had a sterling reputation. It made some of the best professional movie cameras ever. Before it was just Canon, in the U.S. it was Bell and Howell Canon. The company went out of business and now we see the name of Bell + Howell stuck on any piece of flimsy crap the just-this-side-of-swindlers want to sell.There was once an anime called “The Devil Is a Part-Timer.”...It was a brilliant parody of isekai even before isekai was a thing. Watch it today and it still carries the sparkle and hilarity it did when it was first released in 2013. It is a classic. Problem is, it ended in the wrong place, one episode after the logical season ending. No one knew why. Many of us hoped for a second season.Now, as with Bell and Howell, the name has been acquired by some outfit that produced what could have been called “Scooby-Do is a Part-Timer,” though that would be an insult to Scooby-Do. This “sequel” has none of the charm, none of the excellent artwork and animation, none of the crisp acting of the original. The visuals are almost as if the Ex-Arm people made this monstrosity in 3D then flattened it to 2D. The faces are unblinking and expressionless or else anime cliché, with lip-flaps on vacantly staring fixed frames. There is no nuance of the sort that marked the original. “The Devil Is a Part-Timer” has been removed from this series in everything but name. Even Chi’s biganimetiddies have shrunk and the franchise manager has become a loquacious social worker instead of a character in a comedy.The dub voice actors are terrible, possibly out of anguish over what they’ve been given to say. In the real “The Devil Is a Part-Timer,” I laughed continuously. Watching this sorry sequel, I cringed continuously and laughed not at all. The life has been sucked out of all the characters, and some new lifeless characters got introduced for no apparent reason.This series is a huge disappointment. You can be forgiven for screwing up this badly only if your name is Anno. And he was working through his issues. Not that the people in this purported second season don’t have issues. They do, and they involve learning how to write, learning how to draw, learning how to animate and learning how to act. This is more “Squid Girl” than “The Devil Is a Part-Timer.” (Please, Lord, don’t let these people get their hands on “No Game, No Life”!)Second seasons, even those that don’t take nine years to get released, have a pretty spotty history already. After a wonderful, legendary first season, KonoSuba got phoned in for the second season and two movies before finally recovering its dignity in the third movie. But this isn’t really a second season. It’s an inept imitation of what people who aren’t as good think would have been a second season had there been one. Even the memorable music has been replaced by some random unremarkable songs sung by random unremarkable anime singers, with immemorable OP and ED, though the latter makes a fan-art attempt to imitate that of the original season. For anime fans, “Yay! A second season!” is accompanied by a feeling in the pit of the stomach that there’s about an even chance that the second season will do nothing but disgrace the first season. That’s what happened here. A fine anime’s good name has been disgraced.I gave it a 3 for nostalgic reasons. It deserves lower.So shameful, as they say.

The show has a good balance of comedy and action blend, which is why people love it so much. After almost 10 years, it returned... just to disappoint everyone.To be fair, I don't mind the new artistic style and understand the studio change. The new art has its charm also, if they do it right, some scenes are pretty good. However, oh boi, they ruined the anime. The overall art is sloppy and lacks detail, I can...tell from EP4 that many faces are way off-model even in simple still scenes (not in-between).The fighting scene is horrible... It's like the characters are just talking, not fighting. It only has beam shooting, simple slashing, and boring punching even in the last EP which is supposed to be the climax. There is no such excitement to be found here.The problem is the budget and the studio is just a small outsourced one. If you check the end credit names, they're mostly Korean names. The people behind this are not passionate animators, they only finish it to get paid, which is... very sad. I don't want to blame the studio too much. The producer and harsh anime industry are to blame... honestly.I gave 4/10 because it's below average.I watch the show because the story and pacing are not that bad and I am a fan of Hikasa Youko and Touyama Nao voices. tell from EP4 that many faces are way off-model even in simple still scenes (not in-between).The fighting scene is horrible...

But I WILL drop it if it CONTINUES to feel like a chore to watch.To be fair, I am tackling 5+ shows at the moment, and with every new episode release that I have to catch up with, I have to make decisions. Unfortunately, Hataraku Maou-sama S02 did not make that list.I pretty binge watched Season 01 due to the Reddit hype revolving around Season 02. I found the show just okay.But man, did Season 02 not hook me at all.And I\'m not sure who is coordinating the QC of...these episodes, but there were more than one occasions where the animation absolutely tanks. It has been confirmed that these lesser episodes were outsourced. But all that tells me is that I should seriously feel bad for the animators, because the studio management is royally fucking them.The characters are all great and the context of the show is... I guess interesting enough. But the stories have gotten pretty bland.My lesson learned here is - Reddit very much tends to overhype shit and don\'t hop on the bandwagon just because ""everyone else"" likes it. these episodes, but there were more than one occasions where the animation absolutely tanks.

The art style isn't bad, it just doesn't feel the same. The writing isn't bad, it just doesn't feel the same. The storylines aren't bad, they just don't feel the same. Etc.The first season was carried by the absurdity of the the situation that the characters found themselves in. However, the honeymoon phase of that...hilarious premise has long since worn off, and the show's inherent flaws have been on display as a result.The comedy isn't landing as much, the characters aren't as funny, and all of the gimmicks have gotten pretty stale. The original wasn't all that great or anything, but it was a fun 13 episode anime. That's all it ever needed to be. I don't think this season really needed to exist.It isn't completely awful, it's just pretty disappointing and uninteresting. hilarious premise has long since worn off, and the show's inherent flaws have been on display as a result.The comedy isn't landing as much, the characters aren't as funny, and all of the gimmicks have gotten pretty stale.

We got it, but at what cost?Well, the animation was the cost. It’s unavoidable to not notice the slightly stinky artwork and choppy animation by Studio 3Hz. From poorly animated fights to faces falling off models, the difference in quality compared to White Fox’s first season is almost deal-breaking.Luckily though what it lacks in depth of artistry it manages to make up with charming characters. The voice actors still have it when...it comes to performing their roles, especially Maou and Emi, and their impeccable comedic timing is still fun to watch. The introduction of Alas Ramus, the mysterious fruit baby and the fallout of her insisting that the Devil and the Hero are her mother and father was hilarious and perfectly sets up the season. I like how this affects Maou’s and Emi’s relationship too. Their complicated history and reluctant partnership are really interesting and I’m glad this season still builds upon it.I’m not a fan of this season's main villain Gabriel, but I do wonder how much of my opinion of him is skewed because he always seems to be animated poorly. At the very least he’s mid-tier.I can’t blame you if you were a fan of White Fox’s first season and after seeing this you dropped the show. I think it’s still a good show and the animation errors only really affected my enjoyment during fight scenes. They’re still the same loveable characters, just a bit less polished and with their eyes further apart.I’m torn between giving this a 6 or 7, but I’m going to give it a very low:7/10 Good-ish it comes to performing their roles, especially Maou and Emi, and their impeccable comedic timing is still fun to watch.

The attributes that made it cute and entertaining in the first season were stripped away. Even worse was the convoluted story that left nothing resolved and everything open-ended and confusing.Before I get started, on a side note, I saw a lot of people comment on the animation differences. I mean, it is to be expected for several different reasons. Still, it didn\'t bother me beyond the first episode. And not so much a bother, more just that I had to adjust to it.Now...I don\'t know how to summarize into one sentence what the...season\'s about, honestly. We are introduced to baby Alas Ramus, who considers Maou and Emi her parents. We have the introduction of Gabriel, an angel, and his desire to take Alas Ramus back with him because reasons. We have random demons appearing to ""start up trouble,"" I suppose, not even sure of their purpose. And the overall friend gang aimlessly walking around doing nothing...Genuinely, none of the side characters had a purpose this season. Especially Lucifer and Ashiya, they were just playing house. Why couldn\'t they have been given any substance this time around? Don\'t even get me started on Chiho and Suzuno, who literally just walked around following everyone else because, apparently, they had nothing better to do.There was no character development, no development between the ""friends,"" and there weren\'t even any of those stereotypical friend episodes where they all hang out and have fun but also grow closer and more trusting of each other. And I call them ""friends"" because they\'re really not. It\'s apparent that it\'s all out of convenience that they spend so much time together.The biggest upset was changing Maou from being a responsible, mature, and very much blissfully ignorant character to being immature and pervy. There were several gag jokes in this that were incredibly out-of-character for him and disappointing to watch.How I wish this season went...Give it a singular focus - a random baby appears and calls Maou and Emi her parents. They, along with the group, try researching where she could have come from and what her background/species is. They test this out by doing funny exams of her strength, her magic, and so on. This would also give Lucifer and Ashiya something to do other than being homebound while Emi and Maou are at work all day.Alas Ramus would also be used as a RomCom device by bringing Maou and Emi closer together, giving them some tension, and opportunities for honest conversations. They could even have a moment where they finally talk about why Maou started the war in the first place.During this time, keep Maou at McRonald\'s. Sending him to Chiho\'s family\'s farm was irrelevant and took away from the central premise of this show which is the DEVIL IS A PART-TIMER (even more funny - at McRonald\'s).I didn\'t mind sending them to the beach town, simply to give the show a ""beach episode,"" but they didn\'t even deliver on that. They should have used this to develop friendships amongst the group.I also wouldn\'t have minded using the beach episode to still introduce the idea of demons appearing on Earth, but instead of seeing them on the beach, the group notices a sudden and strong fog and then a sudden and strong wind before rapidly disappearing. After this odd occurrence, they then ask the owner about it, and she says that it only started to happen recently.Then, Lucifer comes across an article about a strange weather phenomenon, so Maou has him research to see if more were reported in the area. Eventually, they reach a point where they realize it\'s the gate opening, and that demons may be trying to come through, so they track down when the next one will happen.This moment of the demons coming through the gate could play similarly to how the ""demon battle"" scene actually happened. How they explain that Olba told them to go to Earth and all that, BUT, rather than the abrupt change in plans because OH IT\'S KING SATAN...instead...they see ""the hero"" on the same side as their king and think that she\'s brainwashed him because why would that ever happen otherwise? Thus, a proper battle does commence until Maou gets them to understand he\'s not under her control, and so on.After this, and what could have been a funny addition, is having the demon army stay for a day because Maou has to replenish his magic before sending them back through the gate. But during this time, they are shown ""THE CASTLE"" and it\'s the apartment, and then Ashiya proudly boasts about Maou\'s job...at McRonald\'s. And having their reactions to all of that.I think that could have been hilarious!That said, other things I would change, I would get rid of Gabriel, the fact that Alas Ramus is the tree of life, and get rid of her becoming Emi\'s sword. I\'m sorry, if I was a mother and my child became a weapon, I WOULD NEVER USE IT. You could risk hurting or killing your child whenever you fight with them. How weird was that?I would keep that the angel that saved Maou is Emi\'s Mom. I thoroughly enjoyed that though I didn\'t like how it was revealed.That all said, overall, the plot development that happened was uneventful, and the show as a whole was weak.

Mama lost her courage for a minute.""-- the following is a discussion on how poor animation and misunderstanding can ruin something previously fun. very brief run through of events to illustrate bad pacing. reader discretion is advised. --I\'ve been late to the party for most recent anime events. I started my days with Sword Art Online around its release, but that\'s the only hype train I was apart of back then. In the years following, I frequently saw The Devil is a Part Timer shine brightly on Netflix pages and never gave it the time of day. I tried a few other shows...and didn\'t really get gripped by the medium until last year, realizing how popular the original is. And, noticing that a second season was coming out, I gave it my time.I really wish I didn\'t give the second season my time. It felt like Stockholm syndrome for the first few episodes. ""It\'s not as good, but I don\'t understand why everyone else is complaining"" was what I said to a friend those first few weeks. Then, it clicked.Animation. My god, is it just oozing laziness out of every line. Characters are more like mannequins than actual living beings that the audience is supposed to feel something for. There\'s a close-up and someone is speaking. Yeah, it doesn\'t look great, but their mouth is in-sync so we\'ve hit the lowest bar, great. The next frame has a different character speaking in a group shot, showing the other characters nearby. They have no life. They don\'t blink, they don\'t react, they simply exist to show that they\'re present for this dialogue. The entire frame was drawn once and each subsequent one in that scene has only the character speaking being altered. Even when there\'s a ""lol funny reaction"" expression, it takes a few seconds for the character to pump it out. A bunch of old animatronics that should\'ve been sent in for maintenance, but have been left to rot for seven years. The action is brought down too with the all too common anime mishap of giant blasts of light and fights lasting mere moments - at least in the original there was a layer of comedy and stakes.Misunderstanding. What made the original a lot of fun was character interaction between our two leads as well as the antics the entire cast found themselves in - light fish-out-of-water story with some serious beats lurking in the background. This season is way too convoluted and goes at a breakneck pace, leaving the fun behind. So much just \'happens\' that we accept and move on to the next event in the blink of an eye. Hey we have every character acting as a shell of their former selves with their personalities boiled down to one or two aspects, whoa now there\'s a KID, raising them sure is hard (and we\'re her parents!??!?!), let\'s go to an amusement park, Emi\'s co-worker likes WHO!?!? (let\'s not talk more about that at all until the end of the season now please), another angel is here to kill us, oh he gave up but now MCRONALDS IS REMODLEING? HOW WILL WE MAKE MON-, oh a beach house to work at, hey that\'s a bird, the bird is now gone, let\'s work at Chi\'s family farm, another angel now, WAIT MY MOM!??!, let\'s buy a TV, it\'s over. What? Okay. That happened. Sure, maybe some comes from my inconsistency in keeping up, but binging a few episodes back to back I was surprised with the amount of stuff happening but also how... useless it all feels. I \'guess\' Maou and Emi are closer now through Alas Ramus, but that\'s really the only development that happens and even THAT is insignificant - it doesn\'t feel different at all.At least the original VAs came back, giving these robotic imitations some convincing material. I\'m not actually against the idea of Alas Ramus, I think she\'s a decent addition that I at least can\'t recognize shortcomings with since she\'s brand new. I laughed a little, I think they\'re preying on nostalgia a bit too much with varying levels of success (ex: ED goes well, OP fails), and the episodes went by quickly.I\'m cheesed, this sucked. and didn\'t really get gripped by the medium until last year, realizing how popular the original is.

Hey we have every character acting as a shell of their former selves with their personalities boiled down to one or two aspects, whoa now there\'s a KID, raising them sure is hard (and we\'re her parents!??!?!), let\'s go to an amusement park, Emi\'s co-worker likes WHO!?!? (let\'s not talk more about that at all until the end of the season now please), another angel is here to kill us, oh he gave up but now MCRONALDS IS REMODLEING? HOW WILL WE MAKE MON-, oh a beach house to work at, hey that\'s a bird, the bird is now gone, let\'s work at Chi\'s family farm, another angel now, WAIT MY MOM!??!, let\'s buy a TV, it\'s over. What? Okay. That happened. Sure, maybe some comes from my inconsistency in keeping up, but binging a few episodes back to back I was surprised with the amount of stuff happening but also how... useless it all feels. I \'guess\' Maou and Emi are closer now through Alas Ramus, but that\'s really the only development that happens and even THAT is insignificant - it doesn\'t feel different at all.At least the original VAs came back, giving these robotic imitations some convincing material. I\'m not actually against the idea of Alas Ramus, I think she\'s a decent addition that I at least can\'t recognize shortcomings with since she\'s brand new. I laughed a little, I think they\'re preying on nostalgia a bit too much with varying levels of success (ex: ED goes well, OP fails), and the episodes went by quickly.I\'m cheesed, this sucked.', ""Some people have been waiting almost a decade for a sequel to The Devil Is A Part Timer and a lot of us feel the need to ask, how did it come to this? I normally wait until I am done watching all the episodes in a season before giving a review but I'm not confident the remaining episodes will change my mind much if at all so lets get into it.Everything about this season is a major downgrade compared to the first season in 2013. The animation is a downgrade with a mediocre at best moe artstyle, the plot has downgraded from glorious comedy...about Satan working in fast food to a generic romcom with isekai elements and the characters most of them get zero development from the first season and are downgraded personality wise.Its truly a shame because its not in any top 10 lists for this Summer and no one talks about it. Even worse yet if you have the misfortune of being spoiled with the LN ending it makes you want to watch this season even less. S2 is not unwatchable levels of bad by any means but if you are going in to this season expecting the levels of comedy and expression from back in 2013 expect to wind up disappointed. about Satan working in fast food to a generic romcom with isekai elements and the characters most of them get zero development from the first season and are downgraded personality wise.Its truly a shame because its not in any top 10 lists for this Summer and no one talks about it.

Hataraku Maou-sama first season is well made but this is not my favorite.  So guys what do you think about this...anime please reply me. anime please reply me."", ""tl;dr the sequel curse hit strong. lacks the charm and easy humor of the first seasonMaybe it's just nostalgia but I swear I remember the first season being much funnier or at the very least much more noteworthy. And I mean from a content perspective it makes sense since by this point Maou & co are more adjusted to Japanese society, but it still means you don't get the same great reverse isekai laughs.But honestly that's pretty minor compared to the extreme pacing issues. If it weren't for that I'd honestly have given it a 6 or higher. With a nicely sized group of...core characters that are all quirky in their own ways without being too extra or annoying, the show still delivers an enjoyable experience overall with plenty of humorous moments. Hataraku Maou-sama!! starts out fine with the introduction of a mysterious new character who promises to be the catalyst for much of the action for the season, but then quickly becomes a token toon that sees little if any development at all throughout the disaster of a plot.Instead, the viewer is given about 6 episodes worth of filler SOL of the MC doing some random part-time work that honestly could've been skipped with little impact on the story. Still, that would've been fine and dandy if it weren't framed on both sides by the other 6 episodes that feel like they belong in a different, more energetic and less SOL-esque show. The resulting show now feels rushed whenever the main plot is being advanced but slow and boring in the middle episodes when it isn't. It gets so bad that I was hardly able to follow the last episode at all.I'd also like to mention that the tone of the show feels different. Season one was a more straightforward action/adventure anime. Season two feels more like a romcom with its strong emphasis on cute girls doing cute things. Still enjoyable sure, but for different reasons that fans of the first season may not appreciate.Anyway, all that to say that if you watched season one and liked it you'll probably still enjoy this one. Just know that if you were looking for the same exact kind of enjoyment this will be a miss. core characters that are all quirky in their own ways without being too extra or annoying, the show still delivers an enjoyable experience overall with plenty of humorous moments.

Kind of the same issue with Ashiya, but that may be because he is overworked.Story/Plot may be decent enough to overlook the issues with the animation.

But in this second season, 9 actual years later, familiarity breeds contempt as much of the underlying tension between human and demon camps has dissipated along with the newcomer gags. The animation quality has suffered and the series feels forced, as characters and the plot try to find reasons for existing, and we’re...saddled with a tired parenting comedy as the excuse that binds the series together.

For the OG, I remember liking the sparse action as well as the characters mainly. For the second season the humor landed better, maybe just because I'm older this time around. The characters were just as charming thankfully and they bounce off of each other very well. The action this time around is almost nonexistent and lame. Tbh I'd just prefer no action at all at this point. It wasn't really engaging or impressive in anyway. The story...is the same as ever, which it's really just there as a vessel to deliver jokes, fun dynamics, and fun little scenarios.

The series has 100% always used these odd sticking faces in their animations since the first season and it tried to do so straight forward into the 2nd, be it a little bumpy at first but it did not ruin the experience for myself at least.Story Telling:The story overall told felt great and great pacing, the MUCH further expansion into the Ente Isla world from the first season was a welcome sight for myself, someone who had felt the fire season left far too little to the imagination of the world Maou/Emi came from. Not only this but it had expanded even further into Lucifer/Aciel past and introduced exactly what mythos the anime uses for their story (Hebrew Bible Tree of Life).10/10: I was not expecting so much digging into the actual back story and canon involvement of the universe. A lot more then the first series ever introduced. Where as the first season felt somewhat slice of life with conflict this season felt as though it focused on lore and universe building behind Ente Isla.The Animations:The animation style at first is jarring if you had watched and grown accustom to the 1st season\'s however it is smooth. There are some faces that do feel slightly forced (Likely due to trying to replicate that of the 1st season or even trying to stick to the source material) but there are other expressions that they drop that really pay off (This mainly included the first new character introduced to the season) This also fixes up almost 4 episodes in after they begin to use their own animation style more to show expression rather than trying to replicate the previous studio.I will say I have also noticed a lack of trying to do combat/fighting scenes. At least it seemed this way as there were times they could have made a spectacle of a fight however it feels like they choose to just give it a quick simple response then to spend long times on fighting scenes. Which I would deem a problem if the first one had not been similar in their style of handling fight scenes. From being just zoom outs and just blowing glowing orbs or just flashing away when an impact happens so I am not too upset that a similar thing was done.7/10: I am upset at the fact that dropped some gimmicks the previous studio had (Such as Emi\'s hair antenna being indicative to her emotion and always changing based on her extreme emotion she is feeling for comical relief) however overall the animation was smooth and well done. They for some reasons started the series with CG in the first episode but it isn\'t introduced against through the entire season.Character Development:This season really did expand on the stories of each character of the series that was severely lacking in season 1. If you are really invested into the world of The Devil Work\'s Part Time this really is the anime for you as you learn a LOT of the back story of Maou and crew.10/10Overall: I really enjoyed this season far more than I thought I would have with little expectations as someone who has been a massive fan of the series from season 1. Feeling as thought the show left so much on the table and ending in sort of a cliffhanger this season 100% expanded on the story and universe so much that I wanted to see it play out.

Hataraku season one was not a masterpiece by any means, but it was good at what it was trying to be. A nice mix of reverse Isekai, Slice of Life and a Mystery, all strung together by a charming cast, grounded humor and a wink of the creator.Like this they were able to mask the problems and focus on the strong aspects of the show.The problem with this season on the other hand is simple.

When I picked up this series recently, I had no clue this season was coming out, and after finding the first season as charming as I did, I was excited to see what came next for these characters. There certainly was—rather remarkably, considering the years between the first season and this one—the same, exact charm in this season as there was in the last, and because of that, I got to have a great time with these characters again. However, I do also feel like I was missing something this season, which is...odd because, for all intents and purposes, it’s the same, silly, random series it’s always been. I suppose I was expecting a bit more to come from a second season than what did come from it.I mean, there are certainly dynamics being explored with this season that hadn’t been explored before (the addition of a tiny, adorable child is proof enough of that), but in terms of what was going on the whole season—it felt a bit bland. I have to say, I didn’t think the first season of this series did terribly well with its balance of action versus the mundane, but I still found the more highly-paced sequences engaging enough to sustain my interest. To me, that was lost a bit this season, and the balance felt even more off. Now, that might just be preference in anime, so I think most people who loved the first season will love this one. Ultimately, I don’t think this series was meant to get entirely serious, so I can’t fault it for remaining a bit frivolous. Not everything was frivolous, mind you—I did see some good character development for certain characters that I thought was well done and did a lot to increase how connected I felt to the series and that particular person. I just wasn’t as engaged this season as I wanted to be.

Unfortunately I must say that Devil is a Part Timer s2 disappoints and for one simple reason. It wasn't funny. The first season was a comedy that focused on a Demon Lord whose isekaied to 21st century Japan and has to work Part time at a fast food joint to survive. Maou, the titular devil was recognisably a Demon and this created some interesting and humorous situations especially when the Hero who wants to kill him arrived. The current season however feel significantly less funny...and  almost all of Maou's demonic traits receive less attention, resulting in him appearing less demonic and more like an average anime protagonist, which removes the main appeal of the story. Also, the season as a whole focuses a lot more on the story and a lot less on the comedy, which is a shame as the comedy stood out last season. The story did not and this has become even more obvious in this season. The story comes across as a fairly standard good vs evil story and is largely uninteresting. Furthermore its punctuated by a series of rather dull filler episodes focused first on Maou getting other part time work on a beach restaurant and later on helping out on a farm.Overall, Devil is a part timer s2 was a step down from the first season.

I would give this a one if not for Urushihara, he is the literal one interesting thing about this season. The story is fairly non-sensical and is just more ""devil/angel things happen on Earth for no reason"". The characters are their same tropey selves, and only little bits of changes occur in the final episode, without spoiling, that just recontextualize characters rather than develop them.The devil is as well rounded as a piece of cardboard. I\'ve seen about 600 characters written the same way as Emi. Chiho...is obnoxious. Ashiya isn\'t annoying but is not as dynamic or involved as he was in the first season. Urushihara is the only character I like because he hates everyone else as much as I do. And my god that baby. That stupid f--king baby. Sometimes it\'s an infant. Sometimes it\'s speaking complete sentences in a baby voice. All the time it is obvious it is a grown woman trying to sound like a baby.This is not ""The Devil is a Part Timer"", this was ""The Devil was a Babysitter for an Obnoxious Little C--t"".

While this isn\'t the biggest concern, it is definitely notable. Secondly, the character design and interactions....bland. There are times where it seems like the characters aren\'t even interested in their own story. Finally, the overall plot and story. This is the worst part. The appeal...from the first season, where it\'s the devil trying to live a human life while re-gaining the ability to travel back to his homeland, is almost entirely gone. He still wants to go home, but the human life aspect...it\'s not. It\'s just supernatural fight after fight. There\'s no flow between the different arcs, they leave very little room for explanation, and it seems like they tried to fit as many arcs as they can into one season...all the while neglecting the comedy aspect of the show. Any comedy is boring and unfunny, completely the opposite of the first season. And then there\'s the concept of the events in this season. As I mentioned, they aren\'t explained very well, so things just kinda happen, but it also doesn\'t make any sense.

I genuinely loved the first season and I have rewatched the first season on many occasions. I think there are 2 main factors to why i do not like this series and why i think it has failed the past creators.The first is usue is the art style, everything looks very ""cartoonie"" now, dont really feel like i am watching a anime.... If that was the only issue I would probably not complain about it but there is so many little things that were so funny in...the first season like the facial expressions, there was always detail there. Now the characters feel like they have like 5 emotions that the just cycle through. I use to love whats the boys talk about something or work on a issue they are having but now they are just a bunch of stick figures that are meaningless..... I have never thought I could say this but, the quality of this show is clearly better in the first season rather then the second (its rare something like this happens, usually improvements happen over time)My second issue with this series is that the story line is feeling week. Even though i have only gone through about half the season, I am still not fully invested in a the story. The current villain so far seems like it will be the angel Gabriel and I still liked alciel better because there was a air of mystery with him, we had no idea that was the bad guy till later in the story. Gabriel on the other hand feels like a joke, the character is feels weak and the only attribute we have for that character is that he is strong?! The art style again probably does not help this character feel solid. It seems that on all aspects of this anime, the quality has definitely diminished.Even though this is not what i was expecting the next season to look like, I think ill finish it for the sake of finishing it but I do have to say this so far feels like a let down.... the first season like the facial expressions, there was always detail there.

Comparing to the first season it sucks so don\'t even try.The plot is ok, following on from the first season, it\'s the main gang getting used to ""normal"" life in Japan, along with new characters, like Maou\'s ""daughter"", Alas Ramus, and new antagonists. This time the anime aims more at slice-of-life and humor than at the plot, as if in preparation for the third season, that\'s why lots of importante plot points weren\'t awnsered (they need people to watch next season lol) leaving the series more boring, very generic. The comedy...was fine tho, i can\'t deny i laughed a little bit.There is a change in the trace and artstyle from the first season, that bothered me at first, but as the episodes went by I got used to it.I don\'t think I even need to mention the completely grotesque animation, with lots of ugly static images for long periods on screen and scenes that you see were very poorly done, probably due to lack of funds.As someone who was a fan of hatamaou I was really upset with this second season, a third has already been announced, but my expectations are pretty low to be honest. I\'m so sad to rank it as bad.By the way, in addition to being my first review, english is not my first language, I had help from the translator in certain parts, I hope it is at least intelligible ahaha. was fine tho, i can\'t deny i laughed a little bit.There is a change in the trace and artstyle from the first season, that bothered me at first, but as the episodes went by I got used to it.I don\'t think I even need to mention the completely grotesque animation, with lots of ugly static images for long periods on screen and scenes that you see were very poorly done, probably due to lack of funds.As someone who was a fan of hatamaou I was really upset with this second season, a third has already been announced, but my expectations are pretty low to be honest.

The characters themselves were definitely the highlight, they are a lot of fun and I like their interactions a lot and I don't think that was lost at all in this season.

New animation.2. Writing of this season.3. OP & END song choices.I love a good OP & END theme but for an anime that's about demons and angels fighting a war in the human realm, I find the opening title sequence to be anticlimactic. It doesn't grab my attention and it looks like something from a magical girl anime rather than a fantasy/comedy.The animation style changed along with the company and don't get me wrong, I don't like it. But it does bare more of a resemblance to the manga art style, it's just too...much of a change for me to feel comfortable with. Considering the first season came out when... like—2013? You would think they would have enough materials to work with to insert LESS FILLER. Like—OML, the amount of filler in this series makes me understand why there are so many mixed feelings about this season.A studio that was given so much material to work with shouldn't have this much filler while leaving gaps in their project only to make us wait even longer to find out what is going to happen. much of a change for me to feel comfortable with.

And I\'m not talking about just the Art style. Even the pacing, story structure, character presentation, camera angles, and such are completely different now. Seeing as it\'s been 7 years, and the entire staff seems to be completely different this time around (at least based on what\'s listed here on MAL), I guess that\'s to be expected. With that being said, it\'s still quite a pretty easy-to-watch decent show, especially if you already loved the characters from the prior season.STORY:One of the main things to prepare for when watching this...sequel is the drastic change in direction: It\'s romance-heavy now.The first season was quite emotion-driven, with a hero having a dilemma, and the Devil appreciating a newfound life. This sequel on the other hand is mostly leeching off the character bonds that the first season carefully and calculatedly built and immediately jumps into ""Shipping Mode"". Whether that\'s a good or bad thing is up to the viewer\'s taste/genre preference. I personally find it quite fun. But I\'d definitely still want to feel the same intensity between the characters as in S1 when there were still distrusts and doubts due to their history, even until the end of that season.One thing that I surely appreciate from this season though is the relevancy of ""Ente Isla"". The 1st season kept mentioning, and even showing it but even then, it didn\'t make me feel like I wanted to see it, nor did I want the characters to go back there. But this time, I am quite curious to see what state that place is in at this point of the story.CHARACTERS:A lot has changed when it comes to the character dynamics and mannerisms. Such as:EMI easily feeling embarrassed/flushed when interacting with Maou, which is far from what the last episode of S1 teased.BEL easily getting irritated/mad over little statements which she usually just brushes off or sassily retorts to.CHIHO lost all the fun in her. This actually started halfway of S1 but, she\'s went full generic kind-hearted princess this season.MAOU and EMI\'s tense ""Frienemy"" dynamic is now basically a Tsundereͯͯͯ+Dense relationship.These changes scream ""Romance""-centric. Especially when you start to notice that almost every single character seems to be slowly being paired with another.Romance aside, I do appreciate the new characters. GABRIEL\'s quick-witted dialogues have been fun so far (he\'s only been in one episode as of this writing though :P), and I hope it stays that way til the climax. And of course...ALAS RAMUS IS SO KAWAII DESU! >.<ART & SOUND:Not only did the Art style change, it also became so inconsistent. Faces distorting and such. It could be due to a limited budget, or it could be sheer laziness. Who knows?VA\'s lost a lot of the characters\' spirit. While they all still sound exactly the same, some have lost the personalities in their voices. I noticed Emi\'s voice changes a lot and, it strays away from the Emi character voice from time to time. Maou and Urushihara still sound quite the same as they did before, though. Alas Ramus\'s VA is doing a pretty good job, imo. Not forcing cuteness. Just about the right level. The OP sounds quite generic Anime theme for me, tbh. But the ED sounds pretty good.OVERALL:I\'m still in between when it comes to this sequel. It\'s a pretty fine, entertaining watch but, it definitely strayed so far away from the quality and execution of S1. I understand that it\'s been 7 years since S1 but, I wish the overall production quality didn\'t drop so low. I wouldn\'t have minded the Animation quality drop and the sudden change in story direction, but I wish they had the same staff, at least the director, working on it.But it\'s just getting started.

But if you do not consider animation to be one of the key factors, and solely watch anime for its story, then this is one that you mustn\'t skip.This anime is recommended for every ""FANTASY"" anime lover.', 'This is an excellent anime with a fantastic cast and Characters However, I think we can all agree when the first season aired a decade ago the idea was fresh in the Isekai genre! the sad part is when it returned a decade later the anime was no longer as unique as it first was because of the massive growth in the Isekai genre! :(This anime still has amazing art and animation that is way better than a lot of series out there and the characters are loveable.Personally, I like the idea of the MC exploring why he wanted to take over the world...in the first place! and all sorts of different characters coming together for one common goal! in the first place! and all sorts of different characters coming together for one common goal!', ""Man do I feel like a choosey beggar.I loved the first season, was really surprised and thrilled when a second season came out years later!I even re-watched the first season before starting the 2nd. Just as good as I remembered. Went straight into the first episode of the new season, and that was probably a mistake.Immediately noticable is that the art style is different (worse). They also immediately launched into the same kind of bit that was used to hilarious effect in the first season, but somehow it just.. wasn't very funny? Idk.I warmed up to it a little more a few...episodes in, they seemed to get a better handle of the humor a little further in, the action is good and the story is interesting enough.It isn't bad by any means, but it falls flat in comparison to it's predecessor 🤷\u200d♀️I definitely recommend the first season, and I would recommend the second season too, as long as you adjust your expectations. episodes in, they seemed to get a better handle of the humor a little further in, the action is good and the story is interesting enough.It isn't bad by any means, but it falls flat in comparison to it's predecessor 🤷\u200d♀️I definitely recommend the first season, and I would recommend the second season too, as long as you adjust your expectations."", 'What in the devil\'s name happened here...The first season of Hataraku Maou was a pleasant surprise, utilising its premise of reverse isekai to effectively generate comedy from the ""fish-out-of-water"" situations its characters are being placed in. It was a breath of fresh air and genuinely entertaining to watch because of this.Then Season 2 finally arrives after a 9 year hiatus, and it turns out to be none of the above.Right off the bat, we are introduced to the baby daughter archetype who literally popped out of nowhere, and the two leads must now take care of her, the laziest way for an anime to force...character engagement. But as the show went on, I realised that this was done more out of necessity, because Season 2 has no other plot development to speak of, everything was either trite slice of life BS, or unceremoniously dropped after a couple of episodes with no meaning resolution whatsoever, so the little rut was needed here to trick attachment out of viewers, in the same way how some video games give you a cute animal companion to pet, so you\'ll overlook how boring and terrible its gameplay loop is. All the intrigue and wit from Season 1 are just gone. The cast are a shadow of their former selves and don\'t get to do anything of consequence; the comedy devolved into slapstick nonesense; and the story is almost entirely absent. The show is effectively a generic romcom at this point, with its 12 whole episodes telling us less about the characters or the world than a single episode from Season 1, offering next to nothing new in terms of either character development or worldbuilding.Having slogged through the entire thing, the only highlight for me was the occasion witticism from some of the side characters who haven\'t completely gone off to the deep end, and everything else was just a misery to look at, from the noticeably inferior production values, to how insubstantial the story is. A sequel to a much beloved classic and 9 years in the making, and what we got was nothing but a pale imitation of its former glory, a cynical product churned out to cash in on the brand name alone.

The first season was great, with an interesting premise, likeable characters, solid humour and a certain charm that makes it stand out in my memory when I looked back on previous anime I have watched.Sadly most of the charm has been sucked out with this 2nd season, not only has this season seen a significant change...in visuals (which in my opinion are a downgrade) but the actual animation itself and the way in which scenes are choregraphed kinda suck and SCREAM low budget. The characters act a little different from what I remember and the plot itself in this season is nonsensical, shoving mythical lore down your throat that you don't care about and focusing a lot on the fantasy elements of the world the characters left behind at the very start of the first season.More than ever this anime feels like a slice of life but not in a good way, in the first season you see the characters trying to adjust to their new life alongside somewhat of a plot but in this season every episode feels so disjointed and meaningless with the addition of a new main character that I personally don't care for. There are still some humorous moments which I appreciated but unfortunately the plot and writing sucks to the point where I just couldn't care about what was happening. Also the voice acting for the dub isn't great, the sub seems to be a lot better.I will say though that I liked the music in this season, particularly the intro which SLAPS. However a decent OST ain't gonna make a show worth watching. Overall I'm really disappointed and won't be watching the already announced season 3 which I suspect is gonna suffer hard from low viewership numbers thanks to the low quality of this season. in visuals (which in my opinion are a downgrade) but the actual animation itself and the way in which scenes are choregraphed kinda suck and SCREAM low budget.

Literally, since this is an anime about diabolical characters. The first season was great, even if it was filtered with melodramatic themes, as it wasnt the main plot device, and still had other elements that were well explained.

Do not watch this if you were expecting the same show, it's entirely different, and has shitty pacing.They introduce characters and do not explain at all about any of the plot, to the point where it's just a clusterfuck and insanely confusing....I was watching this with my friend, and we both watched the entire season in a day and hated it. We even watched the 1st season to compare the contrast in the characters in the newer season. Almost 10 whole years for a completely drama driven show, and I am 100% positive the only reason this would have good reviews is due to hype and fanboys who did not want to believe that this show turned into the most disrespectful attempt of the first season.

Juubee-chan: Lovely Gantai no Himitsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/635/Juubee-chan__Lovely_Gantai_no_Himitsu,"['Jubei-chan is an anime that probably fools most viewers at its start. What appears to be a stereotypical show about average high school kids who must save the day from evil bad guys is actually a clever satirical comedy. This is hard to realize at first because it plays so many of its cliches straight that it can easily be mistaken for one of the very shows that it mocks. And, if you\'ve seen enough of those kinds of shows, this one may already turn you off by the intro scene; after all, it involves the played out scenario of two rival samurai battling to...the death. It\'s all very serious, but things do start to feel odd. If you continue watching, small absurdities will build up until the show\'s true nature is revealed. The creators actually expect their viewers to be as savvy as they are when it comes to this genre, which is how they have the freedom to play around with it as much as they do.While other protagonists of similar anime would be all too eager to accept their given role as the hero of the story by the end of the first episode, Nanohana Jiyu on the other hand won\'t be motivated at all by the desperate begging of a stranger—the stranger, in this case, being the 300 year old samurai, Odago Koinosuke, who urgently insists that she must fight as the reincarnation of his clan\'s ancestor, Yagyuu Jubei, in an ongoing feud with a sinister rival clan. If that all sounded like boring exposition to you, Jiyu would agree. She\'ll need more than that to convince her to change her life completely. It isn\'t fear or anxiety that ever holds her back: it\'s pure indifference. She just does not care about this conflict thrust upon her from seemingly nowhere. After all, why should she? She\'s happy with her life the way it is, and it\'s the creators\' success in subverting this classic trope of the typical selfless protagonist that proves just how self aware they really are.Jiyu refuses to comply by consistently casting aside the show\'s McGuffin, the Lovely Eyepatch, and refuses to acknowledge or even understand the importance of it. But she\'s not dumb, and she\'s certainly not a ditsy air-head either. You\'ll notice that there\'s a lot more going on in her head than what\'s first implied. In fact, one of the most endearing things about Jiyu is seeing how she reacts to the situations in her life in surprisingly realistic ways, and how she eventually comes to find her own reasons for fighting. She\'s also just plain adorable, and her relationship with her father is both a central driving force in the story and something amusing to see in its own right. Sometimes they get along, other times they fight, but you can always tell they really care about each other.The same can be said for most of the characters in Jubei-Chan when it comes to the chemistry they have together. The aforementioned Koinosuke\'s attempts to convince Jiyu are hilariously futile, but there\'s a charm to his desperation. Bantarou, the school\'s self-proclaimed ""Banchou,"" has fallen in love with Jiyu at first sight, and as such, is on a never-ending quest to confess to her. And as for Shiro, Jiyu\'s other schoolmate...well, it\'s the same story for him. Yes, it\'s quite common for characters in this series to fall in love with Jiyu at first sight. I guess who could blame them, right? But this actually plays into one of the show\'s greatest comedic strengths: repetition.This show loves to find humor in repetition, which is a tricky thing to do without running jokes into the ground. However, this show really understands what kinds of things are worth repeating. For example: The first time a character gets lost in a particular forest, you might only smirk, but by the end of the series, once almost every character has managed to do this, you may just laugh out loud at what is essentially the same gag. And this repetitive humor comes through most noticeably in the recurring ways that characters always introduce themselves. They do so with such conviction even at times when it would be absurd given the contexts of their situations. There\'s also a peculiar pattern that begins to develop where the characters find themselves mixed up in various bike chase scenes, if that\'s what you could call them, where their sillier quirks really have the opportunities to shine.But if it wasn\'t enough that this show\'s humor takes time to show itself, it also comes in multiple unexpected and unusual forms. There are long pauses that sometimes last for almost half a minute reminiscent of those from Evangelion, except that in this case the pauses are used for humor rather than for dramatic tension. Characters frequently make exaggerated faces, but not of the typical chibi anime variety. Their limbs, too, are freely distorted and stretched to fit the context of the joke or scene, and the laws of physics need not always apply. These exaggerations are even funnier in contrast to the relatively realistic proportions that the characters usually conform to. The show also has a funny habit of showing characters exit or enter scenes in deliberately strange ways. Yet, throughout all of these visual character gags, the animators at Madhouse still pay lots of attention to detail.Even at its goofiest, the animation quality is well above average, and characters are rarely off-model—that is, unless intentionally so. The show is just great to look at, from the smooth animation to the mellow but inviting color pallet. Characters are animated with such subtlety in even the smallest of movements that they really come to life. Even the fight scenes, while hardly ever the main attraction, are nonetheless choreographed beautifully. Unlike in shounen fighting series whose fights rely on slow calculative strategy, the fights in Jubei-Chan are short and sweet, relying on the natural flow of the sword fighting itself—of which Madhouse certainly put in their research, evident in the sword fighting\'s relative authenticity when compared to other anime. And, because of this adherence to flow, the fights are usually over before you know it, neither being boring nor overstaying their welcome.The music of this series is nice as well, particularly Jiyu\'s theme which is always a pleasure to hear at crucial moments. A different arrangement of this theme also serves as the series\' opening theme, although this somehow manages to be one of the strangest openings that I\'ve ever seen for an anime: For just about 15 seconds this music plays before cutting out prematurely, after which Jiyu continues to ride her bike towards the screen for a few more seconds of dead, awkward silence. Perhaps that is the joke.If I had to point out a real flaw of Jubei-Chan, it would be that its repetition isn\'t always used to great effect; this is most apparent in the second half of the series when certain lengthy monologues reiterate exposition that feels more like filler, rather than opportunities to create humor. You may get tired of hearing the details of Yagyuu Jubei\'s backstory. However, if you\'re already invested in this show\'s strengths by this point, then sitting through these occasional scenes shouldn\'t bother you too much—especially when it all leads to a satisfying conclusion.For a comedy, you usually wouldn\'t expect a conclusion to matter too much considering the episodic nature that most of them have, but this show does have a linear plot that runs though each episode. In the later episodes this plot starts taking up more and more of the screen time, and it does take itself pretty seriously at times, but don\'t worry: the comedy never completely goes away. That being said, the show\'s attempts to deliver serious character development, most notably for Jiyu and her father, are not in vain. Their story arc is genuinely touching, albeit not the most emotional thing you\'ve ever seen. It\'s just something extra to make the show a little more memorable.At its core, though, this is a comedy, and it\'s one that slowly reveals its genius as it goes along. It may not have you laughing at first, but there\'s an odd repetition to it that lulls you into its rhythm over time, and before you know it, scenarios that you\'ve been seeing over and over again throughout the series become absolutely hilarious. I recommend that you at least give Jubei-Chan a try, especially if you\'ve already seen a fair amount of other anime series. the death. It\'s all very serious, but things do start to feel odd.

And, because of this adherence to flow, the fights are usually over before you know it, neither being boring nor overstaying their welcome.The music of this series is nice as well, particularly Jiyu\'s theme which is always a pleasure to hear at crucial moments. A different arrangement of this theme also serves as the series\' opening theme, although this somehow manages to be one of the strangest openings that I\'ve ever seen for an anime: For just about 15 seconds this music plays before cutting out prematurely, after which Jiyu continues to ride her bike towards the screen for a few more seconds of dead, awkward silence. Perhaps that is the joke.If I had to point out a real flaw of Jubei-Chan, it would be that its repetition isn\'t always used to great effect; this is most apparent in the second half of the series when certain lengthy monologues reiterate exposition that feels more like filler, rather than opportunities to create humor. You may get tired of hearing the details of Yagyuu Jubei\'s backstory. However, if you\'re already invested in this show\'s strengths by this point, then sitting through these occasional scenes shouldn\'t bother you too much—especially when it all leads to a satisfying conclusion.For a comedy, you usually wouldn\'t expect a conclusion to matter too much considering the episodic nature that most of them have, but this show does have a linear plot that runs though each episode. In the later episodes this plot starts taking up more and more of the screen time, and it does take itself pretty seriously at times, but don\'t worry: the comedy never completely goes away. That being said, the show\'s attempts to deliver serious character development, most notably for Jiyu and her father, are not in vain. Their story arc is genuinely touching, albeit not the most emotional thing you\'ve ever seen. It\'s just something extra to make the show a little more memorable.At its core, though, this is a comedy, and it\'s one that slowly reveals its genius as it goes along. It may not have you laughing at first, but there\'s an odd repetition to it that lulls you into its rhythm over time, and before you know it, scenarios that you\'ve been seeing over and over again throughout the series become absolutely hilarious. I recommend that you at least give Jubei-Chan a try, especially if you\'ve already seen a fair amount of other anime series.', ""I expected much more, all my friends were hyping this to the moon.  They said it was great, but they were wrong.  What's sad is the potential that this anime has to be great, it has such a good story line.  Unfortunately where this show suffers greatly is in the pathetic writing job.  It takes forever for the characters to develop, and I swear they're saying the same things every episode (example: Episode 1: &quot;I'm not Jubei, I'm Jiyu Nanohana&quot;.  Episode 2 &quot;I'm not Jubei, I'm Jiyu Nanohana&quot;.  Episode 3: You get the picture)Not only does the show suffer...from bad writing, but bad voice acting on both ends.  The Japanese voices are annoying, I'm all for high and cute voices, but the female voice are so high that they pierced my eardrums (or at least I thought they did).  The english voice acting is the worst that Ocean Group has ever done.  Really expect better from these guys, they did great dubs: Death Note,  Gundam Wing, and much more are on that list.  However, we are stuck with a cast that either under acts, or doesn't act at all.  This looks to me like a series full of over acting, but the voice actors show little or no skill in that department.The only good thing this series has going for it is the fight scenes.  They are sweet.  Sadly, they are short, and you have to wait all episode, before you actually see a 5 minute battle.Why is this popular in the US?  My best guess is, it came out during a time when anime fans were starving for product, when the anime section at Suncoast was only a shelf as opposed to the wall it is today.  Anime fans wanted what they loved so badly, they excepted almost anything.  Today, you find anime at Wal-Mart, Target, Some Gas stations, your city may even have an anime shop.  Those that like this, are either mostly old school fans who are nostalgic, or they like to play MST3K the home version. from bad writing, but bad voice acting on both ends.

But, the enjoyment level, for the most part, was pretty great.Most of these reviews, I imagine, took it seriously. Well, this anime has both seriousness and comedy, but more heavy on the latter.

Taking some aspects of a magical girl anime and placing it in a present day samurai settings sounds like a good idea on paper but unfortunately this anime really misses the mark with regards to making it entertaining.The genesis of this anime focuses on a...300 year old ninja rivalry between Yagyu and Ryujoji clans and how the master of Yagyu clan (Yagyu Jubei) defeated the leader of the the Ryujoji clan (Taiko Daiyu). After the battle Yagyu Jubei has imbued his power and skill into an object known as the lovely eyepatch and he has instructed his assistant Koinosuke Odago to find a worthy successor to the power of the lovely eyepatch and it took him 300 years to find that successor which is a 14 year old girl by the name of Jiyu Nanohana.Jiyu is incredibly relucant to accept the power of the lovely eyepatch, however the Ryujoji clan is seeking revenge for the defeat of their master. The current leader of the Ryujoji clan (Hajime) wants to obtain the power of the lovely eyepatch and discover all of its secrets because without it the Ryujoji clan will not be able to rule Japan as completely absurd as that sounds. Due to their ambition Jiyu is called into action in order to stop the Ryujoji clan from fulfilling their plans. She doesn't do this alone because she has the help of Koinosuke, Hajime's twin brother Shiro who is a trained high school samurai, her father Sai, her two female school friends. and a small gang of high school boys (The Ruffians). The majority of these characters serve as comic relief more than anything else without adding much depth with regards to the story that is being told in this anime. I think the characters that do contribute most to the overall story are definitely Shiro and Jiyu's dad Sai.The strongest aspect of the entire anime from my personal opinion is definitely the relationship between Jiyu and Sai. It is established very early in the anime that Jiyu's mom died and that Jiyu's father has a serious mistrust of doctors due to a doctor's misdiagnosis that led to the death of his wife. When the anime decides to take a break from it's very painful and uneventful comedy, there are some incredibly touching one on one moments between Jiyu and her dad because he is incredibly protective of her since he lost his wife due to illness and he lives with a lifetime of regret because his job as a novelist kept him away from his family. There is an even an episode where Jiyu is injured and her does everything in his power to protect her and be there for her. The relationship between them is incredibly endearing and when things got serious you can count on Jiyu's dad to do the right thing for his daughter.I think one of the worse aspects of the anime is some really god awful dialogue mixed in with humour that more often than not misses the mark rather than hit the mark. I think one of the things that personally irritated me is that every time a character introduced themselves, they would go into this long spiel about who they are or what their accomplishments were. For example Jiyu, would go into this brief spiel when someone would call her Jubei when she was in her teenage girl form and she had to correct them every time. It's necessary the first time you hear it, not necessary the 5th time you hear it. The same thing happens with the character Shiro. Shiro we don't need to hear your accomplishments in the world of swordfighting in high school competitions every time you introduce yourself. The humour in this anime has more misses than actual hits. There are moments where it does make me chuckle, but the majority of the moments completely fall flat. The humour goes from very obscure places without any significant build up such as characters being animated differently, random nonsensical verbal outbursts, and characters just doing stupidly outlandish things that don't make any sense. Personally I don't mind stupidly outlandish things but only if they're done right and they're actually outlandishly funny.You figure with an anime with the Ninja girl in the title this anime would be rife with action but surprisingly it's not as action packed as you would like to think. Most of the episodes end with a battle of some sort but the battles are so quick and brief, lasting no longer than a minute it's hard to feel satisfied when the action does start to happen. I will admit though the final fight in this anime makes up for it because it is the best battle throughout the entire anime. While the main villain is not particularly engaging it does keep you invested by changing it up with regards to who the main villain really is. The first few episodes follow a standard monster of the week format, with each of the enemies that Jiyu has to face are actually here school-teachers who all end up being minions of the Ryujoji clan. Once they are defeated, the secret power of the lovely eyepatch unleashes itself which eliminates the ryujoji grudge from each member that gets defeated by Yagyu Jubei's sword so they can return to a relatively normal life. After the first few episodes it gets out of the monster of the week format and we get a little backstory into the history of the ryujoji/yagyu rivalry while Jiyu is trying to balance her mundane life as a high school girl to becoming a powerful ninja when the need arrives.The anime also suffers from some pretty useless characters that are not needed throughout the storyline. The gang of Ruffians especially the leader Bentaro who acts as a love interest toward Jiyu. Apparently the love story is completely one sided with Jiyu not really caing one way or another despite all the attempts that Bentaro tries to perform in order to get her to pay attention to him, but it feels like such a wasted plot point in which another plot point could be better utilized. There are even a trio of very upscale girls that have a crush towards Shiro, but there is literally no background story to them and  I think they're placed in the anime to act as comic relief and even that doesn't work.The music throughout the anime is serviceable but not overly memorable. The anime does not really do much to really captivate the viewer since the opening of the anime is literally 30 seconds long with just one animated scene where Jiyu is riding her bicycle in front of the view while looking in multiple directions. That's pretty much it. It's probably the most boring uneventful anime intro I've ever seen out of all the anime I've watched over the last 30 years.Ultimately Jubei-chan - The Ninja Girl: The Secret of the Lovely Eyepatch is an interesting premise that is barely above serviceable because it is bogged down with useless side characters, ineffective comedy, and a criminally low amount of action. There are a few good things about this anime with the father-daughter interactions being the strongest aspect of what this anime has to offer. The anime does an excellent of closing off the loose ends throughout the story with a fairly touching ending so despite all the problems that I have this anime, the good does barely outweigh the bad. I certainly hope the second season does a better job of what the first season did, but at the end of the day it's worth experiencing this anime just for the different approach to the magical girl formula. 300 year old ninja rivalry between Yagyu and Ryujoji clans and how the master of Yagyu clan (Yagyu Jubei) defeated the leader of the the Ryujoji clan (Taiko Daiyu).

Stiff animation, boring characters, uninteresting plot.But if you can struggle past the first couple episodes it unfolds into a surprisingly good comedy that really pokes fun at the cliches of an old school magical girl anime.I've watched it twice both times with different friends and we were never bored and often found ourselves laughing out loud at jokes both within the show and of our own making.Jubei Chan kind of reminds me of a more PG abridged series than anything as...it comes across as very self aware of all the cliches of its nature and presents a genuinely fun time. If your not looking for a serious sword fighting anime I'd say give Jubei Chan a watch. it comes across as very self aware of all the cliches of its nature and presents a genuinely fun time.

In brief, this follows an eight-grader with big breasts that each other character seems to really be into. Even her dad a little bit. Anyways, this fun show follows average story that can turn out interesting because it still has original writing behind the not so original tropes.The story of this show can be described by one word: Average. I still find this to be a very enjoyable anime, because the character...is the best thing to come out of it. In addition, the story dives deeper than just a rivals story. There are small family disputes involved as well. This can be shown between the main male character, Hajime, and between the clan head/Antagonist helper. So far, the story starts off simple and uses simple support for its development. Not bad. Not bad at all. It can be said that the art of the show is on a more leveled field than this section is.The art of the show is actually quite fair for a 1999 show. I won\'t brag much about it, but the old style of the lines along with animation and style of choreography is a good fit for it\'s own anime. I like it. Juubei\'s suit has a more armored design than just a average ninja suit. The animation isn\'t the greatest for art, but the choreography is okay at times. The worst thing about the art is the animation, because it uses repeated frames, and looks ridiculous. Other than that, some of the characters have wacky and fun designs. It falls between feudal era and modern era.I\'m not gonna explain the sound much, but it\'s good I guess.  Not bad but still average, and nothing I would crave to listen to.Last but not least, the character for Juubei is actually fair considering how this anime is presented. In fact, Juubei has a really interesting frame or construct near the show\'s beginning. It seems instead of sticking her nose into the feud of the rivaling clan, she asks, ""Why should I care?"" That made her come off as very carefree about her surroundings. For the other characters, they are quite funny, but also a bit average. The ruffians, a gang at the school, make the least appealing impressions for this show. The leader of the gang and other characters tend to focus on the boobs of the main girl character. It doesn\'t make any sense, especially when she is like 13-14 years old! However, it would be wrong to say that these characters are under developed. The dad in the show is a good example. So far, the character is still fair, but also still mediocre.FOR RECOMMENDATIONS:Hey everyone. I apologize about making this long. This goes to new comers and people that search for things to watch. No matter what, this show is definitely not something to be underestimated, but it shouldn\'t be hyped much either. For about 3 episodes, give your opinion to continue watching. I think this show isn\'t all that bad at all. If you look at some shows now, this is actually quite better written than modern anime. See ya next time 😘 is the best thing to come out of it.

Kaze wo Mita Shounen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/757/Kaze_wo_Mita_Shounen,"['Wow.  What an under watched, underrated gem of a movie with a bit of a Studio Ghibli feel to it.  It isn\'t.  Brains Base did it.There\'s no need for me to go into the story because the synopsis does it very well . . . . for a change.It takes place in an alternate world that has the of 1930\'s Europe.  There are some pretty fantastic airships, bi-planes, tanks, and storm troopers.  The background art flows from dark, menacing snowy nights, bright island life, rain on ruins, to hope filled sunrises.  It is very effective...in setting moods that range from the grim, to innocence, to anguish and despair, to the heroic and hope filled, to the spiritual.Be aware that there is violence and death.  It is grim, realistic, and sad but not ""twisted"" or ""splattery"".  Not really one for the kiddies to watch alone and certainly not just for the kiddies.Character designs aren\'t unique or particular beautiful, but neither do they get in the way.  With the exception of the ""evil dictator"" most characters are drawn to convey ordinary people.  Come to think of it, I did like the look of some of the supporting characters.  The music is equally noninvasive. Besides a flute piece played by the main character in one scene, nothing really stands out.TBWStW can be enjoyed as a fine bit of fantasy.  If you want to go deeper it can make an anti-war statement whilesaying it\'s o.k. to fight back when threatened.  It also dips its toes into philosophy, quantum theory, and theology with its presentation of energy manipulation, many metaphors surrounding flight, and the continuation of the ""soul.""  (Take a moment to wiki C. W. Nicol, the author of the book the anime is based on.  He\'s fascinating.)I liked it. I liked it a lot, enough to give it a 9.

The vintage styling, reminiscent of ""Now and Then, Here and There"", will make you think you\'re watching a film that\'s much older than a 2000 movie. The Boy Who Saw the Wind\'s classic look paints the film as a tribal fantasy epic, despite its technologically-advanced universe. The result is a multi-temporal environment which is nostalgic, modern, and futuristic, all at the same time.Within this universe, the common boy-saves-girl anti-war drama takes place, of which Now and Then, Laputa, Conan, and Agito are variants. The Boy Who Saw the...Wind makes its mark among these through its tragic plot and awesome visuals.The only pitfall of this film is the hurried direction which takes place in the second half, most likely due to time or budget constraints. The lack of build-up and anticipation at this point makes the film seem like it\'s jumping around, but nothing important is left out.The Boy Who Saw the Wind is worth watching, especially if you enjoyed any of the above-mentioned works.

When we encounter a situation that is frightening, dangerous or emotionally painful, our nervous system activates the fight/flight response. If we are unable to resolve the situation we can go into a freeze response instead, completely shutting down either partly (such as not feeling emotions, stop feeling physical pain) or fully such as passing out. If we can resolve a dangerous situation somehow, we still need to downregulate our nervous system to ""rest and digest"", this takes time and focused effort. One problem in our world is a culture where we rather...keep a high tension dysregulated nervous system (for example by chronic screen time) than taking the effort to heal.Many good movies such as the works by Miyazaki Hayao works within the parameter of nervous system activation - downregulation. Chihiro experiences something painful, then she gets help by her friends to integrate the painful event. Tension, release, tension, release. The whole Natsume Yuujinchou can be seen as a story about a boy doing downregulation from a traumatic childhood.So Kaze wo Mita Shounen is supposed to be a children\'s movie. From the perspective of trauma and nervous system dysregulation it is absolutely not suitable for children. The traumatic events are stacked on each other accompanied by graphic violence. The situations are never really resolved and there\'s never taken time for downregulation. The point isn\'t that children aren\'t capable of seeing some bad situations, but these situations needs time to be dealt with, to be resolved, just like good works for children does (or as in Naruto when a situation can\'t be resolved, take time to really process that).That said, there\'s other problems with the movie as well, such as a very chaotic second half without any clear direction, the magic the MC has isn\'t really explained or utilized and comes across as a bad deus ex machina, and so forth.

Kibou no Chikara: Otona Precure '23,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54716/Kibou_no_Chikara__Otona_Precure_23,"['Initially when I heard about this spin-off, I was excited and optimistic. However, after watching, I feel disappointed. It quickly became clear that this was simply nostalgia-bait.A good amount of the episodes followed the formula of ""I\'m doing my dream job but it isn\'t what I expected oh no"" and then they transformed and became Cures again. There was so much reused and poorly upscaled animation for the transformations and finisher attacks along with flashbacks to the old seasons.The Shadows were so ugly too, being jarringly 3d-animated. And the motivation of Bell made no sense. The show was clearly trying to do a...message on climate change and how we all must do our parts to keep our Earth clean but it just fell flat. The negatives, visually and writing-wise, just aren\'t worth it for a handful of heartwarming character moments. message on climate change and how we all must do our parts to keep our Earth clean but it just fell flat. The negatives, visually and writing-wise, just aren\'t worth it for a handful of heartwarming character moments.', 'Otona Precure is an interesting show in that it takes a formula normally geared at kids and performs minimal modifications to direct it at adults. Specifically, if you look at a decent amount of child-oriented daytime TV (original Precure included) many of a show\'s episodes are set up around addressing casual life experiences during the downtime, and personal struggles during the focus, using the action/fantasy element as a catalyst to get the discussion about the personal struggle moving. For kids and teens this means that you see them at school or in clubs, or going out and getting a snack or something with friends, before...pivoting to a worry about teen romance, or grades, or family pressures, which play into how they handle some kind of monster attack. Otona is dealing with adult characters, so instead of school or clubs, they\'re at work. Instead of snacks, it\'s drinks. Instead of the list of things that worry a child, it\'s things like long-term romantic status, work/life satisfaction, comparison of how you\'re ""doing"" to others in your peer group, and so on. There are still monsters to fight, and the monsters still work as a catalyst for self-reevaluation, but Otona realizes that the adult audience knows this and places more of its time on exploring the adult experience than on the fights.In that sense, if you\'ve seen any Precure, you\'ve already seen this Precure. Granted, this one is helped by a tighter, more focused writing due to having only 12 episodes to tell its story instead of 48 to make its point, but it\'s still vanilla Precure, so if you liked the original Yes 5, you\'ll probably also like this one too. If you\'re here for characters, you\'ll like this. If you\'re here only for fights, you won\'t--more on that in the art section below.As a result, in an odd way, the question of whether this show will land is less to do with what the show is doing, and more to do with where in life you are. Younger anime fans may struggle to relate to the adult concerns being discussed, while older fans, especially those in their mid-late 20s, would experience a greater impact.Outside of the writing, the art is visually competent but nothing spectacular. Some clips are recycled from the 2008 Yes 5 sequel, while others go further back to 2006\'s Splash Star, but the majority is modern animation and looks reasonably smooth and well-composited. The only bad animation that stands out are the CG low-tier baddies, but these are insignificant enough to character events that I never really found myself caring...but as a result the combat isn\'t really up to snuff compared to the hand-drawn prequels. This may change as the cast engages the final boss (who is hand-drawn) later in the story. Otherwise early combat, when it occurs, is clunky and goofy due to the very simple and manually rigged CG models.Overall it\'s a decent, honest character drama about continued growth as an adult, and while as of E4 it hasn\'t done anything to leave me gobsmacked, it does well for what it does, and is a solid show I feel satisfied coming back to each week.As of E4 - 7/10.

If you just want to relieve old memories and have a bit of nostalgia, you\'ll like this spin-off. Yes! Precure 5 and the GoGo series are some of my favorites among all franchises (followed by Futari wa and Max Heart a.k.a the OG). Seeing the girls (and boys) are all grown-ups really brings all the nostalgia. I actually like the idea of portraying several problems that might occur to someone when they reach adulthood. It really gives...the feel that these girls have really grown up, still chasing their ultimate dreams with bumps on the road here and there. But for me, Syrup\'s glow-up is the cherry on top of this series (wink wink).Do I have high expectations for this spin-off? Not really. This is just my honest opinion and preference, but early Precure seasons are much better plot-wise, which is why I don\'t expect any ""good"" plot for this. The plot is so-so, the basic Precure plotline but shortened. Don\'t expect all that fighting and battle plots for sure, but there are a decent amount of those. The animation is somewhat worse than the regular Precure series, especially the CGI. Precure has been improving their CGI and animation quality throughout the years and it\'s a bummer they kind of flop on this one.One last thing is that I don\'t know why they left out Nagisa, Honoka, and Hikari\'s life as adults (I mean, they\'re the legendary OG first-ever Cures?! Should I make a petition for another spin-off for them...). This might be a bit biased but I was REALLY looking forward to seeing them as adults as much as the others. the feel that these girls have really grown up, still chasing their ultimate dreams with bumps on the road here and there.

Precure 5 GoGo! / can be divided into 4 days3 - Kibou no Chikara: Otona Precure '23 / in 5 hourssimply watching the yes precure 5 saga, even with the participation of other precures, was simply a 9-day journey, which warmed my heart....A sequel would be a dream.Following the development of all 5 characters was very satisfying, even though I watched something from 2007/2008, I thought the animation at the time was still very good for today.

While I found this film very enjoyable, almost everything done well in this film was done just as well if not better in the original version. The only thing I feel that's done better here is the climax, which feels better paced due to it being in one continuous film rather than split into multiple episodes. Editing the OVA into a film results in much of the content being removed and this hurts the development of characters and the conflict they have to deal with. The first arc...of the film is also shown as a recap which gets the information across in a time efficient manner, but is extremely boring by comparison to the OVA's opening arc. The only scenario I can recommend this over the OVA version is if you've already seen that version which is what I did, this just allows you to blast through it again really quickly. Other than that, just watch the OVA instead of this. of the film is also shown as a recap which gets the information across in a time efficient manner, but is extremely boring by comparison to the OVA's opening arc.

Koutetsu Tenshi Kurumi Encore,https://myanimelist.net/anime/557/Koutetsu_Tenshi_Kurumi_Encore,"[""These 4 episodes take part where season one left off. After watching these episodes, you should come to a conclusion this is basically a fan service for all the Steel Angel Kurumi fans. They put more emphasis on the supportive characters, Saki, Karinka and all the other Steel Angels.And when i mean all the other steel angels, I MEAN all the other steel angels. The last  episode involves all the angels in a contest to win Nakahito's heart.The sound is standard SAK quality and the 5.1 surround is second to none. The japanese voices are your usual chibi-style voices but my favorite...is the English dubbing of the show. The english voices are still chibi-esqe but they have a much bigger emotional range towards everything (i.e. Happy Karinka or angry Karinka)The Writer/Director Steven Foster (Ugly Yet Beautiful, Gilgamesh, etc.) Really does a bang up job for the entire Steel Angel Kurumi Series. Theres nothing funnier than a foul mouthed Karinka.If you Enjoyed the great story and antics of the first season and want to see more stories of your favorite angel, go ahead and get this ASAP. BUT if this is your first foray into the Steel Angel Universe, GO RIGHT AHEAD! theres no continuity issues at all (although the reccomendation is to watch this after S1 and before S2).ENJOY! is the English dubbing of the show.

Kurumi remains the faithful servant of Nakahito, doing anything and everything it takes to please him. Saki's still in love with her sister for all the wrong reasons, and Karinka is just as bratty as ever. Steel Angel Kurumi Encore is a direct continuation of where Steel Angel Kurumi leaves off, so it's obviously catered to people who watched and enjoyed Steel Angel Kurumi and who crave for their next fix of Steel Angel cuteness. With that said, you'll probably want to sit through the first season of Steel Angel Kurumi before jumping into Encore, but...to be honest it doesn't really make too much of a difference. While Steel Angel Kurumi Encore does indeed pick up where Steel Angel Kurumi left off, it doesn't really spoil the events of the first season much--if at all. Encore almost feels like a spin-off, where characters are put in situations that you would never expect to see while watching the first season, and in a way that's exactly what it is. None of the characters seem to have matured very much considering what just happened at the end of the first season, and everyone seems to have settled into their old grooves rather easily. Encore mostly works to provide fans with some of the old playful Steel Angel Kurumi charm that dominated the first half of season one. This is what I enjoyed about Encore, because personally I wanted to see how all of the characters were doing after the ending of the first season, and apparently they're doing just fine--better than fine, really. Saki becomes a film actress in a matter of days, which has to be a first for a Steel Angel. Besides that, Kurumi and Nakahito seem to have gotten closer, and Kamihito is probably on screen more in the four short episodes of Encore than he was in the entirety of Steel Angel Kurumi. Speaking of which, Encore keeps the tradition going with each episode only being fifteen minutes in length. With only four episodes, Encore is the type of anime that you have to watch with your eyes wide open, because if you blink you'll miss it.Even though the stories in each episode were short, I enjoyed every last one of them. It was just plain fun to see all of the characters back at their typical routine of arguing with each other and pining for one another. This is what I thought Steel Angel Kurumi should be all about. Forget the storyline; this is a robot maid anime we're talking about. Just give me humorous situations and quirky characters for my enjoyment, and I won't say a word. Steel Angel Kurumi is just the kind of anime that even if you could take seriously, you don't want to take seriously. Encore helped Steel Angel Kurumi feel fun again, so in turn I was able to have fun again. Episode four--or twenty-eight, depending on how you look at it--was easily my favorite episode of Encore. It was entirely nonsensical, but it was also entirely fun to watch. Seeing a bunch of women compete for a kiss from the shy and young Nakahito was a lot more enjoyable to watch than you would think. Kurumi trying to become a traditional Japanese woman was also rather interesting. I found it funny how the most powerful Steel Angel on the planet--faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound--has a total meltdown when she tries to become a prim and proper Japanese housewife. Now I know Kurumi's limits, and I also shed a tear for Japanese housewives everywhere. Like I said before, none of the stories really felt like they could fit into the storyline of Steel Angel Kurumi, but that's part of what makes Encore worth watching. It's too bad that, with Encore being so short, it had the misfortune of ending abruptly and leaving a bad taste in my mouth because of it. I was thirsty for more Steel Angel Kurumi sweetness, but I was left high and dry.Audio and animation-wise, Encore is on the same level as Steel Angel Kurumi. The intro song is the same as before, Kiss Kara Hajimaru Miracle, but the ending song is a new piece called Suki-suki-suki-suKisu Shite! and is a welcomed change from the original, as it better compliments the primarily comedic subject matter of Encore. Unfortunately I was forced to stick with the Japanese audio while watching Encore because I didn't have access to the English dub. This wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't already gotten used to the English voices, but I have to admit it hindered my experience a little bit. The Japanese audio isn't bad by any means, but I still prefer the English cast over the Japanese cast. Animation in Encore is exactly the same level as Steel Angel Kurumi. Lush scenery with bright colors, and very smooth animation. Character designs also haven't changed, but it is nice to see characters wearing different outfits from time to time throughout Encore. I especially liked the old fashion dress that Saki wore while on the set of her movie. Minor adjustments here and there perhaps, but nothing really noticeable in the audio and video quality of Encore when compared to Steel Angel Kurumi.There are few animes out there that are as short and sweet as Encore is. Most short animes leave you wondering what the hell just happened, while others make you ponder as to why such an anime needed to exist in the first place. However, Encore survives as being just another installment to a popular series, and it's sure to be a welcomed addition for Kurumi fans. Steel Angel Kurumi Encore is just what the doctor ordered if you're a fan of the first twenty-four episodes of Steel Angel Kurumi. Its short length and basic comedic content make it an easy watch for even the busiest of people. It's short, sweet, and fun to watch. If you can't get enough of Kurumi's trademark squeal, Karinka's constantly running mouth, and uh'Saki's incestuous obsession with her sister, then be sure to check out Steel Angel Kurumi Encore.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: Sub to be honest it doesn't really make too much of a difference.

I'm actually surprised to say that i enjoyed these shorts may more than the original series. It pretty much cuts out the battles and such which they go into wayyyyy too much detail over and just provides some simple yet funny comedy, in which often they break the fourth wall and acknowledge they are actually in an anime.You have to see the original to get the jokes and stuff but if you have then i'd definitely say you should watch this.

Experience the great adventures of cute girls in a completely new idol direction! Idols who are witches as well, doing a magic show, a combination the world has not seen in this form before!STORY:Our journey starts with Tiara, a young and beautiful witch apprentice, who travels from her hometown Bristol to the metropolis Mamkestell, the home of Flora Girls’ Academy. She always had the dream to become a student there and quickly finds that she truly has the latent ability to become a proper Witch, with a bright future ahead of her: a future that will...include finding new friends and forming an idol unit together.After reuniting with her best friend Rosetta, their dynamic duo relationship is particularly emphasized as well, Tiara decides to join her and her friends group to form the idol group ""LiGHTs"" together. Each of the five girls is unique in its own way and has a different magical ability. Together they fight for their survival in the Academy due to the rather poor grades. They go through difficulties together, even if something does not go according to plan, they do not give up.Lapis Re: LiGHTs consists of seven different idol groups. Although the focus is on LiGHTs, we get to know the group members of ""IV KLORE"", ""Konohana wa Otome"", ""Sugar Pockets"", ""Sadistic ★ Candy"", ""supernova"" and ""Ray"". They understand and support each other very well; they are friends and even go for adventures together.CHARACTER:Tiara, also the leader of LiGHTs, is a bright and cheerful mood maker. Because she was prone to sickness as a child, she has a strong desire to cheer people up by singing. She is the 2nd princess of Waleland but wants to be treated like a normal girl. She wants to help everyone and make people happy. With her beautiful voice, she gives people hope and joy.With Rosetta, her childhood friends, they often compose music together. Rosetta is smart and a hardworking girl, she is quite popular amongst her juniors. Before the reunite with Tiara, Rosetta tried to do everything on her own, putting herself under pressure and in a position of high risk. She never asked for help, she does not want to burden anyone with her own problems.The most serious member of the group is Ashley, she can be a little bit sharp sometimes as well. As the costume designer for the group, you can\'t tell by looking at her, but deep in her heart she aims to become a knight, like her father. With these words ""You can\'t be a good knight with strength alone"", she was recommended to study as a witch.Lavie, the exact opposite of Ashley and her roommate as well, is the sportiest girl. She has a lot of self-confidence with a naïve personality but is horrendously bad at studying, making her always at the bottom of the class in tests. She really admires the leader of the legendary unit ""Ray"": Eliza (Tiara’s older sister).Last but not least, we have the group bookworm: Lynette. She aspires to be a witch who can shine in public and is a witch otaku who has an abundant knowledge on witches. With her shy personality you cannot tell, but she is an avid daydreamer, even occasionally fantasizing about ""her other classmates making out with each other”.We do not only learn the history and past from these five cute and beautiful girls, we also learn many exciting and emotional things from their friends in other groups: What their dreams are. Why they want to be witches. How they will captivate us all with their wonderful songs.ART:The art style in Lapis Re: LiGHTs is definitely one of the points that caught my eye and captivated me. The girls are presented very cute in a classic CGDCT style. Nevertheless, the environment is also full of beautiful colors. Everything is displayed very dynamically. The beautiful lights that can be seen during their orchestra performance and the perfect coordination of the choreography are all elements that magically attract everybody.SOUND:The music is always extremely important for an idol anime. After only the first two episodes, their songs already thrilled me. I really love the OP and ED; they are both suitable for the idol genre. The very last episode is full of music from all the different group which are really great. Besides that, we can even hear a solo from time to time by Tiara or another girl. Although there are not many songs released by the different Lapis Re: LiGHTs groups in general right now, all the songs are very nice to listen. Idol music gives you strength and a good mood; this is definitely the case here.In addition to the music, the background noises are also well represented; every sound is in harmony with each other.ENJOYMENT:After the first episode, I was already extremely enthusiastic about this anime. I really love every aspect of Lapis. All elements harmonize perfectly with each other in my opinion. I enjoyed every episode. Although I have never heard of the game or this franchise before, I am already fascinated by it.For every CGDCT and idol fan, I can really recommend to watch this anime.

Maybe too underestimated, and maybe it’s because that underestimation that I can give a high score.Although it’s evidently a moe product, the depiction of the story and world is much more deeper than “non-moe” works of this period, giving the impression that those kind of works lack the attention and the perfectionism which we find in Lapis Re:LIGHTs. The technical direction is extremely precise, with cinematographic cuts and meticulous care of context and scenery.

The synopsis came up late and i didn't read it before i watched, so, this is completely first impressions.The theme is really moe, and by that i mean its chill. Just cute girls doing cute stuff and having fun with their friends. I like those stuffs, but i won't give it a 10/10; the plot is flat (like the protagonist) and i don't see it evolving anywhere.SHIKASHI, the current vibe of the anime is really cute and pretty, the art is better than it first apparents, and the songs (till now)...are cute as well.i think it is an ok 7/10, a pretty chill and fun anime like Princess Connect was last season! are cute as well.i think it is an ok 7/10, a pretty chill and fun anime like Princess Connect was last season!"", ""This anime is not meant for everyone, the plot is lackluster and there are tons of characters for a one cour anime but if you've been following lapis relights for a while then it wont be a problem.The plot follows you're average cliche idols shows but this with magic it might sound like the magic thing has just been added because there lacking of ideas.

Without any prior knowledge coming into this series I was fully expecting a low budget soulless mobage adaptation not unlike Nanabun. And not especially Milky Holmes Lite.To be perfectly honest going in into the first episode initially had me fearing the show would be your typical idol show with school saving, rivals, angst and protagonist powers. Then the second episode completely and utterly shattered those expectations to become something special. I mean, this is a show with a goddamned lesbian cabaret club. It’s wacky and insane and thankfully the idol stuff is kept to a minimum and the justifications...for idol activities in a fantasy setting are done well enough.It's clear a lot of thought and effort has been put into what is essentially a mobage ad. The setting and backgrounds are beautiful and the faux-mediterranean setting is a welcome change for a fantasy setting that doesn't reuse the same medieval europe isekai template. Even minor background characters have interesting developments like that one couple who appears in backgrounds and breaks up by the end of the show. It's great and proof that nothing is taken for granted or regarded as some throwaway prop. Even the final plot twist had been telegraphed since the beginning of the show.Of course, that's not why I enjoyed the show so much. And it's not because of the mediocre songs as well (some are decent though). It's largely the cast and characters and how damedame they all are. Seriously. An early episode for instance has them chasing a duck to a pier. Now the standard expected gag would be for the gang and the duck to fall into the river only for the duck to swim away, but in Lapis Relights the duck instead vaults over them and into a separate trap laid by members of the group who didn't jump into the river. It's great seeing how incompetent everyone (apart from Alpha) is, and the inter/intra group dynamics shine brightly because of this interplay. For lack of a better description, it really is Milky Holmes lite but in a fantastical setting.I did wish supernova got more exposure and screentime than what we got in the anime, to better establish them as a more antagonistic group, maybe have Yue develop more of a rivalry with Tia, but spreading out the focus to everyone else is good too. The 19 or so other cast members all receive sufficient characterization and are all uniquely distinctive enough in personalities and character relationships, and it is genuinely fun to see each new episode to see how everyone interacts with everyone else. The show really establishes good chemistry between each character no matter how unlikely the groupings are, and it's a real shame the show is only 12 episodes long. I know they wouldn't do this, but I really wanna see a sequel to this to further flesh everyone out.So, while the idol performances were more of a distraction that anything, the show still succeeds with strong character relationships and great humour. It has been a long while since a Damedame show has graced the post-Milky Holmes era, but Lapis Relights shows the spirit of Damedame is still strong.7/10 for idol activities in a fantasy setting are done well enough.It's clear a lot of thought and effort has been put into what is essentially a mobage ad.

So here goes.There are a lot of good points about this show so far, but also a bit of bad.One massive good point is that the art style is vibrant, colourful, and pretty to look at. A major plus there, as having good art to look at, really is great for a watching experience. No matter if it comes to the characters themselves, or the spells that they used, or the backgrounds we see. Another good...point is that it's cute girls doing cute things with magic thrown on top. Who wouldn't like that? The music is also very relaxing, it's a nice and chill anime.The bad points, I'd honestly say so far the plot is a little eeeh in some areas, as while cute girls doing cute things with magic can be some's cup of tea, but it can also be boring as hell to some. As you may be wondering if it'll pick up. So while it's a good thing, it can also be a bad.  The characters could also might seem a little bland, but they're pretty decent overall. as they have a range of personalities to really stand out as characters, and there is a bunch of them to get to know.With how the story is set up from the 1st episode, it honestly took my interest, as I'm curious to see how far they'd progress in this magic school, and another element of the show that really made me wanna play a game that's within the show. So far it's been pretty good, bit of a slow pace, but it's alright.Would I say pick it up? I'd say yes, it's pretty alright so far, and again, if this suits you, go for it. point is that it's cute girls doing cute things with magic thrown on top. Who wouldn't like that?

This is a must watch for y\'all.', 'I’ll say it now, coming from the perspective as someone who doesn’t usually like Idol anime/games: Lapis Re:LiGHTs was surprisingly good.The only substantial issue present is the VAST difference in quality between episodes, switching from borderline putting me to sleep to downright amazing. As a result, I think I’ll have to discuss them separately in four “sub-reviews”, if you will.Episodes I & II: 8/10This series has a very strong start, introducing us to five likeable (albeit somewhat cliche) characters and a promising storyline. Teasers for future backstory plot points regarding Tiara’s sickness and the significance of her- well, tiara, also help to really draw you...in with that building mystery.Episodes III, IV, V, & VI: 4/10Absolutely nothing of value is added here, with about twenty characters introduced in a manner so rapid fire it ensures you won’t be able to care about any of them. The only redeeming qualities here are the segments featuring the main five characters, and quite frankly, I wish they had kept the cast to that much more manageable sizing. This filler marathon is by far the show’s weakest point, being unbearable to the point of almost making me drop the show by episode V. Thankfully, I decided to stick it out, something which I was very happy about later on.Episodes VII, VIII, & IX: 7/10From this point onwards, the show seems to regain its sense of direction, focusing in on the story to a degree which builds upon plot points set up in the first two episodes. I can’t reveal much without spoilers, but the twist at he very end of this arc(?) genuinely had me on the edge of my metaphorical seat as I eagerly anticipated what was to come.Episodes X, XI, & XII: 9/10Now THIS is what I was hoping for when I first picked this anime up. These final three episodes incorporate a fantastic mix of drama, magic, and song/dance numbers, leaving me glad I stuck out that earlier mess just to see this. While the ending isn’t perfect (this was clearly meant to have a second season, but after the game’s closing and overall minimal interest in the project, that never came to fruition), it’s satisfying enough and closes all of the major plot threads which had been opened throughout the series. In all, this finale was by far the highlight of Lapis Re:LiGHTs.OVERALL THOUGHTS:If you’re looking to watch this, and you aren’t willing to be EXTREMELY patient with unrelated filler, I would recommend watching episodes 1 and 2, then immediately skipping to episode 7 and watching until the end. Otherwise, this is definitely a solid series which is at least worth giving a shot. in with that building mystery.Episodes III, IV, V, & VI: 4/10Absolutely nothing of value is added here, with about twenty characters introduced in a manner so rapid fire it ensures you won’t be able to care about any of them.

It comes with a strong start to a dull middle and a rushed ending but it is still a fairly good ride if you enjoy idols and music. It is a really unusual take of the magical realms you normally see since it is filled with so much joy despite awful happenings in the background. Almost the most part of civilization is oblivious to the truth.The show uses mostly a good level of art but at times goes off somewhat unexpectedly bad. The...worst part of this show is the CGI that gets used during the orchestras since it is an appalling change of detail to get those sequences. It is like two different sets of teams made the show and didn't talk to each other on art forms. That said it is still crisp just a bit clunkier. The art when separated falls between good and bad but together is somewhat mediocre.Sound is the best part of the show. The ED and OP are really good quality but the orchestras are what steals the show since they are diverse and wonderful.Character development goes pretty deep at times but nothing special is really brought forward about anyone since no one is really very interesting or unique. The main cast set does get some great backstories but some are also left out to an extent. There are many characters you wish to know about.Kaede, Maryberry and Garnett form the cutest and best girls of the show in my opinion. I often find those who are not the main cast can be more desirable.I would say the show is very enjoyable from a sound standpoint. The story is somewhat rushed and dull in places but is also well put together.I would give the show a pretty solid 7/10 despite its flaws on the basis of the music and the enjoyment for the most part. A second season could be welcomed but I also do not think it would be necessarily needed. worst part of this show is the CGI that gets used during the orchestras since it is an appalling change of detail to get those sequences.

What we have here is an anime that\'s part of yet another multimedia project to promote a cell phone game involving cute idol girls. Lapis Re:LiGHTs main selling point is that it takes place in a made up fantasy world with made up countries that are much more European-style in nature as opposed to something like Love Live or 22/7. Now, the only reason I watched this was because nothing else really interested me, and since the plague is still going around and putting a bunch of anime on hold,...I thought it\'d be a nice time killer. It was...but now I wish I had every minute I spent watching this crappy show back! Basically, a young girl goes to a fancy magic idol school where she can become a witch, which in this case is basically a magical idol. But she winds up getting stuck with the flunkies who are about to get expelled because they suck at everything. They decide to try and become an idol group and raise enough points so that they don\'t get expelled.In the right hands, this premise would have been great. It could have made for an interesting character study and presented a lot of opportunities for storylines that could go just about anywhere. Unfortunately, Lapis Re:Lights has some of the worst writing, direction, and storytelling I\'ve ever seen. And I kind of feel bad about saying that because Lapis Re:LiGHTs has some really interesting ideas and a cool setting! I\'ll get the positives (or what little of them it has) out of the way so I don\'t be a complete killjoy. I must admit, the show\'s setting is really intriguing. Taking place in a European style fantasy land, with magic schools, and ""witches"" (That\'s what the idols are called in this show) capable of using all sorts of magic by whistling, using hoverboards to fly around and participate in sports, those are really neat ideas! Had the show actually bothered to capitalize on the ideas it had and flesh out its world a lot more, they really could have brought this setting to life with the ideas they presented. Unfortunately, the show spends more time on cute girls just putzing around and expanding its massive cast than actually caring about things like its setting and, y\'know, proper character development.But more on that in a bit. The setting being really well made also has great animation to back it up. The colors are bright, character motion is smooth, the town the girls live in makes use of both European style architecture and more fantastical, sci-fi elements like hoverboards and castles, and the idol concerts are always a visual treat to watch. Granted, they still use bad, wonky CGI for the actual performances, but at this point it\'s become the standard, and the character designs...aren\'t great. Many of the girls don\'t seem all that distinguishable from one another if you swapped their hair styles, colors, and eye colors, with some exceptions, especially some of the younger, cutesier looking girls like Maryberry (Seriously?! Maryberry?! What the hell kind of dumb name is that?!). Also, I\'m not gonna lie, the background music in the show is better than all of the songs the girls sing. Many of the songs feel like they were copy-pasted from other songs over the past 20 or so years, and with a few exceptions, all of them are sung by squeaky voices that just border on grating.Unfortunately, the animation and music alone absolutely cannot save this utter trainwreck of a show. One of the show\'s biggest problems is the fact that it\'s 12 episodes long, yet has a grand total of 24 named characters, barring a select few minor ones who only appear in one or two episodes. The thing about a show with a short length is that it doesn\'t have the luxuries that a show that has 24-26, or even 52 episodes has, and has to set its cards on the table right at the start. It can\'t afford to take shortcuts with its story and its characters. Most 12-13 episode anime get around this by keeping their main cast small, and having side characters still play important roles when needed. Lapis Re:LiGHTs made the decision to have an impossibly huge cast of characters, and none of them get any sort of development or focus whatsoever, and even when they do, any development they do get is so utterly predictable and cliche, you can pretty much guess how their arcs will progress without even trying. It doesn\'t help that many of the episodes just consist of the girls just goofing around or doing stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot. One episode has the girls play a really degrading magical board game, and in said episode, one of the girls is made to wear a skimpy playboy bunny suit and act like a rabbit for shits and giggles. No, I\'m not even kidding. Because the show has such a large cast and no interest in giving them anything beyond one basic personality trait, all of them come across as bland and unmemorable in any way, or wind up being memorable for all the wrong reasons, like Lucifer for being a complete bitch for no reason, and the worst of them, Tsubaki, for basically being a creepy siscon who gets off on stealing her younger sisters\' panties for some dumbass reason. Did we really need that? Many of the characters are so insignificant that the show would seriously benefit if they had been cut out completely.And that\'s not even getting to the utterly piss-poor writing! The show sets up a lot of rules for its setting, like a point system for the magic school that determines whether kids get to stay or get expelled, but often times it contradicts itself when its most convenient. The main group is constantly on the verge of getting expelled, but a good portion of them don\'t even give a damn and just want to putz around (Lavie is the worst offender)! Plus, one girl is confirmed to be an adult, or at the very least in her late teens, yet is still in the school under a different name and in another unit, for really stupid reasons that already contradict the show\'s established rules! They try to explain it as her being held back lots of times, but with how strict the school system is in-universe, you\'d think the girl would have gotten expelled! Furthermore, many of the conflicts in this show, especially the one near the end, could have been resolved in five minutes if the characters just talked to each other and explained from the start why they did what they did, y\'know, like mature adults! But instead of doing that, they needlessly come up with these weirdly elaborate schemes to not only keep Tiara in the dark about it, but actively sabotage her and the main groups\' chances at actually succeeding in every way possible in order to guarantee nothing but failure on their end in order to get them to do what they want! I dare anyone to tell me this isn\'t some form of emotional abuse and manipulation in some way! The character responsible for all of this doesn\'t even get called out or given any real consequences for her actions! Because of all of this, and the show\'s utter lack of interest in fleshing out its characters and...well, everything else, any attempt at being genuine is completely overshadowed by its complete and utter stupidity and overreliance on cliches and stock archetypes. All of it comes together to make a really hokey, meely-mouth ending that\'s just cheesy and dumb and never felt earned in any way whatsoever.I really wanted to be more generous with my rating for this show, but the more I watched it and thought about it, the more I realized the show itself doesn\'t have anything redeemable about it, other than its animation and interesting ideas that it never got to use properly. The reason why I consider shows like, say, Zombieland Saga, AKB0048, and 22/7 to be good, even with their flaws, is because they actually cared enough to flesh out their characters, even if their methods of doing so didn\'t always make the landing (In the latter\'s case especially), and put in effort to at the very least try to do something different with their premises and be somewhat enjoyable. Lapis Re:LiGHTs is just a soulless cash grab that is just ultimately hollow, shallow, and a complete waste of time. I thought it\'d be a nice time killer.

I dare anyone to tell me this isn\'t some form of emotional abuse and manipulation in some way! The character responsible for all of this doesn\'t even get called out or given any real consequences for her actions! Because of all of this, and the show\'s utter lack of interest in fleshing out its characters and...well, everything else, any attempt at being genuine is completely overshadowed by its complete and utter stupidity and overreliance on cliches and stock archetypes. All of it comes together to make a really hokey, meely-mouth ending that\'s just cheesy and dumb and never felt earned in any way whatsoever.I really wanted to be more generous with my rating for this show, but the more I watched it and thought about it, the more I realized the show itself doesn\'t have anything redeemable about it, other than its animation and interesting ideas that it never got to use properly. The reason why I consider shows like, say, Zombieland Saga, AKB0048, and 22/7 to be good, even with their flaws, is because they actually cared enough to flesh out their characters, even if their methods of doing so didn\'t always make the landing (In the latter\'s case especially), and put in effort to at the very least try to do something different with their premises and be somewhat enjoyable. Lapis Re:LiGHTs is just a soulless cash grab that is just ultimately hollow, shallow, and a complete waste of time.', ""Lapis was probably my second or third favourite show of Summer 2020. Going into the series I had never heard of it, but my interest was piqued by the combination of idol girls and mahou shojo, both of which I love. After all, who doesn't enjoy cute anime girls singing and fighting monsters, right? Luckily, I was not disappointed at all and was actually rather taken a back by the quality of writing and the great characters in the show.The story, for me, was actually rather unique and managed to put a cool spin on common idol tropes. I found the concept of the...witch academy and magic being intertwined to music to be very fun. The humour managed to land with me, which is always a plus with anime and the girls are just damn cute. You really can't ask for much more in this genre and I think Lapis will provide an enjoyable experience for anyone looking for a fun watch. You'll become emotionally invested in the girls and their journey as well learn a few new songs along the way.My only negative point to the show is that it's only 12 eps long. It's certainly been a nice way to kick off my weekends for the past 3 months and I will really miss it. Fortunately, we do have a manga for more content.Lapis Re:Lights gets 10 gems out of 10 from me. witch academy and magic being intertwined to music to be very fun.

I didnt know LRL at all until I heard about the anime but I then learned there was a game for it so it's been a thing for a while it seems.As previous reviews say, the plot isnt based on anything /big/ besides the evolution of the protagonist with a goal with friends with other side stories. But Im not...picky at what I want to watch.I personally enjoy it overall! The character designs and personalities are fun, the setting of anime is really nice like how they created a pretty elaborate universe of both idol, fantasy, and magical girl together, and I gotta say the songs the unit groups have are pretty good anime-idol wise! Their music is more, I guess like fit for 2016 and up as anime songs for fans in late teens to young adult(?)The anime got cute girls, great interactions between the characters, an interesting universe, and catchy songs so give the anime a try! picky at what I want to watch.I personally enjoy it overall!

If I wanted to watch a sports anime I'd just do it.It just feels that there's so much potential in this anime but it's been wasted, I tried to force myself to watch but I couldn't make it past episode 6.Now that...the bad stuffs is out of the way, I want to take time to appreciate what's good.The art is very good, I liked all the characters, they all have very good details and the animation is very lively. The backgrounds are really good as well, and I really like the design of the buildings.The voice acting is top notch, there isn't one character with the annoying little girl voice where the voice actor is squeezing their throat.Maybe I'd have rated this series higher if all episodes are out and I can skip all the meaningless 'plot' or fillers that is just a waste of time(imo). Having no story progression for 2-3 episodes straight is just unbearable. So watch this with caution, unless you really like the most predictable slice of life genre. the bad stuffs is out of the way, I want to take time to appreciate what's good.The art is very good, I liked all the characters, they all have very good details and the animation is very lively.

So watch this with caution, unless you really like the most predictable slice of life genre."", ""-SPOILERS-I really loved this show but I felt the need to make this review for a few reasons. After watching the second half of the show as it aired this season, I got a lot more invested once they finally started talking about becoming idles. For some reason, they decided to make the first 5 or 6 episodes purely filler. Sure we get a little bit of world building and some very minor character development, but that's half of the entire show. If they dedicated that time to the story or some deeper development for the main characters, this show could've been so much more.Story...- 4/10Like I said, the first half of the show is purely filler. The story takes place in a magic school where you must accumulate enough points through doing various tasks to avoid getting expelled from the school. The main 5 girls do whatever they can to get enough points to do so for 5 episodes. With only around 6 episodes to develop the actual story, you can obviously tell that there would be some flaws. Some might argue that the first half of the show brought some necessary worldbuilding, but that worldbuilding is completely insignificant. Instead of building up the threat of the magic beasts' invasion, they decide to play dodge ball and walk around a haunted house. It's almost insulting that they just wasted all this time for nothing. They could've at least put the idea in the minds of the main characters of becoming idols, but they had to save that for later for some reason.Once the second half of the show rolls around, Tiara and the gang decide to become idols so they can get the final remaining points they need to avoid expulsion. Some more stuff is revealed in the last episode about her relationship with her sister, and the series leaves off an unfinished note as all the idol groups declare to help recover Tiara's sister's voice. The story wasn't anything special but it wasn't anything too offensive besides the 5 episodes of filler. There were some heartwarming scenes and some hype moments. Honestly pretty solid since they decided to dedicate half of the show to filler. The filler was pretty entertaining but it barely added anything significant.Art - 7/10The art in the first episode is great, but gets a little worse for a few episodes after that. Eventually, we're getting an idol performance at least once every episode. The animation in the performances are pretty solid as well. There were some janky sequences as well as some extra nice ones. Nothing much else to say.Sound - 7/10The voice acting and the sound effects were nothing special nor terrible, but I personally loved most of the music. I was really hoping they would sing the opening in the show, but I'm not too angry. The songs that the girls sung during the performances were great. That's all I have to say.Characters - 4/10Another big issue with this show is the amount of time it takes to introduce a stupid amount of irrelevant characters. They take a few minutes to give some shallow development to the main girls except Tiara and then decide to introduce 10 more girls. That's an exaggeration, but it was honestly stupid that they did this. Tiara and her sister have a complicated relationship that ends up getting resolved in the last episode. It was pretty heartwarming but it was nothing special once again. Yet, the side characters are just plain stereotypical anime cardboard cut-outs. I even had a hard time remembering the characters names even at the halfway point during the show's initial run. If the show just kept LiGHTS, Supernova, and got rid of all the other groups, then it would've had time to sincerely develop our main girls while providing them with rivals. Nevertheless, I still love unconditionally love the girls, hence my unreasonable love for the series.Enjoyment - 7/10I like idol anime and slice of life anime. This anime had a lot of solid slice of life and lots of idols, so I liked it. The humor during the slice of life episodes was actually pretty nice. It was also satisfying to see Tiara get better at using her magical power, which she never uses once after episode 5(?).Overall - 5/10I really liked this show since it was one of my first idol anime to get into, and I certainly wasn't disappointed. It wasn't as if I didn't notice the flaws as I watched the show either; I just simply chose to ignore them and have a good time. This show is honestly just mindless fun with some heartwarming moments sprinkled in here and there. If you're lookin for a solid story or deep characters, turn away now. If you like idols and you're lookin for an anime to just chill and not think about anything when you're watching it then this is the anime for you. I'm gonna miss this show, but it is a multimedia project. Keep a lookout for the game and the manga adaption.All in all, its not really an objectively good anime, in fact its probably closer to being bad, but you can still have a good time watching it. - 4/10Like I said, the first half of the show is purely filler.

The story also had a wonderful flow of time and you felt picked up at all times and you didn't have the feeling that it was stretched with senseless story.So much was packed into the 12 episodes that it was neither too much nor too little. I also found the dance animations wonderful and you hardly noticed any overlapping images.I'm blown away when...it comes to this anime and would love to see more of it, including the second season, but since I don't know how far the light novel or the manga is, I just hope for it.And the 12th episode even made me happy with big tears, it was so beautiful for me the episode. So look at it and judge for yourself but you have to be ready to see an anime of the special kind.10 out of 10 stars.

I'm glad I gave it a chance.The story, while it's pretty fast-pace and a bit cheesy at times, I think that it told what it needed to tell from it's initial premise. But 12 episodes isn't really enough to flesh out the plot to bring out some depth or meaningful messages to it. Though I really enjoyed the story nonetheless.But regardless of that, this show really has some trouble in balancing the magic and reality aspect of it. There's no fine line on what magic can and...can't do and it's always just so convenient when magic works in certain episodes but suddenly isn't even used in other episodes.The settings of this anime is also quite shaky. There's a lot left unexplored and unexplained. Though it's mainly just it's missing potential and not really plot breaking problem of sorts.The characters are quite trope-y but it's understandable since there's A LOT of characters here. Mostly they are here for Waifu bait (and Yuri bait cause why not), but that doesn't stop them from being forgettable or something. The only characters that I forgot are the ones that get zero to no focus so I think that the rest of the characters are good and got pretty decent spotlight.The main cast isn't as strong as I think, but Lavie mah girl carried the team. Everything she does is so crazy that it's entertaining. She a great girl.The animation is pretty fucking good. Considering that they ain't Sunrise (known for Love Live franchise, undoubtedly the Best music/idol anime), I think they made a decent job for the CG models. My only complaint is how they never utilized the CG models for some memorable camera work animation. It's a wasted potential tbh considering that this anime was made in 2020.Though episode 8 had some great camera movement that utilized the CG models to it's utmost potential.Moving on from the CG, the handrawn scenes from this anime is great. It's consistently drawn and never go off-models. It's just pretty to look at.The music is one of the most important, arguably the most important, aspect for Music/idol animes. So how does this one do? Well, pretty f-cking good.While there's no immediate bangers like in other music anime, the songs are consistent and catchy that I never found anything that I didn't like.Though the opening and ending are bangers.

I have a low expectation for this anime because of its episode 1 but fortunately i didn't drop it immediately because later episodes become more livelier and funnier because of the other cast specially the Ashley+Lavie. Well as for the story of this anime it is the result of mixture of fantasy+idol anime. It is an idol anime set in a setting wherein girls who aspire to become a witch will have to attend this academy...and raise their points and their ranking. To do that you have to form a group to help each other raise points. The animation and music in the anime is good, the good thing about the 1st episode is the good singing voice of our main girl Tiara. Her voice really captivates my heart in the scene although i was really bored for the first episode. Then every other episode other groups and character will be introduced. They have their own unique theme and vibe to look forward to. Overall all it is a decent idol anime, having a mediocre plotline but entertaining cast so I was entertained so far by this anime. For waifu? Im still choosing XD But it is worth it to watch? Yes it is! If you're looking a mixture of fantasy and idols with good funny scenes you must try this one.

Characters are cute and likeable, although I personally thought that the main girls were overshadowed by other idol units.Overall, give this anime a try if you are into idol genre and looking for decent j-pop music.

The producers of idol themed anime know full well that the idol fanbase will gladly eat up poor writing, lazy direction, and cliche ridden garbage so as long as it includes some cute girls singing while wearing cute clothes. Unfortunately, that\'s exactly what Lapis Re:LiGHTs is.

While other idol animes doing a perform in hope for gathering popularity, instead these girls doing that for collecting mana.. I mean collecting peoples feelings to be the power source of the city. Maybe the story introduction looks generic, a girls school where they make groups to sing and get extra score, when low score group might be expelled from school, there’s also a group ranking discrimination here. By that setting from Ep1 you can expect where the story leads to, but I’m not going to convince you to change that view because they kinda got me halfway there, not gonna lie.If you came here looking for a good performance, I can’t guarantee that. Best I can offer is Ep2 ending, if you like it you can keep going. Some costumes is cute & cool but personally I don’t like overly exposing tops especially for lolis so I don’t like the japanese trio and the only duo here. They try to add magic on this anime for fighting or daily life purpose, also for the shows where a lots of light popping up and other effects to spice up the stage. The lights makes a cube following their gesture, and other generic shape like star or candy. I like the idea but too much magical things sometimes make us unable to fully enjoy the show. Bungee jumpin between buildings, that’s for story pupose so it’s ok. Flying too high in the sky, is it for the plot? Quickly changing camera angle, my brains tremble.... I can’t keep up with that. But there are many good use of magic here when we follow their daily life like when the sport match, it’s highly entertaining.If you came here for story plot, for me it’s good enough. But if you want that kind of PLOT, wrong place dude, there’s a lot of generic isekai out there. While following the main group, we also get to see 2 others groups dealing with their internal problem but don’t worry, our MC is not K*rito taking too much role meddling with other business which is nice for me, while the 2 high rank group didn’t have problem to begin with, we still get to see their funny interaction. For a large number of cast, it’s normal to see a diverse personality as well. Most of them can keep their consistency with the growth pace which is great, but I spot a character kinda out of trail. Early she can comfort the others when they in trouble, so mature despite her appearance. But later Eps she timidly run away after getting a huge task, I know it’s for building more tense for the final problem but there are some other girl fits better to fill the role.If you don’t care much about the performance but still enjoying just the music. This is a good one for you. Indeed, not all ost is good but I can recommend some of them that hits me well. I dont know if the creator team being unfair or it’s just my taste but only MC group songs that's all good & have more than twice songs than others, a total of 5 with ED song Planetarium, 1st perform 700 million ..something, reuniting Watashi no Na wa Hikari, final perform Your Light, also first & last song we heard A.R.I.A. Other group with best overall performance is the highest rank supernova in both 2 songs. The rest is just 1 good song each, introduction of ghost girl, and final perform of trio waitress but it so sort, also don’t forget the opening by all stars, by the way as I mentioned before I don't like JP trio & the only duo here. Unfortunately, we didn’t get much of Hanazawa Kana singing.

While following the main group, we also get to see 2 others groups dealing with their internal problem but don’t worry, our MC is not K*rito taking too much role meddling with other business which is nice for me, while the 2 high rank group didn’t have problem to begin with, we still get to see their funny interaction. For a large number of cast, it’s normal to see a diverse personality as well. Most of them can keep their consistency with the growth pace which is great, but I spot a character kinda out of trail. Early she can comfort the others when they in trouble, so mature despite her appearance. But later Eps she timidly run away after getting a huge task, I know it’s for building more tense for the final problem but there are some other girl fits better to fill the role.If you don’t care much about the performance but still enjoying just the music. This is a good one for you. Indeed, not all ost is good but I can recommend some of them that hits me well. I dont know if the creator team being unfair or it’s just my taste but only MC group songs that's all good & have more than twice songs than others, a total of 5 with ED song Planetarium, 1st perform 700 million ..something, reuniting Watashi no Na wa Hikari, final perform Your Light, also first & last song we heard A.R.I.A. Other group with best overall performance is the highest rank supernova in both 2 songs. The rest is just 1 good song each, introduction of ghost girl, and final perform of trio waitress but it so sort, also don’t forget the opening by all stars, by the way as I mentioned before I don't like JP trio & the only duo here. Unfortunately, we didn’t get much of Hanazawa Kana singing. If you like it, please consider buy the original soundtrack next november (maybe)."", ""I really like this anime. In terms of the storyline, the songs that are sung in this anime are very good and the characters have their own characteristics. But I don't know if this anime doesn't have a 2nd season. I'm a bit sad because this idol-themed anime and music is really good. I hope everyone will enjoy the storyline and all aspects of this anime. And the art of the images that are displayed make this anime feel alive as well as the characters and plot. I'm very grateful that this anime has a season 2😊.I think the author of this anime story is...very genius very genius""]"

Medarot Damashii,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4052/Medarot_Damashii,"['The story continues with the protagonist Ikki and his medabot Medabee. However, Ikki loses a battle to a new type of Medabot without emotions called Kilobots. Disturbed by the inherent nature of Kilobots, Ikki and Medabee fight Kam, the mastermind/creator of these Kilobots throughout the series.Story: The story was decent at best. In all honesty, it was a disappointment. The plot did not pull you into the story nearly as much as the previous seasons. Additionally, the story follows a common archetype and fails to build up suspense in the fights.A good characteristic was the continuing motifs of friendship and teamwork, although very straightforward at...times, it abided by the previous notions of the Medabot series. Lastly, a real disappointment was the absence of previous characters in the series. My favorite Medabot Rokusho did not partake in this series, however they made an awful imitation of him called Roks which just made the sereis feel like its been going on far too long. Henry and the Referee had also been eliminated. Henry was awesome and the Referee was humorous at times.Sound: The sound effects were kinda crappy. I\'ve taken into account that this is an older show, yet it does not live up to other series of the same period including various Gundam series and Hajime no Ippo.Characters: My only complaint from this category is the character development. Kam, Ginkai and several other main characters histories are introduced at what I thought was a bad time or simply gave vague details to support the following actions. The author also gave many episodes to develop some characters, but many of these scenes give counterproductive insight.I would rate this series a ""6"" or a ""5"" mainly because I enjoyed the prequels.

Overall, I think this series killed Medabots.', ""Medabots Spirits is the sequel to Medabots and follows the continuing adventures of Ikki and Metabee who now have to stop the evil boy genius Cam who wants to destroy all medabots and have children play with kilobots instead. However, unlike medabots, kilobots have no emotions and are simply killing machines built to destroy with medafighters who don't play by any rules.BTW, why in the english dub are they called kilobots? Kilo is a unit of measurement like a kilogram or a kilometer. Just call them killbots or kilabots or something.Story 4/10Medabots have gotten some upgrades since the original show; now medabots can...transform into an action mode, a demolition mode, and can even fuse together into one medabot. I know that sounds awesome in theory, but in execution not really. First, with action mode, a medabot transforms into a car or hovercraft, but it isn't very useful in battle because think how useful a car is in a fight; second, demolition mode drastically increases a meadbots attack power, but Ikki almost never uses demolition mode; and finally, in the span of the entire show, they only use fusion twice. Why? You have all these great new weapons, why don't you use them? They just keep relying on the Medaforce like back in the original show.The original show had a good balance of action and comedy, but in this version there's barely any comedy. This is due mostly to the writers writing out all of the comic relief characters like the Rubber Robo Gang, Mr. Referee, and Karen who were present in the original show and were some of my favorite characters.Finally, the theme of this show is the importance of teamwork and friendship, but I hate how much it's hammered in. I understand this show is made for kids, but even kids get tired of listening to friendship speeches.Characters 6/10Cam: Cam is Ikki's new rival who wants to destroy all medabots and replace them with kilobots. What I like about Cam is how evil and cruel he is. Cam is merciless to his opponents and will keep attacking even after they've surrendered. Cam isn't kinder to his own kilobots either; if Cam feels his kilobot isn't strong enough then he doesn't hesitate to have it destroyed and replaced with another one. Cam even orders his own kilobots to destroy each other just to test which one is strongest.However, while Cam is definitely evil, his plan isn't all that evil. In the original show, the Rubber Robo Gang wanted to take over the world, but Cam's goal is simply to get kids to play with kilobots instead of medabots. That isn't very evil, I mean in real life some people play Yu-Gi-Oh and others play Magic: The Gathering, but that doesn't mean one game is evil and the other isn't.The Screws: The Screws gang are the three bullies at Ikki's school; I already mentioned how the writers cut out their old comic relief characters like the Rubber Robo Gang and Mr. Referee, but I think the writers tried to replace them by giving the Screws more attention. However, this was a big mistake because the Screws aren't nearly as funny. One running joke I hate is how the Screws keep trusting Cam just for Cam to betray them. Is the joke they're idiots for trusting Cam?Ms. Nae: Nae is a new character and the medabot mechanic who continuously repairs Medabee and the others. There isn't anything bad about Nae, but I hate how her entire character seems to just be a plot device the writers can use to give friendship speeches. I guess she's suppose to replace that chicken salesman that was always giving advice from the original show.Art 6/10Similar to how in Pokemon there's always a whole bunch of new pokemon whenever a new generation starts, many new kilobots and medabots are introduced. One thing that makes kilobots visually different from medabots is how kilobots are clearly designed solely for battle and not for friendship. For example, the kilobot Desperado has a body that's just one giant gun and the kilobot Cutter has a body that's just one giant knife.Overall 5/10Medabots Spirits was a step-down from the original show. It seemed like the writers had some cool ideas, but didn't know how to use them. Personally, I think Medabots was renewed for a second season as a cash grab only to sell more toys. transform into an action mode, a demolition mode, and can even fuse together into one medabot.

We are following the character, but NOT the story of the previously seasons.The story is about new types of bots, and fighting against the troubles these are making, as well a hidden secret within it all.  The story is honestly very well put together as a stand alone, but i sadly wish there were more to the ending. They tried giving a little ""this is what happen after"" -ending, but it felt way too rushed within 1 min explanations. The season doesn\'t have many fillers either, maybe two, since most of it...has a meaning to it later in the season, but I honestly wish there maybe was one last ep (even if it was a filler) which would be only dedicated to ""this is what happen after"".When it comes to the music; it\'s the same intro and the same outro, which is in season 1 and 2 as well, BUT they did make a new intro video.Characters in this season start showing a little bit more emotional towards each other, making the feeling of them growing up a little bit. (Like they arent in the same mental age even tho they started a new schoool year, kinda.)  And we can to small degree see some hints of feelings in the air. (Im not going into these details.)Overall, i do find this interesting, and worth watching. The story line has a lot of different patterns it can take, so u never really know what to expect, which is the main thing that made me continue watching.If you watch this with the exception to have any connection to the previous season, i will not recommend you watching it since they aren\'t connected. Think of it has a new anime, not a follow up, instead before u start watching it, and enjoy! :) has a meaning to it later in the season, but I honestly wish there maybe was one last ep (even if it was a filler) which would be only dedicated to ""this is what happen after"".When it comes to the music; it\'s the same intro and the same outro, which is in season 1 and 2 as well, BUT they did make a new intro video.Characters in this season start showing a little bit more emotional towards each other, making the feeling of them growing up a little bit.

The tone is more serious, which I preferred, but unfortunately that's as far as my praise goes when comparing it to the original. The animation is not nearly as good, but worse than that, they removed some indispensable characters like Koji, Karin, Hikaru, Rokusho, Medabot Professor, AND THE GADDAM REFEREE! The new characters are fine but it's heartbreaking seeing all the best characters of the original series go without any fanfare.There's new antagonist, there's no Rubber Robo this time around, which is a blessing, they're schtick got old very fast in the original. There's...less filler episodes and it's less episodic than the original.The dub has the same voice actors, and they do a good enough job.The music's solid.It is worth a watch if you're a Medarot fan but the original I can just recommend to non-Medarot fans too, it's that good. less filler episodes and it's less episodic than the original.The dub has the same voice actors, and they do a good enough job.The music's solid.It is worth a watch if you're a Medarot fan but the original I can just recommend to non-Medarot fans too, it's that good.""]"
Nil Admirari no Tenbin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33850/Nil_Admirari_no_Tenbin,"[""*spoiler free*I'm an girl who kinda likes gaming and reverse harems, so it's not a big surprise that I've gotten involved in otome-style games in my life. Despite being such a big otaku and otome game fanatic, I have not yet found an anime or manga that really displays the otome aspect in all it's glory-- perhaps I have bad luck, or maybe it's just that it's really difficult to put such a strange game format into a cohesive storyline.I've seen a lot of the more popular animes of this genre, including Amnesia, Kamagami No Asobi, Diabolik Lovers, and others. As of now,...I can say that this is one of the better anime I've seen of the sort. This is mainly because it focuses a little more on the plot aspect than it does on the romance-- in fact, there's barely any romance at all, if you ask me.Let's get into it. To begin with, the plot is very simple-- it's about written works that can influence the reader with strong emotions. That's literally the entire basis. I won't go into it too much because it'll ruin a bit of the plot, but all I can say is that I expected a lot more of the plot. At first, I felt as though it was much too tame. There weren't really many stakes, yet the characters acted like there were. Yes, I understand, people can die-- but since such obvious precautions can be taken (issuing all books in print, advising people to buy in print, spreading awareness about the issue, etc.) why wasn't any of that done? It didn't make much sense to me, and the ending of it seemed a little rushed and patchworky, like they were trying to make it darker and add as many twists as possible. Perhaps it just wasn't for me. Either way, I just kinda stuck around for the sake of finishing it; I lost interest in the plot pretty early on.The art, however, was gorgeous. It has this pastel and blurry-ish quality to it that I really like. It's very fresh and different. I also liked the character designs, which were very distinct and interesting. Usually they only have a few basic character templates in a lot of animes, like the 'skinny short dude', the 'attractive lithe tall dude', the 'flat girl', and the 'busty girl', to say the most part. I was pleased with the fact that while all the guys were attractive, they all had different body types as per their backgrounds and who they were, as well as the few girls too. Nobody was TOO unrealistic (*cough cough* no necks and waists being the same width, thank  you *cough*) and the color combinations and backgrounds were also stunning.As for the sound, I found most of the voice actors to be a little forgettable. There was little expression in a lot of the characters voices, but I think that was also an effect of the way the dialogues were written. Conversely, I found the opening and closing to be very fun. While the animation for the OP had a lot of people confused as to what the show was going to be like, I found it refreshing and cute. As for the closing, I really appreciated some of those sketches of our cute main guys, if you know what I mean. :DOverall, I can't say I enjoyed this too much. To me, it felt kinda like a draft of a show. There's so much potential here with character development and a deeper plot, but it just wasn't reached. I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt because it was adapted from a game and the otome genre is a hard genre to please with. Besides, it's bounds better than any other otome anime I've seen thus far.I would recommend this if you: like the otome genre/reverse harems, like books, like angsty backstories, like 'special' heroines, like more plot focusI would NOT recommend this if you: are here for the romance, like it when all the male characters are constantly trying to win over the heroine, don't like reading/booksHave a great day everyone!

The emperor's illness created a power vacuum that allowed the Diet and the political parties to gain more influence. the Taisho Era is often seen in history as a brief period of more democratic government, between the strict monarchy of the Meiji Era and the dominant militarism of the early Showa...Era.This story is set in an alternate 1936 where the Taisho emperor is still alive, and Japan is under a democratic government. In the 1930s in our world, far-right elements of the Japanese military continuously pressured the civilian government to adopt a more aggressive foreign policy. Several times, groups of officers attempted coups and assassinated high-ranking government officials, and by the late 1930s Japan was essentially fascist state.A similar conflict plays out in the background of this anime, where mysterious forces are using cursed books to assassinate government officials who are seen as insufficiently patriotic. The main character, Kuze Tsugumi, gets mixed up in all this and joins an agency that tries to track down the cursed books. The main focuses of the show are her quest to unravel the conspiracy, and her relationships with the various men in the agency. It's all rather silly, but the connection to real-world history lends it a bit of depth.There's also an undercurrent of social tension as traditions come into conflict with the modern world. Kuze is the daughter of an old aristocratic family, and her life undergoes a substantial change when she starts working as an investigator. The two other major female characters, the head of the book police and Kuze's friend the reporter, highlight how more roles are open to women in this new modern era. This is all mostly in the background and doesn't play that big a role in the story, but it does come up a few times.Ultimately, this is a fun story about a girl trying to unravel a supernatural mystery with political intrigue. The presentation would make you think there'd be a greater romantic focus, but that's really more in the background, so the show isn't about an audience-insert character and her harem of sexy men. The characters have mostly stock personalities, but they have fun group interactions and some of their backstories develop in surprising ways. Kuze herself shows a good deal of courage, initiative, and commitment to protecting her new friends. The setting isn't taken too seriously, but it's not just for show and plays important roles in the main conflict and the themes.If you like this kind of show, or if you're a sucker for alternate history, then you'll probably find something in this to enjoy.

I really liked the fact that they added a very mysterious vibe in the beginning of episode 1, because it really grabbed my attention. I personally love short animes that have around 12-25 episodes. Unlike other 12 episode animes, this anime really included various details and plot twists in each episode, even though it was so short. This anime was released in 2018 (the year I'm writing this review), so there might be a second season! Although, if there isn't, I wouldn't be disappointed, because the ending left me in tears of joy.[ART] - 9/10-----------The...graphics of this anime was perfect. The quality was high, and it was very clear to see when the scenes were dark. The details that the producers put into this anime was fantastic. The flames were very detailed, the characters, and even the backgrounds![SOUND] - 9/10-----------There was very fascinating background music for several different scenes, like when they reached the climax, romantic scenes, or even something casual, like going on a stroll. They always had music that fitted in with the scene perfectly. The opening of the anime didn't really make sense to me though, but the music was alright.[CHARACTER] - 10/10-----------I loved all the character designs.

The uniforms they had for Fukurou was also very fancy, and it really suited all the characters that wore it.[ENJOYMENT] - 10/10-----------There was at times where I didn't really enjoy this anime, but most of it was very interesting, especially towards the ending. There were many plot twists at the end of the anime and really made the climax way more interesting than it was.

This anime was really interesting, and I might rewatch it to get a clearer detail of what happened.FINAL SCORE:9/10 graphics of this anime was perfect. The quality was high, and it was very clear to see when the scenes were dark. The details that the producers put into this anime was fantastic. The flames were very detailed, the characters, and even the backgrounds![SOUND] - 9/10-----------There was very fascinating background music for several different scenes, like when they reached the climax, romantic scenes, or even something casual, like going on a stroll.

With all that’s happening, and a slight twist of fate, this is the story of Kuze Tsugumi and her encounter with cursed tomes, a man-made phenomenon that only the handful could see that strikes the Imperial Capital without question and joins an organization to rid of the tomes that held her life hostage.”At the heart of it all, Nil Admirari no Tenbin: Teito Genwaku Kitan (or The Scales of Nil Admirari ~The Mysterious...Story of Teito~) is a visual novel, otome-game, but don’t let the entire setting fool you that it’s the typical otome style show, because it doesn’t present itself as is, and as a guy, I do appreciate this show becoming something more special at the same time.If you haven’t known about it yet, Nil Admirari no Tenbin plays a lot of history, replicating the settings of a bygone-era (the Taishou era) where democracy in Japan is just starting to be taken over from old political statuses of power, nobility and the like. And much of it plays out in the characters that are borne out of this situation. Kuze Tsugumi is the equivalent of a family generational noble-class family, that has started to fall from greatness from politics in the country, such as her role to be married that sets off the catalyst for what is about to happen to her own brother, who tried to commit the mysterious suicide that is through cursed tomes, hand-written books that display the affections of the writers it originates from, to suck its victims into the vortex of suicide. And due to such incidents, she is then referred to the Imperial Library Intelligence Asset Management Bureau (or Fukurou for short), an organization that’s dedicated to finding out the true meanings of the cursed books that cause people to wreak havoc, and with her abilities to see the cursed tomes, sets off at the later point, a pivotal and political shift against powers and humanity.It is there that she faces the team of boys that are responsible and hold much regard to solving the various cases of the cursed tomes:Hayato Ozaki, presumably the main hero to the heroine, standing up for justice as the leader of Fukurou. He poses a no-nonsense attitude and will go to lengths to help protect anyone that is in the line of danger.Akira Kougami, who seems like the mysterious person, but still takes his work very seriously, and will try to draw lines between him and his relationship with the rest of the cast.Hisui Hoshikawa, the boy with the duo-colored eyes, even though his looks may pass off that he is (presumably) the youngest of the crew, his deal-breaker always lies with reprimanding Hayato for his over-the-top, insane actions that cause the group some discomfort. But other than that, he is the well-mannered person that due to his past complications, has a dislike for women, and his powers come into play as the series progresses.Shougo Akai, the son of the prime minister, the typical shounen who’s necessity was borne out of politics, whom has the same circumstances of external forces assassinating his father, and is forced to stay at Fukurou for safety, and overtime, comes to mingle well with the group, not by much but bit by bit.Shizuru Migawa, often the titular player of women, he is an accomplished writer, in which one situation foresees that his books are part of a series of murder-serial killing sprees for the tragedies he has laid out in his books (his books are not cursed tomes). And due to certain complications, he resides in Fukurou to help out the main cast from time to time.Rui Sagisawa, not part of Fukurou, but one who always chances Kuze by coincidence, and that with the over-arching story of the cursed tomes, has become engaged in a heated battle, but subsequently gave in to the cast’s demands.Unbeknownst to the main group, a secret organization by the name of Karasu, which exists as the indication of black bird feathers, is out there to retrieve the cursed tomes to override the political statuses of the Taishou government, from the failed assassination of the prime minister (Shougo Akai’s father) to the abduction of Kuze Tsugumi for her powers to help the people behind the whole movement be realized of their dreams, mainly Takashi Shiginuma for his active role in pursuing Kuze to conquer the world to Professor Mozuyama, who is the creator of the false, cursed tomes, to capture more victims to his orthodox experiments.If for the characters alone, you can pass it off as the generic otome-game features, but with the story setting and storytelling, comes a dimension of history so awfully maintained (just as in real-life) that it sets the course of the situations on hand to a more sinister but typical fashion move that is just jarring, but it works tremendously well here.The art and animation by studio Zero-G, trying to replicate the Taishou era by using closer-to-history art and consistent animation is a definite plus. When this series first started, I can tell that it was going for the more opaque, historical art choices for explanation and further-setup for the story that is about to be realized, and what it does, it does its job to a T. In the history of otome games I have watched, this is as close as it comes to realizing the entire story setting, and everything meshes as well as it should be.The music…it’s really something else. I’d expected a visual novel adaptation to have decent, if not mediocre music, but this show just made me throw all expectations out of the window, because this is the highlight of the series, so much so that it’s one of my favorite OSTs of this season and is worth listening to on its own. The music of kradness in the OP and one of Hiro Shimono’s debut songs in the ED just strikes and screams quality unimaginable to the naked ear.In the end, this may be an otome-game adaptation, but honestly, I’d recommend this insanely obscure series that nobody cares for, even if slightly obliged to a niche audience. Yes, you do need to know a bit of the history which the story stems along, but when all is said and done, it’s a good series to watch, and trust me, the experience after just won’t shake it.

The cursed tomes idea is great, maybe if the focus was the action and mystery they could do something better, but I just smell romance everywhere, everything that happens gives a reason to the romance (yeah, josei, i know!). So... the main idea is good (cursed tomes), but I don't think it was well explored.

Also the plot is pretty lack luster...and dry.

What's not to love?I was pleasantly surprised by how dark, unique and overall well done this otome adaptation was. It took me two tries to get into it I'll admit (first time i watched only 4 eps, second time i completed it) because it was just not what I was expecting from a reverse harem anime and I suppose I needed to be in the right frame of mind to fully enjoy such a heavy anime. Mayhaps I cried at times. The dark themes include suicide and rape (the rape is of a minor character and it is...not graphic but still can be triggering to watch so be warned), and prostitution. (There may be more but these r the major ones I can think of rn.) The characters are all interesting, well-rounded and ofc incredibly handsome, with even minor characters having their own backstories and depths. The atmosphere is dark and sombre at times but that does not make up the entirety of the anime with its exciting mysteries and twists that will keep you guessing right up until the end. There is romantic hints but romance is not the main point of the show with the overarching plot taking centre stage.

Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10213/Maji_de_Watashi_ni_Koi_Shinasai,"['[contains some mild spoilers, some suggestive language, and some comparison to the visual novel]What a slaughter.Maji de Watashi ni Koishinasai (TV) is one of the two visual novels that was adapted this fall season. In comparison to Mashiro-iro, which was a decent adaptation, MajiKoi’s adaptation was pure shit. In Mashiro’s review, I stated that Mashiro was considered an “average visual novel”, which made the mediocre storyline understandable. But, MajiKoi doesn’t have the luxury of using the excuse “the visual novel was bad”, it was considered a great visual novel (8.71@VNDB). In other words, it was a great source with great potential.Now, why exactly does the...adaptation blow? Is it because they adapted it into a generic harem instead of an enjoyable slice of life? Or is it because they completely slaughtered the characters, and developed the cast of respectable female characters into homogenized whores craving the main dude’s dick. Well, it would have to be a mixture of the two; but predominantly the latter.Now, I can understand that Western tastes and tastes in Japan differ. They like excessive fan service, I find it irritating. There’s an obvious difference, but it’s bearable for the most part; it’s not as prominent as it could be. But there’s a limit to everything too. When every other scene is censored due to nudity, it’s basically blatantly insinuating “Fuck you, buy the blue-ray release”. It’s probably a really effective way to catalyze sales in my opinion, but it’s still a douche thing to do. That could be ignored if the other aspects of the show was actually adapted decently, but they weren’t. .My first major gripe would be the harem aspect of it. The first arc of MajiKoi, before branching out and choosing individual path, was essentially, a slice of life. It’s really extenuating more on friendship then it is with the individual intimate relationships, it’s reminiscent of AnoHana in a way. The main arc in the visual novel basically contains little to no romance and it’s not hindered by infatuation until you begin to branch (but that’s still only with one character). The arc is more than enough to be animated into twelve episodes, it took six hours to read. That’s reading with skipping the majority of the voice acting, basically spamming enter. It’s inevitably understandable on why they would adapt MajiKoi as a harem over a sexless slice of life (It’ll probably sell well), but it was still something that could have been done.Now, the second gripe that basically ruins the visual novel, is slaughtering the characters. It’s similar to reading a book and developing the “ideal archetype” of the character, only to see it getting completely revamped in a movie adaptation. By slaughter, I don’t mean some slight miscalculations, it’s some pretty noticeable stuff. Some pretty notable ones would include the main character, Yamato. Now, in the visual novel, the main character is basically portrayed as an intelligent, devious tactician when it comes to facing everyday challenges; that carries on over in the anime. But in the VN, he wasn’t lusting after his friends, and his philosophies were more complex. In the anime, he was basically painted as a kind person as a kid when it came to taking in Miyako. In the visual novel, he just mentioned that she could stay if she wanted, it wasn’t through any good will, he was a nihilistic kid, I don’t think he really cared. On the other hand, each female in the visual novel had their own individual personality, in the anime, they’re basically homogenized into lusting after the dude(most notably Chris, she hated his devious dishonorable personality initially in the visual novel, however, in the anime, she doesn’t mind it). In the VN, they thought of him as a friend, and nothing more unless you pursued it while branching out.Objective Score: 2/10. It’s a disappointment. It did one of the worst things you could do in an adaptation, it slaughtered the character. It turned something with little fan service into something based off of fan service. Action was actually the focal centerpiece in the anime, in the novel, it’s more of an underlying theme.Subjective Score: 4/10: If you didn’t read the visual novel, you might actually like this. Most people reading the visual novel will probably dislike this immensely, it slaughtered the personalities of the majority of the characters. I guess you’ll like this if you like action, boobs, and cliché characters (excluding Miyako, she’s basically the only characters that’s pretty damn awesome in both versions, but then again, adapting a chick who’s going after the dude probably wasn’t the hardest in comparison to the rest). adaptation blow?

Honestly, why do people comparing the VN with the anime itself? we\'re talking about the anime in here not VN. oh god...When i finished this series i was kinda surprised, because the score in MAL itself didnt represent how good this anime was, i dont say this anime was the best but its quite entertaining, that 6.99 is just so UNDERRATED. remember...that.I have seen the VN itself but i am not gonna compare it, so i judge this anime purely based on how excited when i watching this anime.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------STORY - The story itself , i am not quite sure if this anime have a plot. I though the preview in MAL has explain it all. its about a bunch of girls and some boy who lives in under one roof, they represent theyself as kawakami family (sounds like a mafia, huh?), and the first of the episode you will see a war (yeah a war) which happen like in three kingdoms era. if you\'re thinking WTF is this, then i said this was an extracurriculer from the school that they attends. Shortly, for me Maji de Watashi is like Angel beats (Bunch of people) + Oda Nobuna (the war from edo era).At the first, it would quite hard to follow what happen in this anime since so many things that would make the viewers scratching their head. It cant be helped since, many scenes of this anime is slices of the Visual Novel itself, no wonder if the story is kinda messed up and didnt focus on the plot.be reversed from the story itself, The jokes that appears in this anime was really hit the spot, its really funny and quite amusing. 6/10ART - The artwork that the Maji de Watashi have is literally good, its not something that really exaggerate. The biright coloring that they use is pretty much increasing the atmosphere, Colorful scenery, and the character design itself is pretty well made, though the quality is seems a bit lower for the other anime but the art in this anime is still pretty enjoyable to watch. However, sometimes there is a lack in character drawn quality. In some scenes, the character face seems quite been ""distracted"", but thats doesnt really bothering. SO, 8/10.VOICE ACTOR - I am really attached by the voice for each character, they really represents the trait of each character, like Momoyo, she is tomboy, and the voice that they present was really like a real tomboy person, heavy voice and yet its cute. and anoher thing that should we mention is Gotou Yuuko. As the voice actor for MAyuzumi Yukie, her voice was so adorable and cute. No matter how many times you hear it, you wouldnt bored and helped to fallin love 8/10SONG - This is maybe the reason why i love to watch Maji de Watashi. especially the OP song + the animation for the OP itself. ""U-n-d-e-r--STANDING!"" by Endoh Masaaki, Kitadani Hiroshi, Misato Aki is quite catchy rock song, The beats is really hyped up the viewers like me, nor it was perfectly fit with the anime.CHARACTER - Well, its like any other harem anime, we have a tsundere (Christiane Friedrich), Dandere ( Yukie Mayuzum), the energetic one (Kazuko Kawakami), Big boobs (Momoyo Kawakami), and of course the obssesive one (Miyako Shiina) which reminds me of Sacchan in Gintama and for the main lead we have Naoe Yamato, which is very fits for the male lead, he is smart and yet its doesnt easy to tease this guy with the flirt from all the girls and a point plus for this male lead is he is not ""shy"" like any other harem anime.We have a bunch of unique girls, of course it was the standard of all harem. but somehow i found its really amusing. 8/10CONCLUSION - Basically, its lack of the story like everyone had said. but i am not really like concern about that problem since for me harem anime is just for entertaining, so i score this anime based on how satisfaction i am when i watching this anime, so did i satisfied with this anime? yes it is. its funny and yet admirable, especially for each character. so 8/10 for me. that.I have seen the VN itself but i am not gonna compare it, so i judge this anime purely based on how excited when i watching this anime.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------STORY - The story itself , i am not quite sure if this anime have a plot.

As the voice actor for MAyuzumi Yukie, her voice was so adorable and cute. No matter how many times you hear it, you wouldnt bored and helped to fallin love 8/10SONG - This is maybe the reason why i love to watch Maji de Watashi. especially the OP song + the animation for the OP itself. ""U-n-d-e-r--STANDING!"" by Endoh Masaaki, Kitadani Hiroshi, Misato Aki is quite catchy rock song, The beats is really hyped up the viewers like me, nor it was perfectly fit with the anime.CHARACTER - Well, its like any other harem anime, we have a tsundere (Christiane Friedrich), Dandere ( Yukie Mayuzum), the energetic one (Kazuko Kawakami), Big boobs (Momoyo Kawakami), and of course the obssesive one (Miyako Shiina) which reminds me of Sacchan in Gintama and for the main lead we have Naoe Yamato, which is very fits for the male lead, he is smart and yet its doesnt easy to tease this guy with the flirt from all the girls and a point plus for this male lead is he is not ""shy"" like any other harem anime.We have a bunch of unique girls, of course it was the standard of all harem. but somehow i found its really amusing. 8/10CONCLUSION - Basically, its lack of the story like everyone had said. but i am not really like concern about that problem since for me harem anime is just for entertaining, so i score this anime based on how satisfaction i am when i watching this anime, so did i satisfied with this anime? yes it is. its funny and yet admirable, especially for each character. so 8/10 for me.', ""We have Lerche's adaptation of the Minato Soft's adult visual novel that was originally release in 2009 for PC.The first episode is full of action, the next ones are full of fanservice, but then we have this comedy drama overload with a bit of action, and it's not a great combination.The art is awfull compared to the VN, but that will always happen, anyways, Mayumi and his co-workers made a great job.The music goes perfectly with the scenes, Katsuhiko-san is good with his work on this and Mirai Nikki.Every character is different, specially the female ones. personally, I fell in love with Koyuki and...Kazuko, Mayo is so cute (kawaii) and that thingy called Kuroko it's so random. Also, I'm a big fan of Asakawa Yuu, she made a great job with Momo, and even when i hate Yuko Goto's voice, she's wonderful with Yukie and Matsukaze.Enjoyment? well, besides this genre mess, it was a good anime, and I know that the VN is 100% better, but if I have the chance to buy the BDs, I will...

In short, they don\'t care, as long as they have as much shit stuffed on the screen as possible, they\'ll eat it.If you fit within that category this anime is for you. I\'m not going to try and explain any further because you probably...abandoned any sense of reason a long time ago anyway.Now for the Type A watchers who place story and development over flashy gimmick, in short, my fellow brothers.StoryFrom the start of this anime I knew there was a problem... sub par art and the feeling that nothing was making sense from the very beginning. This was a rip off fusion of the concepts of Baka no Test and Dog Days. No improvement on the material, they manage to fuck it all up from the first episode.First of all there is no clear power gap between Classes S and Classes F. What happened to the classes in the middle? Does the S Class even exist? They seem to be equals, Class F seems to be stronger even, maybe it\'s because S if further back in the alphabet than F is, I do not know and I do not care.There is also some romance plot shoehorned in with characters we have never seen before but are forced to show some sympathy when shown out of nowhere flashbacks that has nothing to do with what was happening at the time. If that\'s not bad enough, I have a reason to believe there was incest involved to some level. What the fuck does this do to progress the PLOT (word of the fucking day)? I hope they explain it in later episodes if they haven\'t managed to lose me by then.What peeves me off is that near the end there is a fight and the participants shout names of their special attacks every time they use them. It was pointless and was trying too hard every time they did it. It\'s alright and when used at the right moment, really cool to yell the name of your finisher move when you do it, just don\'t shout it for every freaking move that you just pulled out of your ass on the spot.ArtThis was the first thing that I noticed that let me know this was going to suck. The budget of this anime suddenly became clear and with what came after I began to realize that I had made a mistake somewhere in my life that led into me watching this anime. I look a sigh of disappointment as the cheap animation continued, with latest technology sincere art through anime is possible... They didn\'t even try. I have seen hentai with better animation than what they have in this anime.SoundThis is always a hard category in a review. This anime makes it harder. What hell do you want me to say? If I was asked I wouldn\'t even remember if there was even a soundtrack or BGM worth noting. No memorable score, but I have to give it to that robot Cookie. It\'s voice was kinda cute.Speaking of voices, they have lots of high class seiiyu in this anime. However that does improve anything, it actually worsens it. Sugita Tomozaku could have been doing something worth a shit with his time. Oh well I guess he gotta eat too. I hope he gets paid lots.CharacterToo many. I am confused, I can\'t remember any names. We don\'t learn about any of their pasts, what their dreams are, why they fight. Sure that might follow in later episodes but its unacceptable presenting this crap as the first episode.Pointless filler characters everywhere trying to desperately out categorize TVTropes, when will it end.?!

In my opinion, it's always the latter, because one never invests times in the former.Maji de Watshi is about a high school dude with no power surrounded by chicks with a lot of it. A plot we've seen a million times. This one is hardly refreshing. The only difference is that this anime tries to make some political statement, but fails in every way imaginable. In the meantime, there's cheap ecchi that's terrible and rehashed episodes within the arc itself so that one's viewing displeasure isn't focused on...just one thing. Awesome, right?Maji de Watshi is easily one of the worst anime I have ever watched. Not only is the main character rendered so impotent by weakness and stupidity, enough to make Perez Hilton look macho, but at the same time, the story is expecting the viewer to believe he's actually a genius tactician!!! The animation is fine, but the logic is missing in all aspects. One scene actually depicted a girl who is supposed to be able to move quickly enough to fight 5 people at once, shooting a bullet through an arrow AND through the string of the firing bow while in motion. Then, five seconds later, the powerless main character somehow grabs her arm and stun guns her. Epic retarded laziness is the only way to describe this.There's no payoff, by the way, if you're looking for something to hope for. It ends as badly as it begins. Avoid... this... show! just one thing. Awesome, right?Maji de Watshi is easily one of the worst anime I have ever watched.

Avoid... this... show!"", 'Ok, so I\'ve just finish this 12 episode anime, I must say that I generally describe this anime a chaotically crappy for something that is taken from an adult visual PC eroge novel. Ok so before the last 3 episodes I was able to forgive this anime\'s short comings co\'z of the comedy and the ecchi (even though it\'s censored) things in it and there is this thing that I was hoping that the muchacho (Yamato)  goes for Shiina, however things turned around with a corny ending. All the genres describe for this anime pertains not as a whole, but was divided each on...a per episode basis that adds to the chaos, so for the story it is a ""POOR"" number 3.Art: Mediocre number 5.Co\'z the art bears resemblance from another anime """"Kimiga Aruiji de Shitsuji Ga Ore De,"" where Kuki Ageha came from.Sound: Good number 7.Since I like both opening and ending themes and I also like the seiyus who did the voices of the female cast.Character: Poor number 3.Ok, let’s go to each of the main characters:Naoe Yamato- his character has him being a muchacho who prefers brains over brawn; actually he uses 2 heads one on top where he does all his thinking, analyzing and planning and one below his belt where he reads porn on one hand and plays with it.............. I\'ll leave to your imagination. He\'s a bit of a letdown co\'z everything about his character falls short of expectation, this is due to the fact that everything about his role is a dichotomy:  examples are; he proposes his love for Momoyo in 1st episode but in another episode he makes gestures that he\'ll be willing to marry Momoyo\'s sister, Wanko, he has a vast collection of porn paraphernalia, let alone some of his winky flash to Kokoro and yet he’s very reluctant to bang Miyako, his bragging that he prefers brains to brawn yet he ends up being a damsel in distress and what irritates me is his ridiculous and stupid excuse of  giving this anime a corny ending about his pet hermit crabs to his harem. Actually, my rating for this part falls on him.As for his harem:Friedrich Christiane - her character has her to be part of Naoe’s gang and class, she is a fencer by fighting standards. Since this anime has a harem genre in it, her role completes that of a rich tsundere with feelings for the muchacho (Naoe). The author of this anime seems to have limited her assistant Eberbach, Margit to a cameo role; she could have added something for this anime if she would have been made part of the main cast. Friedrich certainly adds certain class and finesse to the harem . By the way, I really hate the way she wore her uniform.Kawakami Momoyo- she\'s the muchacho\'s love interest, she\'s one superb fighter and she\'s bisexual, it is now establish the she does love the muchacho. Since part of this anime\'s genre is super powers, it is safe to say that her character is that genre.Kawakami “Wanko” Kazuko – By fighting standards she’s pike man co’z she armed with a naginata, she’s basically completes the harem genre as being wife material to the muchacho (Naoe) as well as an able competition from her elder sister, Momoyo.Mayuzumi Yukie – Well, obviously she’s a samurai and part of the harem, she’s probably the only member of the muchacho’s harem who’s a bit weird co’z she has a dual personally which compose of; the shy and conservative Yukie and the opinionated and outspoken Matsukaze which is represented by his horse like cell phone strap thing. What makes it more wired is that one can’t determined whether or not if every cast knows about her condition or they just assumed that the horse like thing is has a mind of its own, if this anime has a psychological genre in it, she’ll fit right in.Shiina Miyako- according to info, she was once bullied and was saved by the muchacho during their elementary days. Question, how was she able to become a skilled archer, in a span of just a few years? It is also implied that she’s not just any ordinary archer but she also has the same quick reflexes as all the members of the muchacho’s harem. Frankly she also adds to the muchacho’s dichotomy were it is implied that the muchacho may have a thing for her and yet he shoves her like some stray animal who wanders into his backyard. But one thing about her is that she contributes a lot to the comedy and ecchi genre of this anime.And the rest of the muchacho’s gang:Kazama Shiochi, Mooroka Takuya, Minamoto Tadakatsu and Gakuto Shimazu – well, it is kinda disappointing that the author has just limited the 4 to be support cast whereasthey have the potential to spice up the anime, however it is only Kazama Shiochi who is the true support cast among the four since he has more air time than the rest whom were just limited to cameo roles.Others:Kuki Ageha – I really don’t get as to why the author has to borrow her from another anime, when he/ she could have just come up with a new character.Cookie – I don’t know what to make out of that character and so are the rest.Enjoyment and overall: Poor number 3.Ok, so as I’ve mentioned this anime is taken from a PC adult eroge visual novel, so it is a PC game, the enjoyment is only on the ecchi and comedy part of the anime which only extents up to the 8th episode and according to another review writer, the anime “Majikoi” didn’t follow the intended arc of the title in fact the title itself  doesn’t fit well and I agree, if we’re to assigned  this title to another anime I’d say that the title  should fit right with “School Rumble,” as for the said animes  title “School Rumble” I’d say that is more appropriate to be assigned to this anime  since the setting always involves the students of Kawakami Academy. a per episode basis that adds to the chaos, so for the story it is a ""POOR"" number 3.Art: Mediocre number 5.Co\'z the art bears resemblance from another anime """"Kimiga Aruiji de Shitsuji Ga Ore De,"" where Kuki Ageha came from.Sound: Good number 7.Since I like both opening and ending themes and I also like the seiyus who did the voices of the female cast.Character: Poor number 3.Ok, let’s go to each of the main characters:Naoe Yamato- his character has him being a muchacho who prefers brains over brawn; actually he uses 2 heads one on top where he does all his thinking, analyzing and planning and one below his belt where he reads porn on one hand and plays with it..............

We see each character possessing a clearly unique, dare i say, supernatural ability that seemingly obliterates any hope of the other side winning the interesting battles that are the common theme of this show.

Decent characters, enjoyable enough, manageable length.However, should you have read the VN beforehand, STAY AWAY FROM THIS. Dear God. I cannot emphasize this enough.

Allright lets make my review short.Storyline:I think the first impression of audience is the most important in anime storyline. For my first impression. I was Shocked, the anime started with no clues but more to action and then the development of the story is quite slow.The story has a few flashback,but I think the flashback does not even make me sense anything.(Shocked again).Recently, I...just discovered the main hero and heroin on the 2nd episode.(Shocked again)Arts:The arts ,umm I can only give this anime for 7/10 . I recently watch other anime which is more quality than this one. You can see it by yourself.P/S: Ro-Kyu-Bu has better quality.Character:Too many character.Sometime I quite confused,who is this and who is that. As the anime is harem anime,no wonder 4 girls is in love with their own brother,which is in love with his older sister.(All of them are siblings..Hahaha)Enjoyment:I dont really enjoy this anime,but as the story is confusing me all the time.At least this anime has the harem,romance, and ecchi elements make it more enjoyable but not the storyline.Overall:Its not to late or it maybe too early to judge the anime.I misjudge some other anime by first impression but the end,it was a succesful work.For now,my overall rating for the anime is 8. just discovered the main hero and heroin on the 2nd episode.(Shocked again)Arts:The arts ,umm I can only give this anime for 7/10 .

The first episode really caught my eye. It came from the middle of nowhere with memorable characters where I was already beginning to pick favorites from and humor that's suited to my tastes.I didn't expect to enjoy it and found it while randomly scrolling through youtube, but I did.This is adapted from a eroge visual novel and while the art isn't amazing and is a little generic--I love the characters.I don't find any of the characters useless or annoying. The characters are strong and everyone has their fair share of time with the audience....I'm entertained and when it comes down to it--that's why people make anime, draw manga and continue on with their stories.I really don't have much to say except to give it a try and hopefully it suits your tastes.

Just your same, awesome Hinagiku, only with a thing for Justince(!!) and a noble bloodline.If you'll...have the hots for Chris, I recommend you play her route in the Visual Novel.

It would make this series a lot better (at least it did for me.

However if you are into the kind of shows that have a lot of ecchi action fights and girls who all adore 1 guy then this show is perfect for you.Personally I am more into the harem aspect of the show, the action is just a bonus for me.Art:...Looks very nice. Very bright, and vibrant.Sound: The OP is really good. I tend to skip OP but due to the fact that Ageha is in it, and that each girl is shown with their trademark abilities/weapons it just draws me in even more. Can\'t seem to remember the Ending though since I tend to just go to the next episode unless it\'s the ending of Fairy Tail (The one where Gray is walking alone, that song fits the animation so well)Character: The characters are the usual bunch. Super Strong leader/object of guys affection but doesnt feel the same way about him, foreign german girl who is not used to the customs of Japan, spunky/cute/optimistic one, Psychotic/obsessed/loves the main guy like no other, shy/flustered/good cook chick.This actually reminds me A LOT of Infinite Stratos now that I think about it.Enjoyment: Very enjoyable. I understand how people can either LOVE IT or hate it but I for one am not one of those nitpicky people that dissect shows and analyze every aspect of it.Give me a good story, with good art, cute girls and some romance. Thats all I ask for. Looks very nice. Very bright, and vibrant.Sound: The OP is really good. I tend to skip OP but due to the fact that Ageha is in it, and that each girl is shown with their trademark abilities/weapons it just draws me in even more. Can\'t seem to remember the Ending though since I tend to just go to the next episode unless it\'s the ending of Fairy Tail (The one where Gray is walking alone, that song fits the animation so well)Character: The characters are the usual bunch. Super Strong leader/object of guys affection but doesnt feel the same way about him, foreign german girl who is not used to the customs of Japan, spunky/cute/optimistic one, Psychotic/obsessed/loves the main guy like no other, shy/flustered/good cook chick.This actually reminds me A LOT of Infinite Stratos now that I think about it.Enjoyment: Very enjoyable.

Thats all I ask for.', ""I am writing this review based on what this anime is about: harem and action. Everyone compares it to the VN, I personally have not played it, so this is an unbiased review.Story- there really isn't one to speak of, other than trying to beat the former DEVA. It's the basic harem where the girls try to get the guy, but the girls are more forceful than other harems(miyako is my favourite, she would strip naked in public if Yamato asked). The action just from the first episode is so over the top with added superpowers makes it just awesome.Art- the art is enjoyable,...the characters are well drawn, the backgrounds too. The fights, anything involving momoyo, are fast, which all you see is arms going back and forth, so it's like they got lazy. The art isn't amazing, but it's still good.Sound-  it went good with most scenes, the fights had excellent soundtracks, the OP and ED were good but not catchy enough for meCharacters- they all followed their respective archetypes, but were more or less open with their feelings, except momoyo. With a half season, the show didn't focus on character development but the action aspect of it, each fight being better than the last.Enjoyment-I watched this show purely for the harem and action that it had. If you don't like this type of anime don't watch it, if u think this is like the VN don't watch it cause u will bitch about it the whole time.This anime didn't try to be anything that it wasn't, on the action part, it nailed it, the harem, miyako dull it down and mayu be just a little less awkward, the ecchi was fine, always just in the bath, never in fights to keep focus on the action. It was enjoyable, but it could've been better with 24-26 episodes and a clear choice on who he would choose out of the five. the characters are well drawn, the backgrounds too.

Well I have been having that with this show. This show is much like that and reminds me of Martial Heart although not as bad. Both have school girls fighting duals against other people in many different get ups from kimono’s to bad ass ninja clothing and they all have a different way of fighting. There is also a lot of nudity, the difference though being that the nudity isn’t actually in the fighting. It’s all in the school life drama that unfolds. The school life is just as it sounds...like, like every other school life genre with the gags running wild from perverted school mates to love life triangles.We have 5 girls all fighting for attention of one man, Yamato. We have the stupid one, the overly perverted one, the shy one, the girl who is from another country, and then the tomboy childhood friend. Sorry but that’s pretty much how each of the characters are. They may fight really well but under the surface, it’s just another school life. And then they had to add a bit of a underlining story that goes along with the show about the government or something but it just doesn’t seem to fit all that well. And sadly, the government part would be a big spoiler if I explained it so I’m in a little bit of a loss as to how to make this seem like a different show then all the other ones like it.The only thing that I have to say is I like Yamato’s undying love for Momoyo Kawakami. He pretty much never really falters in his love for her though he is a major pervert in ways. They had to make it so that he would be going after dirty magazines and movies. I guess it’s a normal high school boy thing but it seriously, it’s a bit overboard. And then there is a point where he gets hurt just because the girls fight over him in one of the most stupid ways. He is a weakling and yet all the girls love him. I’m not against him being skilled in mind but he should be a bit stronger if he’s around those girls.The animation is what I would expect from a 21st century anime and like many before that I have reviewed, it really didn’t stand out much. It was nice and rather clean lines with characters looking standard to the moe genre. That is really all I can say about it, its standard. It was made on a computer which means that the art style is pretty much the same as other bright shows. Not saying that every anime is made exactly the same but sometimes means that there is nothing to really talk about other then its good.The voices are pretty perfect for the characters with none of them really standing out except for me thinking I heard the same voice somewhere else. The same voice actor that does Yamato, Josh Grelle, is also the same one who did Satan in The Devil is a Part-Timer. The person who did Yamoto’s friend Shoichi also did one of the twins in Ouran High School. Things like that stick out for me because it seems that these people were dominating the voice acting industry when these were dubbed. like, like every other school life genre with the gags running wild from perverted school mates to love life triangles.We have 5 girls all fighting for attention of one man, Yamato.

Also, I haven't read the visual novel, so I probably gave it more credit than it deserves.Story: 5This anime has an underlying story that starts somewhere in the middle. The first episode is one that reveals all the characters and is an amazing showcase of animation and lack of plot-like elements. This anime is very much so similar to Highschool DxD in that regard. However, unlike DxD, this anime doesn't fill up the non-story related episodes with something that builds character and instead...uses them for pure fan service.*SPOILER ALERT maybe* the end of the ending just screamed deus ex machina.Art: 8The art in this anime is pretty decent. While I did not enjoy this anime overall, the art and animation were definitely on the brighter side of things.Sound: 6Nothing too memorable or dis-likable about the soundtrack they used. It was something I ignored for the most part.Character: 3While I would like to give it lower, Momoyo is one character that I truly liked from beginning to end. She stays true to herself and helps to salvage this anime. The protagonist, however, having been the focal point of the anime is one that is bland and pretty over used. He is pretty useless in comparison to the lovely ladies that surround him and is a complete pervert. His development is THE reason I rated character so lowly. I can't say too much without spoiling anything, so I'll just say the one thing he's supposed to be good at is completely forgotten as the anime progresses.Enjoyment: 5Between the pretty art and animation and the irritating characters, that one badass character and irritatingly boring filler this anime is at times enjoyable and at other times made me want to tear my face off.Overall: 4While I haven't read the VN, I definitely bore witness to this tragically awful anime.

There\'s no proper introduction of who they are, what their relation is, how can they involved in the war and so on. You have to guess it yourself.

At only 12 episodes I know I'll be seeing it a few more times.The synopsis really doesn't tell you anything about the story.

A story is thrown in there and is wrapped up at the end, but it's a mediocre story at best. It's all about the characters, and it's all about their relationships with each other.The main male character was the weakest fighter, and the girls have all the brawn. He's the Bosley and the five main girls are his Charlies Angels. They take all sorts of odd jobs for various reasons through the school, and it's a crazy ride to follow. I don't know if I would want to go to a school like that, but it was interesting to see their daily life if even just a little.The comedy is great in this series. Forget sexual innuendos, we're talking sex jokes and plenty of them. They don't shy away from making constant bold statements. Frankly, it was refreshing and I laughed pretty frequently.

Forget sexual innuendos, we're talking sex jokes and plenty of them. They don't shy away from making constant bold statements. Frankly, it was refreshing and I laughed pretty frequently. It really is a fun series to watch and I highly recommend it. It has good artwork, good music, and it's filled with all sorts of fun. Definitely worth checking out."", 'Majikoi! was exactly what I expected it to be. Another crappy comedy/harem anime. It\'s so generic that I had a hard time finishing it. I initially set out watching it because of a funny clip I saw on the internet. Even then I expected it be a shitty rom com at the very least. I didn\'t think it would be so generic though. There were some unique points, but other than that it was just a bunch of overhashed old ideas smacked together in one show.  So let\'s get deeper into the review.The story was mediocre. It could\'ve been so much better if...they made a better balance between comedy/fanservice and story. I\'m sure they knew this was never going to get a second season. The least they could have done is given more screen time to the plot and explain things in more detail. It did flesh out some things I like to see in anime though. There was some good introspection and mentions of the philosophies of nationalism/defending one\'s country. So 6/10 for story.The art is mostly average with a few saving graces. Some of the character designs are unique/uncommon. I personally liked how different Momo\'s character design was. All the other characters were average. Actually it looked like a few of them were pulled straight from ""Little Busters"". 6/10 for ArtThe music was okay. Nothing really tugged at my heart strings enough to feel it. The music was nice, but there wasn\'t enough music to really make it stand out. 5/10 on Music.The characters were so static and stale. There were points in each episode where characters were fledged out, but there was little character progression. If they focused more on character progression, it would have been better. However, they focused on comedy and fanservice. The character progression for the main character was mostly decent, but the comedy factor ruined it. 6/10 for Characters.Personally, I didn\'t enjoy this too much. I\'ve watched far too many harem comedies. I felt like this show could have been more than that. The comedy ruined the plot and character development. I like comedy, but not when it overtakes plot.  There were plenty of things to like in this show, but it just didn\'t go where I thought it should. 6/10 for enjoyment.I did hear this originally a VN; I never played through that.  This could have been much better. Some people may like it for what it is, but it could have been much more. 6/10 overall. they made a better balance between comedy/fanservice and story.

I went into it not expecting much and got just that. There wasn\'t anything memorable in this series whatsoever. Despite that, the series was funny when it wanted to be, and the action was actually fairly good. Honestly, the only real problem I have is the story and the ending.Story: 5I honestly think this show would have been better without a story. Of course, one of my main reasons for being the...anime addict that I am is the countless stories that anime is able to offer. If an anime doesn\'t have a story, then as long as it has great characters and good humor then I\'m set. Majikoi is a funny show. They make a lot of sexual jokes, but that\'s not really the only basis of the humor. The story is simple yet also kind of stupid. Stupid is a sort of childish term, but it fits the story nicely. It tries to be serious, and really I tried to take it that way. The ending is what disappointed me. I didn\'t mind the stupid story because there were great characters to back it up. I\'m just going to be straight and say the ending to this show is one of the worst endings I\'ve ever seen. No closure. At all.Art: 8I gave the Art an 8 because it\'s fairly average, but at times it\'s a bit more than that. The animation is actually pretty good for the fight scenes, and there\'s plenty of fights to go around, whether they\'re a serious fight or not. It was fun to see. Other than that, there\'s nothing really notable to point out about the art.Sound: 8The soundtrack is definitely above average. It\'s good, though there are only about 2 stand-out tracks that I\'d actually want to look for. None of the music was really notable. The opening isn\'t anything special, though after a few episodes it grew on me and I actually started to like it. The Ending song I never paid any attention to. (Though I usually would.) The BGM of the show fits fight scenes nicely and one track actually managed to make one of the fights seem fairly emotional. Only a bit, though.Character: 9This is where the show stands out to me. I don\'t really care for ""typical character types"", like when people point out the typical types of girls always involved in a harem. To be honest I have a hard time finding any typical character types here except for Momoya, the girl who only really cares about fighting. I\'m not sure if that\'s typical, though. There were some unique characters, types I\'ve never seen before, actually. Mayucchi, for example, was a great character who always talked to her keychain, which she also thought talked back but it\'s actually just a sort o split personality of hers pretending to be the keychain. There\'s Cookie, the robot, who was a fun character to see interact with people. The main character, Yamato, was actually pretty stand out too. He\'s a pervert, but not really to an extreme level like the main characters of ""So, I can\'t Play H!"" or ""Kenzen Robo Daimidaler"". He\'s not afraid to pull out his man-parts if needed, though. He also loves Hermit Crabs, which was a small yet somewhat entertaining personality trait of his. He\'s also extremely smart when it comes to being a strategist, and for that people admired him. The other girls in the harem, as well as the dudes who were Yamato\'s friends, were all fun to watch interact with one another. The strong point of this show is it\'s character, yes. I honestly kept watching this show for them solely. Plus, the relationship between Yamato and Momoya was one I rooted for. There\'s actually a good amount of depth to their relationship, too.Enjoyment: 7Really the strong points of this series is the comedy. If you watch it solely for that, you shouldn\'t be disappointed. Don\'t take it seriously. Watch it for the characters. They\'re fun. The story is dumb. It\'s there, and it gets in the way of the comedy, but it\'s something you can easily get past and back to the fun.Overall: 7If you\'re looking for a quick comedy to watch to pass the time, a so-so show with a lot of dick jokes, fun characters and pretty good action, I\'d say try out Majikoi. It\'s only 12 episodes, so why not? I enjoyed watching it to pass the time and I feel as though if you don\'t take this seriously, you may enjoy it too. anime addict that I am is the countless stories that anime is able to offer.

To start things off I really liked this anime the ending can go suck itself but oh well. Are story revolves around a boy named Naoe Yamato who one day wants to become the prime minister and fix the government in japan and like any harem anime of course you have the girls who all want to give it to him hard. There are four and a one who finds out near the end that she has true feelings for him. These girls make his life hectic and even...cause him harm. Throughout this anime he has tried to propose to one specific girl this girl at the end of the anime shows her true love for him as she is about to die but of coarse miracles do happen it is shown that he kisses her and she comes back to life. witch then lets the girls to believe that he loves her when in fact he loves his hermit crabs witch was like a kick in the nads but i will say altogether it was a good anime that is why i gave it a nine. cause him harm.

Well you’ll be surprise if you got through with watching this anime!This anime is something else. The first episode really builds you up, give everyone false hope and then it became disappointing. It was action pack and really interesting because they started with a battle. I thought it may continue like this and so I went on but I was wrong. The female characters all having this crush on the male protagonist, well it is a harem but it look like the females really desire the male’s affection. To sum that desire it...would be “lust.” Even though they did include some action scenes which were mediocre, they didn’t really stick with the story all the way through. They briefly introduce the villain but quickly switch the theme to ecchi rather than a thriller. I get the fan service is different in Japan compare to anywhere else but due to this, it completely diverted the viewer attention to ecchi. This means our attention has focused on the ecchi part and completely forgot about the villains.The artwork is decent meaning not the greatest but not the worst.  Other ecchi anime, the nudity is covered up with something more natural like fog or blackout but in this, they put in pictures frames to cover them up. This really is a distraction because rather than looking at the art or subtitles, our attention has diverted to these picture frame because it appear so unnaturally, and unfit to the scene.Character-wise, they all have their own unique characteristics which appears to have something to do with the history part of the anime but it wasn’t properly explained. There is a lot of incomplete trains of event with were left unexplained thus leaving the viewers confused.Overall , I didn’t read the visual novel so I don’t have any harsh terms to say however this anime did have a good start with action and comedy but it wasn’t laid out properly so it’s been really boring watch. This anime is nothing out of the ordinary just one of those in the haystack, a common piece. If you’re looking for harem, ecchi anime, with some action…….you are very close but not there yet, don’t waste your time, take this off your list because you will be not impressed.~Later would be “lust.” Even though they did include some action scenes which were mediocre, they didn’t really stick with the story all the way through.

First of all... Majikoi VN is a masterpiece imo, it aged really well, and the quality it has can fight the newer ones. it has a great quality in every aspect, so if you enjoyed the characters, you'll love it as wellStory: For all those who say that the anime doesn't really have a plot, well.. they are somewhat right, what they did for this anime, is mesh all the routes into one, just to give you a feel about each character, plus the addition of characters that...appear in the sequel of the original Majikoi VN.The story for this anime, mostly follows Momoyo route, with some minor changes, and some big ones.Characters: They portrayed them really well, the personality they have in the anime, is the same as in the VN, so if you liked at least that, you will surely enjoy the VN. I also give my props to the VA's, since their voices suit the characters.Art: For being an anime based on an old eroge, the animation was really good, as well as the colouring, although sometimes the drawing quality did drop.Music: Yeah, the music for this anime doesn't hold a candle to the VN, I don't know the reason of why they didn't used tracks from the game. With that said, I don't think it's necessarily bad, it does fit with the anime. Of all things this has, music has to be my least favorite.Conclusion: It does a good job promoting the VN, it shows a good ammount of the poersonality each girl has, and explains you a bit about the setting. I still think they should have tried harder in making the story a little easier to follow.If you want to enjoy the series, the best thing to do is reading the VN's, I think they have a really good quality appear in the sequel of the original Majikoi VN.The story for this anime, mostly follows Momoyo route, with some minor changes, and some big ones.Characters: They portrayed them really well, the personality they have in the anime, is the same as in the VN, so if you liked at least that, you will surely enjoy the VN.

I don\'t like this anime for the story. If it was a serious anime i would of dropped it. A lot of the episodes was just the dude and his massive harmen of girls interacting and funny scenarios happening. They all try to get him to fall in love with them by doing crazy/cute stuff.  The action scenes are good, but my favorite part is the comedy and the crazy in love girls. This anime is...just full of crude humor and sex jokes. All the characters have really funny personalities and if you have the right kinda sense of humor this anime will make you laugh. If you don\'t like seeing bare breasts, a million sex jokes and some action stay away from this anime. One other thing that, this anime touches on is loving ones country and what it truely means. It doesn\'t mean the country is perfect but you have people you love in it and you want to protect it. ""People form famlies, familes form towns, and many towns form a country\'\'. A quote i liked from the anime. It\'s a fun little anime that has some good spots besides the basic plot. just full of crude humor and sex jokes.

', ""As the story goes it is very funny the more you see it the more it makes you laugh. The opening is a great song the sounds and music in there are great too. The characters each have there own thing that's what makes them so unique. If any one is reading this i would recommend try it out and seeing it for your self. "", ""Except for the art, character designs and flashy fights, this series SUCKS. Really, usually I would find this type of anime acceptable and quite worthwhile, BUT this whole series is a chain of confusion and overreacted characters. After the whole series, I completely don't get the plot, especially the protagonist's choice in the final episode ( Though some people find that surprising and funny), Unless you don't have anything to watch, don't waste your time on this show. Well, it's only my opinion, whether you watch it or not is up to you, you might think different. That's all. "", ""Alrighty Samurai Girls. Well to clarify for anyone reading this. I do see a lot of people say that this adaption of this anime from it's visual novel apparently outright crap. However I have not read the visual novel. So with that clarification. On to the review. Now first the negatives. The story is very eh at best. It makes sense, but it is very plain to say the least. It is enough to get the characters to get out of the house. However what are you going to expect out of a harem series? You know why you watch these ecchi harems. So characters...for me. Most of them are ok. However some of them are kind of annoying to me personally. However that just narrows down who my waifu is. So take that as you will. However with this being a harem. I was pleasantly surprised by how good this series was. I did enjoy this series. So lets start of with the art. Now this is the same studio who made another one of my favorites assassination classroom, and Monster Musume if you like that series. This series does a great job with the fighting animations, and there is plenty of it. The characters also look a bit different as well. So the art style is very nice as well. Also watching uncensored on the blu ray is a added bonus. The sound is also good if you are worried about that. So for the overall feel of the anime as I stated above I liked this series. Usually I am very picky about this genre of anime. Usually its awkward dialogue, WAY too young of a girl, or maybe even a slow boring story. Yes the story is slow, and plain. There is still one there. It is enough to make sense of why the characters do what they do. However no little girl sexual tension. That is automatically a plus in my book. If yah like it it isn't here. If you don't welcome to the party. The jokes are pretty good to. Obviously the jokes are sexual. Because yah know? Harem anime. However I laughed out at some of these jokes. Then the voice acting with the main character and Miyako are absolute gems. The way he talks when she surprises him is fantastic in the dub of this anime. So the score is a seven out of ten for me. I would recommend this anime, but only to people who like this type of anime. If you are a elitist anime fan. You aren't going to like it. Which they don't really like anything. Anyways. I loved it the art is good, dialogue is pretty good, plenty of good waifus to choose from, boobs, and some great fight scenes. Also the opening is pretty kick ass. for me. Most of them are ok.

I may write some additional note if something was particularly good or not (like art or the characters voice).I am going to try to be impartial, even if i like the anime a lot or i dislike it like the kechtup on the pasta and put things in the right context (i can\'t expect a complex plot for an harem)REVIEWPlot - 6I really don\'t understand. This anime made me dizzy because at first was a ""class vs class"" like baka test, then it turn toward...the full harem plot, explaining how girls fall in love with the protagonist and then it become an action plot. I don\'t understand why this mess...It\'s not like i didn\'t enjoy it but it\'s...confusing. If you don\'t mind about this ""change of tide"" it\'s a fair plot after all.Characters - 7Well this is hard: characters are someway a clichè but they are well defined. The protagonist is a good one, full of weakness but somehow smart, and he love his crabs (they were something different from a crab but i can\'t recall what exactly they were). What disappoint me are the other males characters, they got really a small part in the anime but it\'s harem after all, so you shouldn\'t be surprised.In short: good protagonist, fair girls and few good male characters; not bad at all.Other details: the ending is awful. I won\'t spoiler but it cannot be really called an ""ending"" for me. Fights are not bad at all instead!Overall - 6Ok so this anime is worthy? Well it\'s an harem and if you like harem with some action and with a ""not-so-good-but-decent"" plot it can be what you are searching for. As i stated before beware the ending...Personal tastes: i enjoyed it. I like the action and the protagonist was really a good one (he deserves an 8) so for me was a really good anime the full harem plot, explaining how girls fall in love with the protagonist and then it become an action plot. I don\'t understand why this mess...It\'s not like i didn\'t enjoy it but it\'s...confusing. If you don\'t mind about this ""change of tide"" it\'s a fair plot after all.Characters - 7Well this is hard: characters are someway a clichè but they are well defined. The protagonist is a good one, full of weakness but somehow smart, and he love his crabs (they were something different from a crab but i can\'t recall what exactly they were). What disappoint me are the other males characters, they got really a small part in the anime but it\'s harem after all, so you shouldn\'t be surprised.In short: good protagonist, fair girls and few good male characters; not bad at all.Other details: the ending is awful. I won\'t spoiler but it cannot be really called an ""ending"" for me. Fights are not bad at all instead!Overall - 6Ok so this anime is worthy? Well it\'s an harem and if you like harem with some action and with a ""not-so-good-but-decent"" plot it can be what you are searching for. As i stated before beware the ending...Personal tastes: i enjoyed it. I like the action and the protagonist was really a good one (he deserves an 8) so for me was a really good anime', ""I felt that there could have been so much more.  The VN created a fun romp that was worth while playing, unlike most VNs.Did the content of the anime differ from the VN?  Not too much in my mind.  What they did in the anime seemed very like it could happen in the game.  Several scenes that where referred to in the VN got screen time in the anime, much to my chargin (thinking of the festival).The series seemed to hop around on each of the 5 heroines routes as the story progressed.  Each...character seemed to get a day in the limelight episode.  Which did not need to happen.I hoped that they would have picked a specific character's route or the true ending to show to audiences, but then who would buy the game then? character seemed to get a day in the limelight episode.

Just my two cents on an anime to give you a jist.I started this anime because it was on hulu and I ran out of shows to watch on my normal platforms (netflix and hulu). The shows first episode was. . great. Honestly, I was expecting a high action thriller show with a bit of fan service and the harem aspect. Fan service is a plenty and the harem is very real, but the action slows down a fair amount...for the following episodes and eventually picks up again. I'm not a VN fan so I can't speak about that side of this anime, but the story was lacking, the art wasn't bad, the comedy was there, and to be honest, I think this show had potential but it got lost following the VN that I haven't played.

I watched the anime first and I didn't get the story at the beginning but when I finished the VN, I rewatched the anime and finally understood.Story: 7/10The beginning of the episode 1, it was rather nice to see fighting already. It was a like a sequel to Momoyo's route in the VN. That's why I recommended to play it first than watch this.Art: 9/10The art was really amusing and was very admirable.

It\'s difficult to write an accurate review because my own personal experience with the anime does not reflect what I actually think about it objectively, as I enjoyed it quite a lot hence the disturbingly high rating. But, this is a review, so I\'ll try to be accurate.However, since I did watch it before ever playing the visual novels, it will be easier for me to review it as a standalone, rather than simply comparing it to the VN like people tend to do. However, as it\'s an adaptation, the comparison should be made anyways since if you managed to enjoy the anime...and haven\'t played the VN yet, I guarantee you, you will absolutely love the VN as well as all of the sequels.What we have here is a pretty typical case of excellent VN writing getting butchered into oblivion by the fact that it\'s, by nature, a harem. The main setting is a male main character surrounded by a bunch of females, so that\'s what you\'d expect.Here\'s the issue, a lot of the good writing that came with the VN just simply doesn\'t exist in the anime. I\'m not sure if this is because of limited budget or what, but it seems very little effort actually goes into the anime and everything kinda just gets squeezed into 12 episodes. Takuya, Gakuto and Shoichi barely get any screen time at all, same with pretty much the entirety of classes 2-F and 2-S that aren\'t the main girls & Yamato, and a lot of time in multiple episodes is spent just focusing on a relationship/backstory between Yamato and one of the girls, rather than anything actually going on.The girls as well...it\'s horrific how 2-dimensional they are. They\'re not School Days level of bad, but...ugh. Early spoiler alert (like episode 1 or 2) but Yukie has a bathtub conversation with Matsukaze about how she now has to marry Yamato because he saw her panties. Seriously? And honestly there isn\'t really that much character interaction with any of the girls to begin with. Outside of having like an episode each to show off in typical harem fashion, none of them actually do anything besides exist in the background. Miyako and Momoyo are the only ones with any real personality it seems, the first episode is really the only episode where anything actually major happens that involves all the characters (which was the only part of the anime that was actually in the VN as well, big surprise). And you can\'t tell me I\'m the only person who\'s really upset that, as far as I remember, Tsubame never ever makes another appearance after her short one in the first episode. Not that I\'m surprised because the main characters barely get any relevant screen time themselves, just a harem being a harem.Apart from that, honestly, I didn\'t see anything wrong and quite enjoyed it. I loved the opening and endings, the overall OST wasn\'t anything special but that\'s partly my fault because I rarely actually listen to music that\'s playing mid-episode. What action there actually was looked perfectly fine, the fighting was very dragonball-esque in nature with light-speed fists flying and balls of energy, which I\'m not really a fan of, but I\'m not complaining. Being a typical harem, at the very least, it was quite hilarious. I did watch the dub, and to be honest, after hearing the Japanese voice acting in the VN, I don\'t want to watch the sub and have it ruin the VN for me. Dubs tend to be ""more fun"" in a sense anyways, and besides, Josh Grelle never hesitates to throw himself into whatever role he\'s given, so it was worth watching just for that. Hilary Haag is amazing at making characters be so annoyingly bratty yet lovable at the same time, and Tiffany Grant seems to have an uncanny ability to voice German characters, as is seen here and in Infinite Stratos.Overall, as a standalone, it\'s certainly not bad and I enjoyed it quite a lot, but compared to the VN it leaves a loooot to be desired. If you\'re here after watching the VN, don\'t expect anywhere near the same level of quality, but expect to have a few laughs at least. If you haven\'t seen any of the Majikoi VNs, please, do so.

I started it because it looked really funny, and I saw a scene from a youtube video  - it was ecchi and comical.I liked it, it was super funny, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.The first half was formulaic, but in a GOOD way! It had just the right amount of ecchi to comedy balance. The characters were great too, each with their own quirks.  And somehow, there was a sense of camaraderie, like there was no jealousy or infighting. It\'s something...I never really see.The intro and outro music were catchy too, I enjoyed them quite a bit.I was settling in for a comfortable ride of comical ecchi nonsense, but then the series took a turn and made a couple changes -The last several episodes introduced a plot (yes, that late) and changed to a battle anime. It was almost exclusively battle, with no comedy. The tone shifted to a more serious drama. Which not only felt contrived, but the battling was also just kinda....lame. Like, ""Oh crap guys, we forgot to add some plot and interpersonal conflict -- lets fit this in at the end. Ok? Great. Good meeting guys""The characters  I liked, were then consumed by jealously and drama --- they became obnoxious. A good amount of cat-fights ensued, and typical character archetypes took over. It was annoying. The enemy characters had plot armor, were conveniently good at everything, and had a lame, mostly unexplained ambition. It was hard for me to even adapt to this haphazard change(You may be thinking ""Oh, he just likes ecchi comedy scenes and doesn\'t like change -- watch something else"" , but I do actually like battle -- and I actually tried to rationalize and enjoy this change)There were a number of elements introduced early on that could have been expanded upon. They were introduced only to be left alone. These would have been better ideas to cover instead of shoving a bunch of battle scenes at the end.The feeling I have is disappointment. That feeling of enjoying a good anime, and being let down and frustrated at the end. It\'s arguably worse than watching a consistently bad anime since you know it\'s bad.

I am not against his love for his sister but his desperation is so out of this world that he fights a girl because that girl by mistake dropped a half-bitten food off his sister.So the moral of the story is that this story is of a guy who is desperate for his sister and there is nothing else in it but yes the ecchi flavor in it is good if you just come to see the girls oppai and the story doesn't matter for you then you can go for it. a woman everyone else is good though.Enjoyment 5:-In the first some episodes, you enjoy the anime as you really got an ecchi flavor which is clearly uncensored so you enjoyed it on that part.

Initially I thought this anime was going to be a school life/slice of life/harem type anime which even though as been done to death is sometimes good to go back to and just...enjoy. The first episode showcased a class war while the second puts the characters on an odd job to find a lost dog. The flow between the characters seemed to be done very well but as soon as the third episode hits, they introduce a terrorist plot to the anime that completely…kills it (in a bad way). The anime tries to become super serious and add backstory to some of the characters but unfortunately it just fails. It’s a shame because I was really looking forward to a nice laid back anime.Animation: 7/10The animation on the other hand came out pretty good. I was lucky enough to get to watch this season on my friend's BD copy in 1920x1080 resolution and I have to say…ecchi. There are a lot of scenes where there are some suggested sexual content but nothing that pushes the bar too much. In terms of overall quality of the scenes, it is kind of a mixed bag. The scenes where not a lot is going on are filled with some impressive visuals, however I noticed that the action scenes are filled with some artifacting (which shouldn't happen on a BD copy of the anime...) and some loss of quality. Overall it’s a great looking anime so props for that.Sound: 6/10The soundtrack leaves much to be desired but the voice acting is recorded fairly well and also has pretty good actors to back them up. Each character has a unique and well done vocal track. The only issue that really bothers me about the sound in this anime is that the overall soundtrack is just bland and uninspiring.Characters: 6.5/10In terms of my overall enjoyment with the characters of this anime I have to say that I did love some of the characters. The ones that stood out to me the most was the sex crazy Shina, the main character Naoe, and the shy Mayuzumi who uses a keychain to communicate with others (thinking that it is a god). Everyone else however comes off as generic and, “Oh I remember someone like her from like five other anime.” Generic doesn’t always mean “bad” but for this anime it just seems like they didn’t try to push the character development enough to get these said generic characters out of the typical cookie cutter descriptions.Overall: 5.4/10Overall I really, really, really wanted to enjoy this anime because the initial episode really gave me hope and had me hooked. It turns out however that a weird and unneeded plot device can and will run an anime with subpar character development and average sound. It’s hard to recommend this to anyone but hey if you need to kill some time at least it’s not horrible.Enjoyment: 5/10Thanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!Sincerely,Awesome Drummer enjoy. The first episode showcased a class war while the second puts the characters on an odd job to find a lost dog. The flow between the characters seemed to be done very well but as soon as the third episode hits, they introduce a terrorist plot to the anime that completely…kills it (in a bad way). The anime tries to become super serious and add backstory to some of the characters but unfortunately it just fails. It’s a shame because I was really looking forward to a nice laid back anime.Animation: 7/10The animation on the other hand came out pretty good. I was lucky enough to get to watch this season on my friend's BD copy in 1920x1080 resolution and I have to say…ecchi. There are a lot of scenes where there are some suggested sexual content but nothing that pushes the bar too much. In terms of overall quality of the scenes, it is kind of a mixed bag. The scenes where not a lot is going on are filled with some impressive visuals, however I noticed that the action scenes are filled with some artifacting (which shouldn't happen on a BD copy of the anime...) and some loss of quality. Overall it’s a great looking anime so props for that.Sound: 6/10The soundtrack leaves much to be desired but the voice acting is recorded fairly well and also has pretty good actors to back them up.

If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!Sincerely,Awesome Drummer"", 'This might be the lowest score I\'ve given anything I\'ve ever finished. Due to this, the review will be broken into two sections, a short version covering the scoring criteria, and a longer version focused on the couple ""interesting"" choices that were made during the creation of Majikoi, a list that mainly consists of critical flaws.Short Version:Story: 1, There\'s literally nothing going on here, Majikoi does a couple things different (will talk about that in the long version), but at the end of the day, there is no world-building for its supernatural elements, no plot, and really just no story to speak of. Majikoi is...a regurgitated version of the countless generic harem anime we\'ve already seen.Art: 3, Harem/Ecchi series thrive on fan service for this hard to be so unappealing is just kind of sad really. It keeps an alright consistency in the quality, but that\'s not really a compliment when the quality is as poor as this is.Sound: 3, None of the OSTs were memorable, the OP and ED were meh, skipped \'em almost every time. Most of the VA was pretty annoying (English Dub). Also, whoever decided that the MC should shout ""nee-san"" all the time, you literally made me cringe every time I heard it.Character: 1, 100% reliant on troupes; you\'ve seen all these characters before, now they just have different names, appearances and voices, well, sometimes. I just binged the whole thing and I can only remember two character\'s names and that\'s because I have specific issues with those two characters (will cover in longer version)Enjoyment: 2, I found a whole two scenes entertaining in the entire series, so I generously gave 2 points.Overall: 2, Look no one really expects the most from the harem genre, but I genuinely wasn\'t expecting it to be this bad. It\'s unfortunate that there are a couple formulas on how to write harems that get repeated over and over, but its worse when one just decides to crash and burn instead of doing anything.Long Version:Episode 1: Don\'t worry the long version isn\'t episode by episode, but I found episode 1 to be unlike anything I had ever seen before. However, that isn\'t a compliment; I hadn\'t seen it before, because it was an awful idea. Who in their right mind decides to give big introductions to the majority of the cast in the first episode? This episode was a pointless action reel to introduce characters; the only information we got was about some type of skirmish battle between classes at some combat-based school, and then a shit ton of troupes forced down our throats. I really don\'t understand the idea to bring the whole harem cast in immediately either, I prefer it to more so trickle in. It\'s not like I\'m expecting only one or two characters in the first episode, but I\'m not expecting much more than that. When you try to squeeze almost your entire cast into the first episode, giving all of them some lengthy introduction, uh yeah, that\'s what the episode is gonna be then, unfortunately the only thing that was introduced was girls = strong, boy = smart.Also, I\'m not saying if you wanted to put all your characters in the first episode/chapter of a story that you can\'t do that, but there\'s a smart way, and this isn\'t it. Tenchi Muyo: War on Geminar is a great example of how you can get away with doing that. In the first episode of it, the majority of the cast appears on screen in a very short amount of time because they are all present in order to honor the empress being coronated. While the majority of them don\'t have lines, I found it incredibly enjoyable upon a rewatch to notice the majority of the cast was present in the first episode. It\'s a little harder to do in a novel format, but with visual storytelling it\'s pretty easy. Dependent on the size of your cast, you could do something similar to Majikoi, but the big issue was the length of the introductions and the number of them. You would also really want to showcase character interactions, because this first episode of Majikoi was too filled with action to properly do that.The ""filler"": Alright, let me start this off by saying I have not seen the source material this anime was adapted from, and because of that, I\'m not sure that the scenes I\'m talking about are genuine filler, but there are a handful of episodes that felt like complete filler. They were mainly earlier episodes, most of the scenes that filled these episodes we either purely fan service driven, or I think they were supposed to be scenes to showcase character interactions, but let\'s face it, once you figure out which troupe each girl is, you can figure out how those scenes will play out. Why did this happen? Probably because someone thought it was a great idea to throw every character in the anime into episode 1, instead of slowly trickling them in over time. There\'s nothing more to say here, these scenes accomplish nothing.The ""setting"": I won\'t lie to you and say, ""I gave Majikoi my full attention while watching it"", because if I had been foolish enough to do so, I likely would\'ve fatally wounded myself, and been unable to type this review. The point is, it\'s possible I\'ve missed some grand piece of information, but personally I have no idea what the hell is going on for any of this anime\'s expository information. By that I mean, information regarding the setting which is typically kind of important. I think Highschool DXD is a great example of harem story with decently well formed lore and something that isn\'t overly complex in regards to a power system, but still manages to be decently memorable, Majikoi on the other hand is the exact opposite. Some people have what seemed to be abilities derived from some form of martial arts, however they are all very supernatural, very uncreative, and very unexplained. The students use weapons that don\'t injure each other, but what those weapons are, how they work, and why they exist are all a mystery to us.""Japan is dying"": Jesus, so this could\'ve gone in the previous section on ""setting"", but it\'s a slightly lengthier topic to discuss. Majikoi likes to act like it has something big to say on the current state the nation of Japan is in, but plot-twist, it really doesn\'t. 90% of anything remotely serious that happens in this anime is because one person thinks the country is dying and another disagrees. The way characters discuss it make it come across like this is some kind of story that can serve as a metaphor for the current setting of Japan, but to describe how hard it tries to accomplish this, verses what actually happens ... Imagine a kid that goes to jump rope for the first time, but falls, gets tied up in the rope, stands up and just starts jumping again while tied up in the rope, with the most forced smile you\'ve ever seen on his/her face ... After writing that, I realize that metaphor sums up most of this anime.What Makes a Harem: The girls! Which is exactly what\'s wrong with Majikoi. I\'m not saying Majikoi\'s girls are awful, but ... Let me put it this way, they have poor character designs that are drawn poorly, which you can overlook, oh, they were given annoying voices too, but you can get over that, but what matters most, is that they don\'t have personality. All of these girls are 100% flat and there is no time spent developing or growing any of them. This takes us back to episode 1 (yeah, yeah, sorry); the reason most harem anime trickle in the harem members 1 by 1 instead of just dumping them all in at once, is to slowly develop each one. Because of this blunder, the harem ends up being: doggy bitch, bitch that talks to her cell phone strap, foreign bitch, and thirsty bitch. Sorry for the excess of profanities, but the point is that they are all nameless bi.. sorry, I\'m done. The actual point is that each of them can be described in a single word or phrase. This is one of the first times in my life where I can\'t pick a best girl in a harem anime, and it\'s only happening because I don\'t want any of them. Though if you had to make me pick my least favorite it would have to be...Main Girl: We are going to talk about this dumb bitch Momoya, before I blow a gasket. First off, why did you make a main girl that is such a massive c... well, I\'ll keep this review clean of that word, but you can probably guess what I was about to call her, and goddammit, I have good reason. Look, because of the awful writing decisions, the best way to describe the current situation between main girl and MC is that we are in the failed ending of a harem game where you  have already reached the end of the game, but for some reason even though you have already maxed out affection points and reached the end, the main girl still rejects you. The only reasonable explanation is the game\'s creator was for some reason driven to madness, and decided to make a harem game that goes on forever without an ending where you actually get the main girl, forcing you to play indefinitely. Well, pick another girl, you might suggest? That might work, but while the main girl won\'t accept you, she definitely wants you to want her and no one else, so if you were to attempt any ending that doesn\'t involving being with her, she\'ll probably kill you and has the means to do so. When you have characters as flat as these + the scenario that I just played out for you, you can probably guess that Momoya is stupid strong, manipulative b.... and unless you\'re a hardcore masochist, you\'re probably going to be annoyed by everything she does.Main Character: Our MC, Yamato, has a name that I only remember because of a specific scene that I still find ridiculous. The old guy with the bandaged head asked him if he was Yamato\'s son? Which to me felt a lot like if somebody said, ""Hey, you Smith\'s kid?"". I dunno, personally I think Yamato is an incredibly popular name in Japan, or at least anime makes me think so. Regardless, it was a weird scene, and I just wanted to bring that up because it was bugging me. Yamato was almost kind of likable, unfortunately, just like everyone else in this anime, he ended up being exceptionally flat. When reviewing harem anime, I will commonly bring up my ""3 Types of MCs that can Support Harems"", and this one is no different...The short of it is, that a harem can only function with one of these three types of main characters as the harem lead: Oblivious Idiot - too oblivious to realize feelings, Uninterested in Love - kinda self explanatory, and Harem King MC - actively wants a harem--if you want to see the full explanation you can look at my review on Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai. Since we are in this awkward failed \'main-girl ending\', we are stuck in an extended harem situation which forces Yamato into being an uninterested in love (with anyone other than main girl) MC. Although, he has no problem being a pervert, which is typically harem king personality, this is kind of interesting because it\'s basically exactly how Trinity Seven\'s MC was . Also, Yamato doesn\'t like to be perverted with the thirsty girl because apparently he doesn\'t like it if its too easy, Point is, he\'s a massive masochist.I think that about covers everything I wanted to cover; there\'s a lot of small things, but I tried to cover everything in efficient of a manner as possible. I don\'t typically due this more freestyle format on a review, but I had a lot I wanted to say about why Majikoi just doesn\'t deserve even above a 5 overall score. I\'m not expecting others to come in and change their score, but if you decide to watch it even after reading this review, and you look back at everything I said in this review after watching it, let me know if you think I\'m wrong. Personally, I find this anime offensive to the art of storytelling. a regurgitated version of the countless generic harem anime we\'ve already seen.Art: 3, Harem/Ecchi series thrive on fan service for this hard to be so unappealing is just kind of sad really.

Personally, I find this anime offensive to the art of storytelling.', ""I've always wondered when I would eventually watch an anime that I disliked so much that I couldn't even force myself into finishing even half of it and I finally found it.Story: 1 - This show starts off with this big battle between two high school classes. The battle serves as the introduction of all of the major characters, including the Big Four, the four strongest martial artists in the world that are the best in their specific form of martial arts. This battle should also serve as an introduction to the powers, abilities and limitations or rules that govern the show's world.But...when the opening episode leaves more questions than answers, the new question becomes how long will the show finally explain what the hell is going on.It felt like the show's first episode took place when it's third or fourth episode should have been taking place. Characters were introduced that made no sense and weren't explained as to why they were a part of this world, like a robot that makes popcorn but can also transform and fight, a talking mini pinata that holds the soul of a god that only one other character can talk to and a growing harem that doesn't explain or give the motivations as to why four different female characters have fallen for the main male character.Furthermore, the show doesn't explain what is seen as martial arts in its world. One character is shown using what can only be described as ice and fire magic at the same time and can seemingly punch so hard that All Might could be sued by her for stealing her air punches. When a show doesn't set expectations or show the limitations governing the abilities of its characters, then any tension is gone when you are led to believe that anything can be possible.I hate to compare this show to MHA but My Hero does a great job of setting expectations and limitations for all of its characters. Bakugo mentions that using quirks is similar to using mana in a video game; the more you use it, the less powerful it becomes. So, right there, an explanation of how limiting and imperfect any quirk can be, no matter how powerful, is set. Even All Might's quirk has a limitation so when he is struggling or losing a fight, it becomes more believable. Furthermore, All Might is said to be the strongest hero in the world, but the show only shows in flashbacks what he was at his absolute strongest. So when the show puts him in situations where he is less powerful than he was at his best, then the power level and power creep most shonen eventually encounter is kept to a minimum as it is set that he was the strongest ever, so until new rules and expectations are set, All Might will be seen as the strongest. As a viewer, you know that he is becoming less powerful and needs to try harder as he grows weaker, so you are left to imagine just how powerful All Might was at his peak.Additionally, when a show can't even get me to enjoy its fan service as much as I would like, then that is another red flag that I can't overlook. When you can't even tell what a show's story is going to be about five episodes in, that's an even bigger red flag.Art: 5 - The art style is okay, it isn't bad but it doesn't look as good as a lot of shows that came out even before it. To be honest, it looks like it took its art style from the early 2000's, not the early 2010's. It felt like I was watching something from Cartoon Network, not something that came from across the Pacific. But the characters have enough detail that everyone is different and can be told apart.Sound: 3 - This grade is more for the poor lip syncing of the dub, which is obviously difficult to make perfect but there were plenty of times that not a single word matched with what the character was saying. Additionally, there isn't any memorable music that made me want to look it up on YouTube.Character: 2 - Look towards my description of the story for some details regarding characters but there is plenty more I have to say. The only character who has any understandable motivation for why they act the way they do is Momoyo. She is the strongest martial artist in the world and being that strong has affected the way she perceives people and those who she is attracted to. She doesn't see any male as worthy of her due to her strength so she is bisexual in nature. She is the only reason why this isn't a 1. Furthermore, she loves to fight and takes her frustration and pent up energy on Yamato.Every other character doesn't have any background as to why they are a part of the cast. Why is there is a German female that is living in the same house as the rest of the family? Why is there a popcorn making robot named Cookie? Why is there a talking pinata that only one other character can interact with? Who the hell are the other male side characters cause I couldn't even give you their names if you put a gun to my head? Why are all of these characters living together and why do four different female characters have major feelings towards Yamato? The lack of answers or explanations five episodes in was enough that I couldn't care enough about these characters to keep watching.Enjoyment: 2 - The only reason this is a 2 is because of the fan service and the fact that you get to seen nipples. Everything else just felt like a chore to watch. There was even a seven minute conversation between Yamato and the German female as to why Yamato should be allowed to see her naked where plenty of fan service was involved but the conversation was so boring that I could have cared less about the fan service. Then it ends with Yamato showing his pixelated junk to the camera, where it even flops around and that is when I basically noped out on this show.Overall: 2 -  This is a show that is supposed to be a harem action anime, but when it can't do the harem or action right, then what is left is a lifeless corpse that is relying only on fan service to keep viewers watching. Harem animes are fun to watch because of the girls and seeing which would be the best fit with the main character, but when the main character, Yamato, is already in love with another girl that isn't actually part of the harem, then why even try to make it a harem? That defeats the purpose of a harem as every character is supposed to have a chance to be with Yamato but if his mind is already made up, then any argument over best girl is pointless. Furthermore, besides the first episode, which is one big battle, the rest of the episodes I watched had so little action that even putting them together in one episode would take up five minutes of screen time.Worst anime I've ever watched and you would have to pay me to even consider watching the rest of it. when the opening episode leaves more questions than answers, the new question becomes how long will the show finally explain what the hell is going on.It felt like the show's first episode took place when it's third or fourth episode should have been taking place.

Furthermore, All Might is said to be the strongest hero in the world, but the show only shows in flashbacks what he was at his absolute strongest. So when the show puts him in situations where he is less powerful than he was at his best, then the power level and power creep most shonen eventually encounter is kept to a minimum as it is set that he was the strongest ever, so until new rules and expectations are set, All Might will be seen as the strongest. As a viewer, you know that he is becoming less powerful and needs to try harder as he grows weaker, so you are left to imagine just how powerful All Might was at his peak.Additionally, when a show can't even get me to enjoy its fan service as much as I would like, then that is another red flag that I can't overlook. When you can't even tell what a show's story is going to be about five episodes in, that's an even bigger red flag.Art: 5 - The art style is okay, it isn't bad but it doesn't look as good as a lot of shows that came out even before it. To be honest, it looks like it took its art style from the early 2000's, not the early 2010's. It felt like I was watching something from Cartoon Network, not something that came from across the Pacific. But the characters have enough detail that everyone is different and can be told apart.Sound: 3 - This grade is more for the poor lip syncing of the dub, which is obviously difficult to make perfect but there were plenty of times that not a single word matched with what the character was saying. Additionally, there isn't any memorable music that made me want to look it up on YouTube.Character: 2 - Look towards my description of the story for some details regarding characters but there is plenty more I have to say. The only character who has any understandable motivation for why they act the way they do is Momoyo. She is the strongest martial artist in the world and being that strong has affected the way she perceives people and those who she is attracted to. She doesn't see any male as worthy of her due to her strength so she is bisexual in nature. She is the only reason why this isn't a 1. Furthermore, she loves to fight and takes her frustration and pent up energy on Yamato.Every other character doesn't have any background as to why they are a part of the cast. Why is there is a German female that is living in the same house as the rest of the family? Why is there a popcorn making robot named Cookie? Why is there a talking pinata that only one other character can interact with? Who the hell are the other male side characters cause I couldn't even give you their names if you put a gun to my head? Why are all of these characters living together and why do four different female characters have major feelings towards Yamato? The lack of answers or explanations five episodes in was enough that I couldn't care enough about these characters to keep watching.Enjoyment: 2 - The only reason this is a 2 is because of the fan service and the fact that you get to seen nipples. Everything else just felt like a chore to watch. There was even a seven minute conversation between Yamato and the German female as to why Yamato should be allowed to see her naked where plenty of fan service was involved but the conversation was so boring that I could have cared less about the fan service. Then it ends with Yamato showing his pixelated junk to the camera, where it even flops around and that is when I basically noped out on this show.Overall: 2 -  This is a show that is supposed to be a harem action anime, but when it can't do the harem or action right, then what is left is a lifeless corpse that is relying only on fan service to keep viewers watching. Harem animes are fun to watch because of the girls and seeing which would be the best fit with the main character, but when the main character, Yamato, is already in love with another girl that isn't actually part of the harem, then why even try to make it a harem? That defeats the purpose of a harem as every character is supposed to have a chance to be with Yamato but if his mind is already made up, then any argument over best girl is pointless. Furthermore, besides the first episode, which is one big battle, the rest of the episodes I watched had so little action that even putting them together in one episode would take up five minutes of screen time.Worst anime I've ever watched and you would have to pay me to even consider watching the rest of it."", ""Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai!

The exception is Kokoro because she is perfect.The show is old but has aged fairly well. It is nice to watch visually and I appreciate this.Sound is not too bad. It doesn't stand out greatly in battle but is doable. The voice actors did a great job with the very unique characters we get.Characters are all over the place. It feels like they tried to just dump as many different personalities at the same time just to fill everyone needs.

Nana Maru San Batsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34580/Nana_Maru_San_Batsu,"['Quick review:Do you guys like competitive ""sports?"" Do you get excited about seeing people compete with different ideologies and aspirations? Well look no further, you may or may not find that in Nana Maru San Batsu (which I will now call FFF)! It depends on what kind of taste you have. I personally would compare it to Chihayafuru because the concept of being the fastest in both respective sports is reflexes and finger speed. FFF surprised me with how well executed the journey is and how interesting a quiz bowl could be. I personally wouldn\'t do this at all, but I can see it being...a really competitive thing and that\'s what matters.What FFF does right is constantly developing the main character Koushiyama. Since he is the main character we are following, it is important that he doesn\'t get overshadowed by other characters, who are admittedly plot devices with no real development on their own. It\'s challenging to fit engaging characters throughout the whole run time due to the 12 episode constraint as well as obligatory rule explanations. However, FFF does it to a pretty good degree, putting characters in the limelight here and there and really showing their personalities. Koushiyama is undoubtedly the most developed of the cast, albeit perhaps a little too one dimensional. He has tremendous upside in the quiz bowl because he is a nerd to begin with. So naturally, he is rather decent at Quiz Bowl, but watching him develop into an above average player felt satisfying because the competitors all had more intense motivations and clashing ideologies about the sport. It made for an engaging narrative since there are implications like: do what you love and screw what other people say, move forward, relentlessly etc. It was really impressive for something that doesn\'t have a synopsis that\'d pull much viewers.The animation is okay, it sometimes used it to its advantage and visually show us the inner working of people\'s minds with decent symbolism. Other then that, nothing really stood out to me and the OST is likewise forgettable. Heck, I can\'t remember any track playing.All in all, I came in with no expectations (as i usually do) and finished wanting more. It truly has potential and a longer run time would exponentially improve the development of characters. I really appreciate the passion displayed by these athletes, since I know the feeling of doing something nobody respected.

If you don\'t like quizzes shows, then you immediately will consider Nana Maru San Batsu (Fastest Finger First) as a total waste of time, and the only fastest finger that you will end seeing is yours when you ""change"" for other show.I had been thinking how to rate this anime. Should I evaluate the questions, should I rate the quizzes modules, should I rate the characters? After a lot of thinking, I considered there is nothing to measure here.The story is the typical...""nerd"" with his glasses and every detail (Koshiyama). The destiny gave him the possibility to talk with a group of persons and ended joining the quizzes club from the school because Mari Fukami asked him. Then the story focuses on the game meetings against other schools, where Koshiyama finds a rival (Mikuriya). The climax appears when Koshiyama can\'t press the button faster, the inability to answer a certain group of questions, and when he challenges Mikuriya. So they spend a couple of minutes when Koshiyama starts analyzing the problems and figures a possible answer. That\'s all the story, nothing more. There are some unconcluded parts, for example, Mari\'s brother.The characters are the typical members of a school club with nothing special on them. They are in that club because they like it and will participate in the events because why not? The background of most of the characters they like quizzes, they study them, they need faster fingers, and ¡hey I found a rival!.The art and the music are what I consider standard nothing impressive here and nothing to complain about it.Finally, the characters do a little monologue when they try to figure an answer. It is the same repetition from question to question so you could end tired even if you like quizzes. Will I recommend this show to you? Maybe but you will consider it tedious.

It\'s about quiz bowl which is basically a competitive Jeopardy, with the main focus of answering the questions quickly and correctly.Initially, I was expecting like an average 6 rated show, archetype characters, cliche story and so forth. Well, it turned out to be a lot worse.Story (3). Basically, a nerd joins junior high, during the club ceremonies he is picked to join the ""Quiz Bowl"" team for a display game. ""Now even though he is new to the game, he is extremely...talented and smart because of his lack of friends, he spent all his time in the library"". Also playing with him is his love interest  which is passionate to the game, so you can guess who convinced him to join. The rest of the story can be guessed as any competitive club focused story.Art (7). The art is well done, I only put a 7 since Toei Animation has a thing where they will drop the quality overtime. But for the first 4 episodes, it\'s consistent so no problems there.Sound (5). The OST is barely heard throughout the episodes, which isn\'t bad but it could have improved the general tone and feeling. OP and ED are good enough, however I\'m not counting them towards the score. The voice acting is decent enough, so no major complaints, but there are moments when there is lack of passion.Characters (4). Every single character can be described in 2 sentences or less. They all can be put into a certain sub-group of a major archetype except the minor characters, in which case they don\'t have more than 1 emotion. Basically, its 1 or 2 levels above the average harem series, but still down there.Enjoyment (1). One of my mains points for a non-action oriented show is dialogue, which is complete trash. Characters describing things in the least original way possible. ""cough"" Toei style ""cough"". In later episodes, there is a ton repetition, same thing is said within 2 minutes of each other, then repeated every time something similar is mentioned. If Toei could fix that, then this show would have entered at least a 6 on my scale.Overall (3).Story: ClicheArt: GoodSound: Not noticeableCharacters: BasicEnjoyment: Dialogue completely destroyed it for me. talented and smart because of his lack of friends, he spent all his time in the library"".

The difference in facing victory or defeat may depend on a single second or even less. The adventures of a boy who has the talent, but now needs to apply that talent into competitive quizzing against other people.Fastest finger first was on my ""Meh"" watching list. I was kinda hesistant. But after watching 4 episodes, I probably will continue.One of the things many people talked about regarded the main Female Character and her voice actor. I\'ll be honest, I wasn\'t a big fan of it when I first heard it. Not because it was bad, but because it did not seem...to fit her character enough. However, after watching for a while, I started getting used to it, as I should be. She\'s smart and was responsible for getting Koshiyama into the world of competitive quizzing. But for him to succeed, he needs to learn the basics (which I can\'t even understand cuz im stupid). The anime shows that quizzing is more about being smart, but learning to deconstruct each question, breaking it down so that at the exact syllable, you will be able to immediately know the answer to the question.Thing is, Koshiyama is not very good at answering questions fast. He needs to hear the whole question in order to come up with some sort of answer. This is when all these lessons come in, and he\'s taught the art of buzzing. Hopefully we can get more insight into the basics and see Koshiyama develop into one of the fastest buzzerrs in the series.Theres not much to say after 4 episodes, but I wouldn\'t recommend this to people who want something ""amazing"" or awesome characters or a solid story. But, if you do have the time and you like something along the lines of competitive quizzing, then go ahead and enjoy yourself. It has a pretty nice atmosphere to it, and the character interactions aren\'t that bad.In the end, it\'s all about being fast, and being the first to buzz. to fit her character enough.

French for ""a flash of lightning,"" this chocolate-topped dessert that got its name because it is eaten quickly is called what? The answer would be ""eclair.""  However, for characters of this anime, the moment the consonant cluster ""fl"" for ""flash""  is pronounced,  they have already pressed the buzzer and gotten the correct answer.  Okay, one more. The three great festivals of Kyoto are Gion Festival, Aoi Festival, and what? The correct answer would be ""Jidai Festival,"" and you might have already guessed that once the ""A"" part of ""Aoi"" was spoken, the correct answer...would already have been determined.  Okay, last one. Jumping flea in Hawaiian is the name origin of what instrument? The correct answer would be ""ukulele,"" and some of the best competitors would have already known the answer when the word ""flea"" was spoken.Growing up, I have always been fascinated with random trivia questions from a wide variety of subjects, and even now, if you tell me a totally random trivia fact and ask me ""Did you know?"" questions, I will always, and I mean ALWAYS be interested. So of course, when I found an anime that focuses on trivia quizzes, and leveled it up into an intense competition, it became an instant favorite.Nana Maru San Batsu, or in English, Fastest Fingers First, or to be more accurate, 7 Correct Answers and 3 Mistakes—but I guess that wouldn\'t be a popular title—is a school anime centering on Shiki Koshiyama, a bookworm who somehow finds himself participating in a mini quiz bee competition at his school after being chosen at random. Shiki ends up being able to answer only one question, but that question was actually the hardest one. He gets the attention of his classmate, Mari Fukami, who is an experienced quizzer and was one of the participants that voluntarily joined the same quiz, but was not fast enough to answer that particular question. Seeing his potential, Mari invites Shiki to join the quiz club, where Shiki finds a new hobby in competitive quizzes where his knowledge on difficult topics stemming from his habits as a bookworm will prove to be extremely useful.The story is very niche as I can\'t recall any anime that\'s so focused on academic competitions aside from Baka to Test, but even the premise of that anime is significantly different from Fastest Fingers First, so that\'s beside the point. This distinction alone, I believe, makes this anime\'s story deservedly unique and arguably, there should be more anime like this. Not only that, but it also capitalizes on the brains part of school competitions, which is already rare by itself as these types of anime usually focuses on sports, and by extension, the physical body. This appeals to me especially because I used to take part in these types of competitions all the time when I was in elementary and high school. The feelings of nostalgia make me yearn to be a part of those contests again. Sadly, I can\'t do that as a student anymore, but since I am studying to become a teacher, then I can guide my future students toward the same path, but I digress.One more thing I want to point out is that this anime has that kind of story that is better to be watched again for some reason. It\'s like, I first watched this anime when I was 18 years old, and I rewatched it for the sake of this review, three years later that I\'m now 21. For some reason, the story becomes more appealing as you grow up, so I\'d recommend that you watch this anime, enjoy it, then wait some years after you\'ve gained more worldly knowledge and experiences, then rewatch this anime. Better if you don\'t actively think about it.Now, let\'s talk about the characters. Our main character, Koshiyama, is a fresh look at the so-called ""overpowered main character"" trope. Why do I say he\'s overpowered? His knowledge base alone is the overpowered thing about him, but the nature of the quiz bee suppresses the power his knowledge brings him. If he hears the entire question, he would be amazing, period. But since competitive quiz bees rely on competitors answering questions even before the halfpoint of the questions, even if you know the answer, it would not be so much of an advantage. This quality also makes Koshiyama a fresh look at the so-called ""super rookie"" trope because even though he catches attention later on, the anime still gives us an actual character development that portrays delayed gratification. These two points make Koshiyama a good character who\'s not rushed into glory, but instead, we are given a protagonist who gradually improves, and once again, is a fresh breath of air in this anime period where everyone is overpowered from the get-go.For the next main character, my impressions of Mari Fukami are similar to Going Home Club\'s Sakura Doumyouji. Yes, I also thought that her voice was perfectly average, or in other words, perfectly portraying the average Japanese person in my opinion because that\'s how I feel it even though I do not know what the average is because I am not a Japanese person, to the point that I once thought that the two had the same voice actresses. Similar to Sakura\'s VA\'s situation, Mari\'s VA, Umika Kawashima, only had one role as a main character, before stopping for some reason. As such, I think it\'s a waste for these talents not to be nurtured for them to perfect their craft. I don\'t know if this is the case, but I think that many people would disagree with me and instead call these types of voices bad voice acting. They may have a point, but these voices appeal to me, and once again, and I hope that by some miracle, both Umika Kawashima and Miharu Kobayashi (Sakura Doumyouji\'s VA) or someone with a voice caliber similar to theirs would come again to the voice acting scene once more. Aside from her voice, Mari is also a character I\'d consider good, but sadly, I was busy simping for another character whose name I won\'t say, but I believe you\'d like her the instant you will see her.Lastly, a quick comment on Chisato Mikuriya, who you could treat as the antagonist of the series due to his adeptness not only in knowledge but also in speed. He\'s literally me frfr, in the sense that I also feel a sense of rivalry quite intensely, and I always want to compete with people in terms of academics, knowledge, and things similar to those. My school life would\'ve been complete if I was involved in a rivalry similar to Mikuriya and Koshiyama\'s. Sigh, such a shame.Now, the music, especially the opening theme, because that\'s the one thing that stood out to me—""On My MiND"" by  Mrs. Green Apple. Yes, the same ones who sang Fire Force\'s iconic opening theme, ""Inferno."" It\'s so sad to think that such a different hype to an anime and the time they were released makes this much of a difference. Sure, Fire Force had 15x more audience than Fastest Fingers First, and that means by extension, Inferno has had more reach, and that\'s why it\'s iconic. However, in terms of catchiness, I believe that On My MiND is equally catchy and I hope more people will listen to it.This anime is a dream come true for trivia nerds like me out there. Overall, such an amazing concept: interesting niche, characters with good development, a character who\'s literally me frfr, but not so sluggish on everything else. It focuses on its main premise on point without much derailment, which makes the interest of those watching it constantly glued to what they\'re watching. Now if we can get more people who are interested in quiz bowl to watch this anime, or if we can get people who watch this anime to become interested in quiz bowl, that would be nice.Last question before I end, coming from the French word ""revoir"" which means ""to see again,"" what do you call a long article that is a critical evaluation of something you experienced? Indeed, it is a review. And by that, I say au revoir, and I\'ll see you again soon. would already have been determined.  Okay, last one.

This distinction alone, I believe, makes this anime\'s story deservedly unique and arguably, there should be more anime like this. Not only that, but it also capitalizes on the brains part of school competitions, which is already rare by itself as these types of anime usually focuses on sports, and by extension, the physical body. This appeals to me especially because I used to take part in these types of competitions all the time when I was in elementary and high school. The feelings of nostalgia make me yearn to be a part of those contests again. Sadly, I can\'t do that as a student anymore, but since I am studying to become a teacher, then I can guide my future students toward the same path, but I digress.One more thing I want to point out is that this anime has that kind of story that is better to be watched again for some reason. It\'s like, I first watched this anime when I was 18 years old, and I rewatched it for the sake of this review, three years later that I\'m now 21. For some reason, the story becomes more appealing as you grow up, so I\'d recommend that you watch this anime, enjoy it, then wait some years after you\'ve gained more worldly knowledge and experiences, then rewatch this anime. Better if you don\'t actively think about it.Now, let\'s talk about the characters. Our main character, Koshiyama, is a fresh look at the so-called ""overpowered main character"" trope. Why do I say he\'s overpowered? His knowledge base alone is the overpowered thing about him, but the nature of the quiz bee suppresses the power his knowledge brings him. If he hears the entire question, he would be amazing, period. But since competitive quiz bees rely on competitors answering questions even before the halfpoint of the questions, even if you know the answer, it would not be so much of an advantage. This quality also makes Koshiyama a fresh look at the so-called ""super rookie"" trope because even though he catches attention later on, the anime still gives us an actual character development that portrays delayed gratification. These two points make Koshiyama a good character who\'s not rushed into glory, but instead, we are given a protagonist who gradually improves, and once again, is a fresh breath of air in this anime period where everyone is overpowered from the get-go.For the next main character, my impressions of Mari Fukami are similar to Going Home Club\'s Sakura Doumyouji. Yes, I also thought that her voice was perfectly average, or in other words, perfectly portraying the average Japanese person in my opinion because that\'s how I feel it even though I do not know what the average is because I am not a Japanese person, to the point that I once thought that the two had the same voice actresses. Similar to Sakura\'s VA\'s situation, Mari\'s VA, Umika Kawashima, only had one role as a main character, before stopping for some reason. As such, I think it\'s a waste for these talents not to be nurtured for them to perfect their craft. I don\'t know if this is the case, but I think that many people would disagree with me and instead call these types of voices bad voice acting. They may have a point, but these voices appeal to me, and once again, and I hope that by some miracle, both Umika Kawashima and Miharu Kobayashi (Sakura Doumyouji\'s VA) or someone with a voice caliber similar to theirs would come again to the voice acting scene once more. Aside from her voice, Mari is also a character I\'d consider good, but sadly, I was busy simping for another character whose name I won\'t say, but I believe you\'d like her the instant you will see her.Lastly, a quick comment on Chisato Mikuriya, who you could treat as the antagonist of the series due to his adeptness not only in knowledge but also in speed. He\'s literally me frfr, in the sense that I also feel a sense of rivalry quite intensely, and I always want to compete with people in terms of academics, knowledge, and things similar to those. My school life would\'ve been complete if I was involved in a rivalry similar to Mikuriya and Koshiyama\'s. Sigh, such a shame.Now, the music, especially the opening theme, because that\'s the one thing that stood out to me—""On My MiND"" by  Mrs. Green Apple. Yes, the same ones who sang Fire Force\'s iconic opening theme, ""Inferno."" It\'s so sad to think that such a different hype to an anime and the time they were released makes this much of a difference. Sure, Fire Force had 15x more audience than Fastest Fingers First, and that means by extension, Inferno has had more reach, and that\'s why it\'s iconic. However, in terms of catchiness, I believe that On My MiND is equally catchy and I hope more people will listen to it.This anime is a dream come true for trivia nerds like me out there. Overall, such an amazing concept: interesting niche, characters with good development, a character who\'s literally me frfr, but not so sluggish on everything else. It focuses on its main premise on point without much derailment, which makes the interest of those watching it constantly glued to what they\'re watching. Now if we can get more people who are interested in quiz bowl to watch this anime, or if we can get people who watch this anime to become interested in quiz bowl, that would be nice.Last question before I end, coming from the French word ""revoir"" which means ""to see again,"" what do you call a long article that is a critical evaluation of something you experienced? Indeed, it is a review. And by that, I say au revoir, and I\'ll see you again soon.', ""I personally love the concept of discovering something you love and truly being passionate about it.

To quickly summarize some of my thoughts on the anime, I though the art and animation were average at best, and apart from the amazing opening song, the same thing can be said about the soundtrack.A lot of the characters were either annoying or uninteresting. The way the story is presented, it feels more like a shounen rather than the seinen it actual is. The major positive I can say for the series is that when it got to doing the...quiz scenes the anime became incredibly interesting to watch. Often it feels like I'm playing alongside the characters in the show, trying to guess the answer before they do.

The anime is about Koshiyama, a first-year student who was invited and convinced by Fukami and Sasajima to join the Quiz Study Group where they participate in regular quiz competitions against other schools. The aim of the game is to press the buzzer before anyone else and answer within five seconds. You can press the buzzer at any time, even before the announcer has completed reading out the question.Now this anime isn't for everyone. From a title...like Fastest Finger First and this short synopsis, you are getting exactly was you expected. There's nothing special about this anime. It's exactly as how the anime is described, there are no real surprises. This means that if this sounds like an anime that you won't like, then you probably won't like it and I wouldn't recommend you go out of your way to watch it.The slow introduction of new characters and their unique sets of attributes which are useful to be part of the quiz team is what makes this anime special. Each of the characters have the strengths and weaknesses, but when they combine their strenghts, they become a strong team that are able to help each other depending on what type of question is being asked.The subtle hints of romance between Koshiyama and Fukami is what brings to light to this rather simple concept applied to this anime. It's done not too over dramatically which is pleasing to see.The voice acting is quite refreshing for the characters, especially for Fukami, who is the lead female protagonist. There is some criticism for Kawashima Umika, who voices Fukami because she is not very experienced in voice acting anime characters, but I find her natural voice to be fitting in this anime as voice actors sometimes over-do it and over-dramatise scenes where they are almost unberable to watch to the point where they are cringe worthy.The OP and ED is quite catchy which fits the mood of this quick fast paced game anime.The animation of this anime is passable. There's nothing wrong with it and I some of the character designs are unique. There are some characters who do look the same as other anime characters from other anime but overall, the character designs aren't bad.Overall, I am thoroughly enjoying this anime. I do see reasons why people will not like this anime but for the select few who like a change in pace in anime and see something out of the ordinary, this anime is perfect for that.

Going into it, I though I was probably going to end up dropping it and giving it a 5 or possibly a 6. Though as I watched each episode, I just kept wanting to watch more until I\'d finished all 12 episodes and thoroughly enjoyed it.You might notice a marked difference in reviews on this site between those who watched 4 episodes and declared it to be cliched, and those who actually bothered to watch the whole show before giving it a full review. Not just in term of score, which we\'d expect to...be lower on average among people who dropped it, but even among the comments left by people who gave it low scores, but bothered to actually finish it vs people who didn\'t.The story is very good. In contrast to what some people on this site seem to think, because they only watched a few episodes, this is not the story of some noob high school boy rising to become a star because he\'s just so wonderful. This is actually the story of a shy, nerdy kid making friends and finding something he\'s passionate about that he can actually share with other people, in contrast to most of his life that he\'s spent withdrawing. Whilst he obviously improves at quiz bowl through the series, at the actual game I would say he never even surpasses Mari Fukami, the girl who recruited him in and has some experience. He\'s more overall knowledgable than her, but his style and ability to play the game still need polish even by the end. The quizzing serves as an interesting central theme and provides some really surprisingly tense moments (the stakes are never too high that the MC and his friends can\'t fail) but the MC\'s journey through it is really not the main thrust of the story, the story is fundamentally about his development as a person with the sport of quiz bowl.The primary downside of the story is that there are some loose threads that don\'t really get resolved, and the fact that by the end of it, he\'s really just beginning and it might be nice to see more, but I can\'t blame the anime just because it doesn\'t get renewed. And the reason for the couple of loose threads is obvious, the point of this anime is most likely for promotion of the manga. That being said I think the show ends at a very natural conclusion to a first arc and they don\'t try and cram too much in, or try to stretch out too little too far. The pacing is just right and these ""downsides"" are really very minor points as far as I am concerned, it\'s not like we\'re missing big pieces of information, just little intrigues.The art is very decent. This show clearly didn\'t have a grandiose budget and the art isn\'t always 100% on point, but it looks perfectly nice, there really isn\'t anything that egregious and there are moments where I think the art really shines.The music is probably the weakest part. I\'ll be kind and say the music is... generic, though I\'d go as far as to say that some BGM tracks sound almost ripped off. I don\'t know if it was supposed to be in homage or if they just didn\'t have the budget but a number of tracks sounded suspiciously familiar, especially in their beginnings. That being said, none of the music sounds bad so ultimately I can\'t give this a negative score, the music does the job it\'s supposed to do but nothing overall stands out. A lot of people have a go at Fukami\'s VA. I completely disagree. Whilst I will agree that her inexperience shows and you won\'t get as emotive a performance as you might expect from anime (the VA apparently is more experienced in live action dramas), this actually fits the character extremely well. Fukami is a pretty soft-spoken quiz nerd and the toned down performance absolutely works for her. And her voice sounds really nice, it\'s refreshing to have a high school girl in anime that actually sounds like she\'s experienced puberty at some point. There are only one or two points where I think the VA could have put a little bit more into emoting but overall she sounds absolutely fine. Maybe not as you might EXPECT, but certainly fitting for the character.The characters are my favourite part. They\'re all VERY likeable people. It\'s extremely rare that I actually like the characters in mixed-gender main cast animes. Usually they end up acting like fucking tools and nobody responds appropriately and I end up just hating everyone in it which is why most of my top anime are all-girl main casts, I feel they\'re just written with better dynamics and make way more sense. In this case, everyone is very down to earth and they act normally. Well, with the exception of moments where characters have deliberately exaggerated moments of teenage-boyness. But I could easily imagine knowing these people in a school club in real life. They act like actual human beings.Again people with only 4 episodes watched seem to be under the impression that these are all generic archetype charachters and they know everything they will do. Well most of them are wrong in their specific appraisals. As I said previously, the main boy never becomes some god and doesn\'t even surpass the main girl in skill. He starts off around the level of the otaku who joined because of the cute girl and ends up closer to the skill level of the cute girl. The reason he is main character is because of his POTENTIAL, which people can see because he has a wealth of knowledge from extensive book reading. If he could refine his game some more, which I\'m sure he\'d do if the series was longer, THEN he could be a really great player. Similarly there are predictions of ""love interest"" - Well, there are very minor implications that Fukami might like him but throughout the series they are just friends, with a similar level of relationship as anyone else to anyone else in the club. I\'d also like to say that in the first episode the Main Boy sees the Main Girl\'s panties, because anime (although they never actually show the panty shot which is great because fuck that). Does she hold this as a grudge against him for the rest of the series? No. It causes a couple of moments of embarrassment (in a couple of jokes where he has to push thoughts of them aside) and by the end of the first episode she says ""whatever I\'m over it now come join quiz bowl with me"". You know, like normal people (though fairly uncommon for anime characters).Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not saying these characters will blow your mind with their pure originality and never-before seen character traits, I\'m just saying, there\'s a lot more to them as people than [insert cliche label here], in my opinion. They\'re incredibly likeable and I can really get invested into their journey and their interactions with the other characters around them. Which is what a good character needs to be. This isn\'t even mentioning that 4 episodes isn\'t enough to even meet all the characters, including the spanner in the works.Overall, I really liked this show and I rate it at a solid 8. It\'s definitely something that is worth giving a go, unless you just really hate quizzes. I will repeat, this show probably won\'t blow your mind and be the best thing you\'ve ever seen, but it\'s a very enjoyable and solidly put together show show that deserves a hell of a lot more love than a damn 6.8 MAL score.

The characters are very likable. Although it's about 'quizzes' it isn't boring. It's more about the energy of the competition and the various play styles and the cooperation of the members of the quiz clubs.The main character is a literacy lover, but he will develop furthermore.

However, anime such as this is what truly inspired me to be an anime critic in first place: to shed light for the overlooked, to inspire people to re-consider.The most impressive thing about Nana Maru San Batsu is how it presents quiz as more than entertainment anyone would see on TV. There is art behind all kinds of quiz and somehow, quiz manages to capture popular culture and historical landmarks better than the most viral social media post. Moreover, all the characters come off as unapologetic in their passion (and sometimes, obsession) for quiz.

However, this show still has the potential to set itself apart from the rest, due to the underlying concept of the show: how do you deal with information? The world is full of information and as humans there is a limit to what we can take in and what we leave out. I like how this show tantalizingly explores how an individual's interests can influence how he or she treats the information. If the show had more...episodes, I bet the story would be more engaging to audiences who aren't interested in quiz bowls. Specifically I would like to see more quiet moments of the characters when they are by themselves and what do they feel when they aren't among their friends or competitors. What frustrations do they face and what are their side hobbies? What, other than interest, separates them from people who aren't participating in quiz bowl? What separates the participants from each and what do they share? I want to see the subtle ways their preparedness for the quiz bowls aids in their day to day activities that lie outside participating in the quiz bowl. If this can be accomplished the story can literally go in any direction. The show can still retain its niche as a show about quiz bowls but can even go further with being a show that revolves around the intimate theme of how different people chose to deal with information in different ways depending on what it is to them. Although the show's story, art, sound and characters didn't make a lasting impression on me, I still kept watching to appreciate how close it was to be an intriguing show. episodes, I bet the story would be more engaging to audiences who aren't interested in quiz bowls.

I am so hooked with this show I pretty much have to wait in the wee hours of Wednesdays (SE Asian Time fyi) just to get to the latest episode.Let me start with the thing I least liked: Art (6). It was fairly decent, can tell that the budget was pretty low. Nonetheless it didn\'t fail to at least animate what\'s basic.Character (7). I know that such characters were already a stereotype: faint-hearted main character, a...supportive co-lead, the club president seeing more raw talent, a rival, a playful and dreadsome character, etc. Nonetheless, it was good enough. They were able to complement each other in a sense that it gave some congruence to the story.Sound (8). I know the issues with seiyuu (voice actors) and stuff. It boils to a common denominator as anything else at first glance: budget. However, they were able to fetch some popular seiyuus into the scene, so it might not be the case. They did their job well, I would say. (Nope, I left out my seyuu ships/bias in this rating).Story (9). Being someone who wished he lived his youth in Japan, I found myself yearning for the experience depicted in this anime. I am a big fan of general knowledge quizzes or questions. The story seems to follow yet another stereotypical turn, but nah, that\'s the fault in the manga. Anime is merely an adaptation. I find myself hooked with how such a newbie adjusts and adapts, bringing out what he can.Enjoyment (10). Like what I said in the Story, I liked this anime because I am personally into general knowledge. Each episode is a bunch of suspense and fun, and each week gives me such unbearable impatience. I find myself pressing on the pause button to guess along, trying to test my knowledge.Overall (9). The anime is titled ""Nanamaru Sanbatsu"" and the translation ""Fastest Finger First"" diverted the focus somewhere else (from the goal: ""7 correct, 3 incorrect"" to the basic skill each player needed) and that is crap. But that doesn\'t belong to this score of (9). This score is because I diminish from my attention what is not that important for me, and I focused on what made me enjoy-- what makes me watch this anime in the first place. A lot of popular titles can\'t even make me sustain my focus and end up feel bland, but this one stole my attention. supportive co-lead, the club president seeing more raw talent, a rival, a playful and dreadsome character, etc. Nonetheless, it was good enough.

Entertaining. Elevating.I\'ve had a falling out with anime over the past year. Nothing was interesting. Nothing was new. This show isn\'t necessarily either, but it gives a new dimension to the hackneyed shounen dynamic of an underdog undertaking a new challenge in his life as a matter of circumstance which he found heis surprisingly apt at dealing with.But this show isn\'t just finding itself going through the 12 banal steps of the hero\'s journey like Bleach or Naruto. Such series become trite with repetition. Powers become bigger and larger and we lose the intimacy associated with smaller scale story-telling which ends...up having larger bearings on audiences. This is perhaps why hero stories like Fate-Zero work so well, which expresses character intent, feelings and reasoning through all their past and present experiences. As a sports anime, this show wouldn\'t be good if it didn\'t use repetition as a tool to propel itself into our interest by staying one step ahead of what we\'re able to keep up with. Slightly more on that later.However, I\'m not saying Nana Maru San Batsu comes close to anything of a caliber which I just described. But its niche really shines by incorporating it into an academic-decathlon style that explores the real reason of interest to watch it:rhetoric, syntax and diction. These three things and more all lead into the way language influences our understanding of others when they communicate with us. Therefore, especially being about a quiz bowl, this show addresses how we respond to questions and interpret them. This becomes the main driver of our interest, making us reflect on what we say and how we verbally express ourselves and are consequently interpreted.Think of the sentence ""I walked into a bar with that son of a bitch.""  Then, stress each word in the sentence differently each time you say it to yourself. The meaning will be different each time. This show explores that nuance in speech and interpretation. As  a result, the audience becomes more aware of conversational stresses in words. We become more sensitive to character speech patterns and the way they interact with each other when they communicate, or attempt to.If you\'re not interested in rhetoric, language, etymology, syntax or diction, then you are going to have a bad time. An even worse time if you don\'t know what most of the things I just mentioned are. This show is essentially a game of words=a decathlon called a Quiz Bowl, and characters have to answer questions faster than anyone else. But it takes it to a whole nother level where things start to get a little mindfreaky, and characters have to play a guessing game of what questions might be in full if the buzzers are to be rung before they finish in full.

They launched bunch of weird formats for the game and actually make the most out of them, always exhibiting the interesting and fun mechanics within.They don't rely on spectators from the side narrating how epic our MCs are and how they are improving, neither do they rely on hot OSTs raising the tension. They sucked at those parts! However, there is a lot of effort in the mind games part which is a direct content for viewers to consume. This show doesn't intend to fool you with those shounen sports trope, it is nerdy as it can get. And that is what separates 7O3X from your cliche sports animes.Characters (7/10): Our main characters are slowly developing from one dimensional so it's not as cliche as you presume.I'm surprised Daisuke is actually a main character. This guy was tagged with side flags all over the moment he appeared. Yet he eventually become the most multifaceted character in the show so far, outshining our main... oh wait he is one of the main.To be honest, I like all the characters, but none are seriously my favorite, that's just enough for me.Sound (8/10): Like I said in Story department, they don't rely on OST to pull your feels. They really suck at that. But so far, they manage to suit every atmosphere.The OP and ED are nice though.Art(6.66/10): Nothing. If you want kirakira animation, this show can't give you anything. It's just your average art.Enjoyment (8.5/10): The show is fun regardless of how directionless the plot gets, since it is a quiz show. It stands firm as the quiz animation it is.Overall: I'm giving this show an 8 which is 1 point higher than my actual mark because I believe that it does not deserve to be in the 6 rate class. It should probably be at 7 flat.This show has potential all over. It is not good, but it is good enough. the trash!Wait... this review gives an 8, there's has to be a punchline here. Well, burn in fire you normies!Cliche? Has any of your average moe girls sound so lady-like and actually sound similar to our Fukami? Has any of your seemingly wimpy MCs actually stay the way he is and not burst into a beast owning the world after more than half of the season?Sports-like anime journey is too cliche for you? Well, what the heck do you expect? Should we start from the top as a pro and degrade into a noob?This show does everything right and even better than lots of cliche sports animes that got rated 7 or higher in MAL. So why is it rated 6.9 now? Tngg-dngg!!! I know the answer! Because of normies! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!Story (7/10): Plot moves steadily, firstly introducing our main character in the most cliche way possible! YES! The school opening has a club recruitment event and the quiz club started a game, our MC coincidentally or not, got summoned by the club chairman randomly.And because of his overwhelming talent, he proceeds to rekt the game! (X)And because there's a girl who is a quiz maniac in the game, he couldn't excel in the game. (O)And the rest is what it is, he joined the club and the club aims to conquer the world!Everything IS cliche!Our MC having a special talent in the game, a talented rival, a gril accompanying him, a motivation/passion for the game etc etcAnd that's all to it.It is a cliche storyline.

His backstory is that his mom was a librarian and he\'s spent a lot of time in libraries so he\'s awkward af. He then proceeds to like quiz bowl club and the friends he makes in quiz bowl club. He\'s also the potential to become Jesus-kun at quiz bowl, so it\'s got that going for it I guess. That\'s it. Nothing more than the boiler plate stew of...mediocrity.Art (4/10): Nothing special to see here. Nothing horrible either. It\'s not atrocious. It\'s functional. TBH now that I think about it, there\'s nothing about this show that necessitates the use of animation. I mean, you use animation when you need things to be surreal, or cute, or to exaggerate, or to do this visually unique or impossible to do otherwise. This show is about kids in high school hitting buzzers and answering questions. It\'s animated accordingly.Sound (5/10): The opening and credits music are the best thing about this show, but they\'re nothing special. And the buzzer sounds... I like buzzer sounds I guess. After that, there\'s no great music, no environment sounds, the cast is functional. There\'s nothing bad here... nothing good either. The voice of romantic interest girl though sounds weird though. Not good or bad, but just very non-traditional, which isn\'t by itself a bad thing... it\'s just noticeable and every time she speaks, I notice that her voice is weird.Character (2): Shy Main Character trope meets Romantic Interest Girl in the library on the first day of high school. Romantic Interest Girl falls over Shy Main Character and Shy Main Character sees her panties and develops a crush. This is the launch pad for the ""Will they, won\'t they"" dramatic and emotional friction that\'s supposed to carry us throughout the season.  Romantic Interest Girl figures out Shy\'s smart so she tricks him (sort of) into joining the club cuz she\'s really obsessed with it, and it turns out he likes the club. So we got our leads. Throw in the loud dumb best friend trope, the Super-Senpai trope, a Loli+Bratty sister, and we got our cast. That\'s as deep as this puddle gets.Enjoyment (3): If there\'s any enjoyment to be had here, it\'d be from the actual quizzes. The competitions. The point of quiz bowl is the hear a question, buzz in as fast as possible, then get the right answer. So the real objective is to figure out the least amount of information you need from a question to guess what the question is going to ask, then answer the question. Interesting stuff! Except for the fun of this sport doesn\'t translate well when... translated. 90% of the reason people watch trivia shows like Jeopardy or game shows like Wheel of Fortune is so that you can play along. But with this, you can\'t play along, because you have to read the subtitles instead of listening alongside, and between Japanese sentence structures being different, and the fact that the sentences are being stopped midway through for the characters to answer, you don\'t get to appreciate the game at all. ... So I guess what you\'re left with is watching people react to people getting questions right or wrong... and if you can\'t enjoy the main premise of the quizzes the way you want to, then you gotta hang your hat on the characters, and like I said before, they\'re shallow at best.Also, just as a sidenote, this show does a deep disservice to it\'s female characters by over-sexualizing them. Anime, in general, has this problem overall, but this series really bugged with how they did it. It\'s no Eromanga-sensei at all, but that\'s at least a genre and it\'s done for a specific effect. This show is just plain disrespectful with how lazy and so ready they are to just lump the girls into girlfriend roles or idols to drool over. Our introduction to the main female protagonist has her exposing her panties. The next episode has her explicitly show off her thighs in her skirt. The one time we a group of girls talking without men around, they\'re gaggled around talking about how cute boys are. The loli brat sister type just came into the plot and she\'s introduced as the potential girlfriend for Super-Senpai. It\'s annoying and it\'s lazy and it\'s predictable. I have no moral objections. I drool over women. Just, make it interesting if you\'re going there at all.Overall (3/10): If you\'re an English speaking, subtitle reading anime fan like me, there\'s no enjoyment to watching the quizzes, which is the main draw for this show. There\'s no enjoyment to the characters, the art and production values do nothing the enhance or elevated the experience, and there\'s really no point for this show to exist in this form of media.

However, it just doesn't work. With so little variables in the actual sport of quizzes it's hard to enjoy that aspect of it. Who can push the button first and how to predict the question. Those are the only two things that really effect the quiz. The key to a good sports anime is to have lots of variables, making it unpredictable. This show just can't do that and it's obvious from the start.

I am not usually effected by common tropes but the characters feel like they had zero effort into creating them.Also, the main female character in the show has a horrible voice actress, or at least a bad choice of actress.

It sounds unprofessional, which just adds to the list of things wrong with the show.Overall, it's good that they tried something new, but it just doesn't work.

If you think that this is similar to the Buzz games or that sort of games (like I did) you\'re wrong, this is a really fast competitive quizz game.Still it is a fairly paced story but since this is only 12 episodes long, some matches and development of the characters look a little bit rushed. Yet it is a...simplistic story so you are most likely to watch it without forcing yourself to much.The art for 703X fits perfectly, simple and clean is the words that come to my mind. The characters are well designed, every character is different in some way which helps you distinguish them, but still is not a art that standout.And this being a ""simple"" anime, soundtracks and background music are simple, it fits the anime well but isn\'t something that is memorable or you will listen in the future, except the opening which I think is ""catchy"" but still not above average.And something that i never complain are voice actors/seiyuu, but this was the first anime that broke that. The voice actor for Fumaki Mari, Umika Kawashina, is totally off character. The voice is not bad and it suits the character, but fails so bad in expressing the feelings of the character, like she is happy but the voice looks like she is bored, a total turnoff for this character. But the other voice actors were good.About the characters there isn\'t much to talk, the main focus of this anime is about the quizzes so the characters background stories are not as polish as it should be, leaving the feeling of them being ""bland"". The main protagonist can sometimes give you the idea that he has ""main protagonist power"", so some of the viewers can get a little upset with this.This anime is quite an interesting take on something new which is competitive quizz, and can be a little bit fun since it\'s like a sport anime (kind of).I watched all the episodes as a marathon and i didn\'t force myself to watch, and it had it\'s funny and interesting moments so I enjoyed watching it. Still it\'s not a anime for all, since it can be a little boring at some points between matches.I recommend watching it if you are bored and with nothing to do. simplistic story so you are most likely to watch it without forcing yourself to much.The art for 703X fits perfectly, simple and clean is the words that come to my mind.

Although it does do a decent job of making the subject slightly more interesting by emphasis of quizzes through Quiz Bowl competition, there still feel to be areas that are just lacking.Story: 6The premise is a bit bland but not something I have seen before, give a little praise where due. The story is a bit scattered for my liking with it feeling more like a slice of life that just...happens to involve quizzing than a seinen title. The one strong suite is that the actual competitions are a actually quite interesting however, that could actually largely be attributed to character.Art: 7The art has no outstandingly low points but also few real high points. The characters themselves are fairly average. They aren't displeasing to look at and do have some nice emotion at times. The highest point for the art of the series though is the backgrounds. They're nothing groundbreaking or surreal but the backgrounds themselves are actually very consistent and well drawn. They often go unnoticed but that's not because they are bad by any means, they just feel natural and have good color balancing.Sound: 4Annnnnd here comes one of the bigger issues in the show. The OP/ED for me are forgettable. Not a huge issue but good soundtracks always bring in a bit more of that special something to a series, even if the series sucked the music sticks. The biggest issue though is the character voice acting. As many have noted the voice of Fukami, Mari was definitely annoying at first and took getting used to but that alone can't warrant a score of 4. The issue is simply that the characters don't really feel all that alive at all. The VA is just good enough to portray some excitement and emotion when needed but it still feels forced. (This could partly be due to the slightly lackluster character illustrations as I noted before but I found it more of a sound issue altogether.)Character: 6The characters in the show are simply only moderately interesting. Aside from our MC Koshiyama, the others are interesting enough to keep things interesting but not delve further into them as individuals. The tropes that they fit into are actually perfectly average for what the show wants to accomplish and I see no fault in that. Koshiyama himself is the most interesting character, not as an individual but for his thought process during questions. Originally very straightforward and narrow minded in his approach he is quick to learn, adapting along the way and, thus, becoming more interesting. Him being the reason I mentioned that competitions are actually one of the strong suites of the series. Yet again though there are some glaring negatives. The show is about competitive quizzes but only a few characters really seem to realize or accept this. They also play around with what feels like obvious attempts at romance between Fukami and Koshiyama only to make things awkward, uninteresting and, altogether, annoying. Don't get me wrong I love me some romance but if it's not in your tags at all and is executed this poorly that just makes one cringe.Enjoyment: 7Despite the apparent flaws in the series there is still something in it I find endearing so I put it on the positive side of things. It is by no means a standout series for the season, although for this season that isn't saying much either way, but it does do a decent enough job of just being entertaining. There are some definite moments where you actually feel invested in the series and want to see more. You feel happy for the fun they have with their newfound friends and some nice little comedic bits do come in now and then. (As well as one of the most solid feeling second hand shame moments I have experienced in an anime thus far as well.) All in all it doesn't stand out above others but it can pass the time and be enjoying to simply watch.The only thing that really truly bugs me about the series as a whole though: Is the feeling that it is just a poorly done Chihayafuru. It already had that feel for me from just the first few episodes and the way that her sheet was marked to count question measures by syllable. It only got worse when the anime itself kind of touched on competitive karuta. I do know that it is an entirely different activity but the way that it was all set up and the skillsets needed for both just made the comparison all too blatant for me and if you ever have to compare a series to Chihayafuru that is already a tough series to stand up to.Overall: 6The series is relatively average as a whole with a few beacons of hope that are all but too short to warrant a higher score, thus far. I don't see a way nor find it likely that the show does a 180 and becomes super interesting from the progression of things but if the little things are done right more consistently it could be a solid 7-7.5 by the end of the season. happens to involve quizzing than a seinen title. The one strong suite is that the actual competitions are a actually quite interesting however, that could actually largely be attributed to character.Art: 7The art has no outstandingly low points but also few real high points. The characters themselves are fairly average. They aren't displeasing to look at and do have some nice emotion at times. The highest point for the art of the series though is the backgrounds. They're nothing groundbreaking or surreal but the backgrounds themselves are actually very consistent and well drawn. They often go unnoticed but that's not because they are bad by any means, they just feel natural and have good color balancing.Sound: 4Annnnnd here comes one of the bigger issues in the show. The OP/ED for me are forgettable. Not a huge issue but good soundtracks always bring in a bit more of that special something to a series, even if the series sucked the music sticks. The biggest issue though is the character voice acting. As many have noted the voice of Fukami, Mari was definitely annoying at first and took getting used to but that alone can't warrant a score of 4. The issue is simply that the characters don't really feel all that alive at all. The VA is just good enough to portray some excitement and emotion when needed but it still feels forced. (This could partly be due to the slightly lackluster character illustrations as I noted before but I found it more of a sound issue altogether.)Character: 6The characters in the show are simply only moderately interesting. Aside from our MC Koshiyama, the others are interesting enough to keep things interesting but not delve further into them as individuals. The tropes that they fit into are actually perfectly average for what the show wants to accomplish and I see no fault in that. Koshiyama himself is the most interesting character, not as an individual but for his thought process during questions. Originally very straightforward and narrow minded in his approach he is quick to learn, adapting along the way and, thus, becoming more interesting. Him being the reason I mentioned that competitions are actually one of the strong suites of the series. Yet again though there are some glaring negatives. The show is about competitive quizzes but only a few characters really seem to realize or accept this. They also play around with what feels like obvious attempts at romance between Fukami and Koshiyama only to make things awkward, uninteresting and, altogether, annoying. Don't get me wrong I love me some romance but if it's not in your tags at all and is executed this poorly that just makes one cringe.Enjoyment: 7Despite the apparent flaws in the series there is still something in it I find endearing so I put it on the positive side of things. It is by no means a standout series for the season, although for this season that isn't saying much either way, but it does do a decent enough job of just being entertaining. There are some definite moments where you actually feel invested in the series and want to see more. You feel happy for the fun they have with their newfound friends and some nice little comedic bits do come in now and then. (As well as one of the most solid feeling second hand shame moments I have experienced in an anime thus far as well.) All in all it doesn't stand out above others but it can pass the time and be enjoying to simply watch.The only thing that really truly bugs me about the series as a whole though: Is the feeling that it is just a poorly done Chihayafuru. It already had that feel for me from just the first few episodes and the way that her sheet was marked to count question measures by syllable. It only got worse when the anime itself kind of touched on competitive karuta.

That's it, really. Quiz Bowl is a unique sport that has never been tackled quite so directly as it is here, and thus it earns intrigue from that uniqueness alone.The story is nothing to write home about. It's a classic underdog tale of a young boy overcoming the odds. It's not done particularly badly here, but it's nothing special either. The animation is passable. The characters are much the same. The OST of this show, however, is surprisingly enjoyable. It fits the show quite well, especially during the actual quiz bowls themselves. The...sound effects are on-point as well.

From what relatively little I've seen of this anime and my general knowledge of the sports anime genre, I can tell it won't be going uphill in quality much, if at all. There are many sports anime that do nearly everything this show does much better. If the show were about anything other than quiz bowl, there'd be nothing making it a worthwhile watching.

Domestic na Kanojo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37982/Domestic_na_Kanojo,"['SPOILERS INCLUDED.(I didn\'t read the manga so I can\'t compare manga and anime side-by-side).Will you do it with me, here? - random passing girl, age 16.After this awful experience, I have to confirm my theory: don\'t follow friends\' recommendations. I didn\'t want to watch Domestic na Kanojo, but some guys were saying Wow! It was E-P-I-C, watch it! - and I had time to waste - so in the end I decided to watch it and... what can I say? It was horrible.- PlotThe premise is quite dumb, because Domestic Girlfriend talks about a random girl called Rui who asks a TOTALLY RANDOM boy she...meets, called Natsuo, to have sex... well... okay? He accepts. And Natsuo is in love with his teacher, Hina. Okay. Then, we get to know that Natsuo\'s father is remarrying. Natsuo\'s new stepmother is Hina and Rui\'s mother. Wow! What a coincidence! You may think: ""This is just the original premise. It\'ll probably get better later, don\'t worry!"". But you\'re wrong. Domestic na Kanojo\'s plot is ENTIRELY BUILT on coincidences. Let\'s talk about coincidences in anime.There are cute coincidences, like ""boy accidentally meets girl"" and they don\'t take themselves too seriously. There can be Deus Ex Machina in an event. But this anime is a constant succession of coincidences and Deus Ex Machina! There were points in which Domestic Girlfriends could end! No. The plot forcedly goes forward, episode after episode.Examples during the series- Natsuo\'s new stepsisters are Hina and Rui.- Hina sees Natsuo and Rui while kissing.- Rui sees Natsuo and Hina while doing things.- Natsuo sees Hina while mast-Got it? This series should be taken itself seriously. But it\'s not, because it\'s not believable. It has more fantasy scenes than an isekai anime. And that\'s bad. But HEY! BD/DVDs will have explicit scenes! More actual PLOT!- Art/SoundThe art is actually alright. Not the best ever, but it\'s okay, not bad like some shows this season (mmmmh... Date a Live III is that you?) - so we can say art is one of the best aspects this show has got. The OP is really good. The greatest this season for sure. Too bad it\'s wasted on a series like Domestic na Kanojo... The ED is quite good too.I don\'t get why a sad music was played when Hina was mast----- CharactersI HATE THEM! I HATE THEM ALL! Except Rui, maybeThinking: ""A character who does bad things is not automatically a bad character"" is right. But Domestic Girlfriend\'s characters are awful.Natsuo is a dumbass. He accepts to have sex with Rui while he\'s in love with Hina-sensei. Then he tries to kiss Hina while she\'s sleeping the same day he gets to know that Hina and Rui will be his stepsisters. Seems right, yeah! Then he\'s sad for Kashiwabara Momo\'s story so he hangs out and does things with her, too. He says romantic sentences to Hina and then he kisses Rui. Then he constantly lies to Rui because he wants to go to Hina\'s house. Then he does explicit things with Hina, too! WHAT. THE HECK. IS. THIS. Are you joking? His characterisation? Mmh... let me think... I don\'t know, he\'s just an unfaithful boy. He likes to write books and tales about his love for Hina-sensei... okay.Another thing pisses me off: when a girl sees him while cheating, he asks the girl who saw him betraying her: ""why r u saddd, why are u angryyyy"" - WHAT THE HECK.Then we have HINA SENSEI. The woman Natsuo fell in love with. She has a relationship with a married man. Some days after she left him, she\'s interested to Natsuo again. Wow! It\'s right! When she sees Natsuo and Rui while kissing she is immediately HEARTBROKEN and she decides to move to a new house. BUT... she wants to f- with Natsuo, still! Hey! You\'ve seen YOUR SISTER kissing him last day and then you betray her! What\'s wrong with you! You heartless monster! I hate her and Natsuo a lot.In episode 11 she says: ""Natsuo our relationship should end-"", then, in like T-W-O seconds, she completely CHANGES idea. WHAAAAAA-We have Rui. The only girl on the right side, probably Sure, asking a stranger to have sex for knowledge isn\'t normal, but at least she is kinda faithful to Natsuo and she doesn\'t betray him/go with other guys. She didn\'t know Natsuo was in love with Hina-sensei, so she didn\'t betray her sister\'s confidence while kissing Natsuo by purpose. Natsuo did.We have Momo, a girl who hung out with billions of guys and she\'s infamous for it. Ok. Natsuo was sad so he decided to have sex with her lol. EVERYTHING IS FINE.Minor characters Natsuo, Hina and Rui\'s parents! Wow! They don\'t know their children are constantly cheating!Fumiya! Natsuo\'s friend he doesn\'t care about because Natsuo is too busy on CHEATING.Masaki Kobayashi! A dude who works of a caffé.Ashihara Miu! The president of the Literature Club! We don\'t know much about her, but Natsuo will probably cheat another time, I guess.Other useless characters.- OverallDomestic na Kanojo was painful to watch.

This spiced with some dramatic edgy and lots of sex are basically the best things in life anyway.Our story starts off with the aftermaths of our main bro losing his virginity to some random girl who basically went ""I am so bored I want to bang you"" and then they did. Unfortunately this dude is also in love with (or more like lusts for) his teacher because MILFs. Just so happens to be,...some conveniences play out and give us a basis for a romance drama where our main bro ends up living with both of these girl and... WAIT FOR IT.... Becomes sibling with them, and thereafter has to ask lots of tricky questions from himself like raw or not, old or hot, is this really all they got and why not fuck \'em both a lot. I.e. It\'s a (poetic) love triangle that aims to be realistic (outside its settings that could like never happen ever), offer more ""questionable"" take on the feelings stuff, and spit on the faces of everyone who was expecting something pure.The old teacher person is a great character. Her first 3 lines in the series are literally all stating ""children are off limits"" and then she shows green card for the dude like ""make your eyes less innocent and we do it"". It\'s great, really sums up the mind of a woman in heat. The virginity-taking girl on the other hand seems to have something more going on with her character than the teacher who practically can\'t stop opening up about her bullshit. I.e. old is pushy while the younger girl offers certain level of mystery. I am pretty sure the dude will go with the teacher tho because he is a brick. But nevertheless, his decisions, and how strongly the characters will react to their feelings and more physical stuff is fascinating. I am finding most of it terribly interesting at this point.Don\'t have much to say about the production. The character design is okay, the art and animation feel inconsistent at times but I don\'t really think it matters in a series like this. It doesn\'t do anything too awful and there are like no way to make something like this appear better with higher production values. The opening song was surprising tho, lots of powerful emotions going on with that singing. Pretty much the best op from this season.This is definitely a good series because it has pretty girls and it goes all the way. Basically like all those million different light novel series like Bunny Girl Senpai which are about edgy dude who helps women because he is perfect, except our dude does what all of them would\'ve done if the target audience wasn\'t aged eleven. Everyone in this series is trash so it\'s pretty clear there is a massive audience who will never like it and, while some of the things I stated perhaps sounded ironic, I am unironically liking this series because these type of Kuzu no Honkai/School Days/Nana storylines are much more honest than most romantic pandering anime. It\'s good because it feels like your typical real life shit and everyone fucks up something and is miserable.

But when it reaches the episode 7 it takes...a 180 turn and decides to follow it\'s first episodes and becomes so bad that it becomes good. It\'s like a math formula { f(x) = x^2 + 10x }, as it gradually lowers at one time it would reach a point where it starts increasing, and after -10 it becomes positive and the final result starts increasing, and Domestic Trash has reached so low that it could rival even Evangelion in greatness.What I found the most hilarious about this, is that the person behind the story actually thought that it would create dramatic effect if he used methods that even hentai stopped using after 2016. I have been laughing since I watched the 7th episode, and the whole time I\'ve been writing this. I don\'t know why I ever expected something great of this anime, but my prayers were answered. I don\'t recommend this anime to anyone who actually wants something good, but if you embrace the fact that this is trash you would enjoy it to a new extent you never thought was possible. a 180 turn and decides to follow it\'s first episodes and becomes so bad that it becomes good.

I’ve seen a plethora of romance anime which start off strong with an interesting setting and a likable cast just to throw them into a dumpster fire and follow the old, clichéd way of progressing the story. Domestic Girlfriend, unfortunately falls into the aforementioned category of romance anime.The anime starts off pretty good with two high school students having sexual intercourse and then becoming step-siblings. Sounds like the most complicated hentai, right? Much to my...dismay, that wasn’t the case. The first two episodes are handled pretty thoughtfully, and the characters’ actions are meticulously crafted and make sense when you realise the very awkward situation they’ve been put in. But, by episode three the fact that they became step-siblings after fornicating is pretty much forgotten.Our main trio, Natsuo, Rui and Hina do not really compliment each other well. Interactions between them do not feel candid, instead they feel like forcibly inserted melodrama. Natsuo has a crush on his teacher (Hina) since the beginning of the show but tries to suppress his feelings when they become step-siblings as an intimate relation between them would be immoral; but he puts his brain in abeyance and goes for it anyway. This wouldn’t be an issue if he only tried it once, but he tries it three times and succeeds once and that’s about the only hint of drama I could find in this anime.This show introduces interesting concepts and forgets that it did such a thing. Rui, as we learn in episode 1, has social problems and doesn’t really wants to make friends and such, but in the later episodes, (by later, I mean after 2 episodes), she has no problem whatsoever asking Natsuo’s friend to let her stay the night at his house. Ergo, it invalidates the only thing we know about her. Natsuo gets no characterisation at all other than he wants to be a novelist and that he’s a “nice guy”. The other characters are not really that well fleshed out which is to be expected as we’re only 4 episodes into the series.The music is average af, but goddamn that OP is fire.The animation is pretty good but the character designs are as generic as they get. Also, Natsuo is supposed to be in high school but he looks like he’s in his second year of college. The background art is fantastic though.Well, this anime has been pretty boring till now and, with the exception of episode 1, I was basically dragging myself through it. Episode 4 was a cringe-fest. Still, hope remains as it hasn’t been completely trash. dismay, that wasn’t the case.

Still, hope remains as it hasn’t been completely trash.', ""Have you ever watched an anime and been annoyed at how slow the relationship between characters develops? Sometimes the furthest characters go throughout an entire season of liking each other is hand holding. Well, not with Domestic na Kanojo!!! The very first scene is two of the main characters having sex, almost making me think for a second that I had accidentally stumbled across a hentai. This anime immediately strives to set itself apart from the crowd. It endeavors to be special and throws all sorts of drama at us in the forms of forbidden incestuous love and depressed characters as if attempting to get...us to be impressed by how far it’s willing to go to be extra dramatic and unique. Though alas, it falls far short of the mark. Honestly, I'd much rather watch those imouto anime that everyone else loves to hate on over this crap. Yeah, I said it!I’d also much rather watch characters take 24+ episodes to get to the hand holding stage of their relationship over this show.There isn’t really an overarching narrative so much as a collection of short stories. I say this because the flow of the anime is simply atrocious. Characters would go through one event, such as the arc covering heroine Hina’s relationship problems, only for it to be completely forgotten for several episodes in favor of the protagonist dealing with another issue plaguing a different disturbed girl. And the worst part is that none of the characters ever evolved as people throughout these arcs nor do they learn from their mistakes. None of the scenarios were deep or impactful precisely because hardly anything ever amounted from them. They just seemed like  halfhearted attempts to create romantic tension between the characters, and for me, it just didn’t work.But don’t despair, for there is one bright spot amidst all of the mediocrity.The opening theme song, Kawaki wo Ameku, is so good that it has its own anime entry on this site. And it’s much higher rated than the anime itself. Deservedly so, because the song is amazing! The emotion that the vocalist is able to convey is really special, and is something that, from personal experience in the music industry, is hard to accomplish. So hats off to her. Unfortunately, the rest of the soundtrack is plain, and the anime often decides to play upbeat songs during “emotional” moments that further ruin the authenticity of these scenes. Aside from Hina’s seiyuu, the other voice actors just sound so dull and uninterested. Yes, I get that that’s the point when it comes to Rui, but that doesn’t mean that the other girls have to sound so deadbeat. And Natsuo’s seiyuu isn’t any different, though I guess that perfectly fits with Natsuo’s character.Our protagonist Natsuo is one of the most generic yes men in all of anime. People complain about isekai and harem anime heroes being boring constantly, but at least they can say no from time to time, particularly when anything sexual is involved. This dude just does whatever he’s told with like one exception when he decided not to kiss one of the girls once. *clap clap* And when the anime tries to show that he regrets some of his more immoral decisions, he just goes ahead and repeats them anyway, proving that his growth as a character is still at 0%. Natsou’s incredible blandness and stagnancy is simply astounding. I honestly much prefer his glasses wearing chubby buddy. Like, by a lot.The heroines aren’t much better. By all appearances, Rui is a character that I should have enjoyed. I like both her personality and design, but she unfortunately suffers from being a poorly written character. Her awkwardness, which was her main trait, was completely thrown out the window after a few episodes, and she just doesn’t do much of anything important in the show. You could honestly write her out of the story and replace the sex scene with her with one of the other girls and nothing would change. The only female character who is actually important to the broken narrative is Rui’s sister Hina, who is the definition of a hot mess. Seriously, Hina has a lot of problems, and I’m sure she was written this way to be an interesting and layered character thanks to her flaws. But like everything else, it just doesn’t work. Why? Because she has no merits. Everything she does is immoral, and like everyone else, she never learns from her mistakes and any remorse she’s shown feeling is completely invalidated by her just repeating the same exact mistakes over and over again. Flawed characters who aren’t set up to be antagonists and don’t even receive a shred of redemption or personality just don’t work, and Hina is a prime example of this.There are other girls in the show, but they do absolutely nothing for the anime. I guess they’re simply there for some more love drama and harem-esque themes down the line in the manga. But from the anime alone, they contribute nothing to the story. They look cute though, so that has to count for something, right?My biggest issue with this anime was that I didn’t enjoy watching it. I was pondering what word could perfectly describe my feelings towards Domestic na Kanojo, and the first that came to mind was “cringy”. I was just so uncomfortable while watching it. Now you might be thinking, but isn’t that the point of the anime? Isn’t it designed to cover discomforting material? While that’s true, the reason why I cringed wasn’t because of the material itself, but of how poorly it was all executed in the anime. Characters weren’t deep, just stupid. They never learned from their mistakes and would just make bizarre choices that would often completely go against their established characters. And the scenarios they found themselves in never felt impactful. They were just random spikes of drama that would never actually go anywhere. Shows are meant to be fun to watch, yet with this one…I just couldn’t get into it.Now excuse me as I go and watch OreImo, Eromanga-sensei, and KissXSis, which all do a far better job with the brother x sister relationship thingy than this one. us to be impressed by how far it’s willing to go to be extra dramatic and unique.

Some may believe in it while others pass it off as a superstition. When someone like Natsuo decided to have sex with a girl named Rui, and later became his step sister, is that fate too? It’s too bad since this high school boy has been in love with a teacher named Hina Tachibana and his life got even more complicated when she is his step sibling too. What the hell is wrong with this world?From the way I see it, Domestic Kanojo (also known as Domestic Girlfriend) subscribes to a complicated romance story that feeds off of its drama....The first episode immediately makes us realize that Natsuo is not ready for a serious relationship. He’s pretty much the typical sensitive type of guy who lacks experience with love. Sure, he may have had a one night stand with Rui but what she wanted back then was purely to know what sex is like. Natsuo didn’t feel committed to the relationship either since he’s in love with Hina. Domestic Kanojo is saturated with drama so you should expect plenty of. The most evident is this complicated love triangle between the two main leads – Natsuo, Hina, and Rui.The meeting between the first three characters on screen brings out nothing more awkwardness. It almost felt like a moment of social suicide for Natsuo as he realizes the reality of his situation. But hey, everyone loves a secret right? Well, maybe not Rui. In the most direct way possible, she pretends not to know Natsuo and whispers to him to forget about what happened. Despite this, it seems Rui has developed feelings towards him. The show explores a deep degree of puberty for Natsuo and Rui. Being the younger characters, they try to experience what love is. However, the show also makes it unclear who Natsuo is commiteed to on several occasions. In many episodes, I feel like he uses Rui as a replacement for Hina. In respect, Hina also does show feelings towards Natsuo as the show progresses but a big question remains is “will or will they”? However, both sides of Natsuo’s relationship brings about controversy. Hina is at least 7 years older than him. Rui’s relationship with Natsuo would pretty much be designated as incest considering their circumstances. Like I said before, controversy and Domestic Kanojo belongs in the same sentence.Outside of the main cast, I confess to say the other characters are far less appealing. For instance, Momo is introduced as the nice and friendly ‘girl next door’ type. It doesn’t take long for her to show interest in Natsuo but the show dumps her without much development whatsoever. Natsuo’s friend Alex is introduced later with a goofy personality who manages to make no impact in the story whatsover. The manga expands more on his character but the anime adaptation treats him like a butt monkey. Perhaps the more important supporting cast includes Shuu, a married man who had engaged in an affair with Hina. There’s a plot that involves Natsuo and Rui trying to get Hina to break off their relationship yet she seems reluctant. Indeed, this show has adultery and isn’t shy to express it. The storytelling themes reminds me of modern day telenovela where romance always seems to have consequences.But hey, Domestic Kanojo could make a break for experimenting with love right? After all, the first episode included Natsuo and Rui in a sexual one night stand to experience what it be like. The sad truth is that neither seems satisfied and didn’t grow up from their experience at all. As someone who have read the manga, this 12-episode adaptation can’t even manage to capture the magic of their intimiate scenes. It’s hard to get emotionally invested into any of the main characters when you see how many mistakes they make. While I can say this is relatable to real life relationships, the anime indulges in too much drama. Every episode seems to add drama on top of drama for the sake of….drama. Anyone who is familiar with character relationships in similar dramas can easily see how flawed the characters are. To me, this was nothing less than a guilty pleasure that occasionally bought out some unintentional humor from time to time. By the time I reached the final episodes, I can say it’s pretty much a laughable drama with too many mistakes to fix.Diomeda is a questionable studio to be honest. Even some of their work in recent years (Sky Wizards Academy, Unlimited Fafnir, Fuuka) reminds me of production quality similar to the mid 2000s. You’re not going to find high level visuals or realistic animation here. Instead, you’re going to get fan service shoved down your throat in the form of panty shots, boobs, and in some cases, nudity. (yes, there’s an actual uncensored version out there) The manga isn’t shy with its sexualized content either. But for all its flaws, I give credit due for the incredible opening song (Kawaki wo Ameku) performed by Minami. It’s one of the most well decorated theme songs for a drama anime I've seen in recent years. The melancholy, stylish piano choreography, and character emotion in this song is phenomenal. Similarly, I also give praise for the performance of the two main female leads – Rui and Hina. Despite being flawed characters, their voices expressions reflects their personalities and emotions rather well.Watching Domestic Kanojo wasn’t an easy experience for me even as a manga reader. There are several episodes that made me want to tear my hair out. Relationships in this show is expressed through drama added on top of drama with weak direction. It isn’t one of those fairy tale romances with a happily ever after. No. This is more like a telenovela that’s suited for live action than anime with too much stupidity.

The visuals and animation are consistent and maintain a good quality although it never becomes great or outstanding; the art is probably the worst part of...the show and even then, it's not bad at all. The fucking music is brilliant! One of the best opening sequences and ending sequences of the season thus far with a solid VA cast and a complimenting OST!

The art gets a 7 but the sound gets a 9!Plot/Characters:You read my little synopsis/skit at the beginning of this review; so (just like me) you were expecting a low quality story line that relies on ecchi to keep the viewer invested. However, this is certainly not the case, the show relies heavily on keeping great dramatic tension in this fucked up love triangle, which it succeeds in doing! The plot hasn't blown me away with any major plot twists but it has been consistently intriguing while tackling some mature issues of love, relationships and sex. Furthermore, I really feel as if the MC resembles a lot of people that I know in real life, and this realism makes him more likeable! On top of that, his new sisters are fantastic characters that although they do fit certain archetypes, they are 3 dimensional with problems of their own that you start picking up on as you go through then show! Both the show's plot and characters get an 8/10!Overall:This anime has certainly been a ride; it's been tense and deep, fucked up and funny! But most importantly, surprising! Which is an emotion I love feeling and that is exactly what I received upon watching this. This anime has become one of my favourite anime on Fridays after school to just chill and enjoy watching!

Instead, its primary focus is on the emotional aspects of an awkward circumstance of which the “fated” lovers — Natsuo and Rui — have no say over.  It’s certainly not the type of anime that will appeal to the action-oriented crowd or the numerous romcom enthusiasts (although, there are a handful of comedic moments).  No.  This is the type of anime that offers a...semblance of realism to a medium that all too often strays away from level-headed, unromantic situations, in exchange for chuckles and anticipated endings.  “Happy-endings” certainly have their place among the droves of escapist-consumers, but the flooding of the market in recent years has made its appeal less desirable; hence, why Domestic Girlfriend is a welcomed change of pace.So what exactly separates Domestic Girlfriend from the throng of predetermined, quixotic shows that perpetuate fanciful illusions which rarely come to fruition?  Well, rather than slowly building the eventual relationship between the two “destined” lovers, Domestic Girlfriend showcases a scene in which Natsuo and Rui are seen in a bedroom, after experiencing sex for the first time; yet, their jubilation is noticeably absent.  What is normally considered the pinnacle of consensual relationships, was merely a simple task to be “checked-off” to avoid the embarrassment of being a virgin.But copulation done in haste is never so satisfying, nor is it a substitute for a passion-filled, endearing relationship.  A reality that Natsuo and Rui discover in a most unpleasant manner, as their first kiss is done tentatively, without mutual attraction (as Rui’s affections are not reciprocated by Natsuo).  This is not to say that Natsuo does not enjoy their tender encounters — he is a hormone-driven male, after all — but the connection is never fully established.  Fostering an interesting dynamic in which Rui seeks the endearment of Natsuo, while he has his sights set on Hina.While branching away from the conventions of cookie-cutter plots and defined character archetypes, Domestic Girlfriend does have a myriad of blemishes that prevent if from being a truly great show.  It seems the staff made a concerted effort to blitz the viewer with a multitude of plot twists and jaw-dropping moments when the bungling missteps of Natsuo, Rui, and Hina would have provided sufficient entertainment in its own right.  Episode 8, with the underwear thief, was just one example of stretching the limits of storytelling too far to “conveniently” pose a new conundrum for the two to deal with (i.e. Alex being attracted to Rui — causing Rui to feel neglected by Natsuo).  Literally every episode has one or two moments that resemble the high level drama of a daytime soap opera.  It’s not quite as egregious as the machinations of Days of Our Lives, but there is a certain superficiality about it that cannot be ignored.Furthermore, Domestic Girlfriend suffers from an excess of exposition heavy dialogue.  Upon discovering Natsuo’s secret relationship, Rui provides an elaborate explanation as to why she will harbor ill-feeling towards her step-brother.  Ordinarily, though, when a woman is unhappy with a man, she is not as forthcoming with this sort of sensitive information.  Due to a variety of reasons, women can be rather enigmatic, necessitating the man to figure out the cause of the strife without much guidance.  In this viewer’s opinion, if Rui remained silent with her feelings, it would have placed Natsuo in a difficult, realistic dilemma as to if/when he would attempt to mend fences with his step-sister.In terms of the characters, the main three — Natsuo, Rui, and Hina — are thoroughly fleshed, with a preponderance of unique tendencies that enable the viewer to truly understand/empathize with them.  The rest of the cast, regrettably, are relatively weak.  Masaki Kobayashi, in particular, is generally irksome with an abundance of foolish moments that make the viewer want to slap their face or cover their eyes (dude needs to hit the gym to tighten those flabby butt cheeks).  In fact, many of the secondary and tertiary characters were relegated to the sidelines for the mere purpose of comedic relief from the depressing atmosphere of Natsuo’s relationship troubles.  Yet their various absurdities did not meld well with the intended tone of the series.  Ice cream and steak are both delicious, but they are not the type of foods one mixes together.  Neither should one mix erratic comedy with serious relationship issues.All in all, Domestic Girlfriend is a flawed series that attempts to take itself seriously, but far too often does not commit one-hundred percent of the time (or even ninety percent).  Despite its flaws, however, it has a mesmerizing effect on the viewer, propelling him/her to tune into the next episode to see what happens next.  It’s akin to sipping on a cup of tea.  The taste is somewhat complex, albeit acquired.  The experience is pleasant, but nothing special.  And the character is unique, yet nothing revelatory. semblance of realism to a medium that all too often strays away from level-headed, unromantic situations, in exchange for chuckles and anticipated endings.  “Happy-endings” certainly have their place among the droves of escapist-consumers, but the flooding of the market in recent years has made its appeal less desirable; hence, why Domestic Girlfriend is a welcomed change of pace.So what exactly separates Domestic Girlfriend from the throng of predetermined, quixotic shows that perpetuate fanciful illusions which rarely come to fruition?  Well, rather than slowly building the eventual relationship between the two “destined” lovers, Domestic Girlfriend showcases a scene in which Natsuo and Rui are seen in a bedroom, after experiencing sex for the first time; yet, their jubilation is noticeably absent.  What is normally considered the pinnacle of consensual relationships, was merely a simple task to be “checked-off” to avoid the embarrassment of being a virgin.But copulation done in haste is never so satisfying, nor is it a substitute for a passion-filled, endearing relationship.  A reality that Natsuo and Rui discover in a most unpleasant manner, as their first kiss is done tentatively, without mutual attraction (as Rui’s affections are not reciprocated by Natsuo).  This is not to say that Natsuo does not enjoy their tender encounters — he is a hormone-driven male, after all — but the connection is never fully established.  Fostering an interesting dynamic in which Rui seeks the endearment of Natsuo, while he has his sights set on Hina.While branching away from the conventions of cookie-cutter plots and defined character archetypes, Domestic Girlfriend does have a myriad of blemishes that prevent if from being a truly great show.

Frankly for people to gave this a 3 or lower did a big injustice to this anime, and why not? This was a drama theme anime, and if one thinks that live soap operas were much better than this, then by all means watch it..........Stupid. So my ratings for this anime:Story- Very Good 8: Like I\'ve said this anime doesn\'t follow any cliches story plots, though there were some elements in it, but it doesn\'t contain something that goes...in one direction rather the conflict that exist in Fuji household as two step sisters move in with their mom, because Natsuo\'s dad remarries and hold and behold, the 3 knew each other and in fact have a history with each other,and yes I\'m talking about Natsuo, Hina and Rui , Hina is Natsuo teacher, and Rui is some that the guy had a fling with and from there the conflict and romance begins. But the nice thing was that in the end, Rui ends up with Natsuo, or at least here in the anime, cu\'z in the manga, there were spoilers that points that nobody will end up with somebody.Art- fair 6: For starters there isn\'t any NTR in this anime, and the swimsuit services weren\'t that good. But the usual cliche of them girls wearing the usual eyecandy school uniform is still the mainstay.Sound- Outstanding 10: basically I really hate the seiyuu who did Natsuo\'s voice Yashiro, Taku whom we know who did Asta\'s voice in ""Black Clover"" AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! yeah, that Bakasta. So why such high rating????? Cu\'z that is for the opening theme ""Kawaki wo Ameku "" by Minami.Character-Good 7: Natsuo, I really hate, despite the fact that he and Rui already fucked, the guy still has to play that virgin guy card where he has to act like that she never kissed a girl before , or play this guy who has to be stupid for accidentally seeing a naked girl you know stuffs like that, I mean what kind of fucking did Rui and him did that didn\'t involve any kissing and seeing each other naked... If I would have it my way, I would just screw that virgin guy card and simply make Natsuo have that player attitude where he intentionally sees Rui naked, kisses her and do some lovey dovey thing like that of having a affair and not play that nice dumb guy card where he basically ruins Hina\'s reputation of being a school teacher.Hina, is basically a MILF/ cougar and whore, in my book, she get into an affair with a married man, and who knows, maybe the original creator,Sasuga, Kei,  may have planned to have her meeting different men, but then again she a whore who goes back and forth between Natsuo her tadpole and the married guy whom she fell in love with when she is in high school. Tbh, I\'m really disgusted because she is a kind of woman who somehow like to get into messy relationships and one of it is allowing Natsuo to get into her, to the point that such relationship has gotten them more for what they\'ve bargain for.Rui- If you ask me for such score it was basically for her, cu\'z I kinda feel bad that she could be a good wife material for Natsuo, but unfortunately, spoiler both from the manga and other site info suggest that she\'ll never be with him, too bad, Natsuo is not the type who wants a good wife material , rather he prefers MILF\'s than to his own level.Enjoyment- Very Good 8: Despite the fact that seeing Natuso preferring to go with a MILF like Hina than to Rui disgusts me, I still find this anime very moving. That, as one episode ends, I can\'t wait to what will happen next. Also there is that thing in me where I hope Natsuo will drop Hina for Rui, but in the end Natsuo reluctantly ends up with Rui, in this anime only, for all we know he still has a thing for that MILF/ whore Hina.Overall- Great 9: I don\'t usually go that high, but damn this is a GREAT drama anime, and any body who rates this overall a 3 or below, Screw them!!!!Mijuku mujou saredoUtsukushiku areNo Destiny fusawashiku naiKonnan ja kitto mono tarinaiKurai katattokeba umaku ikuMono, kane, ai, koto, mou jiko kenji akitaDéjà vu nani ga sonna fuman nan da？Sanzan wagamama katattoiteKore ijou hoka ni nani ga iru？Sonna tokoro mo wari to kirai ja naiMou ‘kikiakitan da yo, sono serifu.’Chuuto hanpa dake wa iyaMou iiAa shite kou shite ittetatteAishite dou shite？ iwaretatteAsobi dake nara kantan deShinken koushou muchakucha deOmoi mo shinai omoi kotobaNan do tsukaifurusu no ka？ in one direction rather the conflict that exist in Fuji household as two step sisters move in with their mom, because Natsuo\'s dad remarries and hold and behold, the 3 knew each other and in fact have a history with each other,and yes I\'m talking about Natsuo, Hina and Rui , Hina is Natsuo teacher, and Rui is some that the guy had a fling with and from there the conflict and romance begins.

The series begins by introducing primary male protagonist Natsuo, instantly is it evident to anyone watching that there is absolutely nothing intriguing about Natsuo's characteristics. He has no hobbies, no close friends, no quirks, and absolutely no other ambition in life other than to slide into bed with his Teacher.  Like any other troubled teen who has failed to obtain any recognition from their crush, Natsuo does the next best logical thing, lose your virginity to your crush's biological sister, of course,...that's pure GENIUS!As for the pros of the series, it has a really good Opening, quite well done in my personal opinions, anyway here are the cons:My biggest problem with Domestic na Kanojo is the potential the series had, the groundwork was laid out for implementation of original concepts but was completely and utterly tore apart alongside the introduction of generic substances. For example, Rui, the first episode of the show portrayed her as this gloomy and composed little girl who gave off the impression that she didn't care what others perceived of her. Instead, the series decides to chuck this idea out of the window and constructs this shy, socially awkward and introverted little girl who is a loner at school, the male protagonist breaks her out of her shell and helps her make friends. WOW! This is an original concept that has never been done before! To give you an idea how original this concept is, here are some names from the top of my head; Kuronuma Sawako, Tachibana Mei, Furukawa Nagisa, Tachibana Kanade, Tachibana Rikka, Toudou Kirin, the list goes on. This persona is overdone in romance franchise and any attempt to integrate the same concepts can just immediately be rendered as trash.The series then attempts to drag in several other females into the plot all with the unoriginal, plain and upright boring characteristic. We have the 'girl who has slept with all the guys at school but suddenly takes interest in male protagonist', overdone by the likes of 3D Kanojo. Oh really? she likes the boring male protagonist for his deadass average personality? OH REALLY? It caused jealousy within his love triangle? OH REALLY? The f*cking girl in the library likes him now? OH REALLY? He has to kiss her to help him write a book???? OH REALLY? THIS CAUSED MORE JEALOUSLY AMOUNGST THE LOVE PENTAGON?? Why is the grown ass women allergic to closing the door before touching herself to the thought of a married man??*ahem* To summarise, Domestic na Kanojo is a melodrama that attempts to integrate overdone personas and manfolds of Cliché, in a desperate attempt to leech aspects of past anime series to cluster f*ck predictable elements into a sad sag of sh*t that is it. If you are currently watching the series, I would highly recommend spending your time elsewhere, because the only thing worse than watching Domestic na Kanojo in your spare time is to watch a production attempt to integrated the aspects of Drama into a Harem. that's pure GENIUS!As for the pros of the series, it has a really good Opening, quite well done in my personal opinions, anyway here are the cons:My biggest problem with Domestic na Kanojo is the potential the series had, the groundwork was laid out for implementation of original concepts but was completely and utterly tore apart alongside the introduction of generic substances.

Essentially it could have definitely been done better, but overall it was still compelling. The story is simplistic in manner and easy to understand, with the concept of love and all, but delivers a complex situation that is hard to fix. The pacing of the show is continuous, The ""scenes""...I believe deliver their purpose, and satisfaction, if you know what I mean. The individual elements of the show such as the romance between the characters are very interesting for me. The fan service is definitely way up there, so up that it\'s better to consider it a soft-core hentai, the drama is favorable as well. The ending delivers an acceptable conclusion for me.Art: 8/10Art-wise the anime has a clean style in doing things, clean on the eyes and straight to the point. The mood developed in this show with this style achieve it\'s purpose, and it\'s fitting for the story. Backgrounds are clean as well. In terms of character designs it\'s very appealing, and matches well with their personalities The character\'s are easy to tell apart, but they weren\'t as much unique but rather clean.Sound: 9/10The voice actors for the characters played out well and probably chosen to play that specific voice. The background music played it\'s purpose and is fitting, though it wouldn\'t really catch my attention when replayed. I probably won\'t be listening to the background music anytime soon but the opening and ending songs for the anime is different. The opening song I\'d say is one of the best I have heard so far, I can really feel the emotions of the singer and it makes it as much more intimate as it already is. The ending song is quite emotional as well, but more so for the opening to be especially notable.Character: 8/10The character\'s isn\'t so much as well rounded and isn\'t so much as stupid but their actions are quite questionable, the characters for the most part react realistically, in some parts not so much. I related in some things with the main character, but other than that I don\'t , but It was very interesting to me and compelled to see what they are going through. There isn\'t much character development in the anime, but I don\'t see it as much as a problem, but it definitely could have been better if there was. The anime focused quite mainly on the main character and the two female leads, with some supporting cast given some background. The supporting cast played their purpose for the most part, I didn\'t really like Hina and her judgement so I go for Rui. The author probably has the intention for making Hina that way being restricted by society and it\'s problems. In the future I probably would remember them because they gave out quite an impression.Enjoyment: 8/10The majority of people probably dislike this series because of it\'s lacks of depth and personal development and mediocrity, non-anime fans and new people in the anime community or people who doesn\'t mind such things will probably enjoy this series or be fine with it, I\'d probably re-watch some specific episodes for those ""scenes"" but I am interested in reading the manga for those ""scenes"" and probably more in-depth than it\'s anime counterpart. I\'d like to own this series if I could. The series isn\'t really that memorable, there wasn\'t really anything unique that i\'d probably forget it within a few weeks, but as much of how everything seemed to be not anything special. The anime was still able to play it out in a way that I was still looking forward for the next episode, just to see how it would play out.Though I really think everything would have been much better if it were to be just a hentai show.

Let's look at DomeKano from a new perspective.I hope that you, the potential viewer, who hasn’t written DomeKano off as trash, who hasn’t let the appalling state of MAL reviews affect you, will take some time to read what I have to say.Before we know it, it becomes evident for us that as humans, we better find ourselves in love with another, traditionally from the “opposite” gender. This love is supposed to be qualitatively different from all other kinds of love that we either receive, give, or partake in. For instance, this love cannot...be an infatuation, cannot be driven solely by lust, and hopefully(?) must have to do with a connection, of the ethereal kind. And when you do find yourself engaged in such a “romantic” relationship, do not hesitate to tie the knot and create a new family. But hey, how is this love different from the one between you and your parents/siblings/relatives? And why is it different? Why were you searching for a different love in the first place? Wait, do you even love anyone?At its core, DomeKano is an anime that brings to light, the status of human relationships today by aggressively challenging the many social norms that most of us have come to accept as “natural”. But note that DomeKano does not intend to be a seinen anime that one-sidedly uses itself to make a case for its ideology. DomeKano is very visibly, a romance-drama, very much like KimiKiss and Y.Natsuo in as aspiring novelist who has had feelings for Tachibana Hina, who is a teacher at his school. Offhand, his countenance belies his meek and empathetic demeanor. Telling himself that his longings will never be reciprocated, Natsuo ends up having sex with the intriguing and socially awkward Tachibana Rui, after a mixer. So he is genuinely surprised when his father tells him that he’s about to marry Tachibana Tsukiko, who happens to be the mother of Hina and Rui! With time, we see that Natsuo is a very sensitive character who is not afraid to support others and that the socially awkward Rui is adorably sincere in her ways and has a strong sense of agency that leads her to assert her emotions proactively.The characters in DomeKano do not shy away from communicating via physical contact - something that generic romance anime seem to decorate as a trophy, to be received at the culmination of invisible exchanges, strenuous inter-personal issues and maybe a couple of heartbreaks. There is however, NO fanservice in DomeKano.With a stellar voice-acting cast and a gorgeous OP, the production team displays its sincere attitude towards the material by valuing character animation and composition.  Do not expect something of “Yesterday wo Utatte” level here. But nevertheless, Ide Naomi, together with Ihata Shouta, has done a splendid job with the opening and character design. Maho Takahashi is responsible for the intricately detailed backgrounds and the general maroonish-pink shades that give DomeKano its mood - erotic, dramatic, melancholic and inviting coming of age.Having said all that, DomeKano is not without its faults! The drama it uses is often outlandish and leads to developments that are fairly easily anticipated. Not much attention is given to supporting characters and the whole idea of following the pursuits of an aspiring artist is nothing new when at the end of the day, it is only used minimally to emulate mixed feelings at the coexistence of sorrow and creative processes.Yet, the anime makes you ask, what is a family? Why is something socially forbidden? And through the anarchy of its characters, we realize how many things around us are not just social constructs, but also serve the bizarre purpose of controlling individuals and their desires. be an infatuation, cannot be driven solely by lust, and hopefully(?) must have to do with a connection, of the ethereal kind.

Not much attention is given to supporting characters and the whole idea of following the pursuits of an aspiring artist is nothing new when at the end of the day, it is only used minimally to emulate mixed feelings at the coexistence of sorrow and creative processes.Yet, the anime makes you ask, what is a family? Why is something socially forbidden? And through the anarchy of its characters, we realize how many things around us are not just social constructs, but also serve the bizarre purpose of controlling individuals and their desires."", 'This anime is intriguing.On one side, we have a beautiful young teacher, whom the main character is in love with. On the other side, we have a cute, kind teen, who had sex with the main character. Now, which one will he choose?At first glance, this seems like a clichè plot since it looks like a harem with a dumb main character. However, you are wrong.

Sure, I'll admit that this definitely wasn't one of the best I've watched so far, but some of the comments are just too much. As for the series, if you're into unrequited love, I'll definitely recommend it. And yes, it is on the border of incest as well. This series doesn't follow the stereotypical romance anime plot. This is gonna be more true to life than you can imagine. The protagonist is a person who is not perfect by any means....He constantly makes stupid decisions that are frustrating. But that's the point of the series. In real life, you're not always going to make the right decisions. That is especially true if strong emotions of unrequited love are involved. Not to mention the fact that he does whatever they can to avoid hurting his step sisters. But at the same time he can't keep his feelings in check. Soon you'll be experiencing a plot where the characters constantly make stupid decisions based on human emotions, impulse and more often face the consequences. There are genuine moments of human connections throughout the plot. It also shows how powerful human emotions can be. It's a constant roller coaster of emotions. There are flaws and issues, like most series, but they are easy to ignore. Calling it garbage or trash just because the plot isn't to your liking is just acting like a spoiled brat. It's really easy to sit back, relax and bash other people's work.  Personally i feel that not all the series that come out are for everyone. Different people have different tastes. Just because it isn't to your liking doesn't mean you should act all spoiled and just take a dump on it. It really is easy to just avoid it instead of ranting about it, so that sensible people can write proper reviews about it. And even if you feel the need to write about it, there are better ways of doing it rather than acting like a kid and whining about it.

I haven't actually read it, so I can't say how it compares, but personally, I believe the anime shouldn't be judged alongside the manga, as they're different products despite sharing the same story.I enjoyed the anime; it's entertaining, and while there are moments where you might dislike certain characters and some interactions don't feel very organic, overall it's quite acceptable (especially compared to the generic trash that comes out year after year). At least it stays true to the characters' personalities.The soundtrack is good, both the external...(opening and ending) and internal, fitting well with the anime and conveying what's being shown. The use of licensed songs at certain relevant moments is a huge plus.In conclusion, the anime is fine; the characters are memorable, and the drama holds up.

I also liked one of the OSTs but i don't remember what episode it was in. Other then that i would say that the sound design was fine with the exception of when the characters open doors as every time i heard it i just thought of the sound when you open a door in Minecraft.-Character-The characters all have their own unique traits and notable features ,even the sisters, which range from the standard things such as hair colour or personality types again i would say that there wasn't anything particularly special when you compare domestic girlfriend to another show in the same of genre with the same demographic.-Enjoyment-I can honestly not say i have not enjoyed watching every second of this show as it reminds me of the time when i was watching hunter x hunter as there was not a single moment of that show i disliked watching and to be honest i would say that there are very few shows which have given me this level of personal enjoyment and i honestly cannot wait for more of this show to air as it is just one huge dumpster fire of a show which i cannot leave alone.Overall i would say give this show a watch as whats he worst that will happen you watch 3 episodes and realise that this show isn't for you and then drop it but personally i feel like even if you are on the fence about this show being decent then just watch it and find out as i know that not everyone will enjoy a show like this because of the type of anime it is. it may be a bit exaggerated compared to what would actually happen if this were to happen in real life.Now for my opinions on the structure of the anime.-Story-To be honest the story is not garbage but it feels extremely exaggerated ,but it doesn't feel forced like some shows which draws me in as the story just flows and i don't know how to put it in words but it just works it doesn't feel like the 1st half of the 2nd part of tokyo ghoul RE as to me those episodes felt less related then adventure time and i can say for a FACT that domestic girlfriend does not do this each episode feels like you are picking up from where you left off.-Art-The art is what you most likely call standard for a show that comes out in recent times its nothing special but that doesn't mean that it is bad as its anything from that its not unique but then it doesn't try to be unique so i don't personally have a problem with it.-Sound-Let me start this section by saying the OP is an absolute banger and if you haven't listened to it then i would absolutely as it is personally is a song that i listen to now and i usually just play the same 34 songs on repeat but it may not suit your taste.

Well let\'s see the last names\' of all three of these characters.Hina TachibanaRui TachibanaTsukiko TachibanaOHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOOOOOO...Yep, this show is about stone-cold incest and parents so clueless that it should win them both an Oscar. And if that wasn\'t bad enough, let\'s get into the flaws of this nuclear wasteland that some people actually call ""entertainment"".Other than the god awful plot, there is really just three main problems.NatsuoLopsidednessHinaNatsuo Fujii is the worst main character I have ever seen. This man is an utter piece of garbage, he knows that, he doesn\'t careabout that, his character design is as generic as can be, and his personality is so bad words can\'t even describe it. Let\'s see, Natsuo is boring, clueless, lustful, annoying, bitchy, a dumbass, and an asshole. That\'s all I gotta say bout him, there are literally no pros to this scumbag. It should be obvious why he\'s my personal least favorite character of all-time.Lopsidedness may be an understatement. As if this show couldn\'t get any worse, it does. Even though Rui is a complete suck-up (calling her a simp would be an understatement) to Natsuo in every manner and is the most loyal chick on the planet (who also has the worst taste), Natsuo treats her like a tool and a sandwich maker, and nothing else. Rui is literally one of the only reasons this show was slightly tolerable, yet she gets used like a maid without pay. INSTEAD, scumbag sucks-up to his TEACHER, yes, TEACHER, Hina, even though there is literally nothing special about her and he has zero reason to what actually makes her so special other than ""he he, she\'s hot"". Due to this lackluster decision by Natsuo, Rui get\'s treated like a punching bag for the rest of show (I mean ALL OF IT), while Natsuo continues to show off to the world why he is the scumiest man alive, and continues to simp like a loyal Pokimane donor after his, again, T E A C H E R (and stepsister I should add again). Natsuo would literally cut off his pp with a saw and sell his liver to the black market just to be with this uninspired slut (which she actually is, I\'m not just trying to be offensive).Hina. Man, Hina. Not only is Natsuo my least favorite character of all-time, Hina is one of my least favorite female characters of all-time. Yes, Hina is the textbook definition of a slut. Not only does she scold Rui for trying to make moves on Natsuo, while also making advances on him herself, she is also HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A MARRIED MAN. Yeah, I rest my case.Now period, Natsuo should just move on and find someone outside his family to date like a normal human being, but remember this was written by a even bigger lust-filled idiot than Natsuo himself, so that option has been off the table for a while because in the words of Rui Tachibana, herself:""It\'s not like we\'re related by blood or anything"".This show isn\'t just appalling because of the plot, it\'s also just a horrible romance, drama, and comedy. Even if you removed the god awful incest element, you would still get a horrid show that doesn\'t know what it is and strives off it\'s shock factor-filled plot.Mom, Dad, I am so sorry I watched this, please forgive my year younger self. I\'ve learned not to watch stuff like this anymore.Should you watch this? Absolutely not.Bye.

Then Natsuo\'s dad announces that he is getting remarried to a woman named Tsukiko. Why specifically these three names? Well let\'s see the last names\' of all three of these characters.Hina TachibanaRui TachibanaTsukiko TachibanaOHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOOOOOO...Yep, this show is about stone-cold incest and parents so clueless that it should win them both an Oscar. And if that wasn\'t bad enough, let\'s get into the flaws of this nuclear wasteland that some people actually call ""entertainment"".Other than the god awful plot, there is really just three main problems.NatsuoLopsidednessHinaNatsuo Fujii is the worst main character I have ever seen. This man is an utter piece of garbage, he knows that, he doesn\'t careabout that, his character design is as generic as can be, and his personality is so bad words can\'t even describe it. Let\'s see, Natsuo is boring, clueless, lustful, annoying, bitchy, a dumbass, and an asshole. That\'s all I gotta say bout him, there are literally no pros to this scumbag. It should be obvious why he\'s my personal least favorite character of all-time.Lopsidedness may be an understatement. As if this show couldn\'t get any worse, it does. Even though Rui is a complete suck-up (calling her a simp would be an understatement) to Natsuo in every manner and is the most loyal chick on the planet (who also has the worst taste), Natsuo treats her like a tool and a sandwich maker, and nothing else. Rui is literally one of the only reasons this show was slightly tolerable, yet she gets used like a maid without pay. INSTEAD, scumbag sucks-up to his TEACHER, yes, TEACHER, Hina, even though there is literally nothing special about her and he has zero reason to what actually makes her so special other than ""he he, she\'s hot"". Due to this lackluster decision by Natsuo, Rui get\'s treated like a punching bag for the rest of show (I mean ALL OF IT), while Natsuo continues to show off to the world why he is the scumiest man alive, and continues to simp like a loyal Pokimane donor after his, again, T E A C H E R (and stepsister I should add again). Natsuo would literally cut off his pp with a saw and sell his liver to the black market just to be with this uninspired slut (which she actually is, I\'m not just trying to be offensive).Hina. Man, Hina. Not only is Natsuo my least favorite character of all-time, Hina is one of my least favorite female characters of all-time. Yes, Hina is the textbook definition of a slut. Not only does she scold Rui for trying to make moves on Natsuo, while also making advances on him herself, she is also HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A MARRIED MAN. Yeah, I rest my case.Now period, Natsuo should just move on and find someone outside his family to date like a normal human being, but remember this was written by a even bigger lust-filled idiot than Natsuo himself, so that option has been off the table for a while because in the words of Rui Tachibana, herself:""It\'s not like we\'re related by blood or anything"".This show isn\'t just appalling because of the plot, it\'s also just a horrible romance, drama, and comedy. Even if you removed the god awful incest element, you would still get a horrid show that doesn\'t know what it is and strives off it\'s shock factor-filled plot.Mom, Dad, I am so sorry I watched this, please forgive my year younger self. I\'ve learned not to watch stuff like this anymore.Should you watch this? Absolutely not.Bye.', ""Look, I'm not like some reviewers here on this website that write a whole ass essay.

Took me 5 months to move...on with this anime, I really wished Hina ended up with our MC because they both loved each other, it was hinted in earlier episode that Hina do have feelings for our MC, now that it is mutual It should\'ve been a happy ending, also Hina need someone to make her happy because of all her past experience, she deserve the love of our MC. on with this anime, I really wished Hina ended up with our MC because they both loved each other, it was hinted in earlier episode that Hina do have feelings for our MC, now that it is mutual It should\'ve been a happy ending, also Hina need someone to make her happy because of all her past experience, she deserve the love of our MC.', ""OK, the meaning of the title of Anime is Domestic= family relation, Kanojo i.e. Girlfriend.First of all i don't want to degrade a writer's story i.e. this Anime, but i would like to say that he's just complicating the story more & more.Story starts with a very nostalgic way of a hentai, with this I've no problem as this was a good concept to adapt, but problem starts when it gets super complicated. For me Complicacy is good for mystery related Anime, a little bit of complicacy is tolerable & can be added to a romance story, but when complicacy meter crosses that tolerable level,...i can't tolerate it. But still ignoring those facts i respect someone's work, that's why i still give chance to those work.Well, the main thing i don't like about main character is that he's selfish, he does what he like he fucks, he kisses his teacher's sister just to forget about his first love, this continues even after they become siblings , even though he loves his teacher, OK this is not bad, i have no problem with this.but problem starts when he goes for his teacher too, becomes jealous of other men. And at the end goes for his teacher. I've no problem with that, if counting on a big scale but still there are problemsbut the problem is he doesn't stop the kissing between him & his teacher's sister, there are many problems at this point, writer just wants to f*ck the story that is it, but still if you think you you can survive this point, no problem.Point comes where the lil sister comes to know about their relationship (her sister & the protagonist).She stops kissing him, after that, becomes distant from those two.& he goes for the teacher.The main problem i think this story has is the protagonist, he can be a 2- timer, but becomes silent when the point comes to handle both of them. At this point the protagonist had chance of having those 2 at the same time, just by using some words, after all wants to be a novelist. And he abandons the relationship with lil sister.According to me, he's just half ass character just like a scum from a hentai who goes after the heroine, & if she's not available then going after someone, & if the heroine becomes available after that he abandons the girl that he'd gone after. And then what about that girl, she's just in sidekick. This is not manly. But he thinks he's a man, which is lie as from my sideBut one thing can happen, which is an advise from me to the author of this story, is that- the teacher dies & the girl & the protagonist becomes closer after some hurdles & then You know what i mean. i can't tolerate it.

Where should I start?Well I had very high expectations for this anime, as i put it on my PTW as soon as it was put on MAL. Unfortunately this anime doesn\'t meet them.I will start with the story. I won\'t be explaining it in this review, because you can easily read the synopsis on this anime page. The story is certainly interesting but fails to deliver through bad pacing and mediocre drama. In episode 3, which was drama-heavy, I just started laughing 3 minutes in. It\'s just not convincing enough. Thats why it gets a 6/10 in terms of writing.But to...be fair, that\'s not because of the story in itself but because of the characters: I will start with the two main girls. The younger one, Rui, is a typical Dandere, so nothing surprising on that side. His teacher, Hina, is a bit better, but her character almost solely consists of ""I am a teacher so I need to be a role model for MC-kun"". That\'s just ... plain bad. Sorry but I can\'t take these two seriously. Now for our protagonist, well how should I put it. He is the most complex character of the three but that\'s almost certainly not an achievement. I don\'t think he\'s likeable at all but at least I didn\'t hate him. So he gets a pass, for now though. I really hope there\'s some character development in this show. For now, the characters are a 4/10.On the other hand, the animation and the drawing style in general is quite likeable and refreshing from the usual mainstream drawing styles which were established years ago. There is some lazyness in the animation as there are some ""moving pictures"" as I would call them but overall together with the drawing, it gets a 7/10 from me.Now to the best part of the anime, the sound. The background music stands out in a positive way and it\'s really refreshing to finally being able to say something positive about this show. The music fits the themes and it\'s in just the right volume. So it gets a 8/10 from me.But as you can guess, my overall enjoyment is a 4/10 which brings this show to a final verdict of a 5/10 (for now).I am honestly maybe a bit too harsh, but it\'s really hard for me to enjoy this show and that\'s why I can\'t rate it higher.

Sorry guys', ""Honestly, I feel most people who dislike this anime as much as they do just cannot relate to the type of romantic struggles the characters are going through. I would not recommend it to the younger audience if they do not have the empathy to watch it unbiased. It's honestly a really good adult anime, and you can tell the author of the manga expressed herself through the story.I've watched a lot of romance anime and it's one of the more mature, down to earth adult romance anime series I've come across. There are numerous times where somebody said something or made a choice I...felt was extremely mature and unlike other conversations in other anime. Do you have the awareness to stop a kiss when you sense they are uncomfortable? Or step away when dependency is occurring rather than romance?The symbolism and topics here are deeper than RomCom anime, and the choices made are meant to be hard, and maybe not make sense to some (but love doesn't always make sense, does it?)Do you make the realistic, long-term choice even if it leads to sadness? Or do you opt to accept how things are to enjoy a moment of happiness even if it isn't realistic..

It’s a 10 because it’s a 1. It throws rating convention out the window. It sacrifices everything that makes a normal show good for raw entertainment value. It’s an unmitigated disaster in the best possible way. Everyone parrots Gigguk and calls it a dumpster fire, but let’s be clear, here - Franxx is a dumpster fire. This is a dumpster conflagration, a blaze so large and so bright that it somehow becomes beautiful again. If you inhale just deeply enough, really allowing the fumes to fill your lungs – trust me, you can get a pretty good high off...this thing.There are a great number of criticisms, both superficial and reasonable, that you can levy against it. Almost every single decision the protagonist makes is the wrong one. All of the characters, really, do things that defy explanation. The twists and turns are wild. You HAVE to have a sense of humor – It’s so excruciatingly messy that if you don’t laugh, you’ll just be uncomfortable. Your level of satisfaction will be 100% based on the mindset you enter it with. If you hold the story accountable for how utterly nonsensical it is, yeah, you’re not gonna enjoy it. If you choose to simply accept the experience and see where it takes you, you might. There’s no 'right' answer, but the second way is a hell of a lot more fun.Oh yeah, and the OP actually slaps. Easily in my top 3 of all time.I don’t mean to imply that the only possible way to enjoy this is ironically – there are plenty of people who like it for what it is. Though I was choking on laughter the entire time, even I found that by the end, I was at least on some level inexplicably invested in the plot and wanted to know just how high this fire could go. If you end up thinking the same, then know the manga has a lot more in store for you. It's...not exactly happy, you'll have to prepare for some gut punches. But the characters are given far more depth, the art is great, and it's much better written. Probably owing to its female authorship, it’s not at all pure smut; it’s legitimately trying to take a nuanced approach to the conflict between these characters’ incredibly awkward circumstances and the messy, confusing feelings that they don't know how to suppress. Thanks to its proper pacing, it succeeds in this regard much more than the anime. I still don’t quite understand how the manga manages to evolve past its ludicrous premise into something that ends up telling such a genuinely compelling human story, but it honestly does. There are some real highs and lows here, with moments that lingered in my mind for days after I was finished. Even though it's still occasionally trashy and melodramatic, that's...kinda just part of its charm. It's worth noting that almost everyone hates the ending, but overall, it's unironically pretty damn good and worth your consideration if you’re looking for more after episode 12. (#TeamHina)Anyway.

But if you have a sense of humor, an appreciation for absurdity, and a healthy relationship with your morals, I can't recommend this enough.

Not in the sense that any aspect of it is particularly arcane of difficult to understand, but in the sense that I’m not sure how anyone looked at the complete set of choices that went into writing this story and adapting it for animation and thought “Yeah, this is the best possible direction to go in.” It’s a show with a horribly mangled sense of self, a steamy, smutty piece of junky melodrama being forced into the mold of a contemplative, lofty ""art house” piece for no discernible...reason. I have no idea what possessed the production team to adapt this story in a way so fundamentally at odds with itself, but I do know that the end result is a potentially interesting story wasted on one of the most dull, wrong-headed productions in recent memory. How people can call this wet blanket of a show “spicy” makes no sense to me. Devilman Crybaby was spicy; this barely registers at bell pepper levels on the Scoville Scale.At the very least, Domestic Girlfriend is spicy in concept: a guy loses his virginity to a girl he’s just met despite having a crush on his teacher, only to find out that thanks to his dad’s unexpected remarriage, both the girl he slept with and the teacher he’s in love with are now his step-sisters. It’s a situation straight out of a hentai, only with an admirable grounding in more realistic human interaction. There’s a welcome attention to detail in the writing that plays fair with everyone’s various emotional complexes and does a decent job keeping them all balanced. Sex is treated with a degree of nuance and respect, with the characters able to fumble their way decently around an erotic situation without descending into dysfunctional piles of hormones like so many other anime characters. It’s still smut, to be sure, with no shortage of scenes of walking in on someone naked and tantalizing trysts, but it’s smut with a brain in its head. And had Domestic Girlfriend been willing to capitalize more on its sleazy-but-smart aspects, I think it could have made for a uniquely compelling piece of indulgent fun.Unfortunately, someone somewhere in the production team decided that for whatever reason, this kind of story would be best treated as a Serious Adult Drama(tm) that people should watch with a glass of their most expensive wine in hand. So instead of cleverly entertaining erotic scenarios, everything is instead sanded down and trussed up in its best expensive tuxedo, all morose piano music and dull, underplayed performances. It feels like it’s trying to capture the same sense of reality that Rakugo Shinju was aiming for, which is possibly the worst fit for this material I could imagine. This is a show in which the main character at one point must shove a suppository up his sister’s ass in a one-off beat that never comes up again, and the discordance between moments like that and its sub-Oscar-Bait presentation make it feel like someone spliced a porno into Midnight in Paris and tried to present that freakish amalgamation as a complete product. And then it can’t even do the self-seriousness right; the entire production is so soul-deadeningly boring from start to finish. It’s not so much janky as it is nonexistent, with only the most standard and unpurposeful of camera and editing techniques used. There’s no energy to any scene, no good animation to speak of, no interesting direction, the blandest possible background art, and it all ends up feeling so... empty. Not empty in a purposeful way, but empty like a blank piece of paper that got drenched in the rain and is currently floppy and squishy like pulp.And it’s so blisteringly obvious that this wasn’t how the story was intended to be told, because there are little moments of just sheer wackiness peppered throughout that brace against its supposedly realistic portrayal. Certain expressions, reactions, conversations and side characters are clearly designed to fit an overall goofier, un-self-serious tone. Natsuo and Rui, the protagonist and his sex friend/sister, have a moment in episode 2 where he tries to coach her in how to talk to people, and their ensuing conversation spirals so out of control that I was reminded of nothing less than the best non-sequiter verbal sparring matches in Gintama. And speaking of Gintama, two characters literally stake out a third while comically munching on anpan at one point. It’s in these bizarre little moments of incongruent wackiness that Domestic Girlfriend comes alive and you see the show it could have- and SHOULD have- been. How did anyone think this was supposed to be taken entirely seriously? There’s a Bad Engrish transfer student AND a camp gay bartender, for crying out loud. Whoever thought that kind of source material deserved this kind of flavorless pasteboard treatment should be fired on the spot.I could honestly keep complaining; the pacing of the final act is absurdly rushed, there’s a character who’s given a whole episode of introduction, build-up and closure before never being relevant to the plot again, but I figure it’s best to leave it here. Domestic Girlfriend is just boring, with occasional moments of intrigue and enjoyment when the show it should have been peeks through. It doesn’t deserve any more consideration than that. reason.

Whoever thought that kind of source material deserved this kind of flavorless pasteboard treatment should be fired on the spot.I could honestly keep complaining; the pacing of the final act is absurdly rushed, there’s a character who’s given a whole episode of introduction, build-up and closure before never being relevant to the plot again, but I figure it’s best to leave it here. Domestic Girlfriend is just boring, with occasional moments of intrigue and enjoyment when the show it should have been peeks through. It doesn’t deserve any more consideration than that.', ""I bealive for me personally 10/10 without a doubt It's THE BEST anime i have ever seen and the score is that only because of his decent<bad ending.The Story Goes Like That:We Begin with our main character who loves his sensei but hasn't told her.After that we have a girl in his age which just met him and wants to have sex with him just for fun and nothing else (He does bang her :0).After we meet our character and the 2 girls his father tells him he wants to marry a new women and make a new family after his mother's death.He accepts and...the women which his father chose has 2 daugters the teacher and the girl he bang (Rui) Which they deside to live together in a house.The Main Character still loves the teacher and Rui slowly falls in love with himI bealive the anime has really good story line and personally deserves the no1 place as the best anime i have ever seen.The story has some missanderstands insinde which if you are a begginer anime watcher or even you have watched some you won't get but after all it's really good and i really will say Watch It the women which his father chose has 2 daugters the teacher and the girl he bang (Rui) Which they deside to live together in a house.The Main Character still loves the teacher and Rui slowly falls in love with himI bealive the anime has really good story line and personally deserves the no1 place as the best anime i have ever seen.The story has some missanderstands insinde which if you are a begginer anime watcher or even you have watched some you won't get but after all it's really good and i really will say Watch It"", ""I initially rated this anime an 8 always skipping the opening. I finally decided to look it up on YT finding the Minami M/V. Oh boy. The deep dive into Hina's thoughts and feelings.. and the emotion in Minami's voice is something that hit me like a bulldozer. Like a meteorite. Like a planet. I haven't felt this way from a song in... wait, did I ever? It's the best anime opening and it's not even close, and it's one of the best and most heartfelt songs I've ever heard in my life. So just because of that, the anime itself gets a solid 9....I feel compelled to leave this review due to the (in my opinion) unwarranted hate this anime receives.  I will speak more so about real life issues with the anime being the example, but first and foremost don't forget an anime is a work of fiction and that alone should make you have an open mind. I will keep the first half of the review spoiler free, and I will go into more details in the second half which will have spoilers.NO MAJOR SPOILERS ----------I'll start off by saying that out of the 2 Kanojo animes we got back to back this is by far the better one yet it's rated lower than the other. It's insanity.This anime tackles a very interesting yet taboo idea of step-siblings falling in love. This phrase is enough to make a good portion of people hate it from the start. Why am I not one of them? Because I see it objectively, and don't instantly think it's wrong just because society says so. The story follows the main character, Natsuo Fujii, who is 17 years of age. His romantic interests are a few, but his most important one is Hina Tachibana, 23 years of age, who is also his teacher, and becomes his sibling. This tackles an age gap, power dynamic issues and step-sibling love. So how could anyone not repell it as they see it?I'll start with the age gap. It's always been interesting to me how people demonize such a relationship because of one part of it is 17 years old. Even if it's 17 years and 11 months old, people demonize it. As soon as the last month passes and the person becomes 18, people don't demonize it anymore. I will never understand that. It makes no sense. One month is not enough for any major progress in a person's maturity, and yet people care about it so much. Just because society tells us that's right and anything else is wrong. I think a person with their head on their shoulders can discern the context where it's wrong and where it's okay. 6 years of age is not as big of a gap as people make it out to be. I know for a fact a lot of your parents have that age gap if not higher. And it's one thing when you talk about lust, and another when you talk about real love. It's one thing when you talk about a soon-to-be 18yo guy, and another thing with a 15yo kid. But I digress, no matter how much I will explain this logic some people will never grasp it. Personally, it doesn't bother me that much, ESPECIALLY in a fictional series. And before you make any assumptions in your head, I will say that I wouldn't date a girl younger than me because in my eyes women are immature well into their 20s, so I want someone older than me. That's a personal preference. And yet I don't let that subjectivity drive my perception.Now the power dynamic issue... I don't see it in this particular case. There hasn't been one time where Hina abuses her position of power in any way, shape or form. It's just how it happened to be. She's a teacher, he's a student. She is young enough for him to otherwise have fallen for her anyway. That's where that ends.This next part contains Episode 1 spoilers only----Now for the fun part... the step-sibling thing. Recognise the context, again. It's one thing for 2 kids to grow up together as step-siblings and act like brother and sister all the way, and it's another for them to already have had intimate action and only thereafter becoming step-siblings at 17. And with Hina, it's also different to fall in love with her WAY before becoming siblings. What would you do in that position? A lot of people would try and sound righteous and say they would instantly drop anything, any feeling, any action, when in reality they wouldn't, especially when we talk about true love. This is a thing that people in real life deal with too. Why should I and the love of my life completely shut down our real feelings just because our parents got together? Who says that we should, and that our parents aren't the ones who should break up so we can comfortably be together? It's a very selfish issue from BOTH sides. Personally I would be selfish to the end and oppose the marriage. The parents have already lived their love life even if it ended unfortunately. It's absurd for me who has never experienced it to drop it and possibly never find it again just so they can do it a second time in their life.SPOILERS -------------As you can see in the anime too, the parents themselves wondered if they made a mistake. Honestly, they didn't since they didn't know, but I'm glad they have the self-awareness not to make it rain hard on their kids, understanding the situation for what it is.Let's get into rating the show.ART (8/10)It's looking good for the year it came out. Not much else to be said.STORY Premise (8/10)I am giving the premise such a high score because the anime unapologetically goes through with tackling a taboo story like this one which happens very rarely unless it's a Hanime, and making a good piece of entertainment out of it.STORY Progression (5/10)I feel like this is where the show lacks. There is very little development when it comes to relationships between the characters. They barely make any progress throughout the season. The only progress truly being made is between Natsuo and Hina, but it's much slower than it should've been, and it falls apart at the end where they end up separated anyway. Natsuo and Rui also make progress, except it's one-sided.CHARACTERS (7/10)The characters could have been much more, but at the same time despite what people say they ARE pretty realistical to how real people would act in a similar situation. Is Natsuo immature? Yes, but he's pretty young. I would actually say he's mature FOR his age. Is Hina immature? Very, but she's also pretty young. Though she's definitely the most immature one out of the trio even being the oldest. Is Rui immature? In some ways yes, in others she might be the most mature one in the show.Let's start off with Natsuo. He's not a bad guy. He is not a simp, as I've seen TOO MANY people comment under every episode. People nowadays lack the mental capacity to differentiate between a simp and someone that's in love. It's normal to fight for the love of your life and it's wrong in so many ways to categorize it as simp behaviour. I've even seen some people say some crazy things like he only likes Hina because he lusts for her. That's so far from the truth it's not even funny. He's not that type of person. Remember that even though he had his V-card, he still HESITANTLY accepted Rui's request. He denied Momo's request when he realised the mental issues she has and instead offered her a shoulder to lean on. If he was as bad as people say he is he wouldn't have such a moral compass nevermind putting it to use. He loves Hina. He really does. It's as simple as that. I haven't been in love either, but that doesn't stop me from noticing people in real life that ARE in love and understanding that those feelings are to such a magnitude that it can't be helped and can't be killed off easily, and they also fog your decision making, and even still I think he acted properly most of the time. He is fairly straight-forward, which is rare in a MC nowadays, and even though he lied or avoided answering sometimes, usually he ends up coming clean where other MCs would still not do it. He's late, but he eventually tells things how they are. Most people in real life lie 100 times more than him and they never even come clean either. He's definitely a great, realistic MC and extremely overhated.Rui. Rui is also in love. People say she does so much for Natsuo and he doesn't deserve her. In some ways it might be true, but hating Natsuo for that is very silly and I can tell those people are either young, haven't really lived life or never had or closely watched any relationships, without trying to be offensive. You can't blame a person for not reciprocating certain feelings if.. you know.. they don't feel them? And whatever she's doing isn't working in her favour either since throughout the show she goes from UwU look at me senpai to giving him the cold shoulder in the next scene making Natsuo wonder if he'll ever understand a woman's mind. You won't, my dear child, you won't. Other than that, Rui is a great character and mature for her age considering that when she found Natsuo and Hina out she was rightfully hurt and angry at them, but she very quickly came to terms with the situation, even decided to stay out of their relationship AND making up with both of them, only trying to stop the love for Natsuo in her own silly way. Very kind soul. She took care of Natsuo even when he was depressed because of Hina and didn't give her any attention, yet she never left his side. Enough to make a grown man cry. Best character in terms of maturity and kindness! That's exactly why I don't mind the ending. Even if Natsuo loves Hina more, Rui is a much better option in so many ways.Hina. Hina is the worst person in the catalog. By society's standards, anyway. Everyone calls her immature, which she is, but she's not to the level people make her out to be if you try to understand her point of view. She's in denial the entire season minus the last 2 episodes. But wouldn't you be? Being in love with your student? The student that somehow became family? She tries her best to shut down those feelings. She HAS to live in denial. It's taking a huge toll on her mental. That's why she's on and off. Once again, the show clearly encompasses how love clouds your mind. To me, that's not what makes her immature. What makes her immature is her leaving in the last episode. At that point does it even matter anymore? Is it really worth turning a two way love into a two way depression just because you got found out? At that point Natsuo finished highschool. He starts out 17, a year goes by, so even if it's not mentioned clearly in the anime it's safe to assume he's about 18 at that point. Her being a teacher at that highschool or not makes no difference at this point. Their relationship is completely outside that field by now. After risking and losing what they did they should've lived their fairy tail, not make it worse for something that can't be taken back. That is where I disliked Hina.Other characters haven't been impactful or interesting enough to be worth any comments. Maybe the Yakuza guy. He gave me a few laughs and when it came to giving advice he was pretty accurate even being in the dark with the details.I've already said how I respect the parents and why.This show is made out of multiple painful complicated situations. Real life often turns out that way.ENJOYMENT (9/10)I enjoyed the show a lot. I appreciate the fact that even though X-rated scenes have surfaced (which I got from the comments), the main anime itself only hints at the times sex happened. It's mature enough to where sex is implied, but not outlandish enough for it to be a Hanime. I love that balance, and I could only hope more animes would take that direction. Once you get to a certain age it becomes boring to watch the same stories that often don't even end up with a kiss, nevermind something as 'mature' as sex. I can't help but be very happy they did it that way.Other than that, the show was funny sometimes, other times sad, I cringed a couple times, then I felt good, and I felt very satisfied with certain things that you rarely see in anime. It was a fun ride, and I still have it in the back of my mind a few days later when I'm writing this review.OVERALL (8/10)Tying everything together, this deserves nothing less than a 9. Initially it was an 8 as I said at the start, but because of the opening I bumped it up. And again, it pains me to see how low it's rated in comparison to other shows that don't even come close to touching it. But for what it's worth, at least I got all of this off my chest and hopefully I can open some people's eyes.Thanks for reading!

Dear reader, I implore you, now is the time to grab a shovel and join me in burying abomination for good.Once upon a time, there was a dumb sack of potatoes named Natsuo. Fittingly, his name sounds like nut-sack because that is his defining character trait. His sex addiction rivals the protagonist of School Days and it gets him...into so much trouble with his harem of needy waifus. His harem includes:1. Rui, a girl who he had sex with randomly to forget his crush, but now she’s his step-sister.2. Hina, his teacher who he has a crush on, and now she is also his stepsister.3. Momo, a depressed girl with big boobs who the writers forget about right after she’s introduced.4. An annoying green-haired girl who is so forgettable I can’t even remember her name.Wow!!! What a positively electric cast full of chemistry! As for the story… The main conflict only involves Natsuo, Rui, and Hina, making a pseudo-incestuous love triangle. The only entertaining parts of the show are when giant melodrama bombs are dropped on us, shaking up the stale romantic tension. The first arc features Hina in an affair with a married man, then Natsuo butts his head into her business by sexually assaulting her. Don’t worry, she sexually assaults him shortly after. What an emotional roller coaster! No matter how much the writers try to raise the states, the plot is too hamfisted for it to be believable. Instead, they have to use plot contrivances and inconsistent character motivations to build artificial tension. With a premise this stupid, the only way for it to work is if the characters are even more stupid.For the majority of the show, we’re treated to insultingly dull slice-of-life crap. The ‘comedy’ is just a gap between one melodramatic hentai subplot to the next. Girls compete for Natsuo’s attention, and he is as indecisive as a blank-slate dating-sim protagonist so he gives them all time. Very little time is spent trying to resolve his love for his teacher, and their scenes together are the most toxic, and unhealthy in the entire show. His one believable moment of introspection is at the start of the show when he resolves to forget his love and have sex with a Rui. Even though it is a bad decision, he accepts it in the heat of the moment. The mistake was a realistic one, but I expected the show to develop Natsuo from this as he learned better ways to overcome unrequited love. Instead, he just continues to make the same mistakes. No one in this show ever learns anything. They’re all infuriatingly brainless, I swear to god the entire cast has three brain cells in total and they’re all struggling to understand what common sense is. Whenever a love affair becomes too idiotic or repetitive, the show shifts to a new one. At times it is wrought with over-the-top melodrama to the point that it becomes self-parody.Domestic Girlfriend redefines bland characters; we are left with plenty of dead air in between the salacious incest drama. So how do we solve this issue? Filler! So much pointless fluff. Entire episodes are occasionally dedicated to a one-off conflict that has zero effect on the show afterward. The rest of the awkward silence is filled with unfunny comedy. The parts of the story that are interesting are at best so-bad-it's-good levels of stupidity. There is no part of Domestic Girlfriend that is remotely thought-provoking, it’s substanceless melodrama for the sake of shock value and taboo sex appeal. That doesn’t mean this show isn’t without intriguing questions such as...“Is it incest if you shove a suppository up your step-sister's ass?” and“Is it wrong to fuck your underage student who is also legally your brother?”Rui and Hina are very thinly characterized, but Hina gets more focus. It’s a shame considering she is the worst of the two. Rui is very stupid mind you, she doesn’t realize her stepbrother disappears every night to fuck her sister. No Rui, he is not going to hang out with his friend. At the very least, I understand why she decides to throw away her virginity in the first episode. She wanted to be an adult. Hina talked down to her for never being ‘held by someone,’ just like a child. Sadly that’s all the depth Rui has. When she gets desperate for Natsuo’s attention, she kisses him in a way that suggests love. Then directly after she acts like a kid annoyed with him for picking her older—bustier—sister. On the other hand, Hina is more of a controversial character. Her love affair at the start of the show is a basic telenovela drama, then it ends abruptly so she can pursue her brother. She continuously acknowledges how morally wrong it is to mess around with her student/brother/underage teen, but continues to do so anyway. Destined to become another red dot on the sex offender registry. Hina gets punished for her poor decisions plenty of times, but it’s impossible to pity someone who dug their own grave; at some point, she’d have to lie in it. Potato man AKA Natuso is the worst of the three. He has sex because at the start of the show Rui throws herself at him before they even know each other, but then he regrets it because he has a crush on his teacher. Great, another generic blank slate self-insert.None of the side characters have any development at all. Anytime they are on screen they’re wasting time. Their main purpose is to dispense comedy with some weightless melodrama tossed here and there. The story is so haphazardly put together that it’s hard to tell what it is actually trying to be about. Momo, the prominent side hoe, is braindead. Her whole introduction to Rui was so contrived. She puts on a blatantly fake nice girl, with a secret dark side. She tried to kill herself, revealed in a soft-core porn scene, and handled as delicately as a screwdriver. Other than that, she wanted to fuck the potato protagonist. Shortly after she’s introduced, the writers pretty much forgot about her. The same issue affects Miu, the green-haired one (I looked up her name). While she never gets romantically involved with Natsuo, she serves as more waifu-bait fodder. Both side hoes get placed into the story by plot contrivances. They come out of nowhere just to shake up the love triangle before it starts to get boring. The love-pentagon unfortunately never happens. Miu and Momo are relegated to literature club scenes; essentially the Harem Rejects Club. It's the worst excuse for filler in the whole show. During every monotonous club scene, I prayed for pray for the awful incest shit to come back. Some say the pacing issues were due to a shitty adaptation, and that it would be better to read the manga. Personally, I wouldn’t want to touch this series again with a ten-foot pole.The main attraction of this show is pretty obvious, the sex scenes. These scenes without a doubt get the most time and attention from the animation team. With a story that was probably ripped straight from hentai, yet it's never more than teasing to keep you watching. The kissing, sex, and any other kind of provocative lewd scene come out of absolutely nowhere, seemingly to satisfy a sex-quota rather than to fit with the story. Casual conversations turn into foreplay at the drop of a hat, there's always a contrived wrench thrown in to lead to sex. In one instance, Natsuo peeps on his sister masturbating because cuckolding is so SEXY. All of the characters are horny, and it's treated as a deep personality trait and taken so seriously. Even when Natsuo commits his love to Hina, he kisses Rui just because she asked him to in the next scene… And this all happens with the door left open so that Hina can watch! Why does no one in this shitfest know how to close a door?!There's a unique atmosphere to this anime that really fits all of this thrilling drama. In other words, there is none.Sometimes the best background music in a scene is none at all, but that saying shouldn’t apply to half of the show. There are some simplistic piano pieces and ambient effects here and there, but the rest is so boring. The actual soundtrack is repetitive elevator music with such a slow tempo. There is one single saving grace in the whole show, the opening theme. Even in a show as phoned in as this one, the performer Minami delivers one of the best openings of this season. Diomedea is not exactly known for they’re visual prowess, but this is one series where they seemed to have more budget than usual, well in the first couple of episodes. Character designs struggle to stay on model, looping animation is used constantly to cut corners. The scene transitions are reminiscent of a PowerPoint presentation with their amateur dissolve fades. Each episode ends with a bizarre shot of an underwear model, sometimes it comes directly after the final scene finishes. Natsuo and Hina tenderly embracing one another in the final moments, then suddenly SMASH CUT TO NAKED WOMAN! It’s perfect.The background art is barren of visual information and feels like rather than as a stylistic choice this was done out of a lack of care. You can tell a story through showing rather than telling, but Domestic Girlfriend is content with just telling. For example, revealing information about a character through how their home is decorated is a great way of developing their personality without needing heavy-handed dialogue. Visually, it is at best barren of anything interesting to look at, and at worst it’s a hideous hilariously ugly. Across the board, this anime is a clusterfuck of bad ideas and even worse execution.Great job Diomedea, you have outdone yourself yet again. The moment I read the plot synopsis I knew this would be trash, but my expectations were blown away. Even though I lowered the bar as far down as I could, this anime still exceeded all levels of hot steaming garbage I could expect from a romance. This is a spectacular dumpster fire that must be experienced firsthand, but after you do, don't forget to bury it when you're done, and never dig it up again. into so much trouble with his harem of needy waifus. His harem includes:1. Rui, a girl who he had sex with randomly to forget his crush, but now she’s his step-sister.2. Hina, his teacher who he has a crush on, and now she is also his stepsister.3. Momo, a depressed girl with big boobs who the writers forget about right after she’s introduced.4. An annoying green-haired girl who is so forgettable I can’t even remember her name.Wow!!! What a positively electric cast full of chemistry! As for the story… The main conflict only involves Natsuo, Rui, and Hina, making a pseudo-incestuous love triangle. The only entertaining parts of the show are when giant melodrama bombs are dropped on us, shaking up the stale romantic tension. The first arc features Hina in an affair with a married man, then Natsuo butts his head into her business by sexually assaulting her. Don’t worry, she sexually assaults him shortly after. What an emotional roller coaster! No matter how much the writers try to raise the states, the plot is too hamfisted for it to be believable. Instead, they have to use plot contrivances and inconsistent character motivations to build artificial tension. With a premise this stupid, the only way for it to work is if the characters are even more stupid.For the majority of the show, we’re treated to insultingly dull slice-of-life crap. The ‘comedy’ is just a gap between one melodramatic hentai subplot to the next. Girls compete for Natsuo’s attention, and he is as indecisive as a blank-slate dating-sim protagonist so he gives them all time. Very little time is spent trying to resolve his love for his teacher, and their scenes together are the most toxic, and unhealthy in the entire show. His one believable moment of introspection is at the start of the show when he resolves to forget his love and have sex with a Rui. Even though it is a bad decision, he accepts it in the heat of the moment. The mistake was a realistic one, but I expected the show to develop Natsuo from this as he learned better ways to overcome unrequited love. Instead, he just continues to make the same mistakes. No one in this show ever learns anything. They’re all infuriatingly brainless, I swear to god the entire cast has three brain cells in total and they’re all struggling to understand what common sense is. Whenever a love affair becomes too idiotic or repetitive, the show shifts to a new one. At times it is wrought with over-the-top melodrama to the point that it becomes self-parody.Domestic Girlfriend redefines bland characters; we are left with plenty of dead air in between the salacious incest drama. So how do we solve this issue? Filler! So much pointless fluff. Entire episodes are occasionally dedicated to a one-off conflict that has zero effect on the show afterward. The rest of the awkward silence is filled with unfunny comedy. The parts of the story that are interesting are at best so-bad-it's-good levels of stupidity. There is no part of Domestic Girlfriend that is remotely thought-provoking, it’s substanceless melodrama for the sake of shock value and taboo sex appeal. That doesn’t mean this show isn’t without intriguing questions such as...“Is it incest if you shove a suppository up your step-sister's ass?” and“Is it wrong to fuck your underage student who is also legally your brother?”Rui and Hina are very thinly characterized, but Hina gets more focus. It’s a shame considering she is the worst of the two. Rui is very stupid mind you, she doesn’t realize her stepbrother disappears every night to fuck her sister. No Rui, he is not going to hang out with his friend. At the very least, I understand why she decides to throw away her virginity in the first episode. She wanted to be an adult. Hina talked down to her for never being ‘held by someone,’ just like a child. Sadly that’s all the depth Rui has. When she gets desperate for Natsuo’s attention, she kisses him in a way that suggests love. Then directly after she acts like a kid annoyed with him for picking her older—bustier—sister. On the other hand, Hina is more of a controversial character. Her love affair at the start of the show is a basic telenovela drama, then it ends abruptly so she can pursue her brother. She continuously acknowledges how morally wrong it is to mess around with her student/brother/underage teen, but continues to do so anyway. Destined to become another red dot on the sex offender registry. Hina gets punished for her poor decisions plenty of times, but it’s impossible to pity someone who dug their own grave; at some point, she’d have to lie in it. Potato man AKA Natuso is the worst of the three. He has sex because at the start of the show Rui throws herself at him before they even know each other, but then he regrets it because he has a crush on his teacher. Great, another generic blank slate self-insert.None of the side characters have any development at all. Anytime they are on screen they’re wasting time. Their main purpose is to dispense comedy with some weightless melodrama tossed here and there. The story is so haphazardly put together that it’s hard to tell what it is actually trying to be about. Momo, the prominent side hoe, is braindead. Her whole introduction to Rui was so contrived. She puts on a blatantly fake nice girl, with a secret dark side. She tried to kill herself, revealed in a soft-core porn scene, and handled as delicately as a screwdriver. Other than that, she wanted to fuck the potato protagonist. Shortly after she’s introduced, the writers pretty much forgot about her. The same issue affects Miu, the green-haired one (I looked up her name). While she never gets romantically involved with Natsuo, she serves as more waifu-bait fodder. Both side hoes get placed into the story by plot contrivances. They come out of nowhere just to shake up the love triangle before it starts to get boring. The love-pentagon unfortunately never happens. Miu and Momo are relegated to literature club scenes; essentially the Harem Rejects Club. It's the worst excuse for filler in the whole show. During every monotonous club scene, I prayed for pray for the awful incest shit to come back.

First of all the very first episodes were very lackluster for my taste,but I endured the pain that it brought. The story is about the main character Natsuo liking his teacher ,and in the very first episode,has sex with some random girl just because ,and she later ends up being his step sister. This pretty much is boring at this point ,but after the middle of the story ,Natsuo has the chance to develop a relationship with his teacher and in doing so he clearly states ,although not this exact words,""I\'m willing to...die with you if it means being together ,Hina"" which is directed at his teacher which now is his step sister too. After all that ,everything is going smoothly ,but then they get caught and end up being seperated from one another and end up their relationship. Now ,If I personally hate something ,is that the author ,after writing that Natsuo was willing to die for his teacher,why did he end up with his other step sister rui,it doesn\'t make sense ,does it? I feel that a story goes better when you don\'t end up playing with alot of characters and then introduce more girls that love Natsuo ,when it\'s not even a harem ,what is the point in the story then?

It takes the theme of a melancholic teen love story about unrequited and forbidden love, and quickly turns into something full of conflict in it.Most of the Domestic na Kanojo actors consist of hypocrites who are upset with the fate of their love. Two sisters with opposing personalities live in the same house as the male protagonist. Sometimes they act unreasonably, and can change their attitude to willingness, surrender to love. After all, love is a difficult thing, and teenagers are at the most confusing stage of their lives. But it becomes...a question if what they feel is love in the first place when they can easily find someone else instead, sleeping with anyone who shows them even a little love. It's very possible that Rui and Natsuo might just fall in love with things like strangers. Because they were the first people to give them that love.While a woman like Hina is undoubtedly possessed by a very twisted worldview, it becomes a wonder how she can even fulfill her duties as a teacher. She thinks that being an adult will always act wisely but in fact isn't. She finally reached the point where she ignored his principles so far and decided to become a person who thinks rationally.Each of the three main gets their turn to tell on many occasions, which are not good for explaining their motivations and feelings and for making them feel like the right protagonists rather than mere accessories for slaughter, even if some receive less significant characterizations. From the other. Just showing two characters having sex or making out one another is not nearly the same as when accompanied by narration. When arranged with the anime's emotional soundtrack, some dialogues almost feel enthralling, and kisses can bring strength, even if it is between two people who really have no business kissing each other in the first place. It's quite unfortunate to have anime that isn't brave enough to draw sex in an honest way.I will admit that I am very interested in Domestic na Kanojo. This is not because this is a bad anime, but because it aims to convey how true love is, which only contains pain and tears. Domestic na Kanojo is about as far as anime is as fun as possible, and it never really aims to fill that gap with a lot of substance or meaning. The starting and ending points are the same.Indeed, the industry of anime is now soaring in every time one of them is Diomedea, after producing extraordinary works they are now increasingly improving their quality from time to time.

I saw Instagram posts about this anime for so long, and I waited 12 weeks to binge watch this garbage... Really? 80% incest, 15% love, 5% what the actual fuck...- Spacecraft555 UwU', ""Romance is one of the genres that will become successful if the audiences could feel the characters and emotion linked to one another towards the story. Combined it with drama then the important element of pacing and the story placement are number one that needs to be well created. When characters already exist, despite good or bad the concept is, it won’t work without emotion at all. It goes the same as the drama genre. In a worse case, it definitely won’t get better when it doesn't have both elements mentioned before. And that’s just what happened in Domestic na Kanojo.The story is nothing but...rubbish as same as how the main characters and the others ( or not so important characters that actually don’t need to explain or even created in this series) frankly speaking about their life problem to get any solution. But it didn’t give any good impact at all. The good concept about forbidden love that they put in through this series is just only good as a synopsis, nothing more. With no clarity of how the story will go by the confused state of the characters, it just leaves more depressing feeling to the audiences from start to the end of the series. The ending itself is still questionable with no explanation. It all feels just like when someone wants to go to the theater but ends up in a funhouse anyway. And not all of the funhouse was even “funny”.Some of the characters in this series are uniquely annoying in their own way. And some others popped suddenly before the audience got full definition and learn the intention of another character. There’s just one character in this series that truly steady but the rest are horrible. Much unimportant dialogue content that doesn’t need to be expand showed in a more longer time than focus on their main problem. Diomedea staff needs to know that no matter how much they want to make a different way to tell their “own romance story” they can’t just blankly put dialogue into a character that could ruin their first impression by the audiences like pushing a big plate of chicken into little child’s mouth. It will get stuck and gave an unpleasant moment for them. The distribution between the main role and the support one are not evenly balanced. How they solve their conflict are just unnatural and felt like affectation just to fit the condition of the story.Two aspects that may become the hero of the series is their art and music. But still, both of the sections still got a mistake in the process. When someone realizes that they already watch this anime and felt unimpressed by the presentation in the middle but didn’t want to drop it just to see how the story will end, then at that time they would be able to found any fault there’s available in the series, even the little one. For example, the art was fine but they often used frozen animation which limits the movement of the characters. It well received and tolerable though as long as it didn’t ruin the story. On the other hand, the music or sound section is the best part, the opening and ending are beautiful but again there’s a time when they put a little touch to background music that did not turn well. They cannot put a light-hearted melody when there are serious events that showed in. It messed up the atmosphere and could stop the audience to feel the character’s emotion more.The biggest enjoyment of this show is how “funny” the characters behave towards the story. In the end, the drama and romance that becomes the main genre were not satisfying at all. Not even make feel the audience touched or relate to the character to understand them better. Other than waifus, the audience won’t get beautiful with meaningful story, they won’t get the feeling the emotion of mainly all of the character’s side and point of view just like any drama genre and they won’t get a nice ending either.

There are so many things bad about this show but here are the main things.The Good: The op was ok and the animation was alright.The Bad: Really gross, tons of step-incest, barely got through it without puking, most of the story is bad romance cliches.The Ugly: Pre-marital sex and incestual cuckholding.In short: Poorly written and extremely gross. ', ""My rating 9/10This anime definetly is something different when it comes to the romance and slice of life genre. In my opinion the show presents the most dystopian version of a complicated teenagers life and yet does a good job at it. I already read several negative reviews about Domestic na Kanojo and they were all talking about incest and the randomness on how the story devolops but thats a bunch of hogwash.It certaintly is NOT incest since the characters are not related by blood.And yes it is random at some point but that's a good thing.The kind of emotional rollercoaster the protagonist is experiencing...also gets transferred to the viewer and let's him take part in Natsuo Fujii's fairly innocent life, but that's about to change. Our protagonist now comes in touch with women and encounters various uncomfortable situations in which his new feelings and emotions for girls play a major role.As I already mentioned this show is a bit different than others. I mean who'd guess his new step sisters are some girls he already knew from more or less awkward situations. And now we've reached the point were most people freak out and question how naughty and down bad japanese authors must be to create such a crap and some others give it a try and just watch what happens.In my opinion the series does a great job at surprising the viewer with weird or uncomfortable scenarios, which don't beat around the bush. Those steamy experiences now compliment the decisionmaking of our protagonist who noticably develops as time goes by.Of course you could discuss whether the level of showcasing that is too extreme or if it's needed.In the end it is a romance anime that heavily plays with feeling of a teenagers first love and we can relate to that at some point can't we?

Our protagonist now comes in touch with women and encounters various uncomfortable situations in which his new feelings and emotions for girls play a major role.As I already mentioned this show is a bit different than others. I mean who'd guess his new step sisters are some girls he already knew from more or less awkward situations. And now we've reached the point were most people freak out and question how naughty and down bad japanese authors must be to create such a crap and some others give it a try and just watch what happens.In my opinion the series does a great job at surprising the viewer with weird or uncomfortable scenarios, which don't beat around the bush. Those steamy experiences now compliment the decisionmaking of our protagonist who noticably develops as time goes by.Of course you could discuss whether the level of showcasing that is too extreme or if it's needed.In the end it is a romance anime that heavily plays with feeling of a teenagers first love and we can relate to that at some point can't we?

I have enjoyed anime since i was a freshman in high school and had no friends (just kidding). Me and my classmates were falling for a teachers all the time and some were even successful. Domestic Girlfriend was spot on in portraying the essence of a teenager going through romantic and domestic challenges. The character of Natsuo was not just a generic nice guy, he had a lot of flaws which made him relatable but nothing compared to Rui. To me Rui was...the real star, she reminded me of my cousin who was the glue that holds the family together. She also didn\'t like to socialize until meeting people who were not offended by her. Rui is also a force to be wreck en with when she is strong and extremely vulnerable when she is week. All in all shortest and best review you will read about this anime because most people aren\'t a fan of incest, well they aren\'t related by blood so get over it because it happens more in reality that it does on tv and it just makes the anime more realistic if you ask me. the real star, she reminded me of my cousin who was the glue that holds the family together.

And all I can say about this anime is how gut wrenching it is. It’s not blood, gore or any sort of horror that’s made me feel this way. But rather it’s a heart issue. Issues of love; the characters coming to understand that emotion. And the feeling of that love being unrequited is making my heart ache, as I can’t help but empathise with the male protagonist. We continue to watch this anime yearning for a peaceful ending. Resolution...and reconciliation between characters. And it’s my hope that comes in time as I continue to watch the anime. At this point this anime has had no issue manifesting an array of emotions inside me. I’ve felt sad to the point of tears, angry to the point of screaming, and a dull ache where my heart strings are being pulled that I can only attribute to feelings of jealousy.Only 6 episodes into this anime, while not a masterpiece, has had the power to move me. And after thinking long about how this anime is able to invoke so many emotions in the viewer.. I came to a simple conclusion... This anime, unlike many other romance anime out there, portrays a realistic view of romance and the brokenness of human relationships. It’s romance in the real world where not everything is straight forward. An anime where romance isn’t like fairytales or the princess and prince. But rather a story filled with unrequited love and love triangles, and then, along with that, jealousy, lust, adultery, unfulfilled desire and awkwardness as the cast navigate their way through their own sexuality. It’ll only be another 24 hours until I finish the anime that I can reflect on these feelings I’ve put on paper and properly review the anime.I’ve resumed the script for this review at 1am the next day, having now fully completed the anime. And now, after full absorbing this series I can say that I haven’t been moved by an anime in this way since I saw Re:Zero or Mysterious Girlfriend X. While not a masterpiece there are so many great features to this anime that I’ll look at following our standard review pattern with story, characters, art and sound.The story revolves around a boy named Natsuo Fuji who falls in love with his teacher named Hina. His father ends up marrying Hina’s mother, and so they begin cohabitation. The story explores the relationship between Natsuo, Hina and Hina’s sister called Rui.The focal point of the anime story is around romance, and as I’ve mentioned earlier this is done in a way that I didn’t expect. You see this anime depicted the reality of what some romance turn out to be. The challenge of being with someone, and the despair of rejection is something that many people can empathise with. So because the anime is this way, the story was mainly driven by the characters and developed as they continued to interact with one another.A key aspect of the story and of the character relationships that honestly isn’t for everyone, is the taboo being openly explored. In this anime you’ll see relationships build between a child and adult, and between a brother and sister. And I feel there are people who, for them, this turns them away from the anime. But for me, it wasn’t something that fazed me. Perhaps because it’s a common occurrence in anime, that the boundaries are often pushed. Or maybe it’s because I’ve seen it in anime before that I was desensitised to the idea. But at the core of this anime is romance, sweet, sad and real. And upon reflection it could possibly be that the very fact the anime pushes these boundaries makes it so engaging. The viewer is kept on the edge of seat in fear for the protagonists, are they going to be found out? Or will she reciprocate his feelings? We are left in heart ache wanting the best outcome for the characters and that’s part of what makes the story so engaging. The story ends on a what seems like cliffhanger. With a little resolution.. Leaving the viewer in shock and yearning to see more. A perfect strategy to sell sequel volumes of the manga.The characters in this anime were great in a sense that they were relatable. But if I could say there was a let down anywhere in the anime I would say the characters weren’t at their peak. I honestly just felt like they weren’t developed enough. And for a romance anime this is key. We didn’t know much about Natsuo, just the fact that he simply loved Hina and is an aspiring novelist. Rui was made out to be someone who also loved books, but that passion was rarely a bonding point between Natsuo and Rui. And Hina was just a teacher that looked cute. There was so much focus on the drama that we lost some character development when it was clearly needed. Regardless I still loved the characters, they were drawn well, had amazing voice actors behind them and were relatable.So as for the art and sound. In terms of the art, I think it was done well. It was clean, and with the combination of the amazing voice acting and art, the characters emotions were brought forth so powerfully. It was so easy to see their anguish, their feelings of hopelessness, and even when they succumbed to their libido and desires. The sound and art apart from this were done to a high standard, and while it honestly wasn’t something I noticed. Upon reflection I can see the effect it had on the viewer.So finally, while not a masterpiece this anime was powerful. It moved me, made me feel what the characters were feeling, and I got sucked into the world desperate to see resolution. Hence why I’m still awake at 1:45 typing this review. This anime is great for anyone who wants to see a romance anime that is real, but I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who hates taboo topics or romance that pushes the boundaries.Domestic Girlfriend is an anime that is truely unique in its own way and will leave you wanting more.

IT'S BORING AS HELL. This 12 episode anime feels like a 200 ep long-running shounen anime that doesn't know how to build climax. However, this show is not an action shounen, it's a romance anime, so it's less action-packed and the entertainment highly relies on the quality of the plot and the characters. However, the characters all feel like they have NO personality, except Rui and the american transfer student. The characters get poorly developped throught the anime or just a little bit. And the show really fails at portraying adultery, and just feels like they're forcing...you to accept that a teacher and a student sleeping together is okay. you to accept that a teacher and a student sleeping together is okay."", 'Domestic Girlfriend: The Anime that Killed the Slice of Life GenreDomestic Girlfriend is a subversive masterpiece of an anime that masterfully deconstructs the Slife of Life Genre as a whole. You can see its direct inspiration from such beautiful works of art such as Sergio Leone\'s Once Upon a Time in America; just like Leone deconstructs the mob genre, this show deconstructs SoL. From the first few scenes of the show, we can see our main character (Natsuo) having sex with the character only known as Rui. Sexual relationships in anime are supposed to be developed and earned by the protagonist in a show,...but we just saw Natsuo get it in his first few scenes. Secondly, whereas most harems are earned by the protagonist\'s charismatic nature, in this show his own father indirectly lands him in the position of an anime harem protagonist, making it abrupt and giving us the feeling that it was unearned. The show definitely challenges our perception of conventional anime tropes as it splendidly destroys them. When Hina and Natsuo are talking about them masturbating, something that can be seen as taboo, you can see how brutal and embarassing that was for Hina, making us have to share her pain and embarassment, unlike most slice of life. Furthermore, we can see the sexual nature of this show, as it is not afraid to show us a naked women, but much to our surprise their nudity is not for sexual pleasure or fan service, but symbolic, a form of social commentary on the nature of nudity and sexuality itself. And speaking of sexuality, this anime is brave for its depiction of Masaki, a former Yakuza and homosexual. As LGBTQ+ people are still oppressed in modern Japan, having Masaki also be a former Yakuza as well as a homosexual, the show challenges us on the nature of mobsters and homosexuals alike. Of course, by the end of the show, Natsuo may not have his ""domestic girlfriend"" that he always wanted, as he was the protagonist in a harem anime, but he has to live with the pain that he has caused to everyone, as he gets something inferior to the \'ideal\' domestic girlfriend (Hina). This shows us that we cannot take anything in life as granted, no matter what the circumstances.The dichotomy within his own self, having to choose between two sisters in his life, make this the main point of this anime: Love is love, no matter how close or related, or even age, as we are shown teachers having relationships with underage schoolchildren, questioning the fundamentals that our society were built upon and what makes love real. Natsuo of course, is a character study if you really think about it. This show is heavily inspired by Raging Bull, a Scorsese film, as it depicts the Madonna/Whore complex within Natsuo, being able to see women as either one of the two, hence his love for Hina makes sense in the end, as she is still a \'virgin/angel\' to him, whereas Rui is a but a \'whore\' to him. However, this show is not afraid to show how a good p̶u̶s̶s̶y̶ woman can really break a man, as Hina could also be characterized as manipulative and a heartbreaker. ""But, isn\'t the whole scenario coincidental?"" one could say, and the answer is Yes. The creator of this is obviously inspired by Stanley\'s Kubrick A Clockwork Orange, for its poetic depiction of sex/nudity/drama, but also for its unique use of coincidence, kind of like a fairy tale, that is carefully deconstructed. A true postmodernist view on the anime medium. This show of course touches on themes of creativity as well. Natsuo is nothing short of a talented writer. Of course, he tries really hard to write a good story to send to Reichi, but it ultimately turns out to be not as good as he intended it to be. However, when his heart gets broken, he devotes all his passion and spirit to write a novel, not because he wants it, but because it called for him to write it. Just like Bukowski said ""Don\'t Try"", because you really do not have to try to do something, if you cannot feel passionate about it like Natsuo did. Natsuo did not give up after getting rejected as an aspiring writer but kept on pushing, just like all the great writers did. Of course as this show is misunderstood people did not realize what a piece of art it was and dismissed it, but I believe in later years people will realize how much it shook SoL, and the medium as a whole. Because, Sergio Leone\'s Once Upon a Time in America did not have a proper critical reception upon its inception, but it is now recognized as one of the greatest movies of the gangster genre.However, I was expecting a pissing scene at some point in the show and didn\'t get it 2/10 but we just saw Natsuo get it in his first few scenes.

In my opinion Domestic Girlfriend is a 10 out of 10 modern masterpiece. Every episode has you at the edge of your seat, every minute that passes gets increasingly more ""Spicy"". It\'s just the peak of enterntainment. An undefeatable beauty of an anime. 10/10 would recomend, best anime ever made. Nah but for real, as ridiculous as the premise is, It\'s pretty fucking enterteining, there is no denying that, and at the end that\'s what matters the most to me. I will defenetly rewatch it, It\'s just that good. I get that this type of entertaining may...not be for everyone but for me it\'s a perfet 10 out 10. not be for everyone but for me it\'s a perfet 10 out 10.', ""As with this type of plot, there will always be the hardcore haters. If you absolutely cannot stand incest-type dramas then do not watch this show. You know upfront you will not like it, so there is no reason to watch simply to give it a bad review.As for those who are not against this type of plot, here are my thoughts:You cannot deny that this show has arguably the best OP of the last couple seasons if not years. I have that song on repeat as much as possible and it fills me with joy, as well as heartbreak after finishing the series....The animation is done better than most of the other shows this season and there were only a few moments were the animation interrupted my immersion into the show. I really enjoy the way the emotions are animated, I think it is one of the highlights of the showThe depth of character development is something a lot of the trolls against this show don't seem to want to accept. You can characterize these characters however you want, but there is no one way to describe the characters. They are all very complex in the way they try to achieve their dreams and in the ways that they cope with their issues. Character development for Natsuo and Rui impress me more than Hina's; however, I think it is just easier for me to identify with those two. Natuso isn't some typical harem player, he truly wants the best for everyone in his life and tries to make everyone happy.In the end, I was left with a stinging feeling in my heart. Though I do not like this feeling, I think it shows that the anime did its job and left an emotional impact on me. The only way to fix this feeling is to move on to another anime, but this one has definitely left a mark on me and I am hoping for a second season, although a complete adaptation seems to be impossible without Naruto-level popularity The animation is done better than most of the other shows this season and there were only a few moments were the animation interrupted my immersion into the show.

And had some hopes for this, but my hopes were crushed when I began to like Rui more than Hina. Yes, I'm team-Hina, and reason is she's so much better in the manga, no doubt in my mind. Anyway, without further a do, let's get into this.Story: 1Simple, it doesn't follow the manga at all, it drops some of the most important chapters in the manga, and misses out on almost ALL character development arcs. Like, the characters are so shallow, it's ridiculous, but I'll get further into that later. The story seemed promising in the 1st episode, but...as soon as I noticed they'd dropped a lot of the arcs, it just didn't work. All in all a lackluster story, with a huge amount of plot-holes.Art: 6The art is the only thing that makes this anime appealing, like the art style is rather clean, let's be honest here. The characters look smooth, background rather smooth, all in all clean. It's just a huge lackluster on the animation, and some awkward moments, but I'll let that slide for now.Sound: 5Only reason I gave it a 5, opening. The opening is so lit, it's one of the best openings I've heard, and the animation in the opening is better than in the anime it self, that's depressing.Other than the opening, the sound is mediocre.Character: 3Why does the anime hate Hina so much, she's portrayed so bad, and Rui takes the spotlight which annoys me since I don't like Rui in the manga. (Sorry all team-Rui people). But I guess characters are to some extent okay, but since I'm a manga reader I dislike the portraying of the characters.Enjoyment: 3Sure, you can enjoy it. But in my honest opinion they should have kept the nsfw scenes, it just spices up the story, especially in the manga (hehe). Still, I didn't enjoy nearly as much as I enjoyed the manga. Poor execution.Overall: 4 as soon as I noticed they'd dropped a lot of the arcs, it just didn't work.

The opening is so lit, it's one of the best openings I've heard, and the animation in the opening is better than in the anime it self, that's depressing.Other than the opening, the sound is mediocre.Character: 3Why does the anime hate Hina so much, she's portrayed so bad, and Rui takes the spotlight which annoys me since I don't like Rui in the manga. (Sorry all team-Rui people). But I guess characters are to some extent okay, but since I'm a manga reader I dislike the portraying of the characters.Enjoyment: 3Sure, you can enjoy it. But in my honest opinion they should have kept the nsfw scenes, it just spices up the story, especially in the manga (hehe). Still, I didn't enjoy nearly as much as I enjoyed the manga. Poor execution.Overall: 4"", '**Some Spoilers!!** [Also super toxic]Imagine your self at the bakery, where you buy your self a hot looking ass Jam filled doughnut, you are excited to get digging right into it. But when you go bite into it, there is no jam in between, and in fact, the ""brown sugar"" that you thought was gonna be good, actually turned out to be fucking sand. That\'s basically this anime.Domestic Girlfriend is an anime that makes you want to shoot yourself. Now I\'m not 100% sure, but I wouldn\'t be surprised if this studio also made ""Scums Wish"" because both anime are literally the same with different...characters. DG is just so bad that I had to drop it, like its sister ""Scum\'s Wish"", but since this is a review, let us get on with the shit show.*Now I didn\'t watch all the episodes because after episode 7 I lost my shit and I basically had to watch the heroin equivalent anime to forget the number of brain cells I lost watching this anime.Story: 1Hahaha, you think this shit has a story? It starts off with your classic MC, let us call him Dipshit [DS] for short. The story starts off with DS losing his virginity with some girl he just met, (more on her later) and then he goes home where his dad tells him that he is getting remarried and that the fam is coming literally rn. Also, DS has a crush on his teacher so yeah. Turns out his new mom\'s daughters are, you guessed it: The girl he just fucked and his teacher who he wants to get with. Now, this a romance anime so you can basically guess the rest. He finds out his ""teacher/crush"" (TC autism, TC for short) is having an affair with a guy who has a wife, and so DS is like ""nooo break up"" and the girl he fucked (BlueBerry [BB] cause she got blue hair), is like ""I want my sister back"" so like the first 3/4 episodes are just trying to get them to break up, and then they break up. Good right? Well we will see later on. Episodes 5 and 6 is filler. SO MUCH FUCKING filler. We meet Momo [only name i remember], whos basically a slut due to the fact her parents dont give a shit about her, and Green Haired Grape. So Momo ""goes on a date"" with DS, BB gets salty cause she\'s copping a feel for her step bro. and Grape just exists. Now DS goes on a date with TC but their ""date"" gets ruined because shes like ""we have to die together if we want to be together"" and DS is like ""nah, but lemme d8"". Now episode 7, this is where I dropped this mofo. TC decides to relapse like a fucking drug addict and heroin and she is caught finger banging herself while saying the guy who she was cheating with\'s name.That\'s it, I just stopped right there because i just wasted [7 x 24 min] = almost 3 fucking hours! to find out that we are back to square one. This anime is trying to be a hentai, an incest hentai. Like don\'t get me wrong, all incest anime are HELLA sus, but like ""Yosuga No Sora"", thats something worth watching over this shit. [have u heard it\'s soundtrack bro its literally 100/10, makes up for the twincest shit (highly recommend)Art:4The art is like any other anime, its decent, like any other anime. Not much to say about the ArtSound: 4It\'s sound, of a shitty romance anime. You can\'t get above a 4 for that. Nothing emotionalCharacters: 2Holy shit there is 0 character development. These Characters are the jelly doughnuts filled with air instead of jam. Let\'s do a break down of each character [keep in mind I forgot everyone\'s name because no one is memorable except Momo] :DipShit [MC]: Leader of the harem, likes his teacher/step sis, but can\'t because they are siblings and is getting ""cucked"" by the dude his teacher is fucking? IDK man. he is so boring that you just want to drop kick off a cliff.Blue Berry: The girl DS fucks at the start of the show because ""im bored"", She develops a love for DS throughout the story and gets jealous of him being with other girls. Basically Tsudenere. Also I forgot to mention she is the main girl in the show other than TCTC: A bitch certified by the government. She dates some guy named ""shuu"" who has a wife. She says she loves her family but clearly not because she is fucking anybody. If you have seen Scum\'s Wish she is LITERALLY the same as the teacher slut. I really dont want to talk about this retarded ass of a character cause im about to sue the studio for wasting 3 hours of my life with this bitch relapsingMomo: Holy shit only character who i can name. She is cute, she is fluffy [no she is not a furry]. She also is abused with ""cutting scars??"". Personally, Momo is the best girl in the show because she does absolutely nothing BUT she acknowledges that which is respectable. She as that soft cute girl vibe to it. She was a slut because of her parents not paying attention but DS makes her his by caring for her. [only good thing he does]Green Haired Grape: she literally reads a book. Similar to Momo, she is quiet and soft tone, but shy AF. SHe\'s the literature club pResident. HMM Mokina Is that you??

After finishing this absolute nightmare of an anime one has to wonder how brain dead someone must to be to think this is suitable for human consumption. While there are plenty of technical issues to consider, I must preface this by saying I did in fact watch all twelve episodes because there was an ""it\'s so bad, it\'s good"" element. I often found myself cackling at random, misplaced shit they did. So, if you want to give this show a try, I would encourage you to. It certainly is a fun adventure.Story (2/10): Mother of God, the story...is so bad. Incest galore, sexual assault, confusing plot points, characters that disappear or lose their importance almost immediately. Natsuo, the main character, is so horny that any girl character that happens to be existing at the same moment as him ends up in bed. He\'s supposed to be in love with Hina-nee, his TEACHER AND STEP SISTER(another problem!) but lets himself get bathed by his other step sister Rui (sister of Hina). Natuso comes in contact with pretty much any chocha that is in his vicinity. By the way, the main plot being that these two girls randomly become Natsuo\'s step sisters is so ridiculous that this is more of an anime soap opera than anything else.Art (8/10): Art is not awful by any means, much more run of the mill for 2019 if anything. Sometimes imagery is lazily put together but overall not very bad.Sound (6/10): The intro and outro are VERY good. However, I cannot remember any music from the anime\'s in-show moments and I just finished it 30 minutes ago. Boring.Characters (2/10): After watching, I could not tell you any of the character\'s personalities. They are all normal, unimposing people that are insanely boring without the massive amounts of drama that surround them at every moment. Rui is supposed to be socially impaired but that plot point is forgotten almost immediately. Hina has absolutely no remorse for her adulterous relationship early in the show because she justifies it with bullshit like ""you can\'t choose who you love."" Natsuo is toxic and honestly not that good of a person, lying to all the women in his life. His parents are absolutely annoying and questioning their marriage anytime something bad happens.There happens to be ANOTHER pervy teacher at the school, who I cannot remember the name of because he was also utterly forgettable. His character has an relationship with green-hair girl, another student at Natsuo\'s school. This plot point serves absolutely no purpose and only intends for you to question it for about twenty seconds because, like many things in this show, it\'s never mentioned again! Yay! Hina and Natsuo don\'t end up together (but it is insinuated they will find each other later in life) and Rui then forces herself on Natsuo like he didn\'t just go through a major depressive episode over her sister. There\'s a pink-haired girl that used to cut herself and replaced that coping mechanism with sleeping around, drawing Natsuo into yet another sexual orbit. She\'s a cute character but also eventually get\'s wiped of the face of the Earth.Enjoyment (7/10): Like I said, the show was so bad it\'s good. I thoroughly enjoyed laughing at these stupid characters and even stupider situations. I also liked that they weren\'t afraid to explore sexual situations, although some of them were non-consensual and it was gross. Most anime avoids it though. I did not really get bored at any point in time, just amused and disgusted. Lots of my enjoyment stemmed from morbid cringe.Overall: Do not watch this if you have a very serious personality. In order to enjoy this anime, you have to throw social conventions and your pride out the door. You may recognize the plot holes, but just enjoy them.

Or else, you\'ll find yourself quitting after four episodes.', '**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**This anime was a work of art worthy of the title ""best anime of the year"" (for every single year). To start off the storyline is perfect, it is extremely unpredictable and gives you a twist every episode, but it somehow still manages to make sense. With the unpredictable event of Rui and Hina moving in and how the story develops from there. When they move in the story develops so much and it becomes truly perfect, with the affair scandal and Rui changing schools.The art was outstanding and immeasurably good, the way they kept on focusing on hair and...really random shots just added a sense of uniqueness and unpredictability to the anime. Additionally, those random still shots with just no change in anything for 10 seconds. Just the same frame for a long period of time really added a sense of dramatic pause and really put me on the edge of my seat, and it will for you too.The sound is marvellous, like in episode 4 when Rui was crying they were playing up beat and romantic music, it really fit the tone so perfectly. The wind instruments really complimented her \'frustration\' during the scene. And the sound effects during the \'spicy\' part with Rui and Natsuo in the beginning, the sounds she makes during the flashbacks are very realistic and really emphasised the mood.The character development is outstanding with every character having a behemoth amount of character development. With Rui becoming less shy and Hina breaking up with Shuu because of the pain it brought Rui and Natsuo was very unexpected and really allowed Hina to develop as a character later on. In terms of how good the characters are, they are all incredibly detailed and are extremely good characters, in fact Domestic No Kanojo probably has some of the best characters I have ever encountered, but Rui is best girl.Lastly, enjoyment. There is no way you will not enjoy this show as it makes me laugh every time I watch it, no matter how many times I know what\'s coming it always makes me laugh. The small easter eggs like Kine and Yuuya peaking around the corner when Natsuo and Rui are talking in school. And when Natsuo \'ran away\' and he was stretching with his friend and also how they thought Rui was his girlfriend. It all just makes me crack up. But this anime also manages to show emotion unlike any other, through watching this I have cried many tears, tears of joy and sadness and tears from laughter. It truly is a masterpiece that rivals the greats such as Boku no pico, Skelter Heaven, and Mars of Destruction. Truly, my favourite anime of all time, and I promise, it will be yours too. really random shots just added a sense of uniqueness and unpredictability to the anime.

And the sound effects during the \'spicy\' part with Rui and Natsuo in the beginning, the sounds she makes during the flashbacks are very realistic and really emphasised the mood.The character development is outstanding with every character having a behemoth amount of character development. With Rui becoming less shy and Hina breaking up with Shuu because of the pain it brought Rui and Natsuo was very unexpected and really allowed Hina to develop as a character later on. In terms of how good the characters are, they are all incredibly detailed and are extremely good characters, in fact Domestic No Kanojo probably has some of the best characters I have ever encountered, but Rui is best girl.Lastly, enjoyment. There is no way you will not enjoy this show as it makes me laugh every time I watch it, no matter how many times I know what\'s coming it always makes me laugh. The small easter eggs like Kine and Yuuya peaking around the corner when Natsuo and Rui are talking in school. And when Natsuo \'ran away\' and he was stretching with his friend and also how they thought Rui was his girlfriend. It all just makes me crack up. But this anime also manages to show emotion unlike any other, through watching this I have cried many tears, tears of joy and sadness and tears from laughter. It truly is a masterpiece that rivals the greats such as Boku no pico, Skelter Heaven, and Mars of Destruction. Truly, my favourite anime of all time, and I promise, it will be yours too.', 'It\'s a half lame show about a dude jacking it to his teacher (no judgement).Pretty blank and lame MC, with no descernable personality features, other than being ""nice"" and a bit rapey.

Well, there\'s a bit of ye old anime booty, and that never hurt nobody.If you\'re looking for anime sideboob you may find it here, but honestly there are better ways of obtaining that.

Forced drama in situations that could\'ve been resolved with just a reasonable debate, escalate too out of bounds. That being said, the first arc was quite enjoyable(follow me on this). It had lots of plot twists and character development. Unfortunately that got annihilated by the second arc and the series problems that were there from the start now became very apparent. Things became very convienient for drama and our protaganist just gave up and became a plot device.I\'d still recommend this to people who are looking for the ""feels"". You\'ll still forget this in...two months ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ two months ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯', 'I enjoyed watching school days with the boys more than this show and none of it was pleasant. the fan service was bad and the character personalities were also bad. I stopped laughing at things about 7 episodes in and just groaned instead. There was a little shell of decency in the story writing so it was basically garbage you would consider feeding your favorite street racoon. I will probably leave it as a 3/10 because I finished it which should count for something. but if I rated it out of 5, it would be a weak 2. I cant really recommend this show unless...you want to get drunk and watch the best girl just lose and the worst girl just be bad. you want to get drunk and watch the best girl just lose and the worst girl just be bad.', 'Dang... I honestly never thought I was going to give a 1 mark to an anime.

I must confess, it had me cringing and being like ""WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?!"" while watching it.... Like, in my opinion, there\'s no character development, and I\'m just off with this ""teacher-student romance drama"" stuff so that\'s maybe one of the reasons that this anime never came to my liking.If you like this kind of drama,...go ahead and watch it, you may enjoy this.

The first episode is quick, entertaining, slightly perturbing, and it sets up the rest of the anime perfectly (a bit disturbing, and funny though).The interpersonal relationships are the body of this anime. they are so awkward and it does cross the line into taboo subjects... It is hard to really like any of the main characters.There are no hero\'s here, just a jumbled up mess of emotions between people who have to get along because they are ""family"".This is a roller coaster ride. There are parts...you will love, and parts you will hate, but this anime has an emotive heart that really gets you thinking about what the ""other"" (non- protagonist) is feeling.My First review!

How wrong is it to love someone that cannot and should not be loved? I can't imagine what it feels like to break a taboo and living through it. There is a lot of taboo, incest PLUS teacher/student relationship, and cheating here.After watching the anime, even if taboo, I support Hina and Natsuo's relationship. I'm glad Hina found her true feelings in the end, she loves Natsuo and kept it even if apart :) Hina is beautiful. I love Hina for her beauty and the kind heart she has !!!!!In the beginning, Hina has an affair...with a married man Shuu though as an adult, she knows she shouldn't. Natsuo secretly loves Hina, but can't show it. Rui doesn't agree with Hina's affair, but was curious about a relationship. From a standpoint, that changed when they dealed with the affair. I think it's a case of if there's no space to move, there's no space to love.After the affair broke up, everyone finds out more about their feelings they want to open. Between Natsuo and Hina and Rui, feelings are put into action. There are feelings and development of touch, kiss, sex. Hina and Natsuo are finally lovers although it's a taboo relationship, while Rui also loves Natsuo. Domestic na Kanojo handled it true to heart, Hina and Natsuo follow their love for each other to the fullest. Hina is beautiful for protecting Natsuo :)Hopefully in Season 2, Natsuo can stay loyal to Hina's feelings to marry her and never change. I know Rui also opened up her honest feelings to Natsuo. There are some problems still, like I don't think Hina knows yet that Rui had Natsuo's virginity, Hina and Rui both love Natsuo.

And there are ones that without knowing why makes you hooked. This anime fits that category. Its bad in everything, but if it was good at them that would be an amazing series since its not boring to watch at all.Domestic na Kanojo (AKA Wasted Potential: The Anime):Story: 4/10 (*Slight Spoilers*)Imagine a story which starts in a very good and unique way and lets you hooked for a few episodes. After that story became...such a cliche and meaningless that it makes you forget how good story was for the first few episodes. Also this anime ends without a proper final, when i was watching it i said ""ok i wonder what will happen in Ep. 13"" but when i logged in MAL i saw there won\'t be any episodes, so this anime lacks a final as well. I\'m sad that a story this unique wasted in such a bad way like this.Art: 5/10Nothing remarkable here, just your usual art stuff on mission.Sound: 5/10Ok, i will be honest this show has the best opening sound among the animes it was aired together. It also has a very very good ending song too but thats about it. I don\'t remember any melodies or any kind of OST vibe from this anime so we can say sound division only consists of opening and ending on this one and nothing far from that. Still since OP and ED was really good pieces i can give this a 5.Characters: 2/10There are 3 characters in this anime, which is Rui, Hina and main douchebag. Other than that characters are only and only appears in that anime to say some fancy stuff to these 3 characters. Other than that they are just a waste of thime, you wont be getting side characters stories or anything like that, i mean you wont be really getting the feelings of main characters as well so this is something you can expect i guess? Well its sad that this anime is horrible character wise.Enjoyment: 8/10Apart from some awkwardly odd filler episodes in a 12 episode anime (ones with side characters ""stories"") i really enjoyed it. I mean i dont know how can i enjoy this that much. I hope it was not my guilty pleasure or anything like that but i mean to be honest i really didnt get bored at all while watching this.Overall:If there is no season 2 while you are reading this review and if you are not already watched this show, don\'t watch it.4/10 such a cliche and meaningless that it makes you forget how good story was for the first few episodes.

You look at the label and think, I like it and open the box. The sight of the first piece is promising. The aftertaste, however, reveals the weaknesses.Story: Starts off with interesting premises and themes, but the anime does not deal with it in depth (3/10)It starts by throwing the viewer directly into the ""act,"" or rather shortly thereafter. The first impression will be ""Wow"", one is used to the fact that it takes 24 episodes in the melodramatic...soap opera, until the protagonists kiss at all. This is by no means a bad idea for an anime with only 12 episodes, but there is also the danger that it will appear too constructed. Business as usual, one might say, but to keep up the pace of the story, the number of coincidences along the plot just gets too big. In this way, the characters are not included in the story but thrown from one situation to another.Characters: Complex, but not really tangible (4/10)Unfortunately, the viewer is unable to connect to the characters because the plot is overly constructed (see above: ""Story""). The cast is not bad, the characters have both good and bad qualities. They could be really interesting, but due to the lack of connection to the audience, one does not really feel or care about them.Tachibana, Rui:A little secret, she is the real protagonist, but her character is doomed to remain one-dimensional. Referring to the characters in the manga, her characterization is the biggest loss in the anime. She appears as a cold and analytical girl who has problems getting in social contact. All her fears and doubts and what she does to overcome them are little hinted at. It was waived a lot, which is a pity.Fujii, Natsuo:He seems to be more grounded, than most other male protagonists (for example, Matsuura, Yuuu from Marmalade Boy) in this genre. This makes him special in a certain way, on the other hand a little farouche, but at the same time he cares about Rui, Hana and his family. It\'s a bit hypocritical and his character is a mixed bag to me, some may find him great, but he\'s not my favorite. In the end, it is not surprising that he throws his actual character development out of the window again.Tachibana, Hina:She is not a bad person but she does not live up to her social position as a teacher because of her too young and thoughtless behavior, in the end she makes every mistake one can make to hurt herself and all her relatives. She does not do it on purpose, but it was clear from the beginning that it was not a good idea.Life is often a bittersweet symphony and if you just pick the sweetness, then the music is all the more bitter in the end.Kobayashi, Masaki:A side charakter but the most interesting one, the series has to offer. His background is diverse, as an ex yakuza (elderst son of a Yakuza Oyabun) and has a typical Yakuza style tattoo that covers his back. He delivers most of the comedy in the show, but surprisingly he is also the voice of reason. A good example is the third episode in which Hina\'s love problem and the family come together in L\'amant.Visuals: Less, than can be expected from a 2019 anime (4/10)The visuals are not impressive, the character design is not bad, but simply generic. In addition, on a closer look there are many little things that worsen the overall picture e.g. outlines that look like bold pencil strokes. This art style nicely underscores the occasional comedy, but on the other hand, it rubs the credibility of what that show could have done differently, an realistic attempt to examine family dramas, forbidden relationships, and internal conflicts that tortures the victims souls. But in that way there is not much left that really sets this show apart from others in this genre. Some may find the background art nice, but the CG is way too neat. A small crack in the wall or a little sign of decay would be a lot more realistic. For this reason, the art as a whole looks a bit artificial, the combination of CG and drawing parts do not merge into a pleasant overall picture. The animation is not at a high level. It is not immediately noticeable, because genre-typical, much screen time is spent with conversations without action sequences. But if you look, for example the background more closely one notices that no cloud moves and the hair and hairstyles have only little movements. In the very rare cases of seeing someone running, it does not look natural, as in Episode 4, when Rui and Natsuo follow Hina. All in all, the animation (Imho) is substandard for a 2019 anime.Sounds: good VA, uninspiring music & not always good sound effects (5/10)The BGM composed by Kouda, Masato, is not very inspiring and has little accentuating effect. For example, the meetings in Café L`amant, the music does not really express the emotionality of the current situations or dialogues. On the other hand, the BGM emphasizes in less important sequences too much that a feeling of ""much ado about nothing"" comes up. All in all, the music is not well balanced and can not mitigate the already below-average overall picture.Similar to the background music, I found the sound effects often unbalanced. They were sometimes unnaturally loud and direct, as if crowded in the foreground instead of supporting the scenario.The first OP ""Kawaki o Ameku"" is performed by Minami, a young Japanese singer and songwriter, her favorite genres are modern J-pop and rock. The OP is not my favorite, although the music is not bad, the OP does not fit the anime. Animation and lyrics of the OP would rather fit a good psychological anime.The ED ""Wagamama"" is sung by Takigawa, Alisa. Her pleasant voice you may already know from the ED ""Sayonara no Yukue"" from the anime ""Owarimonogatari"". The ED is a soft J-pop and the arrangement is close to a typical Idol song. Although the music, the voice and the lyrics are good, the animation confuses me a bit, but that`s just a little thing.My favorite is the ED ""Always"" by Takigawa, Alisa. Although the song is heavily influenced by the European art of music management. It\'s done well, music and vocals fit together perfectly. A wonderful piano playing that accompanies the beautiful singing, while the orchestra creates a sonorous musical space for the singer and the piano.Concering the dubbing voices, I especially noticed the voice of Tsuda, Kenjirou as Kobayashi, Masaki. The ambivalence in the voice between a former yakuza and the current coquettish Elusteren person Masaki (sorry) ""Marie"" was portrayed very well and convincingly.As for the female voice actors, I especially noticed the voice of Uchida, Maaya as Tachibana, Rui. She portrayed well, an unemotional girl, her speech was almost without emphasis, but at the right opportunity her acting showed the true emotions. That was pretty good.All in all, I do not recommend Domestic na Kanojo. Notwithstanding its other shortcomings, the anime does not grapple enough with the chosen themes to thrill fans of drama and psychological, nor is it innovative and funny enough to entertain the fans of romcom well.Thanks for reading. soap opera, until the protagonists kiss at all.

Despite having over a 7 on MAL currently, these reviews and the plot description given above might give potential viewers the wrong idea regarding the quality of this anime.  Is it good?  I must admit that I didn\'t exactly enjoy it all the way through.Initially, I very much liked the anime.  Yes, it starts with something of a highly improbable setup.  These kinds of things simply do not happen in real life, that your first...happens to become your sister and move in with you and your parents, both new and old.  That and your unrequited love, who happens to be your teacher at school also comes with that package.  It doesn\'t happen; you are more likely to be stuck by lightning or win the lottery.If we factor out the contrived nature of the plot, then there is another critical point to address: many reviewers seem so disgusted by the anime they are actually angry.  They are unhappy to such a degree they are calling these characters and the anime as a whole things like ""trash"".  May I gently suggest that the way these characters in this anime behave are how the majority of people behave in real life?  If you have never been faced with a difficult situation, then count your blessings and be glad of your good fortune.  Most of the rest of humanity deals with unfulfilled desires and poor judgment.  My observation is simply that, when actually faced with such difficult trials, the majority of us fail the first time to do the right thing.Don\'t get me wrong; I\'m a bit of a judgmental, self-righteous prick myself.  Or at least I was, before I started trying to understand other people and their motivations.  The thing is, this anime is actually quite realistic in portraying unrequited love and the desperation people feel.  Among all types of human interaction, love is the only area that seems to be a no-holds barred rule-less wasteland where it seems people can hurt each other in the worst way possible and it\'s perfectly legal.  To those calling the MC a terrible person devoid of personality, I can only imagine they have never felt the terrible longing that only comes from wanting someone you cannot have.  I\'m not saying that\'s good or bad, it\'s just how it is.  Obviously, the MC does some things that he should not have.  He also makes some good decisions, too, if these reviewers were simply mature enough to notice.Likewise, neither Hina nor Rui are bad characters.  Their motivations are understandable if you factor out how odd and unlikely their situation is.  I particularly liked Rui: instead of the standard anime trope of a girl who lacks any connection to the rest of humanity, Rui can at times be funny and sympathetic.  She is trying her best, but simply lacks the talent or experience needed to be a social butterfly.  She doesn\'t understand her new feelings and is trying to work through them without a handbook.  None of us have a handbook when it comes to love, only the jaded judgmental eyes of our peers and the anecdotal wisdom of the masses.  Neither should count as good advice in the affairs of the heart.Hina, I will admit, comes off rather less well.  Her heart is not constant, her motivations are muddy and seem largely born of insecurity.Ironically, this insecurity is what drives reviewers of this anime to express such disgust.  People are unhappy seeing the ugliness inside their own hearts, and so in public forums try their hardest to distance themselves from dirty or unsightly feelings and expressions.  Or perhaps the simple lack of experience and insecurity makes them quick to judge others.  If you have never felt that you would risk anything and everything just for a smile from a specific person, then perhaps you cannot understand why people would act as they do in this anime.Will you enjoy watching this show?  My enjoyment rather soured about halfway through the series but not because I thought the characters were ""trash"" or that the anime was poorly made.  I am simply a hopeless romantic and I like who I like.  I tend to ship certain parties and they almost always end up NOT being the parties the writers put together (temporarily or otherwise).  You will only enjoy this anime if you have an open mind about relationships.  It will help if life has smacked you around enough that you\'ve picked up a little wisdom.  Wise people know not to judge others from a position of ignorance. happens to become your sister and move in with you and your parents, both new and old.

Or at least I was, before I started trying to understand other people and their motivations.  The thing is, this anime is actually quite realistic in portraying unrequited love and the desperation people feel.  Among all types of human interaction, love is the only area that seems to be a no-holds barred rule-less wasteland where it seems people can hurt each other in the worst way possible and it\'s perfectly legal.  To those calling the MC a terrible person devoid of personality, I can only imagine they have never felt the terrible longing that only comes from wanting someone you cannot have.  I\'m not saying that\'s good or bad, it\'s just how it is.  Obviously, the MC does some things that he should not have.  He also makes some good decisions, too, if these reviewers were simply mature enough to notice.Likewise, neither Hina nor Rui are bad characters.  Their motivations are understandable if you factor out how odd and unlikely their situation is.  I particularly liked Rui: instead of the standard anime trope of a girl who lacks any connection to the rest of humanity, Rui can at times be funny and sympathetic.  She is trying her best, but simply lacks the talent or experience needed to be a social butterfly.  She doesn\'t understand her new feelings and is trying to work through them without a handbook.  None of us have a handbook when it comes to love, only the jaded judgmental eyes of our peers and the anecdotal wisdom of the masses.  Neither should count as good advice in the affairs of the heart.Hina, I will admit, comes off rather less well.  Her heart is not constant, her motivations are muddy and seem largely born of insecurity.Ironically, this insecurity is what drives reviewers of this anime to express such disgust.  People are unhappy seeing the ugliness inside their own hearts, and so in public forums try their hardest to distance themselves from dirty or unsightly feelings and expressions.  Or perhaps the simple lack of experience and insecurity makes them quick to judge others.  If you have never felt that you would risk anything and everything just for a smile from a specific person, then perhaps you cannot understand why people would act as they do in this anime.Will you enjoy watching this show?  My enjoyment rather soured about halfway through the series but not because I thought the characters were ""trash"" or that the anime was poorly made.  I am simply a hopeless romantic and I like who I like.  I tend to ship certain parties and they almost always end up NOT being the parties the writers put together (temporarily or otherwise).  You will only enjoy this anime if you have an open mind about relationships.  It will help if life has smacked you around enough that you\'ve picked up a little wisdom.  Wise people know not to judge others from a position of ignorance.', ""Well I was reading DomeKano before the announcement of this adaptation and I was so hyped about this.The PV visuals looked promising,the voice acting sounded promising and that OP was just hot damn.The first three episodes were really good they exactly followed the manga so the character development was going really well,visuals were perfect,the songs were perfect,voice acting was really good buuuut it all went downhill from here.They started to cut off bits and pieces from manga in a classic fashion to fit the series to a 12 ep season.For example they cut of the camping arc which is one of the key points of...the manga and made you understand a lot of thing characters did and why they did it but since they cut it all off it things that characters did seemed awkard and stupid.I REALLY REALLY RECOMMEND READING THE MANGA fROM THE SCRATCH.This series broke my heart with it's broken promise.Could've been an anime of the year candidate , WHAT A SHAME the manga and made you understand a lot of thing characters did and why they did it but since they cut it all off it things that characters did seemed awkard and stupid.I REALLY REALLY RECOMMEND READING THE MANGA fROM THE SCRATCH.This series broke my heart with it's broken promise.Could've been an anime of the year candidate , WHAT A SHAME"", ""The OP is absolute fire! Basically why I watched this show in the first placeThe animation reminds me of the uglier stuff from the early 2000's. Not very memorable character design, and visually the show can get incredibly boring (especially during kissing scenes) where one shot can last five-six seconds.Character actions don't make sense and there's always this silly plot device of open doors ruining shit. The ending is also ridiculous and seems shoehorned in.I also really recommend watching this anime at 2x speed, especially in the later half of the show, as gets really fucking boring.

But is it any good?Romance anime is often plagued by pacing issues. Put simply, it usually takes awhile for anything of consequence to actually happen. And who wants to wait 50 episodes for a kiss when the characters can start banging halfway through the first episode? But we’re just scratching the surface.If you’ve read the synopsis, you know the setup. Boy is in love with teacher. Boy can’t have teacher. Boy sleeps with random girl. Boy’s widowed father marries these two girls’ divorced mother, and now all three of them are step-siblings living under the same roof. What...unfolds is the classic “which step-sister should I be hooking up with?” scenario that children and adults alike all know and love. Feeling soap opera-y yet?Now, is the show all smut? No. Certainly it does tackle some serious topics such as infidelity, the world’s increasingly loose definition of “family”, and “social suicide”, among other things. Some are done well, some aren’t. The story-line surrounding infidelity was probably the most well-done part of the series. It really captured the agony that it can cause outside of the people directly involved, as well as the fact these situations are not always as black and white as you might think.Now, to touch on the characters a bit. The main trio consists of the protagonist Natsuo and his new step-sisters Rui, whom he hooked up, and Hina, the teacher he’s in love with. The most likable is Rui, who despite her tsundere tendencies, is actually shown to be quite a caring person and fairly honest with her feelings. The most interesting is probably Hina, because she is just such a wild card. Her feelings are more difficult to figure out than the other two, and often leave her very conflicted. I don’t have a ton to say about Natsuo, his character is sort of “meh”. The best compliment I can give him is we usually knew where his heart lied. Oh, and at least he didn’t take advantage of the hot but emotionally-damaged Momo, so there’s that.The art was slightly above average for the genre, but don’t expect to be wowed. The character models were fine. Natuso and Hina’s in particular were a tad generic. Top-notch tongue physics. You’ll be seeing a lot of that.Onto sound. The only voice acting performance that stood out to me was Maaya Uchida as Rui. The delivery had a nice mix of dryness and sass, while also nailing the few emotional outbursts Rui had. The OP was solid, but definitely not the best of the season.So, all in all, would I say Domestic Kanojo is a good anime? No. It’s pretty low-brow and a lot of the situations are both contrived and melodramatic. But it held my attention, so that should count for something. Just not enough to warrant a high score. unfolds is the classic “which step-sister should I be hooking up with?” scenario that children and adults alike all know and love.

After a while you just want to follow Natsuo\'s journey to see where he ends up. Every time something that  shouldn\'t happen,happens, and somehow it doesn\'t get old.The animation was lacking for pretty much the whole season, there are so many episodes...where minutes pass and it\'s just a still image, and the characters continue talking , sometimes if you are lucky the perspective will change but the still image is still there, just the mouth is moving.There are some moments where it was actually decent but it was mostly in the first episodes.The sound design was average , there wasn\'t anything spectacular, but sometimes the voices sounded weird , it happens a few times throughout the whole season and it can be kinda annoying.The characters were so shallow , Rui was the only one I was content with her development , Natsuo an good character until the later episodes where the pacing just went crazy same thing for Hina. The other cast was very poorly developed , all members of the Literature Club had one episode each to get to know them , after that they were just forgotten. The same can be said for the other support cast except Fumiya and Mary.It was a very fun ride at the start, the drama was soo good. After that a few episodes passed and then everything went downhill , the pacing was destroyed , the characters , everything started getting worse and worse. And by the end I was just angry.On a brighter note , the op is amazing , the song made by Minami is a masterpiece.Overall I think I ended up hating the series so much after I realised how much they butchered the source material. Maybe if it wasn\'t for that I would\'ve brushed it off as ""Just an average story with bad characters"".If over the top drama is your thing you will love this, if you like incest but not incest because they aren\'t blood related even better . If you liked the first episodes continue but if you didn\'t don\'t expect it to get better.This was my first review so , sorry if it wasn\'t a good review, also while I\'m here, read the manga , a much better choice. where minutes pass and it\'s just a still image, and the characters continue talking , sometimes if you are lucky the perspective will change but the still image is still there, just the mouth is moving.There are some moments where it was actually decent but it was mostly in the first episodes.The sound design was average , there wasn\'t anything spectacular, but sometimes the voices sounded weird , it happens a few times throughout the whole season and it can be kinda annoying.The characters were so shallow , Rui was the only one I was content with her development , Natsuo an good character until the later episodes where the pacing just went crazy same thing for Hina.

Do they even exist for their purpose? These questions were explored in this anime, and the answers were clear:• 1) Seems like the doors in Japan may or may not have locks, but we will never know, as there were so many sticky situations Natsuo gets himself into because he simply didn\'t close the fucking door. This leads to Hina catching Natsuo and Rui making out on Rui\'s bed. Yikes. It is fair to conclude that the door was left open due to the anime producer powers. Must be that.Let\'s backtrack a...bit.Before I begin, let me clear things up and mention that there are only TWO sex scenes. And they reveal nothing.Anyways.This anime was an attempt at an enjoyable slice of life/drama. It has been a while since I watched a slice of life and I am glad I chose this one to see. It was so trash that I couldn\'t help but enjoy watching it flop. The visuals were fine. There was always a change of pace and different environments. The drama and suspense were actually pretty enticing. Watching various characters make the same stupid brainless mistakes over and over again was quite fun. The soundtrack was good here and there.Now let\'s dive a bit deeper.Despite being enjoyable at the surface, I finished the anime with distaste sprinkled with disappointment.Fundamentally, the problem lies in the characters. Not only were they 2-D cardboard cutouts, but also spewed clichéd lines nonstop.It it was truly hard to really like any character.- Hina was internally weak and had a overly cheerful cringey bimbo persona with the IQ of a goldfish.- Natsuo was a misplaced sims character with a personality as bland as gritz. He clearly didn\'t know what love was and was always ""keeping his options open"" (letting things happen that easily could have been stopped just so he has fallback options).- Rui was a socially awkward piece of cardboard who was ALL KINDS OF WACK. In fact, I actually grew to hate her character as the series progressed. She was creepily assertive, did not understand what consent was, and stuck her nose where it didn\'t belong. You\'d think it was quite obvious that Natsuo only thought of her as his one night stand from centuries back, but she clearly wanted to avoid the facts. It was always what SHE wanted. Not if others wanted it too.This leads me to the comparision between Hina and Rui. These girls are stark opposites whose only similarity was their feelings for Natsuo.But here is the thing: Hina\'s feelings for Natsuo were kind of understandable based on the events that took place between them over the course of the episodes. But the feelings Rui has for Natsuo were confusing and left a rancid taste in my mouth. There was barely any chemistry between them apart from the fact that they had a one night stand in the past. That\'s it. And not to mention, she peristed that Natsuo act like nothing happened between them in the past. Huh? It felt so revolting when she expressed her love towards Natsuo by forcibly kissing him or begging to be kissed. I felt second hand embarrasement for her pathetic actions throughout the entire course of the anime.Now let\'s move back to the main character.Fundamentally, there was nothing great about Natsuo. He was a bland, boring, yawn-inducing shell of a sims character. But our female characters think otherwise it seems.He could be taking a shit on the classroom floor, and attract any female within a 10 mile radius. He had no distinct personality traits, and yet, Rui, Hina, and Momo were drooling over him.To add on to the mess, Natsuo\'s feelings for Hina were so ungrounded. He claimed he loved her, but it was honestly nothing more than a hormonal teenage crush. Cue to the creepy scene where he tries to kiss her when she is asleep drunk. Pathetic.Another point I must make it how dumb Natsuo was. When Natsuo started going to Hina\'s apartment, why did Natsuo lie to Rui saying he was at Fumiya\'s place!!?!? There were so many things he could have came up with, such as""None of your business.""""Walking around.""""Nowhere special.""He could have just not told her a specific reason. Rui isn\'t Natsuo\'s mother or girlfriend so it was none of her business to begin with.There were so many situations Natsuo got into with both Rui and Hina that were easy to keep stable, but he made it a catastrophe because he couldn\'t be honest with both parties.Now Hina on the other hand had no excuse. She was a full blown adult who not only had an two year affair with a man who was once her teacher (seriously though wtf), but also ended up falling for Natsuo, a student in the school she teaches at. Natsuo. The same guy she caught making out with her younger sister. Why would you fall for someone who has a thing going on with your younger sister? The forced drama in a cardboard cut out anime was painful to watch.The best parts were in episode 11.Quotes:""I\'m so lame."" -Natsuo.""I\'m a weak person."" -Hina(Not making it up look for it yourself)The anime made attempts at making us choose a side (Rui or Hina), but in the end, I didn\'t like either of them. Hell, I would have been happy if he ended up with loose Momo... or Ashihara.......or even Fumiya. bit.Before I begin, let me clear things up and mention that there are only TWO sex scenes.

That\'s it. And not to mention, she peristed that Natsuo act like nothing happened between them in the past. Huh? It felt so revolting when she expressed her love towards Natsuo by forcibly kissing him or begging to be kissed. I felt second hand embarrasement for her pathetic actions throughout the entire course of the anime.Now let\'s move back to the main character.Fundamentally, there was nothing great about Natsuo. He was a bland, boring, yawn-inducing shell of a sims character. But our female characters think otherwise it seems.He could be taking a shit on the classroom floor, and attract any female within a 10 mile radius. He had no distinct personality traits, and yet, Rui, Hina, and Momo were drooling over him.To add on to the mess, Natsuo\'s feelings for Hina were so ungrounded. He claimed he loved her, but it was honestly nothing more than a hormonal teenage crush. Cue to the creepy scene where he tries to kiss her when she is asleep drunk. Pathetic.Another point I must make it how dumb Natsuo was. When Natsuo started going to Hina\'s apartment, why did Natsuo lie to Rui saying he was at Fumiya\'s place!!?!? There were so many things he could have came up with, such as""None of your business.""""Walking around.""""Nowhere special.""He could have just not told her a specific reason. Rui isn\'t Natsuo\'s mother or girlfriend so it was none of her business to begin with.There were so many situations Natsuo got into with both Rui and Hina that were easy to keep stable, but he made it a catastrophe because he couldn\'t be honest with both parties.Now Hina on the other hand had no excuse. She was a full blown adult who not only had an two year affair with a man who was once her teacher (seriously though wtf), but also ended up falling for Natsuo, a student in the school she teaches at. Natsuo. The same guy she caught making out with her younger sister. Why would you fall for someone who has a thing going on with your younger sister? The forced drama in a cardboard cut out anime was painful to watch.The best parts were in episode 11.Quotes:""I\'m so lame."" -Natsuo.""I\'m a weak person."" -Hina(Not making it up look for it yourself)The anime made attempts at making us choose a side (Rui or Hina), but in the end, I didn\'t like either of them. Hell, I would have been happy if he ended up with loose Momo... or Ashihara.......or even Fumiya.', ""Thoroughly enjoyed this anime. If I'd use a word to describe it; realistic comes to mind. Finally a male protagonist who has women interested in him who doesn't just awkwardly reject them without realizing it or being obtusely oblivious of the female attention, at least not to the usual extreme degree that most MCs exhibit. Any teenage male in his position would make the same decisions as he does and he still comes out as being more mature and virtuous than most youth.While there is nudity, it doesn't seem particularly fanservice-y. Obviously it's still fanservice but it makes sense that Rui is ok with...being nude around Natsuo once or twice considering the premise of this show is they have sex to begin with. The other fanservice of the older sister; Hina is realistic in the sense that she'd grown up living in an all women's home and it didn't cross her mind to dress a bit more modestly with men around.I love that all the characters are messy and flawed, bouncing through the story without some grandiose plan but rather just like how people live, one step at a time, overthinking things, not being able to understand others emotions but trying to. It's all so refreshing and an exit from the tired old tropes of anime rom-coms. Natsuo actually earns the attention of the women who want him which contrasts with most harem anime's out there.Art is wonderful, and so is the music and sound. Side characters don't get too much but even they seem to have a depth and aren't just plain antagonists or protagonists. I will acknowledge that the events within the story are perhaps a tad dramatized but show me a rom-com where that isn't the case.Overall absolutely would recommend this anime, i'm going to be keenly waiting for a season 2 and I might actually read the manga which i've never done before after finishing a show. being nude around Natsuo once or twice considering the premise of this show is they have sex to begin with.

I am not a big Romance or Rom-com fan with anime but I chose to give this one and a few others a try. This 12 episode anime is by far the best out of the Romance genre that I have seen (as limited as that may be). The story is decently written as the characters are well developed given the short length of the show. I think the show does a good job of showing the stakes of what people are risking and the possible consequences. Unlike other...romance and Rom-com shows the characters are not as bland or have a harem of “perfect but different” girls to choose from.Unfortunately the 12 episode show does not really end the story instead going for more of a cliffhanger.

First things first, this anime is hilarious. I don\'t know why it doesn\'t have a comedy tag because I\'ve never seen an anime that made me laugh so hard.I\'m seeing a lot of people harshly judging the characters moral actions in this anime but I think its important to keep in mind that people are emotional beings and often times, the right course of action isn\'t completely clear. Nothing the characters do in this anime isn\'t something that a lot of normal people do,...especially in high school.

Most kids\' favorite time of the school day is lunch or recess. Mine was walking into Ms. Grubbly-Plank\'s class and seeing her beautiful form preparing for the day\'s lesson. The rest of the students would filter in to class, chittering about this and that. My focus, however, was like a hawk laser-focused on a tasty morsel. I sat at the front of the class to get the best view. Sensei would usually begin the lesson by pulling down the projector screen from its ceiling enclosure,...which meant a few precious seconds where her ample posterior was on full display.

My heart leapt as my mind raced. Did Sensei reciprocate my feelings? What will we name our first-born child? I personally was set on Mikasa if it was a girl. Eren for a boy.

I give it an 8.', 'THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS AND REALLY FILTHY LANGUAGE!This is my first review so bear with me.This is one of the worst anime shows I\'ve seen in a while, and it\'s so bad I had to get this out. I\'m going to start off with the pros/good parts of the show and talk about those first.The Good:I think everyone can agree that the art and sound of this show are very solid. The quality of the art in this show is better than the quality of art from some genuinely good shows and you can tell a lot of care went into crafting the backgrounds and...character designs. The animation is also solid and blends together well with the art. Diomedea should be proud for the work they did in this respect, and I hope they get a chance to work on a better series so they can properly show off what they can do.The best part of the show is the opening, which highlights these two aspects (Sound and Art) spectacularly! The artist, Minami, who performed the opening song is someone I was familiar with before watching this show, and I ultimately discovered the show because of her song, ""Crying for Rain,"" aka the opening song. I found the opening on youtube and rewatched it several times before deciding to check out the show to see if it was any good. SPOILER ALERT: It wasn\'t.Next, there are 3 good characters in the show: Rui (one of the main characters of this series) and the two parents of the three main characters (who are sadly almost never in the show).I\'ll talk about why the parents are good in the Bad section of the review (it\'ll make sense why later), but for now, let\'s discuss Rui.Rui is one of two characters we meet at the very beginning of the show and she\'s the character who starts pushing the plot along. The first scene of episode 1 involves both her and Natsuo (THE main character) finishing sex. She puts her braw back on, and we discover from Natsuo\'s private thoughts that it was his first time.What\'s unique about Rui is the way she behaves. Rui, at first, seems like a typical socially awkward tsundere girl. A lot of her decisions naturally do not make sense, such as asking a stranger to have sex out of the blue or transferring to a new school where all the girls want to be her friend and go out of there way to talk to her and ask for her phone number to hang out later, and seemingly shutting them down by saying it\'s pointless. She also speaks in a monotone voice, and many of her actions and words don\'t actually convey what she is actually feeling.Most people probably haven\'t figured this out (and I never see anyone mention this about her online), but from these points we can reliably surmise that Rui has some kind of autism, and when you recognize this, the pieces begin to fall into place. She has trouble making friends because she can\'t see how the way she behaves puts off other people, and unless one knows her well enough or begs the question, one probably would never guess that she actually desires to make friends in the first place.Throughout the first couple of episodes, Natsuo interacts with her and Rui starts to slowly unravel in a relatively organic and (mostly) charming way. There are some really uncomfortable and dumb moments that happen with her character (like asking Natsuo to shove a pill up her ass), but that\'s because of the terrible writing more so than the character.The relationship between Rui and Natsuo works really well, and it\'s no wonder why she\'s most people\'s favorite to win Natsuo\'s affection. Unlike so many characters in this show, Rui is NOT a plot device. She\'s a genuine character. I genuinely wanted to see how she developed as a person, which is more than I can say for any of the other characters in the show.I do appreciate that the main male character is not some narcissistic nerd (who\'s secretly special and nobody knows it) who miraculous gets the girl by being nice and respecting her and being a shoulder to cry on without actually doing anything or being someone that would be attractive to a beautiful girl. Natsuo gets laid. No funny business (relatively speaking). No big romantic gestures to try and win her heart. Just, ""hey, wanna fuck?"" ""yeah, let\'s go."" That doesn\'t mean the relationships are any less realistic. In fact, in some ways, it\'s even more unrealistic than typical beta male romance plots.Subjectively, the show is very enjoyable. It\'s fun to watch and see how the characters engage with each other and it\'s ironically fun to find out how the show will get worse and worse with every passing episode, kind of like watching a car crash video on youtube; you know what happened to the driver is horrible, but you enjoy watching it anways.The Bad:The story and plot are a disaster and filled with cliches. They\'re arguably the worst parts of the show (the characters are slightly worse in my opinion). Since finishing Domestic Girlfriend, I\'ve done some research on the show and it’s reputation. I’ve checked out the show\'s reviews from several people on and off this site as well as going through Gigguk\'s videos on youtube. I\'ve heard some rumors on the internet about the manga\'s ending, which I hear is horrible. I can\'t really say much for the manga as I haven\'t read it, but when it comes to the show, they\'re all correct. This show is a mess, and the story is mainly the reason why.The plot forces drama every chance it gets. It puts characters in improbable and uncomfortable situations in order to produce tension between the characters (many times, sexual tension) artificially at the most bizarre moments. When these moments happen, they completely catch you off guard, not because of good and unpredictable writing, but because much of it makes no sense whatsoever.When I first watched this anime, I didn\'t know it was considered to be an ""incest"" anime (bear with me here. I\'m not stupid) and I only discovered that after reading the reviews. This is not an incest anime. Rui said it best when she stated that Natsuo and her, while LEGALLY considered siblings, are not truly siblings because they are not related by blood.While the story would have been a lot worse if they had been blood-related, this is still bad because the story forces this false idea that somehow sleeping with your stepsister, who just became your stepsister in your late teens a couple days ago, even after already having had sex with her before ever becoming or knowing they\'d become siblings, is somehow just as bad or anywhere on the same level as actual incest.Imagine if you slept with a girl, made her your girlfriend (no, this part isn\'t in the actual anime. I\'m just making a point), and suddenly both of your individual parents decide to get married, and now you\'re living together under the same roof. Viola! You’re technically brother and sister! Does that make it wrong to continue the relationship? No. Are you going to end it? Probably not (though some might) because you aren\'t siblings to begin with. Blood matters, but the plot tries to make the relationship naughty and exciting as though something wrong is happening, and it fails completely.Since the beginning of the show, Natsuo, the male lead (15 or 16 years old, can\'t remember) is in love with his teacher, Hina, who is older than he is (23-24 years old). In my opinion, the age difference isn\'t that big of a deal since they are both considerably young and relatively close in age, but I understand why people still gawk at it.Long story short, the two eventually fall in love with each other and have sex towards the end of the series. I don\'t mind that the story contains this relationship in the story (or the actual sex scenes themselves if you watched the uncensored version, as I did). What I do have a problem with is that the series glorifies the idea of an underage student having a sexual/romantic relationship with an adult female all while knowing it won\'t work out and deluding themselves into thinking it somehow can. It\'s ridiculous! I mean, the teenage boy she\'s sleeping with, who isn\'t even 18, actually proposes to her, his adult teacher, and, even after she came to the decision on her own to break up with him, EVEN AFTER they\'ve only been together for a short time, a month at most... she says YES!!!Hina is a DESERVEDLY hated character because she is not only a slut and a terrible person, but because she also seeks to justify her bad behavior, whether it\'s having an affair with her former high school teacher or coming onto her step-brother, kissing him passionately, shoving him onto her bed, getting on top of him, ripping open his button-down shirt to reveal his chest, feeling him, and then immediately telling him to fuck off for being a child when she\'s acting like a child herself. Yeah, this is the kind of scenario that actually HAPPENS in this show!Now, back to the incest. If it were real incest, the issue wouldn\'t be the fact that incest is involved in the story. Take Game of Thrones for example: it is an amazing series where two of the major characters are siblings and romantically involved with each other (it happens in other places as well), but you won\'t hear people drawing their pitchforks and torches and ranting about it in that show (and unlike this show, the characters in GoT are actually blood-related). That\'s because the difference between this story and stories like Game of Thrones is that this show tries to make it out to be incest (when it isn\'t) and openly GLORIFIES incestuous relationships (so long as it\'s true love! uwu XD) and it glorifies relationships between adult teachers and underage teens. That\'s simply put: evil.It\'s almost like the story was made to create a scenario where an audience would sympathize with an incestuous/underage romeo and juliet in order to lessen the disgust that most societies have towards the act, despite the fact that most people correctly realize how fucked up and disgusting these kinds of relationships are in real life.I\'ve actually been in relationships with two teachers separately, whom were considerably older than me, when I was in high school and I\'ve known others that were in similar relationships. Whether they\'re consensual or not, they are NEVER healthy for ANYONE involved and are never truly romantic in any way. It\'s purely sexual and emotional, and it becomes depressive and exhausting and keeps you in a constant state of fear that someone will find out. This doesn\'t even factor into the show. It treats the relationship like it\'s just a normal loving relationship between two people who are madly in love except they have to hide it from everyone else because the rules are simply unfair and oppressive because it keeps them apart from each other.And what\'s more, when Hina is caught by her superiors for being involved with a 15/16 year old and is punished for it (very lightly I might add), the show makes her look like a victim (I know she confesses and admits it\'s wrong, but the show made it out to be a big deal with all the main characters become depressed and sad when she is forced to leave). If you take a risk that involves you getting in trouble with the law or getting fired (even if it is unfair), don\'t bitch and moan when you\'re caught and have to suffer the consequences! You reap what you sow. Own it! And if it\'s truly unfair and unreasonable, DON\'T GET CAUGHT DOING IT!!!It\'s disgusting conduct and this show tries, and fails, to dramatize it in a way where the audience is supposed to somehow sympathize with these sick people in these equally sick situations.What I believe is objectively the worst part of the show are the characters themselves, with 3 exceptions. Now, I\'ve discussed why I like Rui in the good section, but I left out the parents until now. The reason why I did so was because I wanted to discuss some of the negatives of the story first. I found it hard to talk about the parents without talking about the story as well.The parents, for one, act like parents. You can tell they genuinely love each other and are concerned for their children because they are constantly worrying about whether or not their kids are actually okay with them getting remarried.Eventually, when both Natsuo and Rui run away from home, their parents naturally assume that their remarriage had been the issue (because in many cases, it is, even if the kids won\'t admit it, especially in Japan) and even considered getting a divorce to try to solve what they believed was the issue (they weren\'t sure if their kids were lying and just pretending to go along with the marriage).One of the best scenes in the show is when both Natsuo and Rui decide to go back home and when they get back late at night, they find their mom and dad, not in bed asleep, but at the kitchen table, in the dark, completely silent with a blank divorce slip still on the table. They are contemplating divorce despite how deeply they love each other deeply and making a huge sacrifice for the sake of their kids. This is a meaningful interaction that says a lot about these parents and is genuinely well written. It was a good example of show, don’t tell, which the show uses rather sparingly.The rest of the characters are awful.I’ve discussed why Hina sucks earlier, but I\'m going to expand upon that a little bit more here: Hina is the worst character in the show because she\'s sleeping with an underage student and acts like a total child. She\'s a drunk who seeks to justify the way she behaves and treats her little sister, Rui, like trash. When she finds out Rui was in love with Natsuo, she has the gall to say that Rui should stop because they’re family, then, a couple of episodes later, Hina ends up dating him! When Natsuo says he wants to be with her, she actually suggests they kill themselves! She\'s just... awful. There is no reason anyone should like her, and the world/characters would probably be better off if she had killed herself like she suggested.Natsuo is the second worse character in the show, only surpassed by you know who. Natsuo, while he gets ass, almost never initiates any of the interactions he has with the women he fucks and he rarely takes the lead (however, he gets better at this the more the show goes on, especially with Hina). The only thing he\'s got going for him is his good looks. In real life, most women would not actually want to fuck this guy, especially if they were living with him.That being said, while those issues do make a character flawed, they don’t necessarily make a character bad in and of itself (nothing wrong with being an average guy with above average looks). It\'s more an issue I have with anime in general; the trend of the gamma male specifically. Although not all anime suffer from the disease that is the ""gamma male wish-fulfillment trend,"" it has become more and more common in anime, especially in shonen and isekai anime.Most of you probably haven\'t heard of the concept of the ""gamma male,"" but I\'m certain you know the type and, more importantly, the way its implicated into stories: the loser beta male is secretly the alpha chad who makes a fool of everyone somehow and miraculously gets the pretty girl simply out of respecting/loving her (as though nobody else could match the love/respect he has for her) despite being either a total loser, a cuck/simp, totally unattractive, entirely delusional, completely inept, weak-willed, emotionally retarded, or more likely a mixture of the bunch. Take your pick.Now, this doesn\'t completely describe the story, which is neither shonen nor isekai, and there are many other anime shows that follow the before-mentioned gamma male storyline trend more completely, but the gamma archetype does describe Natsuo\'s character fairly well, and whenever a romance story has this kind of character as its male lead, I am almost never able to invest myself in the story. It\'s like how some people can’t get into superhero movies for being “too unrealistic.” For me, it\'s the same thing here. Subjective, I know, but hear me out.Natsuo is a weak gamma male who acts emotionally and desperately, and he is COMPLETELY obsessed with his teacher/step-sister, Hina. He manipulates women in order to either make out with them, sleep with them, or make them feel sorry for him, and when he\'s caught, he acts innocent, gets depressed, tries POORLY to explain himself to these women, then does it all over again. He never owns up to any mistake he makes and he plays the victim constantly. That’s his character arc! He doesn’t change!Hina, at the very least, got down on her knees and apologized for sleeping with an underaged student (although an apology doesn\'t make up for borderline pedophilia), but Natsuo NEVER does any of that to anyone. In fact, when Hina loses her job, he locks himself in his room crying for a fucking week!People have actually called Natsuo a chad! How the fuck is this whiny brat a chad? Because he sleeps with a bunch of women? Try acting that way in real life and see how many girls you can get, if you can get any? How can a man as weak and emotional as Natsuo get ANY ass?I respect men who know what they want, go for what they want, and get what they want. Natsuo doesn\'t command ANY respect. He hates himself for the feelings he has for his teacher/step-sister, so in order to forget the way he feels, he tries to force a kiss onto her when she\'s asleep, makes out with his teacher\'s actual younger sister, and almost has sex with the school slut! WHAT!?!?!?!? This is PATHETIC!!Absolutely nothing that happens in this story would ever happen in real life or in most stories written by competent authors because it doesn\'t make sense, and that\'s the crux of the problem. The show is so totally outlandish yet it takes itself way too seriously to the point that you can never accept anything that\'s going on!Onto the minor characters:Momo is yet another girl who vies for Natsuo\'s affection and she\'s an even bigger whore than Hina. In fact, she admits to being with (and sleeping with) at least 30 other guys, and when she finally gets together with Natsuo (which doesn\'t take long at all because she\'s easy), she brings him home and up to her bedroom so they can fuck (keep in mind they pretty much just met at the time that this all happens). After that, she shows up every now and then, but she\'s never really involved in the story ever again. This is bizarre considering she\'s one of the characters highlighted in the opening credits. I will say though that, in my (unpopular) opinion, she is the cutest of the four girls. Oh, and she has slit marks on her wrist for trying to commit suicide.The other gray/green-haired girl in the credits, whose name escapes me (I looked it up, Miu), is a shy and timid girl who seems to have a crush on both Natsuo and her writing teacher (Natsuo and Miu actually flirt at one point in the series), and is perhaps Natsuo\'s best chance for a real, healthy relationship, but nothing ever develops between them and she\'s barely in the show at all. She\'s just his club president and isn\'t really important to the overall story. Admittedly, she\'s not bad, but she doesn\'t really serve any purpose and is hardly even worth mentioning. If you took her out of the story, it wouldn\'t change anything. Again, like Momo, she\'s featured in the opening credits to make you think she\'s important. She\'s introduced, developed, and almost immediately tossed aside.Masaki is a bartender who is gay and is Natsuo\'s confidante; the voice of age and wisdom in the show. He\'s given a backstory; he used to be in the Yakuza, but then he fell in love with another man, so he quit being a gangster so they could be together because... gay relationship. Yay! (I assume the Yakuza aren\'t fond of homosexuality, don\'t know how accurate that is to real life, but it wouldn\'t surprise me) To be fair, he does have some funny moments and some genuinely good dialogue, but for the most part, he serves as a plot device more than an actual character.Reiji, who is a teacher introduced as the literature club\'s sponsor, who I swore was gay when he was introduced (it\'s never confirmed, but I thought he came onto Natsuo towards the end of their first conversation) acts as a mentor to Natsuo (who we suddenly learn dreams of being a novelist out of no where) and his friends. He\'s the stereotypical cool shoujo sigma male that every high school japanese girl swoons over, and he\'s secretly a famous novelist (Natsuo\'s favorite in fact). He\'s actually a decent character, and the only problem I have with him is the more scandalous parts involving his character (aka flirting with Natsuo, a high school boy and appearing to make out with Miu, a high school girl). These scandalous moments do nothing to develop him or anyone else as a character.Fumiya is Natsuo\'s best friend and offers him a place to stay when he runs away from home. He gives some advice and acts as comedy relief. That\'s about all he does.The last character I could talk about is Alex (nicknamed Al), a very attractive, blonde, extraverted American-Japanese immigrant with the worst sounding english dubbing I\'ve ever heard in a SUBBED anime. He has a crush on Rui and it goes LITERALLY nowhere. He becomes friends with Natsuo, and he\'s comedy relief just like Fumiya. Both Natsuo\'s friends are comedy relief and don\'t offer anything else to the story, other than helping him chase down a panty-stealing pervert in the streets of Japan.CONCLUSION:Despite the numerous flaws the show has, I will say this: I had fun. Despite what it may seem, Domestic no Kanojo is entertaining to watch and I was never bored at an point. I was even able to finish it all the way to the end without dropping it, which is more than I can say for other series. (However, that might just be because it only had 12 episodes.)If not for the excellent artwork, sound design/quality, enjoyability, and the handful of decent moments sprinkled throughout this abomination, the show would have been a 2, but it deserves a slightly higher rating of 3/10. I truly feel bad for the studio, Diomedia. If they had the chance to adapt a genuinely good manga into anime with this quality of art and sound, it would have been a huge hit.But as it stands, the show is a disaster in the making. I do not recommend watching it, but that\'s not gonna stop most people from doing so (if they choose to). I hope you enjoy it and get a kick out of it like I admittedly did, despite, well, everything.SHORT VERSION:Story: 3/10 (Bad)Art: 8/10 (Really Good)Sound: 7/10 (Good)Characters: 2/10 (Horrible)Enjoyment (Subjective): 7/10 (Good)Final Score: 3/10 (Bad) character designs. The animation is also solid and blends together well with the art. Diomedea should be proud for the work they did in this respect, and I hope they get a chance to work on a better series so they can properly show off what they can do.The best part of the show is the opening, which highlights these two aspects (Sound and Art) spectacularly! The artist, Minami, who performed the opening song is someone I was familiar with before watching this show, and I ultimately discovered the show because of her song, ""Crying for Rain,"" aka the opening song. I found the opening on youtube and rewatched it several times before deciding to check out the show to see if it was any good. SPOILER ALERT: It wasn\'t.Next, there are 3 good characters in the show: Rui (one of the main characters of this series) and the two parents of the three main characters (who are sadly almost never in the show).I\'ll talk about why the parents are good in the Bad section of the review (it\'ll make sense why later), but for now, let\'s discuss Rui.Rui is one of two characters we meet at the very beginning of the show and she\'s the character who starts pushing the plot along. The first scene of episode 1 involves both her and Natsuo (THE main character) finishing sex. She puts her braw back on, and we discover from Natsuo\'s private thoughts that it was his first time.What\'s unique about Rui is the way she behaves. Rui, at first, seems like a typical socially awkward tsundere girl. A lot of her decisions naturally do not make sense, such as asking a stranger to have sex out of the blue or transferring to a new school where all the girls want to be her friend and go out of there way to talk to her and ask for her phone number to hang out later, and seemingly shutting them down by saying it\'s pointless. She also speaks in a monotone voice, and many of her actions and words don\'t actually convey what she is actually feeling.Most people probably haven\'t figured this out (and I never see anyone mention this about her online), but from these points we can reliably surmise that Rui has some kind of autism, and when you recognize this, the pieces begin to fall into place. She has trouble making friends because she can\'t see how the way she behaves puts off other people, and unless one knows her well enough or begs the question, one probably would never guess that she actually desires to make friends in the first place.Throughout the first couple of episodes, Natsuo interacts with her and Rui starts to slowly unravel in a relatively organic and (mostly) charming way. There are some really uncomfortable and dumb moments that happen with her character (like asking Natsuo to shove a pill up her ass), but that\'s because of the terrible writing more so than the character.The relationship between Rui and Natsuo works really well, and it\'s no wonder why she\'s most people\'s favorite to win Natsuo\'s affection. Unlike so many characters in this show, Rui is NOT a plot device. She\'s a genuine character. I genuinely wanted to see how she developed as a person, which is more than I can say for any of the other characters in the show.I do appreciate that the main male character is not some narcissistic nerd (who\'s secretly special and nobody knows it) who miraculous gets the girl by being nice and respecting her and being a shoulder to cry on without actually doing anything or being someone that would be attractive to a beautiful girl. Natsuo gets laid. No funny business (relatively speaking). No big romantic gestures to try and win her heart. Just, ""hey, wanna fuck?"" ""yeah, let\'s go."" That doesn\'t mean the relationships are any less realistic. In fact, in some ways, it\'s even more unrealistic than typical beta male romance plots.Subjectively, the show is very enjoyable. It\'s fun to watch and see how the characters engage with each other and it\'s ironically fun to find out how the show will get worse and worse with every passing episode, kind of like watching a car crash video on youtube; you know what happened to the driver is horrible, but you enjoy watching it anways.The Bad:The story and plot are a disaster and filled with cliches.

Because he sleeps with a bunch of women? Try acting that way in real life and see how many girls you can get, if you can get any? How can a man as weak and emotional as Natsuo get ANY ass?I respect men who know what they want, go for what they want, and get what they want. Natsuo doesn\'t command ANY respect. He hates himself for the feelings he has for his teacher/step-sister, so in order to forget the way he feels, he tries to force a kiss onto her when she\'s asleep, makes out with his teacher\'s actual younger sister, and almost has sex with the school slut! WHAT!?!?!?!? This is PATHETIC!!Absolutely nothing that happens in this story would ever happen in real life or in most stories written by competent authors because it doesn\'t make sense, and that\'s the crux of the problem. The show is so totally outlandish yet it takes itself way too seriously to the point that you can never accept anything that\'s going on!Onto the minor characters:Momo is yet another girl who vies for Natsuo\'s affection and she\'s an even bigger whore than Hina. In fact, she admits to being with (and sleeping with) at least 30 other guys, and when she finally gets together with Natsuo (which doesn\'t take long at all because she\'s easy), she brings him home and up to her bedroom so they can fuck (keep in mind they pretty much just met at the time that this all happens). After that, she shows up every now and then, but she\'s never really involved in the story ever again. This is bizarre considering she\'s one of the characters highlighted in the opening credits. I will say though that, in my (unpopular) opinion, she is the cutest of the four girls. Oh, and she has slit marks on her wrist for trying to commit suicide.The other gray/green-haired girl in the credits, whose name escapes me (I looked it up, Miu), is a shy and timid girl who seems to have a crush on both Natsuo and her writing teacher (Natsuo and Miu actually flirt at one point in the series), and is perhaps Natsuo\'s best chance for a real, healthy relationship, but nothing ever develops between them and she\'s barely in the show at all. She\'s just his club president and isn\'t really important to the overall story. Admittedly, she\'s not bad, but she doesn\'t really serve any purpose and is hardly even worth mentioning. If you took her out of the story, it wouldn\'t change anything. Again, like Momo, she\'s featured in the opening credits to make you think she\'s important. She\'s introduced, developed, and almost immediately tossed aside.Masaki is a bartender who is gay and is Natsuo\'s confidante; the voice of age and wisdom in the show. He\'s given a backstory; he used to be in the Yakuza, but then he fell in love with another man, so he quit being a gangster so they could be together because... gay relationship. Yay! (I assume the Yakuza aren\'t fond of homosexuality, don\'t know how accurate that is to real life, but it wouldn\'t surprise me) To be fair, he does have some funny moments and some genuinely good dialogue, but for the most part, he serves as a plot device more than an actual character.Reiji, who is a teacher introduced as the literature club\'s sponsor, who I swore was gay when he was introduced (it\'s never confirmed, but I thought he came onto Natsuo towards the end of their first conversation) acts as a mentor to Natsuo (who we suddenly learn dreams of being a novelist out of no where) and his friends. He\'s the stereotypical cool shoujo sigma male that every high school japanese girl swoons over, and he\'s secretly a famous novelist (Natsuo\'s favorite in fact). He\'s actually a decent character, and the only problem I have with him is the more scandalous parts involving his character (aka flirting with Natsuo, a high school boy and appearing to make out with Miu, a high school girl). These scandalous moments do nothing to develop him or anyone else as a character.Fumiya is Natsuo\'s best friend and offers him a place to stay when he runs away from home. He gives some advice and acts as comedy relief. That\'s about all he does.The last character I could talk about is Alex (nicknamed Al), a very attractive, blonde, extraverted American-Japanese immigrant with the worst sounding english dubbing I\'ve ever heard in a SUBBED anime. He has a crush on Rui and it goes LITERALLY nowhere. He becomes friends with Natsuo, and he\'s comedy relief just like Fumiya. Both Natsuo\'s friends are comedy relief and don\'t offer anything else to the story, other than helping him chase down a panty-stealing pervert in the streets of Japan.CONCLUSION:Despite the numerous flaws the show has, I will say this: I had fun. Despite what it may seem, Domestic no Kanojo is entertaining to watch and I was never bored at an point. I was even able to finish it all the way to the end without dropping it, which is more than I can say for other series. (However, that might just be because it only had 12 episodes.)If not for the excellent artwork, sound design/quality, enjoyability, and the handful of decent moments sprinkled throughout this abomination, the show would have been a 2, but it deserves a slightly higher rating of 3/10. I truly feel bad for the studio, Diomedia. If they had the chance to adapt a genuinely good manga into anime with this quality of art and sound, it would have been a huge hit.But as it stands, the show is a disaster in the making. I do not recommend watching it, but that\'s not gonna stop most people from doing so (if they choose to). I hope you enjoy it and get a kick out of it like I admittedly did, despite, well, everything.SHORT VERSION:Story: 3/10 (Bad)Art: 8/10 (Really Good)Sound: 7/10 (Good)Characters: 2/10 (Horrible)Enjoyment (Subjective): 7/10 (Good)Final Score: 3/10 (Bad)', ""First of all, I had a really cynical thought about this anime, I thought it just another Kuzu no Honkai anime. As I watched it through I started to feel that it's kinda different.The storyline and character buildup were all so messed up until the very last episode, which was good, but at the last episode too, right after getting enlightenment, it's like destroying the whole build by the same episode. The character itself, all of them mostly childish but have some development throughout the story.The art and sound are okay since it was produced by a famous and big producer anyway.But overall...it's kinda good to watch but I really don't recommend it, it's fair enough and quite enjoyable, but I see why people are leaving an unpleasant review, because to me itself, it does leave an unpleasant feeling to me.By the way, the opening song itself is awesome, better than the anime itself. it's kinda good to watch but I really don't recommend it, it's fair enough and quite enjoyable, but I see why people are leaving an unpleasant review, because to me itself, it does leave an unpleasant feeling to me.By the way, the opening song itself is awesome, better than the anime itself."", ""*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*As a person who read the manga first, I must say this anime adaptation failed to deliver many things Domestic na Kanojo the manga had before the manga also went to the dumpster fire as well.First of, they did a lot of cutting. And when I say a lot, I mean A LOT. It cuts so much of the character development that the manga establishes early on within the story to the point it makes the dramatic scenes bland and emotionless for the audience watching it. Like no matter who you were shipping, either Rui or Hina, the breakup scene between...the MC and Hina within the manga was heart breaking because it built their characters up with many scenes within the story to get to that point. However, in the case of the anime, since it cuts so much of that stuff the average audience doesn't get that emotional impact the manga delivers. Hell, I didn't get it either from watching it even though I knew the whole detail as I read the manga beforehand.Also, if that wasn't enough. The comedic moments the manga has is not even delivered properly either within this anime. Matter of fact, they cut most of that stuff as well. Is as if they wanted this story to be told in a serious believable manner to the point they cut all the comedic scenarios the manga offered. Which is hilarious cause the premise of this show is already ridiculous enough. So cutting those didn't do this anime any favors either.And lastly, the cutting and editing is so much to the point the scenes feels awkward and confusing. Like that is the only emotion I get from watching this anime. So yeah, avoid this anime at all cost. Like I know the manga also turned into a disaster as I previously mentioned, but at least the manga started okay unlike this anime. Which started from dogshit to still dogshit at the very end.Just horrible. the MC and Hina within the manga was heart breaking because it built their characters up with many scenes within the story to get to that point.

I would describe it as an anime that you want to hate but that you love anyway.The premise of the show easily rivals porn plots, in fact, this show really blurs the line between hentai and anime, thankfully the female characters aren\'t dumb whores, or else this would have easily been categorized as a hentai, but without the sex scenes.Anyway, the premise is about some generic MC called Natsuo that loses his virginity to a goth girl, because...""she wants to know what it feels like"". Oh, and the generic MC also has a crush on his hot young high school teacher. And to spice up the plot, the MC\'s father marries a divorced mother of two daughters. Guess who the two daughters are... That\'s right ! The goth girl and the hot young teacher, and they all live in the same house.Story: 7/10 It\'s original, and it\'s not of these shows that takes 2 seasons for two characters to hold hands, the drama is enjoyable to watch. Although there are some weak points, like the attempt to introduce two random girls in this mess of a love triangle, that was unnecessary.Art: 8/10 The art is fine, just your typical stuff.Sound: 9/10 I liked the OP, everything else is fine.Character: 7/10 I liked the two girls, I didn\'t like the MC.

I only stumbled upon this anime thanks to MAL telling me “Yeah, here you go, dis the type of garbo anime you like, right?” I just genuinely couldn’t stop watching because this whole anime relies on shock value and the culture of today.I’m only wasting my time if I were to even make a detailed review about the plot but all I need to say is that the story only exists for people that “CAN” relate. I mean, yeah, we all know how much of a struggle it is...stop the younger sister of the one you love from banging you, right? Pathetic plot, seriously. 1/10Speaking of garbage characters we also have Natsuo, also translates too “Nut soon” considering he does it more than enough times to make my eyes and ears bleed out. He is the epitome of what we call “A harem gone wrong” more or so cause he’s retarded. Rui here is just your normal average girl, bored to death about life and has nothing to do except bang someone she just met only to find out that person is now her step-brother. The “other” girl, Hina, is your ideal teacher who just can’t seem to hold back on love and it seems whenever she’s in a relationship she only ever thinks about others. Couldn’t ya just be a lil’ more selfish you idiot. I think it’s obvious to say that no-one here actually cared about the consequences of anything and if Hina went to prison I think Natsuo would legitimately blow the whole fucking prison up (Not really) and just save her. Characters are from my point of view pretty garbage. 2/10The art is meh, that’s all I need to say. You’ll find this quality of art style literally in the gutter of anime streaming sites. 5/10The sound is equivalent to the art in quality wise, not too bad, not too good, but uh the “sounds” in bed weren’t the greatest, would’ve of preferred not hearing this damage my perfectly good hearing abilities.No, this isn’t a hentai, but you can bloody say it’s borderline hentai. I genuinely wasted 3 months of my life, waiting each week just so I wouldn’t feel unsatisfied. ((Spoiler)) I felt like the empty carcus of a fly after the last episode.

Its rather low on my scale (note that I watch high school DXD, and The Testament of Sister New Devil) so my scale is a bit off.  While the whole story did remind me of a step fantasy it was very emotional. It\'s not a huge roller coaster of emotions but it definitely has a good amount. I personally enjoy animes that make me question things in life. This one had me questioning: are forbidden love stories really that bad?ArtI don\'t...think about the art enough to give a score.

There is a lack of display of raw emotion, the only preserved aspect is the story, and the most glaringly missing element is the introspective dialogue. In the manga, the mangaka lets the story develop within the dialogue in such an eloquent manner that all the changes, including the massive character development, that happen don't seem so abrupt or absurd. Without the introspection it would've been easy for the story to end up looking ludicrous, and that's exactly what has...happened with the anime.Also, if you wanted to watch the anime to see the beautiful manga titties come to life, you're gonna be horrified to know that there is basically no nudity or explicit sex scenes.So why am I still giving this a 7?

This is shown on how the important desitions the characters take are made in a rush and in a ""just because"" kind of deal. Sure, not every desition is made like that, but key scenes for development where like that, so there\'s not much to save.Their feelings  change...just as fast, this is why the desitions seems so rushed, this happens a lot with Hina for example. Natsuo on the other hand ended up being another harem/love-com/drama character like every other MC on this genres, how so? showing no common sense to its relationships and is blind sighted by (personal opinion) common trash, leading him to making dumb naive desitions.The secondary characters are literally just filling to the plot, they really do little on the MCs life to be relevant and their development is practically non existent.What about Rui? Well, she\'s the only character that actually feels right, she\'s not that dumb taking into count she\'s in love and a teenager, although she doesn\'t get much of work either, that\'s one thing  that left me wanting more at the end. There\'s something about her that just fits and makes the chemistry with Natsuo way better than any other character.That\'s why I didn\'t find this anime amusing and actually understood why, to others, dis likable. The development between Hina and Natsu didn\'t had that *click* to be enjoyable. The MC\'s attitude through the episodes just got worse and worse because of that.Now why I\'m in the middle? I did enjoy the first episodes, because they kept expectancy and tension going. Also it did felt way different than other animes with love triangles, like it was more mature and, in a way, serious(on the scenes and actions interpreted by the characters, no falling from stairs to each other, no accidental sexual touching, no much hiding their feelings when call up, etc, etc. The characters themselves were the problem). Finally for me what saved the series was the final episode, almost everything that went wrong to me, actually got a bit fixed. I found the closure I needed to be satisfied and just enough to not hate the whole thing.Like I said, one thing that left me wanting more was the development on Rui. Her future ended open to viewers imagination, which I liked and felt totally comfortable with it and probably wouldn\'t have like it any other way. just as fast, this is why the desitions seems so rushed, this happens a lot with Hina for example.

Especially voice acting, I can hear my dear Rias Gremory in lovely Hina, why is that I wonder? Good work and thank you Hikasa Yoko as usual! Just don't be a hypocrite and don't try to take is as it should be realistic, natural or genius. This is just a story about 16 years old boy full of unreleased sperm who wanted to bone his hot, THICC sensei who is also a woman with her needs as any real woman. Many boys...want to bone their hot senseis IRL, it is as it is, there is nothing bad or good, terrible or awesome, this is just life as is. The only difference is that Natsuo gets what he wants, but again, this is the point of harem and romance anime genre, a fantasy, a dream that comes true.And despite that, this anime has very touching and romantic moments, and Hina and Natsuo are very romantic and sweet couple, well their love is based on lust.... what am I talking about, all love is based on lust, and everyone wanna fuck each other. And therefore if you see that some person says that that it laughed at episode 7 - you know that it is either soulless person or just a hypocrite who will bash couple he or she doesn't like but will drool over some other couple that is basically the same, and therefore that person opinion should be ignored cause this opinion is unstable and not consistent.I love DG because I love Hina, I have senseis\\onee-chan fetish and I love pornhub incest, and yes when I was 16 I also wanted to bone my hot sensei. Unfortunately real life is shit and is real dumpster fire. I wish my life was more like DG, I need some Hina in my life... want to bone their hot senseis IRL, it is as it is, there is nothing bad or good, terrible or awesome, this is just life as is.

I wish my life was more like DG, I need some Hina in my life..."", 'Story: The story is very interesting in it\'s way of going against some clichés very common in this genre of anime. When people read the anime is about a guy involved in a love triangle with his two step-sisters, people think about anime like kiss x sis, or some harem ecchi generic anime, in which the guy is indecisive, always being attacked by other girls trying to seduce him, and he flirts with everyone and all the girls seems to be ok with it, and so on. This anime is totally different, trying to bring a more realistic approach to this popular concept. The guy...looses his virginity in a very trashy way (1st episode), and then he finds out that her beloved one is not as pure as he thought (i\'m being generous here), and then a situation that should be paradise (having 2 hot step-sisters living with you) becomes a rather troublesome situation, almost provoking divorce of their parents... It is by all means a modern tragedy, as it is now. Of course it is needed to know the end to assure that, but no way it is a comedy. The story ends in a quite open way, of course caused by the lack of episodes available to complete the story, also because the original material  (manga) is still on going. But I have to congratulate the director of this anime for finishing it in a good way, even though i\'m personally a hater of open ending, but the way he did is better than creating a crazy situation to end it completely there, as Ao no Exorcist made the anime community suffer. In general, it is a good story, that\'s not GREAT but it stands out among modern cliché anime.Art: The art in Domestic na Kanojo is good. The style of drawing is the usual we see in post 2010 anime, but it is well made, mainly in terms of light incidence and brightness. The animation is also good, very fluid frames. The scenario  is rich in details, in comparison to normal anime (not compared to Violet Evergarden or masterpieces like this). So if you are a exigent viewer in terms of art, this anime is approved and you won\'t get annoyed watching it.Sound: Soundtrack in any part didn\'t catch out my attention. It means it is not bad, because it didn\'t annoyed me, but also means that it isn\'t very good, as it didn\'t leave me a deep impression. For me it is the part in the production that have less received effort.characters: the main character is a normie guy like in any other highschool anime, but he is better than the usual set. He is decided in what he wants to do and in with who he  wants to be with. He goes through a interesting path of personal maturation that is worth pointing it out. About the two sisters, the older one has some value as she has genuine human actions e motivations, not being idealized or exaggerated. The youngest is just an usual ""blue haired emotionless kudere"" that we all know since ever (or 90s, thank you gainax for evangelion).Enjoyment: I enjoyed this anime quite a lot, because it approaches a context that I\'m used to watch in animes I like in a different way, being more mature and realistic. I wouldn\'t classify it as a seinen experience, but in the middle way between shounen and seinen. It may be a good enrichment of imaginary capacity for youngsters in theirs late 10\'s.Overall, I recommend it to everyone that has watched a lot of animes with love triangle, and goofy protags... and has being sick of it, and desperately needs to escape from wishful thinking dimensional prison.

Big F you.Now that I have vented that out, here\'s the review.This is a story about a boy (the MC) who\'s in love with his teacher, while at the same time he has mixed about her sister. To make matters worse, they are all in the same family (step-brother and step-sister).What makes this a really unique story is that the way it\'s paced is very similar to a mexican soap opera,...or what in some latin countries would be called a ""telenovela"".

Well, without spoiling more then the first episode, it’s a romance anime, but it’s also a sister show. If your familiar enough with anime, you know pretty well what to expect here.Except, this show breaks what must be the number...one rule of anime romance in the first 60 seconds, and actually has the main character getting laid. The rest of the first episode and the show for that matter is a cringe filled mess of realistic and believable characters that you can’t help but feel for.So, is it good?This is completely subjective, and really, really hard for me to say, since it’s a trashy show with amazing character’s. I feel like I can’t call this a great show, but I can’t call it bad either, despite me wanting to say both at the same time.If this doesn’t help at all, I apologize. But I would recommend watching it, so long as your alright with watching cringe heavy romance.Overall, the storyline was completely trash i didnt like it i would rate it 1the character developments was a bit better compared to storyline i might rate it like 2 so if you got plenty of free time or are really intrested in a hentai based storyline with mild nudity then you can go ahead and watch it one rule of anime romance in the first 60 seconds, and actually has the main character getting laid.

The Main Character had no idea how to go after what he wanted and the sheer uncertainty in his actions left me shouting "" DO SOMETHING"" even if that meant walking away. Natsuo was stuck in limbo for the full duration of the series and also had zero idea what he wanted. Beta Cuck Male at it\'s finest and perfect example as to why nice guys finish last.The writing of this was lazy and lacked any real direction, ironically Natsuo wanted to be a writer, probably representing the writers ambitions. I really hope his sex life is nothing near to what resembles...this anime. BIG TALK and when it comes time to shine, he jizzes himself in his pants and can\'t satisfy his girl....I would score this a 10/10 for educational purposes on how to lose all the options you have available to you if you are a man seeking for a female companion.Great Start to the anime, would have scored a 20/10 had the momentum carried through from episode 2 onwards. Started off with a huge spark and fizzled off into a warm fart after a night out of drinking.... Oh well this anime.

IDK what to say the manga is better ig.they are not related but still its weird and hina is an adult whereas natsu is probably a minor.So this is grooming. plus hina was also probably groomed.The anime starts off pretty good with two high school students having sexual intercourse and then becoming step-siblings. Sounds like the most complicated hentai, right?There isn’t really an overarching narrative so much as a collection of short stories. I say this because the flow of the anime is simply atrocious. Characters would go through one...event, such as the arc covering heroine Hina’s relationship problems, only for it to be completely forgotten for several episodes in favor of the protagonist dealing with another issue plaguing a different disturbed girl. And the worst part is that none of the characters ever evolved as people throughout these arcs nor do they learn from their mistakes. None of the scenarios were deep or impactful precisely because hardly anything ever amounted from them. They just seemed like halfhearted attempts to create romantic tension between the characters, and for me, it just didn’t work.But don’t despair, for there is one bright spot amidst all of the mediocrity.The opening theme song, Kawaki wo Ameku, is so good that it has its own anime entry on this site. And it’s much higher rated than the anime itself. Deservedly so, because the song is amazing! The emotion that the vocalist is able to convey is really special, and is something that, from personal experience in the music industry, is hard to accomplish. So hats off to her. Unfortunately, the rest of the soundtrack is plain, and the anime often decides to play upbeat songs during “emotional” moments that further ruin the authenticity of these scenes. Aside from Hina’s seiyuu, the other voice actors just sound so dull and uninterested. Yes, I get that that’s the point when it comes to Rui, but that doesn’t mean that the other girls have to sound so deadbeat. And Natsuo’s seiyuu isn’t any different, though I guess that perfectly fits with Natsuo’s character.Our protagonist Natsuo is one of the most generic yes men in all of anime. People complain about isekai and harem anime heroes being boring constantly, but at least they can say no from time to time, particularly when anything sexual is involved. This dude just does whatever he’s told with like one exception when he decided not to kiss one of the girls once. *clap clap* And when the anime tries to show that he regrets some of his more immoral decisions, he just goes ahead and repeats them anyway, proving that his growth as a character is still at 0%. Natsou’s incredible blandness and stagnancy is simply astounding. I honestly much prefer his glasses wearing chubby buddy.

As a fan of romance anime, I found myself drawn into the tangled web of relationships and emotions depicted in this series.At its core, the anime explores the complexities of love, desire, and personal growth in a refreshingly honest manner. The characters grapple with their feelings and navigate the challenges of romance and family dynamics, creating a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.One of the standout aspects of the show is its exceptional music. The soundtrack sets the mood for...each scene, enhancing the emotional impact and drawing viewers deeper into the story. From poignant piano melodies to upbeat tracks, the music adds an extra layer of depth to the viewing experience.Reflecting on my experience with the anime, I am inclined to give it a score of 7/10. While it may not be without its flaws, such as occasional pacing issues and controversial themes, its strengths lie in its ability to evoke genuine emotion and spark meaningful conversations about love and relationships.In conclusion, Domestic na Kanojo is a compelling anime that offers a fresh perspective on romance. With its fantastic music and thought-provoking storyline, it's a must-watch for fans of the genre, even if its unconventional nature may not appeal to everyone.

Sure - the premise and plot was pretty weird, but what else did you expect from a show with this title?The plot was pretty interesting, it\'s not something I\'d really seen before and there were a LOT of grey areas that I wasn\'t sure on how I felt about.The animation definitely had some room for improvement, but it was still really good.Again, with the sound design, I\'ve seen many people saying it\'s really quite bad, but compared to other anime\'s I\'ve seen, it was actually one of the...better ones. I enjoyed the music too, and it seemed to fit the narrative - with some very minor exceptions in one episode.The characters:I think that each main character deserves a talking point, and there are some personal opinions and pretty major spoilers ahead.Natsuo should have broken it off with Rui as soon as he and Hina were official, and I think it was pretty selfish of him not to. I think his character was supposed to be written as the ""I don\'t want to hurt her"" type of guy, but it came off more as a ""I\'d rather fuck with both of them."" which makes zero sense, considering his overwhelming love for Hina.Hina\'s goodbye was pretty sad, although it was definitely going to be found out eventually, but I do think the way it happened was complete BS, it would have been far more realistic for them to be caught on CCTV, but there would have been no sex scene I guess - so the writers decided that was more important - again, I call bullshit.Natsuo or Hina weren\'t exactly bad people, they were just dealing with a really difficult situation and certainly one I\'d never want to find myself in.Rui was conflicted and seemed to act more on her own interests, which made me super uncomfortable, but she\'s really inexperienced and pretty immature, I just think it was kind of creepy how she was written to be very forceful and jealous. I did think she deserved better than what she got , but that ending was really fucked up and completely wiped all of that out of my mind.End of the day, this has got to be one of my best watches so far, just because of the drama - characters and writing. The animation was pretty good too, and that OP? Fucking hell it\'s god tier.Overall, would I recommend this anime? Yes. It\'s got some really good story, with a main character who - although being dumb as a rock - is actually pretty well written.

It starts off with our protagonist, the high school student Natsuo, losing his virginity to a random girl he met at a mixer named Rui because he’s trying to suppress the feeling’s of love he has for his teacher, Hina. It doesn’t go all that well so they decide not to meet again. Not long after that...he discovers that his single father has decided to get remarried to a woman that has two daughters, and those two daughters turn out to be Rui and Hina. That’s just the beginning of this mess though. It turns out that Hina’s having trouble with her boyfriend, and Natsuo get’s involved with that, which ultimately results in him whole heartedly trying to go out with Hina. Somewhere along the line, Rui also falls in love with Natsuo, but both sisters are also really close, so it turns into this bizarre love triangle of three siblings pretty much.On top of the premise being a ridiculous coincidence, the plot is pretty much entirely carried by more crazy coincidences. Most of the major events in the anime happen not because a character pushed for them and forced them into happening, but more so just because something random happened. A character just happened to run into another. A character just happened to be visible from a window. Characters just happened to come to the same café at the same time. A character just happened to go into someone else’s room at the worst possible time. A character just happened to fall down the stairs. A character just happened to be caught doing something in a completely unrelated photo. A character just happened to be wearing a wig that made them look like another character. Some of these are so random that I honestly burst out laughing so hard that I had to pause the anime for a second to get over it, even though I’m pretty sure these scenes weren’t even intended to be funny.As such there’s no real sense of progression to things. Everything major happens suddenly and abruptly. That leads to a sort of strange pacing, where the majority of the anime is paced really slowly, but there are random burst of extreme progression where things move really fast. It also feels like the anime randomly hints at things that are never expanded on and randomly introduces characters it never does anything with. As a result of all this, it’s not clear at all where things are going or where they’re going to go. As a result, it turns into the type of anime that could go in any direction at any time and it wouldn’t be surprising in the slightest. And all in all, I don’t even think that’s a bad thing. It was pretty good at being this type of anime and was wild ride that was quite interesting.The problems stems from another area, the cast of characters, particularly the main three as they’re the only ones that really matter in the end. I’ve watched a decent amount of strange anime so there being a love triangle between step siblings isn’t near enough to faze me, so that’s not what I have a problem with. However, the personalities of the characters in this love triangle and drama that arose out of that was a bit too much. I’m fine with relationship drama where it’s just making a mess of things for the purpose of having an interesting mess, I probably enjoy it more than I should in fact. However, here it felt like it was trying to do more than that. I think the anime was trying to convey that one can’t control the feelings of being in love or trying to obtain love and others shouldn’t judge people for that despite how things may appear from the outside, but also that the impression of those outside still matters so one has to make difficult decisions for the sake of those loved, even when it leads away from said love.However, due to the characters involved it felt pretty hard to get invested in the relationships well enough for that to really work. Honestly, I didn’t like most of the cast. To get it out of the way firstly I’ll note that the side character Fumiya, Natsuo’s childhood friend, is pretty awesome and the type of friend I would love to have, so he stood out as a pretty great character. Outside of that none of the side character’s really made much of an impression so I really don’t have anything to say about any of them. Of the main three I found myself finding Rui okay, though I wouldn’t go as far as saying I liked her.I disliked both Natsuo and Hina. Not that much, as I felt they had pretty decent chemistry, but I found how they ended up causing problems for each other and how they reacted and responded to the problems created really annoying. I found how the narrative tried to frame these responses as sensible responses that were worth it because they resulted in character growth even more annoying. Character’s felt like they just didn’t know what they really wanted and flip flopped around on it, which is fair to a degree, but the way it’s used here is that it plays into them basically just being thrown around by the arbitrary plot, which is really annoying and makes it really hard to get invested in anything. To be fair, the anime only adapts part of the story and the original author probably used what was built up to handle things better later on. Still, where the anime left off and how it tries to portray those circumstances as a good thing left a pretty sour impression.The art and animation are both really solid to the point I think they enhance the anime a good amount. The character designs, or more so how character designs were used, was also really solid. The OP was legitimately amazing in terms of song and visuals, though the visuals don’t really reflect the anime all that well. The ED was also solid in terms of visuals and audio. The use of insert songs was also pretty great and the instrumental of the OP was also used pretty well, but outside of those the soundtrack wasn’t particularly memorable. he discovers that his single father has decided to get remarried to a woman that has two daughters, and those two daughters turn out to be Rui and Hina.

I am a teacher and know the legal ins and outs of the job(1) when teachers get home they do not have free time, they are lesson planning and marking, in other words slaves to the system. Teachers do not have fun, especially early career teachers like Hina one of our main characters.(2) Touching or flirting with students is illegal. It is very easy for a student or a parent to take...you to court and charge you for paedophilia which results in your teaching license being removed. In the first episode Hina is depicted doing this.(3) visiting your teacher or even being alone in a room with them is a big no-no. Much like above, a law suit can be filed against the teacher and they will have their license revoked and likely end up in jail. Teachers are depicted one-on-one with students many times throughout the show.(4) having a relationship with a student who is also legally your brother is most certainly illegal and you will end up in jail. I'm sorry Hina, you can't just go and do that.It isn't just the teachers in this anime, but literally every single character is unrealistic. No such people exist in this world. But when all these unrealistic things come together it creates a somewhat interesting drama. And it is for that reason I give it a 7. you to court and charge you for paedophilia which results in your teaching license being removed.

And it is for that reason I give it a 7."", '""Your becoming siblings with the girl you had sex with AND your sensei"" - basic premise of the animeDomestic na Kanojo if LA can pinpoint what it is, is a melodramatic romance anime that tightropes the line between Citrus in terms of it\'s romance setting but even crazier and no yuri (and LA didn\'t think say it but it\'s true) and School Days of the main protagonist sex drive.Natsuo Fujii voiced by Taku Yashiro normal days flips upside down when his father remarries and karma is quite the bitch on him in his romantic endeavors when this happens where his crush who\'s  his teacher...Hina Tachibana voiced by Yoko Hikasa and the person he had a one time fling Rui Tachibana voiced by Maaya Uchida with becomes his siblings.In terms of characters, well Natsuo is the mildly dense main protagonist with a rather proactive sex drive not knowing the consequences of a one time fling but LA will say that the situations he gets into with his ""domestic girlfriends"" becomes coincidental ALOT of the time in order to drive melodrama in the anime, some LA will say IS HIS FAULT because he can\'t keep it in his pants, the other half is outright coincidental and yeah for a melodramatic ""forbidden fruit romance anime"", the melodrama is the defining trait of..you know a melodrama romance especially taking things in a saucy ""taboo"" notion in a ways it\'s also a bit like Citrus but without the yuri aspects to it. Rui is the typical shy stoic younger sister and generally the anti social to Hina\'s genki but at first her standoffishness pushed LA away to Hina, but she got better when the rest of the cast came into play and she also helped made the romance ""saucy"" in a ways as well as the fact of her initiating a couple of the things so she\'s one of the prime factors driving the plot along so LA will give it that. Hina is the main focus for almost 3/4 of the anime, as Rui and Natsuo helps her get away from an illicit affair from a married man but latter on she and Natsuo gets *ahem* more acquainted and that\'s her focus throughout the anime, she was and oddly enough still is LA\'s favorite character, sure she did plenty of mistakes in the anime, but she actually made some of the logical decisions in the anime thus is still LA\'s favourite character in the anime.Natsuo, Rui and Hina are the main core cast, but there are some supporting characters like Momo Kashiwabara voiced by Haruka Yoshimura, the typical soft spoken femme fatale but popular girl of the school, Miu Ashihara voiced by  Konomi Kohara the bookish shy girl and head of the literary club and LA will say the best wingman of the anime, Fumiya Kurimoto voiced by Takuya Eguchi, Natsuo\'s friend and the only person early on to know of Natsuo\'s crush on Hina and he\'s completely supportive and helpful in giving advice to Natsuo. Domestic na Kanojo is NOT a harem as the OTP was ALWAYS on Hina, Rui was the only competitor due to the entire domestic aspect, Momo just wants to be friends with Rui and Miu pines for another teacher (and advisor of the literary club), yes they ""help"" move the plot along but Rui, Hina and Natsuo drive the plot all the way, nonetheless their supportive characters one way of another with LA seeing Momo getting the shaft of the anime, as after her introduction she\'s a satellite character to Rui most of the time.So the melodrama goes off it\'s rocker about halfway once the OTP actually forms on Hina and Natsuo and Rui also gets into the mix but the melodrama at least has a tinge of karma for Natsuo especially, as the situation Hina of her having an affair, well near the finale, it hit back to Natsuo in such a karmic way. But yeah it\'s a ""he sleeps, he kisses, she kisses, she sleeps"" with situation to drive the melodrama along and yes most of the time it\'s coincidental it happens but much like LA said about Citrus, it\'s kinda what\'s it suppose to be, a melodramatic forbidden fruit romance anime, coincidences and sex drives goes hand in hand, does characters do stupid things because of love, well of course but it\'s the weirdness of Domestic na Kanojo\'s drama in a nutshell really. Domestic na Kanojo is a crazy fever dream, Domestic na Kanojo is off the rocker melodrama and LA loves this dumpster fire oddly enough...maybe for the drama, maybe for Hina and Rui, maybe for the sauciness, LA doesn\'t care, it\'s a brightly lit dumpster fire.The animation done by diomedea, is actually pretty decent, right from the decent character designs of most of the characters (they have an air of crispness to them). Now the sex scenes, well it\'s mostly bleached or really doesn\'t show nudity at all, more or less ""implied"" stuff than anything, so when LA sauciness in all this, it\'s much more in it\'s melodrama than the sex. Nonetheless one of the strengths in Domestic na Kanojo does come in the animation and LA will give it to diomedea in the animation department.As for the voice cast, well LA actually really liked the voice cast, from Yoko Hikasa as Hina, Maaya Uchida as Rui, Takuya Eguchi as Fumiya, Haruka Yoshimura as Momo and Konomi Kohara as Miu. Really some interesting roles were Yoko Hikasa doing a more serious mature role but also tkaing on the initial genki semi-drunkness role to Maaya Uchida doing quite the opposite from Yoko Hikasa and going stoic shy, quite playing against the type, whilst Haruka Yoshimura was in her typical element as Momo as LA knows her more as Mika from Idolmaster Cinderella Girls and Konomi Kohara as Miu was ehhh decent work from her as the shy bookish type. Nonetheless this voice cast was great especially from Maaya Uchida and Yoko Hikasa.Domestic na Kanojo is a glorious dumpster fire of a melodramatic forbidden fruit romance anime much in the veins of Citrus, OreImo and like a non violent School Days, but it\'s a glorious dumpster fire with decent to stupid to interesting characters like Hina, Natsuo and Rui, Domestic na Kanojo knows what it was doing with it\'s sometimes absurdly coincidental melodrama and went ALL the way with it, though the finale left it quite open ended though giving Natsuo a semi-ok ""happy ending"" with some implications.  Is Domestic na Kanojo one of LA\'s guilty pleasure of Winter 2019, well from this review welllllllllll.....YUP. Hina Tachibana voiced by Yoko Hikasa and the person he had a one time fling Rui Tachibana voiced by Maaya Uchida with becomes his siblings.In terms of characters, well Natsuo is the mildly dense main protagonist with a rather proactive sex drive not knowing the consequences of a one time fling but LA will say that the situations he gets into with his ""domestic girlfriends"" becomes coincidental ALOT of the time in order to drive melodrama in the anime, some LA will say IS HIS FAULT because he can\'t keep it in his pants, the other half is outright coincidental and yeah for a melodramatic ""forbidden fruit romance anime"", the melodrama is the defining trait of..you know a melodrama romance especially taking things in a saucy ""taboo"" notion in a ways it\'s also a bit like Citrus but without the yuri aspects to it. Rui is the typical shy stoic younger sister and generally the anti social to Hina\'s genki but at first her standoffishness pushed LA away to Hina, but she got better when the rest of the cast came into play and she also helped made the romance ""saucy"" in a ways as well as the fact of her initiating a couple of the things so she\'s one of the prime factors driving the plot along so LA will give it that. Hina is the main focus for almost 3/4 of the anime, as Rui and Natsuo helps her get away from an illicit affair from a married man but latter on she and Natsuo gets *ahem* more acquainted and that\'s her focus throughout the anime, she was and oddly enough still is LA\'s favorite character, sure she did plenty of mistakes in the anime, but she actually made some of the logical decisions in the anime thus is still LA\'s favourite character in the anime.Natsuo, Rui and Hina are the main core cast, but there are some supporting characters like Momo Kashiwabara voiced by Haruka Yoshimura, the typical soft spoken femme fatale but popular girl of the school, Miu Ashihara voiced by  Konomi Kohara the bookish shy girl and head of the literary club and LA will say the best wingman of the anime, Fumiya Kurimoto voiced by Takuya Eguchi, Natsuo\'s friend and the only person early on to know of Natsuo\'s crush on Hina and he\'s completely supportive and helpful in giving advice to Natsuo. Domestic na Kanojo is NOT a harem as the OTP was ALWAYS on Hina, Rui was the only competitor due to the entire domestic aspect, Momo just wants to be friends with Rui and Miu pines for another teacher (and advisor of the literary club), yes they ""help"" move the plot along but Rui, Hina and Natsuo drive the plot all the way, nonetheless their supportive characters one way of another with LA seeing Momo getting the shaft of the anime, as after her introduction she\'s a satellite character to Rui most of the time.So the melodrama goes off it\'s rocker about halfway once the OTP actually forms on Hina and Natsuo and Rui also gets into the mix but the melodrama at least has a tinge of karma for Natsuo especially, as the situation Hina of her having an affair, well near the finale, it hit back to Natsuo in such a karmic way.

Is Domestic na Kanojo one of LA\'s guilty pleasure of Winter 2019, well from this review welllllllllll.....YUP.', 'Domestic na Kanojo does what many drama & romance fail to do....Lure the viewer.Which through twelve short episodes, I caught myself unable to finish watching and continue watching another time due to such effective--yet predictable writing in which the episodes tend to end on some sort of cliffhanger, keeping you attached, only until the show ends .....in 12 eps.Liked:-Romance Maturity(Sex,nudity, yes you know what i mean :))-Actual Affection between characters-Real life circumstances, which made the MC\'s relate-able...-Supporting cast(harem essentially)-The Drama!Disliked:-The pacing. ooooo. my. god.-MC-Suspect ""storytelling"", plot holes in important areas-The Adaptation itself, could have fit more content into a 1 season manga adaptation-Sometimes idiotic character writing-- writers couldn\'t figure out where they wanted the show to go....Overall, I enjoyed Domestic na Kanojo. It had some excellent patches and very good arry of \'romantic\' scenes which is rare these days outside of hentai.My main takeaway with a view of the entire anime is that production studios that churn out these adaptations in short time windows really need to take a look at their releases and figure out if they rather keep the plot & art of these anime\'s they\'re producing consistent to the manga or light novel adaptations.That was mostly exposed with Domestic na Kanojo, and its huge pacing and plot problems which were really only due to the skipage of arcs, and huge character progression holes, that I must imagine would fix itself with a consistent adaptation quality. -Supporting cast(harem essentially)-The Drama!Disliked:-The pacing. ooooo. my. god.-MC-Suspect ""storytelling"", plot holes in important areas-The Adaptation itself, could have fit more content into a 1 season manga adaptation-Sometimes idiotic character writing-- writers couldn\'t figure out where they wanted the show to go....Overall, I enjoyed Domestic na Kanojo.

In what way, you ask? Why, that love becoming your stepsister, of course! Huh? Not enough for you? Okay, how about, while having feelings for that girl, having a one-night stand with another girl that turns out to be her younger sister, and now, SHE\'S your stepsister, too? Congratulations! Your life is now a soap opera with the same premise as the anime we\'re going over today. I read some of the manga of said anime before it came...out to prepare myself a bit for what was to come, but I never got around to actually watching the anime until two years after it premiered. One thing led to another, however, and here I am now, having gone through this so-called ""dumpster fire"" in just three days and about to dump my thoughts onto any unsuspecting reader who comes across this.Lads, ladies, and non-binaries, here is my review of ""Domestic Girlfriend"", known in Japanese as ""Domestic na Kanojo"".Domestic Girlfriend follows the trials and tribulations of Natsuo Fujii, a high school student and aspiring novelist with a huge crush on his teacher, Hina Tachibana. Unfortunately, he knows that his love will never be, as not only is she a teacher who claims to see him as a child, but there are rumors floating around that she already has a boyfriend. One day, when invited to a mixer, he sneaks out with one of the girls at the mixer, Rui Tachibana, and because of Rui\'s desire to know what sex is like, the two of them lose their virginities to each other. You would think that their association with each other would end with this simple one-night stand, right? WRONG! You see, Natsuo\'s widowed father soon gets remarried to a woman with two daughters of her own, and those daughters just so happen to be Hina and Rui!From there, to put it one way, emotional chaos ensues.Now, the story of Domestic Girlfriend is, by no means, bad. At the very least, it isn\'t boring; it\'s the kind of story that will keep a viewer watching to the end, even if for no other reason than wanting to see the main characters make a smart decision for once! However, I do have a major issue with the anime\'s pacing; skipped events I remember reading in the manga getting skipped aside, the story presented in the anime feels like it\'s going too fast, with little time for the audience to process what happened. For that, I blame whoever thought it would be a good idea to cram 76 chapters of the manga into a 12-episode series. If the anime had gotten a longer runtime - probably 24 episodes, at the very least - the pacing issues could be fixed.No matter the pace of the story, though, there\'s no doubt that the characters are at its heart; unfortunately, the main cast is a frustrating one to follow. Perhaps the biggest source of frustration is the protagonist, Natsuo; while he actually seems like a nice guy, which makes it hard to me to say I hate him, most of his actions make me want to yell about how freaking stupid he is being. Neither Rui or Hina are that much better; Rui makes some questionable choices regarding her relationship with Natsuo, and while I can appreciate how Hina tries to go about her own relationship with him, it\'s hard to know what her true feelings are at times. As for the supporting characters....well, not a lot of time was given to develop them, so I didn\'t really care about most of them. However, there are quite a few supporting characters, such as Masaki - uh, excuse me, Marie - Kobayashi, who give decent advice to the main characters, and I genuinely appreciated their presence.The art and animation, done by Diomedea, is solid overall. There were a few moments of still animation that felt unnecessary, and even aside from that, the animation isn\'t perfect; however, the colors, the backgrounds, and most of the animation was beautiful. The voice acting is solid, as well, although some of the casting choices, while not bad, surprised me; I don\'t know what I was expecting with Momo Kashiwabara\'s voice, in particular, but the softness of Haruka Yoshimura\'s voice for her managed to catch me off-guard, for some reason. The ending song, ""Wagamama"" by Alisa Takigawa, is more than solid; the song is a beautiful piece that I wouldn\'t mind listening to multiple times.My favorite part of Domestic Girlfriend, however, is undoubtedly the opening theme, ""Kawaki wo Ameku"" by Minami. I had listened to this song several times and even watched the music video over the course of the past two years, and my feelings for it then are the same as they are now; it is a fantastic song with emotional lyrics that could be relatable for most people, sung with the powerful voice Minami has. It was already perfect for an anime like Domestic Girlfriend, and the visual part of the opening only helped it shine. It\'s clear to see that the animators went all out with this one, from the colors and movements to the visual storytelling that complimented the story of the actual series. I don\'t know exactly where it would be placed on my top 20 anime openings, but it\'s somewhere on that list, for sure.Overall, is Domestic Girlfriend a trainwreck into a dumpster fire? Absolutely. Is it a bad anime? Absolutely not; those with a taste for melodrama and incest will definitely get a kick out of it. Just....be careful when it comes to the kinds of relationships it depicts, okay? out to prepare myself a bit for what was to come, but I never got around to actually watching the anime until two years after it premiered.

Just....be careful when it comes to the kinds of relationships it depicts, okay?', ""Have you ever dived into eating a delicious looking sandwich only to notice how spicy it is after like three bites in, confused as your face turns red from the intensity of spices, lost in confusion on what such an innocent looking sandwich could pack so much insense flavor in it?I might flip around the context of what I just said by switch the “sandwich” with “Domestic na Kanojo”, the same analogy applies for how vague and explicit it suddenly came out of nowhere, and before we could complain, we were already way too swayed to address the problems. With its heavy incestuous plot...points that know no border, it doesn't hold back on provoking that Taboo of a relationship which only a true descendant from Alamaba can relate to.Story (7/10):If there was anything this show excels at, it's the art of distraction. If we pulled all the chords, there is really no deep backstory that changes everything in the last moment or anything of that caliber, I would argue that Calliou had a more interesting plot line if we were honest, but “Domestic na Kanojo” is self-aware of that and unlike all other shitty adaptations, it acts against it by pushing it extra hard with the incest, that one taboo that's still not well expressed upon on mainstream media, and you know our inner selves enjoys these moral-provoking direction that pinches at a place we're not all too familiar with.I'm no expert in cooking nor do I have the slightest experience needed to pass as a taste analysis, but I can point out a spicy plot when I lay my eyes on one. Yes, we're talking about a dude that walks in on his sister A while masturbating to only go make out with sister B not even 5 minutes after.It's the fast and unpredictable pacing that makes it work despite the many flaws it has, you can start off an episode all heartwarming and heavily wholesome with all sorts of sweet family friendly content, “Oh, brother, can you get me that glass of water - Sister A”, “of course - The brother” and then they would go for hours bringing up fun memories from their childhood and oh boy does it transform very fast to a dedicated sex scene right after they get off the dining table.Despite the controversial references it packs, the show definitely knows how to steer it from a lighthearted sitcom to a dark love hexagon (If you will) that mocks a lot of serious social crises like taboo relationships, forbidden love, and suicide.Art (7.5/10):Art style wise, it's really good, but animation wise, it's average at best.The movements of the characters are very trippy and unmatching for such a fast-paced show like this one, but I guess their intention was to create something that's not very expensive whilst fulfilling the massive still shots of their shocked faces that just happen to occur at least 10 times an episode, you really can't criticize those Indian dramas without bashing on this show first for a reason.I really like the general art style of the show, notably more visible on character designs, the way they draw their faces and expressions, their anatomy at different camera angles, I adore that. Sometimes though, the proportions can be a little bit off and can really do a number of the overall visual quality.There was a specific aspect of the art I really liked and would love to see in more other shows is that strange color displacement effect they dd on some of the scenes to enhance them visually and add special highlights on the characters.Sound (8/10):The sound acting was... decent, I can't remember any moment that made me go “damn, that's performance gave me chills”, it was just about enough to carry on the spiced up cliché moments.On the other hand, the opening song, without a doubt the best one this season, I could even argue that it has the potential to be the best opening of the year, but that's only going to be confirmed once 2019 is past us.Most fans compared it to Unravel, the popular song from the opening of the first season of Tokyo Ghoul, some even called it Unravel 2.0 which I can sort of agree, it does give off almost the same vibes, the lyrics are just as strong and relatable to the story itself.Characters (6/10):An interesting character rooster is what this show lacked the most. Talking about their treats and characteristics, I can name at least about enough other shows that had identical characters to fill out an A4 paper.Natsuo, in particular, was a horribly written character that makes you instantly not like it despite being the protagonist that you're supposed to cheer up, an unbelievable rational teenager that wants it all to be his way and decides to skip on all opportunities of character development he got.Now moving to the more controversial group of characters, the female acquaintances, it got so serious that it split up the fandom into four groups, for each their idolized waifu. On that note, I can definitely see why they were that popular as characters and I won't hide the fact that even I rode along their hype, speaking as one of the Miu team.Enjoyment (9.7/10):“Domestic na Kanojo” was something I only decided to watch so that I can keep my watching list of the season dividable by two, and I so happened to stumble across this marvelous guilty pleasure series (Which I kind of found it like that) that fed me up from its spiciness and kept me asking for more every week, even though it falls short on quality when it's compared to its higher pairs of the season, it differently provided me with more enjoyment than most of them.Overall (7.6/10):It's hard to say if it's a recommendation-worthy show without stretching it any further, it differently has its charm, that I can give you, however, a lot f people expect every show to have a deeper meaning behind it and end up missing on a lot of good series that aren't precisely that concerned on carrying out a reality series but do make up for the enjoyment you get from it.I at least know what other show is worthy of a rewatch along others, a lot of fans of the source material trash the show as much as they can, however, I do appreciate what it offered even if it was mocked to hell. points that know no border, it doesn't hold back on provoking that Taboo of a relationship which only a true descendant from Alamaba can relate to.Story (7/10):If there was anything this show excels at, it's the art of distraction.

And then, goes even worse with the suddenly sibling stuff, this thing never works. This story shows that both men and women are thinking only about sex, there's no romance, or at least i couldn't find it in...the first episodes. The anime is aimed for the male audience, i understand that, i've watched other series from that category and i really enjoyed them, but this one is a big no.Art: The art is very good, the female girls look amazing, usually in those ecchi/harem anime girls are designed pretty good, while the guy looks basic...(not in all tho, but in this one yes).Character: I know teenagers are pretty blind or/and dumb in anime, especially in this type of anime, but come on, it gets so cringe when i see them how they are interacting. I barely dragged myself trough the first 4 episodes because of the characters and their absence of personality.Overall:This anime should get a hentai version, it would definitely get more attention like that and the plot would make more sense. I know some girls that actually enjoyed this anime, but i'm not one of them. If you are looking for some incest, big boobs, harem and a good art, this one is for you. the first episodes.

If you are looking for some incest, big boobs, harem and a good art, this one is for you."", 'This review doesn\'t contain any spoiler, you can read at ease. At least that\'s what I hope. This\'s my first time writing a review as I refrain from reviewing unless I feel it\'s absolutely necessary. For this particular story, I HAVE to do it. Bear in mind that my opinion does not include the manga because I haven\'t read it and have no intention of doing so.Before I start, try to imagine yourself as a high school student around the age of the characters in this story. Once you\'re able to do that, perhaps you can see what I see. The characters in this story...are teenagers in puberty with some exceptions. They\'re teenagers with unstable emotions, unstable ambition, unstable desires, lack of experience, lack of decisiveness, have a tendency to go with the flow, a completely normal high school student you can find anywhere. Try being a high school student once again if you can.1. Story (2/10)Pretty interesting plot I must say. It makes me wonder what would I do if the woman I love end up becoming my step-sister. But that\'s the end of it. The rest does not interest me at all. I\'m not against cliche. In fact, I believe cliche is needed. But this\'s just too much. It\'s too cliche, at least for me. So much so that you can expect it to happen. I managed to predict the whole story after I\'m done with episode 4. With some exceptions of course.A high school plot. Any small thing can make you fall for someone. Trust me, I\'ve been there, and you might as well. Although I\'m not the victim. The story makes me wonder ""Am I watching an ecchi anime? Or am I watching half-assed hentai with a story?""2. The characters. (1/10)They got no brain. I\'m sorry, that\'s rather rude. Let\'s say their brain is clouded by unstable emotions.A. Protagonist, Fujii NatsuoI\'m sure many of you wouldn\'t able to stand the idiocy of the protagonist just like how I feel about him. Even so, try to look at it through the glasses of a normal high school student. What the protagonist has done is something completely normal for a boy of his age. Not that I like it though. His desire to chase after his crush clouded everything else, making him the stupidest protagonist I\'ve ever seen. Honestly, I can\'t help but get irritated every single time I saw his face. If I\'ve given 5m to become his friend (Kurimoto Fumiya) I would certainly knock some sense into him. That\'s all, I got nothing more to talk about him.B. Heroine, Tachibana sistersThe older one, Hina is the type that would fall a victim to a typical hentai plot. Beautiful face, nice body, pretty seductive I must say. Perhaps that\'s why she\'s so stupid, all the nutrients must\'ve gone there instead. I feel like I\'ve seen her in hentai before and I\'m not even joking. Aside from that, nothing much worth mentioning about her. A typical female teacher you usually see in anime. Kind, beautiful, friendly, loved by students and teachers but in reality, she got her own problems to deal with. Yeah, like everyone else in the world. The problem of others can be seen as small or big depending on the perspective. For example, a poor person troubled by how can he feed his family tomorrow if he didn\'t earn enough money today. A rich person does not see that as a big problem. On the other hand, the poor person does not see the rich person\'s family problem as something big. I want you to understand that because we might think of the character\'s problem as something exaggerated.The younger one, Rui got her grip together. That\'s what I thought, then I remember that she\'s a teenager herself. Unstable, hate it if the adult treats them like a kid without knowing that\'s what made them a kid. If I were to choose between rooting for Hina or Rui, I would go with Rui. At least she got some sense on her. Perhaps she can fix the protagonist stupidity or perhaps his stupidity would get into her as well.C. Supporting CharactersWhat unnatural development... New character shows up one by one as if they\'re waiting in line for the other to finish their appearance. Oh, some who actually maintained their mind actually shows up, that\'s good. Or it doesn\'t matter.That\'s all for the characters. This\'s my first time, I\'ve got a lot to say but I don\'t know which is appropriate and which is not.3. Development (2/10)Predictable. If not too much. Predictable in a way I don\'t like it. I wonder if they forcibly shorten it so it can fit for anime. I don\'t know what else to say besides predictable and cliche. Wait, there\'s actually some funny moment, but it\'s clouded by the previous event which made the comedy unlaughable.4. Art (7/10)Pretty good! Not gonna say it\'s great, but it\'s good nonetheless. The characters look nice and cute. The scenery as well.5. Sound (5/10)Mediocre. However, the ending song was quite good, and the way they insert the BGM is pretty thoughtful and at the right moment.6. Enjoyment (1/10)I sometimes went out of my way checking the remaining minutes and the remaining episode I need to bear with. I always end up asking myself ""When will this end?""7. Overall (3/10)Yes, I agree that everything the character does is something a normal teenager would do. I understand it and I can comprehend it. But that doesn\'t change the fact that I did not enjoy the show. In fact, I want to give it lower, but I can\'t deny that I like the art and some of the characters in this anime. I feel like I should give it at least 5/10. But when I remember the irritation I had to bear while watching this, I realize I can\'t go that far.PS: Just give me Ayano, and I would give it 5/10 LOL. are teenagers in puberty with some exceptions.

I was not expecting it to be a hentai? So, I had to skip the sex scenes. I can't lie, it was going alright, the characters were interesting and with the plot twist of the teacher he loves and the girl he lost his virginity to becoming his stepsisters. It was cute seeing him pining over his teacher and I liked the friends he has and made. His school life was fun to watch and I loved the sister/teacher's affair drama. Now, this anime...would have been decent if it didn't turn into literal paedophilia! The whole teacher x student/step-siblings actually made me sick because she has even a bigger reason to stop the romantic relationship. I didn't think she was actually going to reciprocate like the teacher could have held back no matter how much she fell in love with him, he's still a kid!!! The boy clearly had a dream to become a novelist and something like this could really hinder it. He's very passionate to her which is sweet but the way he just kissed her and went to her house just shows how naive he is to the weight of the situation. She really tried to deny him in the beginning though and clearly throughout it she knew the relationship was wrong yet she still continued to the point of giving him keys to her house and having s*x with him YUCKKKK YOU'RE A GROWN ASS WOMAN. I was praying they got caught every second that's why I had to watch till the end. She got off very lucky for her nastiness and the poor boy had to suffer heartbreak. I was hoping him and the sister his age would become best friends but no she continuously forced herself on him eww. This is the worst suggestions I've gotten besides Boku No Pico lool. In conclusion, the best character was Marie <3 and maybe I should start reading descriptions and reviews first. would have been decent if it didn't turn into literal paedophilia!

Admittedly, I\'m not done. I still have the final three episodes to go through, but I\'m considering not finishing. That\'s how much his character throws me off. If I do, I\'ll gladly update.He doesn\'t grow, at all. He\'s the same character on episode 1 that he is on episode 9. He\'s head over heels for his sensei-turned-step-sibling Hina. Tries to get over her...with other girls, but always reverts back to the sad little puppy that he is. He COMPLETELY glosses over his other step-sibling, Rui. He acts on his own frustrations on not being able to get with Hina and engages in romantic moments with Rui. Doesn\'t explain to her his feelings for Hina, or tell her anything for that matter, but just goes back to chasing Hina while Rui is left to wonder.I actually was fairly tuned in after the first 2-3 episodes and conflict started arising. Natsuo and Rui got together, then the two of them and Hina all became siblings. Natsuo and Rui\'s relationship grows a bit in the second episode, they discover something about Hina, and the rest of the show seems to go downhill from there. That said, after every conflict, it\'s just little ol\' Natsuo reverting back to his ways of fawning over Hina. Natsuo doesn\'t grow, he doesn\'t learn any lessons, nothing. He\'s awful in every way.Hina can be just as insufferable. She goes through a real conflict and opportunity to learn and grow, but even after she resolves that situation she continues to be the ""you\'re not an adult, you wouldn\'t understand and you\'re not ready for the grown-up world"" person that she is. Even after episode 9, it doesn\'t seem to change after her interactions with Natsuo. The way she speaks to Natsuo, even after all of these events, feels very much like a mother talking to a child, or at the very least the ""pretending to know things that I don\'t but I\'ll try to council people on those things anyway"" type of thing. Still, she pales in comparison to how poor of a character Natsuo is.I hope the last three episodes turn this into something it currently isn\'t, because if it remains the same my score likely goes lower.EDIT: I\'ve pushed through and finished the last three episodes. I now despise Natsuo even more. The last three episodes have done nothing to show anything besides the fact that he\'s beyond obsessed. Even to the very end, he\'s nothing but absolutely pathetic.If you\'ve gone this far, I\'d just pass on this one.

Domestic Girlfriend (DG) is a dumpster fire that I begrudgingly enjoyed so much, so I gave this show an additional 4 points it in no way deserved.The best comparison I can give that provides an inkling for what one will be going into for DG would be a Spanish telenovela or American Soap opera. The set up for DG is as follows Natsuo has a mad crush on his teacher Hina and one day while out on a group date with some...friends he hooks up with one of the girls named Rui and they proceed to bone after the fact. Fast forward to the next day where Natsuo\'s father who been single for a while tells him that he is getting remarried. Fun fact the woman his father is getting married to is the mother of Rui and Hina so yeah we get to throw incest on there too. The rest of the show can be summed up with ""how can we top this?"" and boy does this story try its dammest.Is this format good? No, but it is entertaining in the sense of how low can it sink. The characters are relatively entertaining, and surprisingly despite how he acts I never found Natsuo despicable, foolhardy yes, but not dislikable.At the end of the day, the sad part is this is not even DG\'s best version. Supposedly the anime rushes through much of the manga\'s content cutting out significant portions of its story. In addition, the manga has .5 chapters which have what one would expect in a show like this. The show even reflects this sentiment because the last episode is a blatant ""Go read the manga"" episode.I enjoyed my time with DG for which I must now admit I am trash, but honestly, if any of this piques someone\'s interest, stick with the manga. The only thing the show does better is the American transfer student and his ""Engrish"" because he was always hilarious. friends he hooks up with one of the girls named Rui and they proceed to bone after the fact.

I’m one of those people who dislike this series because of the lack of depth and character development.I like character-driven plot so it was hard to get emotionally invested into the mc when he is as poorly written as this.

Awful story or the adaptation was not executed well but you still want to know what fucked up things will happens next.Too many side/supporting...characters that were not needed or they just didn’t fit.

Well ‘Domestic Girlfriend’ changes this trope by having the main character, Natsuo, lose his virginity within the first minute of the show. While you would think this means that the show would be filled with fan service and sex scenes, this is not he case. Natsuo doesn’t have sex again until the end of episode 11. Additionally, there isn’t actually ‘sex scenes’, instead showing post coitus Natsuo naked under the covers. Now this isn’t to say that there...isn’t any fan service, because there is still some of that here, but it isn’t nearly as pervasive as other shows within the genre. In fact, for a story that would fit in for a hentai, this series is quite tame, being more focused on the Romance than the Ecchi elements.Simple Plot: Generic ‘Yes Man’ Natsuo is our main protagonist and blank slate for deviant wish fulfillment. Thanks to the gods of chance, he happens to lose his virginity to a random girl while hanging out with his friends. This random girl is Rui, and she so happens to be his future step sister, more on that later. She wanted to know what sex was like, for reasons that become clear later in the season. Natsuo has unrequited love for his teacher Hina, who also happens to be Rui’s older sister, which means that she is also going to be Natsuo’s step-sister, more on that…. Now. Following the golden rule of ‘no chromo’, the story revolves around a love triangle between Natsuo and his new step sisters. Side girls are added in as the season progresses, but due to this not being a harem anime they are underdeveloped and only serve as waifu bait. Will Natsuo end up with his one-night stand Rui? Or will he end up with his first love Hina? Or will a side character receive actual development and win his heart? Who knows? I sure don’t, because I haven’t read the manga and cannot be bothered to do so.Music: For the most part the music was decent although uninspired, and there were some questionable song choices. Why was there sad music playing when Natsuo was peeping in on Hina masturbating? On the plus side the OP is one of the better ones. Honestly, I’d rank it in my top 10 of all time, and it gets bonus points for not reusing any footage from the anime. I absolutely hate it when the show spoils stuff by reusing anime assets in the OP, and I wish more studios would follow this example of using new assets that captures the themes of the show, not specific scenes from the show.Art: Overall the art was pretty good. It wasn’t amazing, but there were no points when it appeared janky. There might have been points when the background didn’t receive much detail, but I cannot be bothered to care. The character designs are fairly generic. Natsuo is super average, and even with the show fresh on my mind, I wouldn’t be able to pick him out if he was mixed in with 4 other generic male protagonists. Not every protagonist needs to have crazy hair, or crazy clothing, or crazy scars/tats in order to stand out, but Natsuo has nothing other than a bland generic personality. Who cares about the male protagonist though? He is only a blank slate for us to insert ourselves in! The girls are what matter after all and in ‘Domestic Girlfriend’ the girls are, decent. While Rui, Hina, and the other waifu wannabes are pretty, they are also something that the viewer has seen before in different, better, shows. I’d give the girl’s designs a B- in this show and the males a C. Nothing bad or to hate, but little to love. Due to personal taste I do like Rui’s design and would give her best design in the show with a B+ ranking.Filth Rating: This show is fairly tame by my standards, and my standards are the only ones that matter. I demand more lewding to be done in my Romance/Ecchi shows! The lack of nudity is understandable because it aired on TV, but they could have done some bullshit light censoring and let the Blu-ray buyers, or streamers, see some tiddies. Maybe this will be added in later for the Blu-ray buyers, with completely new or redesigned scenes for those who pay. But I am not one of those people who pay, and I will rate this based off the currently available footage. This would normally give the show a Filth Rating of 4/10, except for the plot. The plot itself is fairly spicy and gains up some lost ground. Incest… check! Double Incest… double check! Double Incest and one of them is his teacher… my manhood cannot take much more! Main character watching his stepsister masturbate? I’m game. Having a stepsister watch her sister and stepbrother make out. Wincest! While it isn’t directly shown the main character does indeed have sex, and I’m ok with that. More characters in anime need to have sex, and this adds in even more bonus points. While the show may be tame, the plot itself is wild and seemingly plucked out of a hentai. This gives the show a Filth Rating 8/10 and I hope that this failed abortion gets even more wild in future seasons or OVAs.Overall Score: This dumpster fire should not be as good as it is. Generic all around, but the high notes shine through the literal shitstorm that is this show. Other shows have done the incest romance plot better, yet I am drawn to this show. Maybe it is because I am also shit, and I know that I do not deserve better than this shit show. The side characters are barely built up and are quickly cast aside. This could be due to the problematic pacing in this season. The first 6 episodes are well paced, but the last 6 seem to move along too fast, with many important things seemingly missed along the way. Natsuo has two episodes of happiness in a relationship, but in the next episode it ends, and he spends 15 minutes in deep depression. The viewer does not feel his sadness, because we were only given 2 episodes of the relationship, while Natsuo was given 3 months. This pacing also affects Rui’s character development. Her awkwardness was her main character trait, and this was seemingly thrown aside between episodes early on with little transitionary period. Harem wannabe Momo is introduced and built up, with a seemingly decent backstory, but then drops off hard only appearing as a minor background character. Why spend a whole episode building up a character to then relegate her to the background? I can’t help but feel that this season would have been better serviced as a 24-episode season, but due to budgetary constraints had to squeeze all the material down into 12 episodes. This anime is trash, but so am I, so I’ll give this show a 7.25/10.Given this season’s popularity, I assume that OVAs and eventual season 2 are coming eventually. I just hope that this series slows down some. The plot is a potential gold mine for good content. Now they just need to make us actually care about the characters. isn’t any fan service, because there is still some of that here, but it isn’t nearly as pervasive as other shows within the genre.

Thanks to the gods of chance, he happens to lose his virginity to a random girl while hanging out with his friends. This random girl is Rui, and she so happens to be his future step sister, more on that later. She wanted to know what sex was like, for reasons that become clear later in the season. Natsuo has unrequited love for his teacher Hina, who also happens to be Rui’s older sister, which means that she is also going to be Natsuo’s step-sister, more on that…. Now. Following the golden rule of ‘no chromo’, the story revolves around a love triangle between Natsuo and his new step sisters. Side girls are added in as the season progresses, but due to this not being a harem anime they are underdeveloped and only serve as waifu bait. Will Natsuo end up with his one-night stand Rui? Or will he end up with his first love Hina? Or will a side character receive actual development and win his heart? Who knows? I sure don’t, because I haven’t read the manga and cannot be bothered to do so.Music: For the most part the music was decent although uninspired, and there were some questionable song choices. Why was there sad music playing when Natsuo was peeping in on Hina masturbating? On the plus side the OP is one of the better ones. Honestly, I’d rank it in my top 10 of all time, and it gets bonus points for not reusing any footage from the anime. I absolutely hate it when the show spoils stuff by reusing anime assets in the OP, and I wish more studios would follow this example of using new assets that captures the themes of the show, not specific scenes from the show.Art: Overall the art was pretty good. It wasn’t amazing, but there were no points when it appeared janky. There might have been points when the background didn’t receive much detail, but I cannot be bothered to care. The character designs are fairly generic. Natsuo is super average, and even with the show fresh on my mind, I wouldn’t be able to pick him out if he was mixed in with 4 other generic male protagonists. Not every protagonist needs to have crazy hair, or crazy clothing, or crazy scars/tats in order to stand out, but Natsuo has nothing other than a bland generic personality. Who cares about the male protagonist though? He is only a blank slate for us to insert ourselves in! The girls are what matter after all and in ‘Domestic Girlfriend’ the girls are, decent. While Rui, Hina, and the other waifu wannabes are pretty, they are also something that the viewer has seen before in different, better, shows. I’d give the girl’s designs a B- in this show and the males a C. Nothing bad or to hate, but little to love. Due to personal taste I do like Rui’s design and would give her best design in the show with a B+ ranking.Filth Rating: This show is fairly tame by my standards, and my standards are the only ones that matter. I demand more lewding to be done in my Romance/Ecchi shows! The lack of nudity is understandable because it aired on TV, but they could have done some bullshit light censoring and let the Blu-ray buyers, or streamers, see some tiddies. Maybe this will be added in later for the Blu-ray buyers, with completely new or redesigned scenes for those who pay. But I am not one of those people who pay, and I will rate this based off the currently available footage. This would normally give the show a Filth Rating of 4/10, except for the plot. The plot itself is fairly spicy and gains up some lost ground. Incest… check! Double Incest… double check! Double Incest and one of them is his teacher… my manhood cannot take much more! Main character watching his stepsister masturbate? I’m game. Having a stepsister watch her sister and stepbrother make out. Wincest! While it isn’t directly shown the main character does indeed have sex, and I’m ok with that. More characters in anime need to have sex, and this adds in even more bonus points. While the show may be tame, the plot itself is wild and seemingly plucked out of a hentai. This gives the show a Filth Rating 8/10 and I hope that this failed abortion gets even more wild in future seasons or OVAs.Overall Score: This dumpster fire should not be as good as it is. Generic all around, but the high notes shine through the literal shitstorm that is this show. Other shows have done the incest romance plot better, yet I am drawn to this show. Maybe it is because I am also shit, and I know that I do not deserve better than this shit show. The side characters are barely built up and are quickly cast aside. This could be due to the problematic pacing in this season. The first 6 episodes are well paced, but the last 6 seem to move along too fast, with many important things seemingly missed along the way. Natsuo has two episodes of happiness in a relationship, but in the next episode it ends, and he spends 15 minutes in deep depression. The viewer does not feel his sadness, because we were only given 2 episodes of the relationship, while Natsuo was given 3 months. This pacing also affects Rui’s character development. Her awkwardness was her main character trait, and this was seemingly thrown aside between episodes early on with little transitionary period. Harem wannabe Momo is introduced and built up, with a seemingly decent backstory, but then drops off hard only appearing as a minor background character. Why spend a whole episode building up a character to then relegate her to the background? I can’t help but feel that this season would have been better serviced as a 24-episode season, but due to budgetary constraints had to squeeze all the material down into 12 episodes. This anime is trash, but so am I, so I’ll give this show a 7.25/10.Given this season’s popularity, I assume that OVAs and eventual season 2 are coming eventually. I just hope that this series slows down some. The plot is a potential gold mine for good content. Now they just need to make us actually care about the characters.', '#THIS REVIEW CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS#There are a few disclaimers I wanna put before I start my review.First, my spoiler free TLDR: its a crazy ride with weirdly written but surprisingly grounded characters and is overall a hot mess but one that I\'m fine with recommending and had a surprising amount of fun watching.Second, I have pretty mild opinions when it comes to incest. If both parties are consenting and are at the appropriate age and protection is used I really couldn\'t care less. I don\'t really condone it but I\'m not gonna condemn anyone unless they\'re making inbred babies cause that is a pretty...shitty thing to do. I say this because a lot of my thoughts hinge on that opinion and made my experience with Domestic Girlfriend to nearly cause my brain to implode.#SPOILERS BELOW#Domestic Girlfriend is a dumpster fire. A dumpster fire that I enjoyed and has some decent merit but a dumpster fire nonetheless. But to ignore the taboo nature of the relationship between Natsuo, Rui and Hina and focus on anything else is to ignore the show entirely. I have never been so confused trying to figure out if a show is good or bad because a lot of building blocks of the relationships of our main love triangle were set up before they became siblings. Rui and Natsuo bang before they became siblings, Hina and Natsuo started falling for each other around the same time. Its this constant back and forth of these characters trying to follow their hearts but having their desires backfiring usually by having other parties finding out what goes on behind closed doors (although I think these characters don\'t understand the concept of closed doors).The whole idea behind Domestic Girlfriend is how these characters deal with their emotions and feelings that began before the remarriage and fall apart after it. This whole concept is equal parts fascinating from a drama perspective and plain bizarre and confusing at times. The amount of times I would scream: ""WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS"" was usually met with this insane curiosity to see how the situation falls apart which was always just around the corner. I actually accepted that at a certain point I was just watching it to see these characters get hurt. I was just super into these character dynamics and I don\'t have much of a reason why I was other than morbid curiosity.The story is admittedly pretty bland and predictable at least after the halfway mark. Up until that point however was really solid. We see Natsuo thrown into this massive whirlwind of his feelings for Hina and his and Rui\'s banging setting forth a huge arc for Rui to go on. We see these characters act on these urges that we all know is wrong and struggle with their new relationship and try to move past it. I say try, but the try is more like a 1 foot wall of popsicle sticks against a steamroller.The blandness comes from this formulaic approach to how conflicts goes about in the story. Rui/Hina make some sort of advancement toward Natsuo or vice versa, advancement gets found out, conflict happens. This happens a lot during the latter half of the show and is borderline just lazy writing. When the beginning of this story shows us its very capable of having interesting things develop between our main cast it sucks that they just go for the shock factor taboo incest route.I have issues with how the overall story is played out and written but our main cast is surprisingly grounded for how crazy the premise is. I think that a lot of the decisions Rui, Natsuo and Hina make aren\'t the biggest leap in logic when you factor in a lot of their decisions are so heavily rooted in their emotions. Natsuo can\'t just up and let go of his first love Hina. Rui\'s first sexual experience was with Natsuo, and Hina, well Hina I have issues with. A lot of Hina\'s character is built on this front that she\'s the adult in this situation and has to make the grown up decisions and try to put an end to Natsuo\'s advances. But her defenses are so paper thin and waffley until we learn that she started to grow feelings for Natsuo around the same time Natsuo fell for Hina. Which the reveal feels so weak when we consider literally 2 episodes before they start ""dating"" she proposes the notion that them trying to date would be like committing double suicide, while dragging Natsuo into the ocean with her to further her point. Like she just gives into Natsuo\'s advances saying that she did have feelings for him all along  just felt forced and weak.Rui on the other hand got so much more development throughout this shows run time and was overall a much more fleshed out and interesting character than her older sister. We see her go through this entire emotional arc from her trying to keep these dormant feelings for Natsuo away but eventually giving in.  The thing is she probably would\'ve been able to move on if it weren\'t for her discovering Natsuo\'s feelings for Hina and catching them in the act a few times. She starts off when the remarriage happens going: ""what happened between us never happened and i\'m moving past this"" to putting up walls around these feelings, only for her discoveries between Hina and Natsuo showing her that she does in fact, miss that anime protagonist dick and wants a cut of that action. What makes a lot of the decisions Rui makes hit a bit harder in terms of her character is that she\'s always been confident when going after what she wants. From her making the move on Natsuo for them to have sex to her wanting secret make out sessions, she understands that the relationship she wants is only weird because society tells them that it\'s weird and doesn\'t want that to stop her heart. Little sidenote but her giving Hina the big No-Chromo when Hina finds out is one of the truest moments to her character and just flat out funny from a memes perspective.In a way Hina and Rui represent two different mind sets towards incest and how society treats it and plays with those ideas interchangeably and is probably one of the strongest things about Domestic Girlfriend.Now onto our main man. The absolute Chad that gets both the imouto and the onee-san: Natsuo. He.... is.... an alright character. A lot of his character is just a nice guy trying to follow his heart but not understanding the potential consequences following his heart brings. We get a small cast of other characters he interacts with to try and sell that he\'s a nice guy who wants nothing more than to live on his novels he wants to write and bang his teacher. It\'s weird that our protagonist is also the series antagonist because every single one of his actions sets every conflict in motion. His attempts at Hina get found out by Rui and sends her off onto her arc and vice versa. It\'s his constant attempts at trying to get his first love to reciprocate feelings that causes everyone involved to get hurt in one way or another. But I can\'t fault him for trying to do his thing in trying to be with Hina. It\'s been stated in the show and shown that giving up is not something he wants to do and it takes Hina having to leave the school and move away with no one knowing where she is for him to start to understand that it\'s never gonna be a real thing between them.Outside of our main trio we have a smattering of side character that serve some function and others little to no function and really is a waste of them existing in the world and potential. The club president and Natsuo\'s ""bros"" serve little to no purpose other than adding extra characters I guess? Which is bizarre cause the club president is featured in the OP which one would think would mean she has some sort of impact (also I can\'t be fucked to look up her name cause she\'s so useless). Momo on the other while she also had no real impact on the story but also on the OP struck a very weird chord with me specifcally. At the end of her episode we learn she has a hard home life and is often alone which is why she sleeps around a lot and self harms. Critically she only served to be another girl for Natsuo to be nice to but Momo has a weird place in my heart for. When I was a bit younger there was a girl I dated with who also self harmed and I discovered that also in a kind of intimate situation. To this day I have a very hard time seeing any sort of self harm and especially cutting in particular and seeing how Natsuo navigated a situation I was just not emotionally equipped to deal with was weirdly therapeutic and is something I won\'t forget about from Domestic Girlfriend. Just a side note to those who have a hard time in life and also struggle with depression and use self harming as a means to cope: you are loved, you deserve love and I love you. Don\'t ruin yourself because you think you\'re not worth it because to someone out there you are way more than worth it. From someone who also used those means as a way to deal with life to anyone who is struggling who needs to know they are worth it.Back on track, some of the highlight side characters that just stole all of my attention whenever they were on screen. The manager of L\'amant (idk how to do the thing over the a). A gay ex-yakuza second in command who is everyone\'s muse. I love this guy he\'s just so wholesome and funny and anytime he was onscreen all of my attention was just purely on him. Then we hop over to my personal best boi: Alex. From the first line he delivered to the last time we get to see him on screen I was always rolling in laughter whenever he just blurts out random things in English and just had so much charm I love him. Fumiya, Natsuo\'s best friend who is honestly more of a self insert that Natsuo is was just a solid rock for Natsuo whenever he needed some help from a 3rd party. A lot of these characters got way more screen time and time to develop into their own characters way more than club president girl and Momo and is just a shame.A lot of the auxiliary production is pretty bog standard for most anime. The direction was passable, animation was passable a lot of its qualities were just passable. The warm lighting that was used in a lot of the more intense scenes was about the only thing that really caught my eye but by the end of this show I was largely over it.I ragged a lot on this show but at it\'s core its got a lot of solid pieces that just weren\'t executed to the best of their abilities and my morbid curiosity of how the cookie is gonna crumble got me through an amount of the show specifically the halfway point to the last quarter of it. That\'s not to say this show is bad, cause I think anyone saying that this show is bad is mainly saying that because of the incest. Which I agree to an extent.  Anime in general that  shoehorn\'s incest in as a weird fetish thing and it\'s just fucking weird. As a show where its the forefront of the plot I think Domestic Girlfriend is entertaining as hell and a roller coaster of a ride and is a show I poured way too much energy into thinking and writing about. shitty thing to do. I say this because a lot of my thoughts hinge on that opinion and made my experience with Domestic Girlfriend to nearly cause my brain to implode.#SPOILERS BELOW#Domestic Girlfriend is a dumpster fire.

Rui and Hina are beautifully drawn! Everything else is shit!I loved the first episode. Finally someone in a romcom anime had sex. A guy and a girl meet and they go straight at it without any forced ecci scenes- the girl\'s top doesn\'t accidentally come off and the guy doesn\'t accidentally land on her boobs. Immediately after, their parents marry and they now have to be siblings just after having a one-night standoff. Wow, so the story is not about two step-siblings just itching to fuck, coz they already fucked. Instead of having a show of raging hormones...they got the sex over with in the first episode. Great! Not to mention the other stepsister is his long time crush and teacher. The settings seem ""real"" enough and the hero\'s best friend provides comic relief without being a pervert or a complete idiot. The show even promises some emotional depth by indicating serious riffs between the sisters.But that is all just the first episode. After that it is any typical Harem anime with fucked up asshole characters with no observation into how they got so fucked up in the first place. All the characters has been reduced to one prevailing issue (be it loneliness, or daddy issues, or inferiority complex etc.). The story is plain stupid with everybody always making the worst possible choices. Natsuo is a worse creep than all other Harem protagonists simply because he believes his own lies, at least the other harem heroes know that sex is all they want.A terrible show made worse by the promise of the first episode. I would have scored it a 1 but then added 2 more points for the brilliant drawings and the lack of ecci fanservice. they got the sex over with in the first episode. Great!

What I hate more than this series though, is myself. I forced myself to watch the entirety of this series because I hate to drop shows once I start it, so I grinded it to the end knowing I didn\'t like it.Probably the BEST thing I can say about this show is that it\'s conventionally different from the norm of romance anime. It\'s not a bunch of quirky high school kids who take an entire season to hold hands or any of that slow-paced garbage you expect of a romance anime. The pacing of the characters falling for...each other is fine. The first episode seemed a bit interesting early on, with how the main character fell into a depressive state and went in for a hookup right from the rip. Not many romance MC\'s actually end up getting laid in the beginning, so that was an interesting concept. That\'s about where  the good qualities of this show ends, however.I\'m not a fan of incest plots, but I\'ve come to accept that\'s a trope that anime will use, there\'s a lot of incest plots out there. However, Domestic na Kanojo is probably the worst and weirdest incest plot I\'ve seen. The show has embarrassingly awkward moments. I couldn\'t even watch this entire series without stopping because of how much embarrassment was irradiating through my screen. I had to take tons of breaks to finish this series. They really tried to force the love triangle plot line of this series, and it does not do this series any justice.The ending of this series was absolutely horrid as well, for an already bad anime, it\'s actually quite impressive how you can make an ending to an anime exponentially worse than an already overall bad series.This series is not ""a so bad it\'s good"" series, it\'s just a bad series. The only reason I can see anyone liking this is as a guilty pleasure anime. However, I personally think this show is more ""guilty"" than pleasure.This is arguably one of the worst series I\'ve ever seen.

I didn't really like the show but that might've been because I watched this directly after a really good anime that touched my heart.There certainly are quite a few things to choose from but i'll try to start from the positive aspects of the story.The opening to the anime is amazing. It's probably one of my all time favorites.And that's about it.There's nothing else that good to talk about the anime. I don't want to spoil the story if you are really serious about watching the show even though I personally wouldn't recommend...it.The soundtrack other than the opening is mediocre at best. The three main characters are uninteresting and really annoying at times.

But you won\'t see the deed itself. (The manga is more graphic.) AND- I have to spoil here- don\'t get your hopes up about seeing the threesome that some of the show\'s promotional art seems to promise. There\'s no polygamy here, just serial monogamy; in other words, Natsuo\'s only involved with one at a time, but they keep taking turns.As the show opens Natsuo has known Hina for about a year. Hina openly flirts with Natsuo at school- pretty unprofessional conduct even for a young, inexperienced teacher, but she has quite a number of behavioral issues, as we\'ll see. Apparently Natsuo\'s dad never got around to introducing his prospective bride OR her two daughters to Natsuo until the marriage is nearly a fait accompli, though he does ask his son\'s opinion before making it official. And you can almost see a thought bubble above Natsuo\'s head, which is surely captioned ""Oh boy, oh boy, I\'ll be with Hina 24/7!"". Even though she\'s going to legally be his sibling. And even though the person he lost his virginity with (whether the sex was ""meh"" or no), Hina\'s sister, is ALSO going to be a legal sibling living with him.I wish that someone could have played a Jedi Mind Trick on Natsuo and put this thought into his head: ""These are NOT the sisters you\'re looking for!"". Instead, Natsuo quickly encourages his dad to marry Hina\'s mom, all very much as you\'d expect from the sort of young man who thinks with his gonads instead of his brain. Natsuo has aspirations to be a writer, by the way, which suggests that Natsuo might be a Mary Sue kind of character for the manga\'s author. (I may say more about this later.) In any case, ""domestic life"" soon begins, but it\'s anything BUT blissful, because Hina, Rui, AND Natsuo are ALL seriously dysfunctional individuals.Let\'s start with Hina. It seems she often drinks herself to sleep in the evenings. Apparently her mom has simply put up with this for a long time- and now Natsuo\'s dad does too- but let\'s face it: Hina\'s a grown woman, and her parent(s) could at least have insisted she get some help as a condition of her continuing to reside with them. I\'m not sure if the alcohol is to blame, but Hina also exhibits some frighteningly over-the-top behavior when she\'s trying to make a point. She\'s always telling the male students that they\'re ""just kids""- even though she seems awfully immature herself- and the first time our hero Natsuo actually makes a pass at her (this is AFTER she\'s become his stepsister) she doesn\'t calmly tell him he\'s acting inappropriately; she doesn\'t yell at him; she doesn\'t even slap him. No, she aggressively tries to turn the tables on him by pouncing on him and trying to undress him; when he\'s intimidated by this attack, she uses that as proof that he\'s ""just a kid"" (AGAIN), and that he\'s apparently not ""man"" enough for her. (His response to this, to show he\'s NOT a kid, is to...run away from home.) She\'ll try to make her point against involvement with him in a different (but equally disturbing) way later, but we suspect that she\'ll sooner or later succumb to his ""charms"" (whatever THOSE are; I NEVER figured that out), which will create its own problems when it happens. (Really, I think she got off lightly in the end; I\'m pretty sure this would have ended much worse for her in the ""real"" world, either in Japan or the U.S.)Rui is...no improvement, really. Despite being Hina\'s younger sister, her dour, sarcastic attitude somehow still seems less immature than Hina\'s behavior. She originally had sex with Natsuo ""just to see what it was like"", and is disappointed because it didn\'t ""change"" her. When her older sister passes out drunk, her custom is to simply drag her to her room by her arm caveman-style. Despite her first sexual experience with Natsuo being such a disappointment, she subsequently changes her mind and tries her best to seduce him. The only way I could interpret this is that she must have noted how Natsuo and Hina ""got along well"" (Hina\'s occasional bizarre attacks on him only happen in private), and got jealous. Still, she\'s nearly as slow as everyone else is to identify what\'s REALLY going on between Natsuo and Hina. The parents here are especially oblivious: they think the problem is the girls and Natsuo DON\'T get along, when the real issue is of course the exact opposite. (Even Kirino\'s mom in the Second Season of Oreimo was sharper than THIS.) Natsuo naturally easily succumbs to Rui\'s seduction because, well, he\'s a male of the sort that Kouji Seo (Suzuka, Fuuka, A Town Where You Live) likes to depict.In fact, this is the closest imitation of Seo’s style I\'ve ever seen, and that applies to all THREE leads. For one thing, no matter how often Natsuo lies to and betrays one of the girls (usually with the other one), they STILL both remain resolutely in love with him, just as they all do with the male leads in Seo\'s shows. And there was one jaw-dropping bit of hypocrisy that reminded me of A Town Where You Live in particular: Natsuo finds out that Hina\'s involved with a married man named Shuu Hagiwara- who was one of her OWN former teachers. (Another teacher, named Reiji Kiriya, was supposedly transferred to Natsuo\'s school because he was involved with a student; AND as the faculty sponsor for the school\'s literary club Kiriya tries to induce Natsuo and another club member to kiss ""as an experiment."" WHAT IS IT WITH TEACHERS IN THIS SHOW???) But what made ME see red was that Natsuo then publicly confronts Hagiwara and Hina over this. Now let\'s be clear that by this time he\'s ALREADY made it plain to Hina (his stepsister/teacher) that he\'s romantically interested in her HIMSELF, so it seemed to me pure chutzpah for Natsuo to adopt this moral-indignation/it\'s-for-her-own-good pretense when there\'s ALSO the completely self-serving purpose of getting a rival out of the picture (or at least of diminishing their influence; see Haruto\'s similar approach to his rival for Yuzuki in Seo\'s A Town Where You Live.) And for him to make an issue of the moral unacceptability of someone ELSE’S desire for her...well, words fail me. But Hina- and this is arguably even MORE absurd- takes Natsuo\'s argument as completely motivated by selfless concern for her. (Which makes her not just an emotional trainwreck, but a particularly DIM emotional trainwreck.) Sure, he thinks he\'s in love with her. At times, he ""loves"" Rui too (or is at least receptive to her advances.) In between the two, he\'ll find himself in love with (or at least in ""lust"" with) a random girl or two, just to spice things up. THIS IS GOING TO BE HIS PATTERN FROM NOW ON. The anime HAS an ending, but not really closure, and this is for a reason: in the manga he keeps repeating this pattern well beyond the events (and the girls) of the anime. (In the anime we DO see him starting to get intimate with one other girl, and the show apparently wants us to admire his final decision to back off with her. But in context it looked to ME like he was perfectly willing to go all the way with her, and backed off just because he noticed something about her that seemed icky. ) And for all of Natsuo\'s belief in his ""love"" for Hina, when the real test comes his concern seems to be not with her well-being, but rather by how HE is affected by what happens to her.Oh, I said I was going to talk about Natsuo\'s literary ambitions. Obeying the literary dictum ""write about what you know"", Natsuo eventually produces a thinly-disguised account of his relationship with Hina (thinly enough that just about anyone from his school could figure out who the ""models"" for it were.) For some reason he wins a prize. My first thought was, geez, first the ""mess""-terpiece in My Sister, My Writer, and now THIS- is no one in Japan supposed to have respectable literary standards??? My second thought was, well, there IS always a viable market for trashy novels, so maybe his work COULD sell well- if it weren\'t such a far-fetched concoction about abominable characters who completely lack self-awareness.I\'ll just mention that the screechy, strident, discordant piano piece that opens the show adds a hysterical note to the proceedings that ALSO does not help.I was also going to note that I\'m also watching ANOTHER show with teachers romantically involved with their students, a ""comedy"" called Why The Hell Are You Here, Teacher?, and with TWO shows with such similar themes, it seems like SOMEONE\'S surely cribbing from someone else. (They\'ve even both got an ""inserting a suppository"" scene.) I\'m not saying that this topic is any LESS offensive played as comedy, but somehow it seemed a little less depressing that way. Domestic Girlfriend seems to demonstrate that exploitation genres don\'t really work as ""straight"" drama, in any case.The Recs are all better shows about students- sometimes students in love, but they\'re almost always more mature than our cast here.I hated all three major characters in this. Honestly, I\'ve never seen such an oblivious, self-absorbed cast in all my life. Natsuo, in particular, is completely oblivious to the fact that REAL love is thinking about the welfare of the other person as well as your own. Hina had it right the first time: he\'s just a ""kid"" in that respect. Unfortunately, I never noticed a moment where he really ""grew up"". If this is what you get when you play a ""hentai"" theme as straight drama, it\'s probably better to leave it as hentai. — Allen MoodyRecommended Audience: Nudity, sexual foreplay, and adult themes.

God when i read the synopsis i thought tea would be spilled, but nooo it was burned. I mean i am a sucker for drama but this just did not sit right with me at all.Story: 5/10. The plot was actually not that bad... the idea isn\'t a bad thing at all. It\'s just that it\'s one of the plots that should remain...""a possibility, but never reality."" I understand that maybe the author was trying to spice things up, but it did not feel like it had a natural flow to it at all. And the plot twist was only there for the climax; it wasn\'t too thoroughly explored, though i sort of liked it. Story-wise, this situation certainly might be possible, but i pray this sort of thing really doesn\'t happen in real life.Art: 7/10. It was great, and the scenery was not half-assedly made. I like how they used some of the same perspectives during the character\'s crucial moments, so we can somewhat feel what they were going through and the difference of the atmosphere as well.Sound: 6/10. The sex scene gave me second-hand embarassment, but other than that, it sounded okay. I especially like the main character\'s reaction near the ending; that was heartfelt. Good job for the va on that.Character: 5/10. I hate to admit but i kinda like how the main character isn\'t actually your typical good guy, but is more of someone who literally just follows his heart. He gets caught up in the moment, and bam. Things happen. He has no moral compass whatsoever, only horniness. It was a change of mc character for me since i have watched a lot more shounen and no drama like this at all.If we\'re looking at this from an ecchi point of view, it certainly is different from your normal ecchi, and at least has a reasonable plot to it. From this view, the characters are barely fleshed out, while from the actual romance point of view, it seems that the only thing they want to do is fuck.Enjoyment: 3/10. I was enjoying myself until episode 11. Honestly i can understand how the author wanted to give some sort of climax but it was really wack and in my opinion was not needed. The 3 points i\'m giving it for enjoyment is purely because of the opening. It is such a banger and a bop i can\'t get it out of my head.

As you might have read in the synopsis, our MC will be living with the girl he banged and the girl he wants to bang.The reason why I rated this anime so highly is because of how many plot-twists there are on it. Every other episode something BIG will happen that will completely change the way you look at a character, and because of those changes, you just can\'t stop watching.I don\'t care how ""taboo"" this show might be, I watch anime to be entertained and this one worked like a...charm.

I really loved it! I went to see the anime it was from and it happened to be \'Domestic Girlfriend\'. Worst decision of my life. I wanted to write a review about the anime at about episode 6 but it was probably best to finish it up so i can have clear understanding of the whole anime (it was probably not needed but oh well).Natsuo .. i have my eye on you. This person is the most perverted character i\'ve seen in any anime (that\'s probs...an exaggeration) . This guy takes step bro and step sis to a whole new level- To save the pain for you to go watch the anime, i\'ll tell you what he did in the most simple way. First he f*cked his step-sis Rui, this is justifiably kinda since they did it before they knew they were gonna be family. But even when they were family they continued to kiss every now and then. Natsuo had a crush on one of the teachers in his school, Hina. Hina happened to be the other step sis Natsou was gonna have. Natsuo even tried to kiss Hina while she was sleeping , while they were FAMILY. Later on Hina had feelings or some sh*t for Natsuo soooo they kissed, and almost f*cked (i think???).

I ended up watching all of these episodes in the span of a single night and found it very enjoyable.I would definitely recommend watching this garbage show that is so good for yourself and seeing what you think of this very chaotic show because I for one really enjoyed this dumpster fire continuing to burn.[Hina, Rui, or Momo can have me any...day of the week ;)] day of the week ;)]"", 'Domestic girlfriend the show about incest I don\'t even know why I am even writing a review about this but it is what it isThe main reason this show is bad is because of the events that happened almost everything in this show is a coincidence well its fine if he decides to ""do it"" with a random girl on the street well it starts the story of but then his father ""coincidentally"" marries someone and turns out the person he married has kids and guess who it was the one he ""did it"" with and the teacher he has a crush on.and also...his favourite author is also one of his teacher. A romance anime is usually about coincidences but this is just too many.Its also incest.The characters the teacher she is the one I am particularly interested in when I was watching the show her character was really mysterious but nearing the climax where we got to know her turns out she just likes younger men.The main character is also really bland and empty.But I gave my review a five because even if its trash and every episode is really weird but it is by no means boring every time you finish an episode you just want to click on the next one to see what weird shit happens next.The opening is 10/10 tho his favourite author is also one of his teacher.

I would've dropped the show if it wasn't for anticipation of more Rui appearances beyond the 6th episode.The opening music on the other hand is...kind of appealing, particularly the intro music, it had a nice tone to it and I have no complaints.The characters... Well, the 5/10 for characters comes from a mashup of characters which I enjoyed watching mashed with characters that I ESPECIALLY DO NOT ENJOY WATCHING...The Animation is okay, but it is below average for the time being, but there may be budget problems but there are no complaints about it.Overall, this anime will definitely stick in my head, and from thinking it would be a good anime, it went straight to the trash after like the 6th episode.

Even if one has enough courage to foray into the deep dark world created by Kei Sasuga, we may soon realised just how depraved the characters are to not give up on their ""love"", love which they let develop after becoming family, for anything. Every time something decent begins to happen, we, as the viewer, only wonder where it could lead to, and every time it would end up much worse than before.Domestic Girlfriend, everything considered, actually had a memorable first episode. The narrative was bold enough to...dive right into the plot, set up its characters well, and made the viewer actually like the main character, Natsuo Fuji. We see him being a supportive son, a normal high-schooler (apart from having a crush on his teacher, we ignore that part), and a good friend. Natsuo is not a bad character; he is merely a complex one. Even in the later episodes, we see him being a good human to others... but he also loves both of his stepsisters.What the viewer must recognise is that the story was always meant to head this way. The characters were never meant to be good or bad; they had their own lives and their own feelings. While one may appreciate the complexity of these characters, they may not appreciate the story itself.The music is great, the animation is, unfortunately, good, and the voice actors perform well. However, it is not a story that appeals to everyone. Rather, it was made for the appreciation of only a certain group of people.

LOL"", 'Domestic Girlfriend is a smoldering dumpster fire. The presentation is pretty good with particular praise to the OP for being absolutely outstanding. Unironically iconic OP for an anime of this caliber. The VAs did a good job with particular praise going to Yoko Hikasa\'s work as Hina but that doesn\'t mean everyone else did a poor job.The story however...oof. The premise is interesting. I like that there is a distinct flow of time and a more thought out and, dare I say, mature take on romance. This story was written by a woman which furthers my conspiracy theory that women mangakas just write better...romances (or at least more realistic ones compared to most of their male colleagues). I like that this story isn\'t afraid to have the characters be sexually attracted to each other, none of this lewd handholding childish trash. I think the music is okay, nothing stands out but nothing is particularly bad. Again this being a woman-made series, all of the characters look attractive, not just the girls. They also change outfits and the guys don\'t look like they were dressed by their moms like in other romcoms. Um..hm..can you tell I\'m just looking for stuff now?But what I don\'t like, chiefly, is the pure contrivance involved here. There a few examples but to not bore you with an essay length review like a lot of reviews on this site kinda are, a really good one is Natsuo\'s relationship with Momo. Momo is one of the more layered characters in the show and shown to be a love interest to Natsuo. She is presented as the ""normal"" choice because she\'s not his sister (lol) but her life is anything but normal. There are times in this anime where Natsuo\'s actions imply that he likes her, but his words say otherwise. Natsuo\'s characterization is that he is kinda impulsive but when he\'s around Momo, he is more cautious and reserved? Seeing her arm made him stop having sex with her? That\'s dumb. I get the context is that the self-harm made him reconsider his selfish desire to sleep with her but at the same time, he knew she was a bullied person and she initiated the advancements onto him. Perhaps it\'s because he doesn\'t want to be another notch on her headboard or another source of trauma? But why be so committed until the very end like that? I feel like that just hurts her more than rejecting her advances to get him into her bedroom. Natsuo juggles his feelings for Hina while smashing Rui on the side eventually catches up with him as he slowly falls for Rui. Okay...but why? Why is he is so impulsive here and just going with the flow of his feelings but then he acts more discerning at other times? Like I said, this is one example of many but the inconsistent characterization muddles the plot because we are supposed to just accept what we\'re watching without really thinking deep about it. And for a romance drama that is aimed for adults, I can\'t buy into it.I think this anime would\'ve gotten a much lower overall review score had more chapters been adapted simply because the general consensus amongst anime-viewers is that there is an extreme level of contrivance. It hurts because I want to like it, and it has nothing to do with Tezuka\'s production of it, but watching it instead of reading it made me really see how utterly ridiculous it is in its entirety. romances (or at least more realistic ones compared to most of their male colleagues).

Yes at first it is cheesy and sometimes I found myself to be rather annoyed.BUT (and I wish that but would be even bigger)This is most likely the single best show when it comes to displaying the struggels of romantic relationships between adults.Things like cheating, affairs, having your feelings not answered, surpressing what you really feel and are, depression and even down to suicide and self harm. Most of those things I personally experienced and this show really hit close for me.Some people really think of love as...a coin with two sides but I think love and all the emotions that come with it are the most complex to understand and this show just portraits perfectly how hard it sometimes can be.I urge everyone considering this show or looking for an amazing romance drama to look past the whole family thing and just try to understand the motivations of the characters and maybe put themselves in their position and think if you would act differently.The emphasis here is really built around the characters and the story. In terms of emotional investment at least for me, this show is almost up there with shows like ""Shigatsu wa kimi no Uso"".I personally found myself siding with Rui most of the time but almost all the characters were really relatable to me in terms of knowing how they felt.Really sad to see this show get a bad rating because of it\'s premise. a coin with two sides but I think love and all the emotions that come with it are the most complex to understand and this show just portraits perfectly how hard it sometimes can be.I urge everyone considering this show or looking for an amazing romance drama to look past the whole family thing and just try to understand the motivations of the characters and maybe put themselves in their position and think if you would act differently.The emphasis here is really built around the characters and the story.

So I watched it. It wasn\'t. It has a pretty good premise and story that I like. The music is great and the arts pretty good too, but there are so many awkward moments in this that never before have I ever wanted anything more than to shoot my fucking balls off. There are some really agonizing scenes which make me writhe with pain. The characters make some stupid decisions which are typically the cause for these situations to unfold, so I don\'t necessarily like them too much. But over all it\'s...a really good anime, I would totally recommend it. Remember, it\'s not a hentai. a really good anime, I would totally recommend it. Remember, it\'s not a hentai.', 'This is one of those anime that I walk away from it feeling like I didn\'t really watch much. Almost like I spent the whole time going ""okay, it\'s about to take off.""I guess I\'m gonna start with the art and sound. So, the music in Domestic Girlfriend, as far as the opening and ending goes, was great. It was different and felt like it fit the original tone of the anime really well. However, the actual background music that was in the anime definitely did not line up all of the time. Sometimes, during certain feel-good moments, it was spot-on, but there were...times the music supported a comedic scene when a dramatic scene was playing, and things like that. The art was beautiful-- just up my alley. I enjoyed that this anime had a lot of deep colors in it rather than the duller or violently brighter colors we\'ve seen in a lot of anime recently. Again, though, sometimes it would just be weird. Not the art style, but the animation. During some scenes, shocking or surprising things would be said, for example, and there\'ll just be a pause on a screenshot of the characters with absolutely blank expressions. That sort of thing happened more than once, and it kind of made me feel like I didn\'t understand what I was supposed to be feeling in that moment.So, yeah, the sound and art were average; let\'s talk characters. Legit: no development. I\'m not saying they didn\'t change; what I\'m saying is every character had zero backstory effort put in to their stories and the characters that did change did not change gradually at all. It was like night snapping to day all of a sudden. None of it felt organic. Now, there were characters that I liked. A couple of them had really nice quotes and things to say that I thought made them unique and special, but that little bit just couldn\'t carry the rest of the flawed aspects.The story is where I have the real problem, though. Now, listen: I\'ve seen worse. This wasn\'t unwatchable. There was a story there that had some type of shape... it just wasn\'t a particularly good one.For one thing, the tone at the beginning of the series felt like it was going to lead into a much darker anime, when the fact is that it just didn\'t. So, from the jump, I had genre whiplash that knocked me out of the immersion. I\'ve already stated that the anime doesn\'t really pace well either. While the story does have a definite timeline and narrative, it\'s still really choppy and weird. It\'s hard to tell what a character is thinking episode to episode, which makes it difficult to understand why things are happening within the plot. It felt like, what happened, was that the anime was supposed to take one direction, but then that direction was forgotten and replaced with a new one halfway through. Also, as an aside-- totally not necessary to note as a part of this review-- but the story was just... lame. The whole angle of these three becoming step-siblings was just unnecessary. It didn\'t add anything at all except for the occasional ""oh, no, this is wrong"" dialogue. The ending as well was just... why? It ignored nearly everything that happened and made its own conclusion. Or, more like, the entire anime was set up to throw away for the ending from the jump, which makes me wonder why I even bothered watching it just for that.Okay, I just... I\'m not trying to completely flame this anime. It\'s fine. I just found a lot of things in it that irritated me, and it more or less overshadowed the good things about it. It did have some very touching moments in it that actually moved me, and I did find myself being invested in one of the characters\' happiness. So, it isn\'t like I was just mindlessly watching it to trash it later; I did enjoy some of it-- mostly in the first half. To put it simply, this anime tried to recreate a cliche storyline by trying to make it not so cliche in the end, which just proved that the cliche was probably the way to go in the first place. It isn\'t the worst anime for this genre in the world, but...

At the end of the episode, Natsuo\'s dad tells him that he wants to remarry, and Natsuo will get 2 new sisters.I won\'t get further because there is an obvious plot twist after what i just said (sarcasm).The great thing about this anime is that it wastes little time, after a few minutes, THE ACT has happened, and after 5 ep, the guy wants to do it with another random girl with a name that i still do not know why people get labelled with.I won\'t spoil more, this anime is great, it isn\'t a fanservice fest, it isn\'t as long as To love-ru, it\'s just a great 12 episodes shonen/hentaï crossover (thx Gigguk for the idea).

It was something different for me. I do not personally consider it 10 but to oppose the harsh negative reviews I gave it 10. I felt some funny exciting moments in this. I was getting bored with the basic mainstream anime I just watched this on someone's recommendation and enjoyed it. So just watch it and then decide. It has romance, some mild nudity and funny moments. There are some anime I just don't want to watch after watching the first episode.

First thing to clear up, most of the time, the not related by blood thing does not cover up the blatant incest. While texhnically, it is not incest... it is. But this isn't incest. He falls in love and has sexual relations with his sisters before they were even her sisters. Obviously, this guy had really bad luck. He loved someone through this horrible taboo and had two girls fighting for him. Enough about the story that literally raped my brain. Overall, the anime isn't horrible. The drama can be kind of unrealistic at times, but when is drama...in shows realistic. It is always blown up really big to give it more of an effect. We don't want to watch anime characters that actually live a normal life. There has to be a twist. While the anime is no where close to perfect, it still has its charms.

Why Natsuo\'s pure love has to be killed by some cruel rules or ""good measures"" imposed by nowadays society? This is...a story of true love between two people that ever character tries uselessly to break: first Hina\'s boyfriend, a man you will wish to kill with your bare hands, then Rui, Hina\'s unpleasant sister, and finally society, symbolized by teachers.I am sure that one day, looking at the last episode of this amazing anime, I will see this love winning against prejudice and, hopefully, my frustration of seeing Hina repressing her true feelings will finally set me free. a story of true love between two people that ever character tries uselessly to break: first Hina\'s boyfriend, a man you will wish to kill with your bare hands, then Rui, Hina\'s unpleasant sister, and finally society, symbolized by teachers.I am sure that one day, looking at the last episode of this amazing anime, I will see this love winning against prejudice and, hopefully, my frustration of seeing Hina repressing her true feelings will finally set me free.', 'I don\'t get the hate against this show, I have been looking for ages for an romance anime with character that felt like humans and this is it, the story is really enterteining and never boring, the characters are cuta and human, is well drawn, yes is not the most original idea of all but what do you expect from a romance with no fantasy element, at least, unlike all other show, this is done well. The jokes are very few, THIS IS NOT A COMEDY BUT A ROMANCE, the few that exist are intern, that means that you laugh with the character and with...on them, also there is no ""embaracing moment cliche"" or any sexual jokes. Many have criticized the sexual moment but there are not that many and they fell autentic, real, do you expect a real romance to be without them??? try to live in this world man.The characters are partly teenagers so they go to school but there are not that many school scene.At the end it does well everything it should do, it is a very sweet a cute story with a more serious tone.

The problem of the main characters is almost ignored, after all they are a ""stepfamily"", in other words, NOT-RELATED-BY-BLOOD. It becomes comic, but looking at another point the anime also has its maturity, after all it has been a rather spicy anime.

The anime is relatively more or less straightforward.**For the review I will be spoiling the first 2 episodes of the series.**Domestic Girlfriend is a series about a character who loses his virginity to some random chick named Rui. Something he then sort\'ve regrets because he already had feelings for someone else. This girl in question being his teacher, Hina. Natsuo (MC) gains feeling for her as she figures out that he wants to write a story. So Hina is constantly pestering him for another chapter of his...book while Natsuo gets flustered and slowly but surely gained feelings for her. Now the story actually starts when his dad actually marries another women giving Natsuo 2 step-sisters. Lo and behold the younger sister is the girl he slept with and the older sister is his teacher that he\'s in love with. Now he has to deal with both of these under one roof.I have to say I am somewhat impressed by the series. Not just because of the 1.5 minute long sex scenes either. The series does far better job than I expected into making me like the characters. This is especially true for the trio of main characters. Natsuo isn\'t some deadbeat weirdo but is an interesting protagonist. Similar to the other 2 heroines. I think the author has done a good job of making me want to see how there story unravels. They aren\'t some God-Tier characters but they are fun and enjoyable to watch.Likewise the romance of this series is very very fun. Dare I say its probably the best part of the series. I really liked listening and watching all the romantic tension unfold. I don\'t think giving a series bonus points just because it doesn\'t end at the dating aspect gives you bonus points. But It was still refreshing and entertaining to watch. I think the anime does a fantastic job of making me want to watch more and more.The story as well does a good job of hooking you in. The MC is in love with Hina, Hina is dealing with her own love problems, Rui has no people skills but is slowly coming to terms to her feelings. At the same time all these feelings are clashing with each other making this into somewhat of a roller coaster. But its a fun Roller coaster where i can\'t wait to see what happens next.I think the weaker part about the series is probably the last 2-ish episodes and the side characters. Alex especially felt very poorly placed and had no meaning. The rest were fine but again really it is only the gay barman that was fun.Also the last episodes feel somewhat rushed. Even before i felt like the manga anime was skipping something. Now i have read the first 150 chapters of the manga but i don\'t actually remember the first 100 chapters at all. Some of it did come back but the parts that did was pretty what the anime adapted. Everything was happening much faster than it should and this resulted and the more serious scenes to have a more comedic effect rather than the intended one.The final bit of issue for me was that the ending was open ended. It was more like ""go read the manga pleb"" rather than the anime trying its own ending.Despite all of this i did enjoy the series. The series had well established characters and an interesting story that made me want to know what happens next. I think the anime had done its job of making me you know, enjoy it.TLDR: It\'s not some masterpiece but its interesting and exciting enough to make me wanna know what happens next. At least more so than most of the other anime i have seen. 7/10 book while Natsuo gets flustered and slowly but surely gained feelings for her.

Unfortunately, the OP is the best part of this awful show. I don\'t usually give low scores, 5 is the lowest I have scored, as I think all shows have at least a few redeeming factors that make them avoid complete garbage status.Domestic Girlfriend is a fucking trainwreck. It tells a story that could as much be an hentai plot, the catch being there is no explicit sex. Kind of like Aki-Sora but more reserved on the sex scenes. I feel like the author used...to write hentai but they wanted to reach a broader audience so they made this.The premise is simple. A guy named Natsuo loves his teacher, but she has a boyfriend, so to forget about her he decides to have sex with the first girl he sees after leaving school (kind of literally). Both his teacher and his ""partner"" end up becoming his step-sisters and the story goes on from there.Now, there were a couple of ways that this show could work. The first being if it didn\'t take itself seriously and had been an incestuous comedy manga (if that\'s even a thing). The other one would be having an actual good plot, which it doesn\'t.The first few episodes are entertaining, albeit stupid, but then the short 12 episode plot just gets repetitive and bland on top of cringy.I guess I don\'t want to spoil too much but I\'ll try to sum up the main character\'s traits:- Natsuo is constantly jumping back and forth between the two sisters, like he couldn\'t decide on which sweater he should wear.- Hina (the teacher) is having an affair with a married man even though she despises the fact her father did the same to her mother. This isn\'t the only thing that makes her an hypocrite, as she tells her sister she can\'t date Natsuo because it\'s incest, but then proceeds to bang him like 10 minutes later. She is the worst character in the show.- Finally Rui (the younger sister) is a tsundere that grows into being nicer as the show goes on. She is also a bit annoying because she tries to have sex with Natsuo even after he and Hina lied to and betrayed her trust. She is still the best (main) character in the show though.There are a couple more girls part of Natuso\'s harem but they don\'t do much and just show up a few times, having a dedicated episode each.The vast majority of the drama scenes are either very cringy or just unreasonably funny. I\'ll give a couple of examples:- Natsuo just finished having sex with Hina and is talking to her. He is saying how he saw her masturbate weeks ago and she gets embarassed. He replies ""don\'t worry, I jerked off thinking about you afterwards"" with a casual voice.- When Natuso confesses his feelings for Hina on a beach, the first thing she does is stand up, drag him to the sea and try to double suicide because they can\'t be together. Later in the episode they are having sex with no issues whatsoever though.Several other instances in the anime are also stupidly unrealistic, such as when Rui constantly forgives Natsuo for betraying her trust and lying to her or when in the final episode the two sisters start fighting over who gets to be with Natsuo, which I guess is the following plot of the manga.The art is also abhorent. The first few episodes are ok, and since this is a show that doesn\'t require a big budget or fluid animation they could have focused on a consistent art syle, however there are several disproportionate characters with weird faces or jagged limbs.The redeeming factors I mentioned at the beginning are the aforementioned OP and also the sub-plot of Natsuo trying to become a novelist. It was much more interesting seeing him struggle with the fact he wasn\'t good enough and winning an amateur first prize award than the entire rest of the romance plot. Moments like him finding out his teacher was actually his favorite author and him staying over two weeks closed in his room trying to create a decent novel were the highlight of the show for me. If the story actually focused on that or even if it was a romance story but without all the bullshit love triangle and unrealistic situations, I think this could have been a pretty good series, but it isn\'t.4/10 to write hentai but they wanted to reach a broader audience so they made this.The premise is simple. A guy named Natsuo loves his teacher, but she has a boyfriend, so to forget about her he decides to have sex with the first girl he sees after leaving school (kind of literally). Both his teacher and his ""partner"" end up becoming his step-sisters and the story goes on from there.Now, there were a couple of ways that this show could work. The first being if it didn\'t take itself seriously and had been an incestuous comedy manga (if that\'s even a thing). The other one would be having an actual good plot, which it doesn\'t.The first few episodes are entertaining, albeit stupid, but then the short 12 episode plot just gets repetitive and bland on top of cringy.I guess I don\'t want to spoil too much but I\'ll try to sum up the main character\'s traits:- Natsuo is constantly jumping back and forth between the two sisters, like he couldn\'t decide on which sweater he should wear.- Hina (the teacher) is having an affair with a married man even though she despises the fact her father did the same to her mother. This isn\'t the only thing that makes her an hypocrite, as she tells her sister she can\'t date Natsuo because it\'s incest, but then proceeds to bang him like 10 minutes later. She is the worst character in the show.- Finally Rui (the younger sister) is a tsundere that grows into being nicer as the show goes on. She is also a bit annoying because she tries to have sex with Natsuo even after he and Hina lied to and betrayed her trust. She is still the best (main) character in the show though.There are a couple more girls part of Natuso\'s harem but they don\'t do much and just show up a few times, having a dedicated episode each.The vast majority of the drama scenes are either very cringy or just unreasonably funny. I\'ll give a couple of examples:- Natsuo just finished having sex with Hina and is talking to her. He is saying how he saw her masturbate weeks ago and she gets embarassed. He replies ""don\'t worry, I jerked off thinking about you afterwards"" with a casual voice.- When Natuso confesses his feelings for Hina on a beach, the first thing she does is stand up, drag him to the sea and try to double suicide because they can\'t be together. Later in the episode they are having sex with no issues whatsoever though.Several other instances in the anime are also stupidly unrealistic, such as when Rui constantly forgives Natsuo for betraying her trust and lying to her or when in the final episode the two sisters start fighting over who gets to be with Natsuo, which I guess is the following plot of the manga.The art is also abhorent. The first few episodes are ok, and since this is a show that doesn\'t require a big budget or fluid animation they could have focused on a consistent art syle, however there are several disproportionate characters with weird faces or jagged limbs.The redeeming factors I mentioned at the beginning are the aforementioned OP and also the sub-plot of Natsuo trying to become a novelist. It was much more interesting seeing him struggle with the fact he wasn\'t good enough and winning an amateur first prize award than the entire rest of the romance plot. Moments like him finding out his teacher was actually his favorite author and him staying over two weeks closed in his room trying to create a decent novel were the highlight of the show for me. If the story actually focused on that or even if it was a romance story but without all the bullshit love triangle and unrealistic situations, I think this could have been a pretty good series, but it isn\'t.4/10', 'Besides an absolute BANGER of an OP, this show requires you to sign a waiver because of how spicy this gets. If you want a cohesive plot, do not watch this show. If you have a step-sister, please do not watch this show. But, if you want to see a show that is absolutely WILD, then turn off whatever soap opera you were watching and watch this instead. I have no clue as to why I continued on to keep updated with the manga. Maybe once the spice wore off, I needed to see if this story could attempt to reach ghost pepper level. All...jokes aside, this show should not be taken seriously. It attempts to tackle subjects such as self-harm which is baffling for a show that is centered on an MC that has a crush on his 2 step-sisters. Just enjoy the ride and turn off your brain, this is solely meant to be a show that has a shock factor cranked up to 10. jokes aside, this show should not be taken seriously.

Natsuo's behavior, Hina's behavior, Rui's behavior, everyone's behavior... I could relate to all of them in most cases. I truly love all the characters and understand all their choices. I never thought I could find a manga/anime like this one. A manga/anime that could put me in the story.It only took me a couple of days to be up to date with the manga - which is made of 216 chapters right now. I don't want to spoil or anything so I'm just gonna say this :...even after 216 chapters, I still love DomeKano from the bottom of my heart and I felt all the pain Natsuo went through the same way I'd have felt it if it was me.I think that beyond the fact that it's a manga/anime, it conveys strong messages about how reality is, about how love is, about how a writer's life is, and so on.I wish this masterpiece will be able to make all its readers/viewers shiver the way I did. I'm looking forward to the next chapters.流石景、本当にありがとうございます。 even after 216 chapters, I still love DomeKano from the bottom of my heart and I felt all the pain Natsuo went through the same way I'd have felt it if it was me.I think that beyond the fact that it's a manga/anime, it conveys strong messages about how reality is, about how love is, about how a writer's life is, and so on.I wish this masterpiece will be able to make all its readers/viewers shiver the way I did.

I have massive respect for the author. I hadn't cried for a very long time. Until this morning when it hit me again.There is no way that the anime can match the manga. But that's okay.

After watching Gigguk\'s analysis of the show on YouTube, I decided to look past all the negative reviews and try this anime out for myself. Despite the *spicy* plot and the clearly hentai elements, the characterization in this show is so realistic and believable. Everyone, from the parents to the sisters and the MC and all of their friends, is a well-thought-out, complete character with their own feelings, drives, motivations, and self-doubts.My overall rating was a...9 personally, so I\'m not going to say something like ""Try to overlook the plot and appreciate the characterization"". I am all-in for this anime and I want people to see it as I see it: a dramatic yet erotic portrayal of complicated love and sexual expression. 9 personally, so I\'m not going to say something like ""Try to overlook the plot and appreciate the characterization"".

I was somewhat surprised, and a little bit disappointed, at how much I enjoyed this series.The characters are bland, dry, and given a singular defining characteristic each. With the exception of best girl Rui, none of the characters show much development at all. The series is very disjointed and they feel more like general ideas of functioning human beings than fully fleshed out characters.The series starts with two teens getting it on in the name of science. I...mean, what better reason to lose your V card than simply because you want to understand what it means to have sex? Sudden plot twist shows that the two horny teens are now siblings! What a twiiiiist.As it progresses you get to meet the rest of the wannabe harem: a hot sister sensei, a bodacious babe with a tendency to flock towards any male willing to give her the slightest bit of attention, and a shy green haired cutie that really doesn\'t want to be lumped into this harem. Don\'t get too excited now, only two of the girls really enter the picture beyond a mere mention of their existence.The younger sibling, which I already introduced to you as Rui, is a socially awkward blue haired beauty that really just wants to feel literally anything. She is like a robot in a flesh suit just yearning to feel any tingles of those pesky little things called emotions.The older sibling, who was the main protagonists love interest and teacher long before becoming siblings, is a drunken mess of a human being that is currently partaking in an affair with her *gasp* old high school teacher! Anyone detecting a bit of foreshadowing here?Pick your ship now: big sister or little sister? If you said big sister you are garbage and cannot sit with us. Anywho, the love triangle follows the three now siblings in the ups and downs of what it means to be a horny young adult with no sense of self control. The whole being siblings thing could really be played up more as it kind of falls into the background which is sad because I am a garbage human being that wanted some more incestual mockery to occur. How in the world did the parents not notice any of the steamy sibling on sibling action going on around them? I guess they too were probably too busy boning to give a shit about the real world.Our horny protagonist gets the best of both worlds for the better part of the series until the older sibling realizes that he has legit feelings and not just puppy love and the younger sibling has one of those ""whoa, what is this feeling? Is this a feeling?"" moments and realizes that she may actually like this empty shell of a plot device. There is the usual will they or won\'t they back and forth in the relationships as the series attempts to give you emotional whiplash but all in all it falls together rather nicely.So what reason do I have to rate it as good instead of it being rated as the total mess that I clearly reviewed it to be? Well, the answer is pretty simple really. I am trash and the show gave me the feels.It is not handled the best and the characters could really use a personality dialysis but the story line (what little there is) is pretty decent and by the end I found myself audibly rooting for my sister of choice, much to the dismay of my partner who did not wish to be inflicted to this trashy soap opera of an anime. The art is really pretty to look at, the music is decent, the opening theme is fire, and the way the first season ended was exactly what I had secretly been hoping for. I love when unrealistic happy endings are ripped away from the cold hard hands of the fans.Look, this series is not great. It is probably pretty bad to a loooooot of people. If you like soap operas, trash television, hentai plot without any actual sex, not like we are blood related sibling love, or just making yourself suffer than you may actually enjoy this series and should give it a shot just for the fun of it. mean, what better reason to lose your V card than simply because you want to understand what it means to have sex?

On the other hand the show doesn't have any noticeable plot holes and the pacing of the show was actually not half bad.Art 4/10Let me be frank the artwork in this show is very half assed. The character designs for the MC and the Teacher where both very bland...and basic looking which was surprising when you compare them to Rui who has a very good character design. Every once and a while the characters would have good designs but it was few and far between. As for the animation it was also very mediocre.Sound 10/10The music in this show is impeccable. The opening, ending, and background music are great and something I would listen to in my free time. The entire reason I watched this show was because of how good the opening is, if you would like to listen to it I will put a youtube link at the bottom of the review.Character 6/10In my opinion the characters in this show were actually not half bad. For the most part they were well written and had interested traits that made up for their lackluster designs for example our MC enjoyed writing and they highlighted that a lot. The reason I only gave the show a 6/10 was because they made so many interesting characters but only actually went into any depth for three of them.Enjoyment 7/10Overall I felt like this was something I didn't mind watching it was well paced and almost so bad it was good. Somehow this show managed to keep me interested by just how much of a mess the MCs life is. In a sense its so bad its goodOverall 6/10Honestly Domestic Girlfriend wasn't terrible but I cant say that it was good enough to deserve higher.

I think it\'s decent to worse-than-good but it\'s not horrible.First, the characters and their dynamic.There are three main characters:Natsuo is your typical romance anime protagonist, nothing more to say really.Rui, your typical romance anime tsundere but she has a little more depth to her character than Natsuo, so it\'s fine in my book. Plus, her design in itself stands out a lot more than N, which kind of makes her the true protagonist in my eyes, if that makes sense. I think it\'s more interesting if you look at it that way.Finally, we have Hina. Ahhhhhh, what a...horrible person. Really, I have no idea how you are supposed to like this character. This b*tch is literally manipulating a high-school student (6 year gap btw, this is totally fine) to almost completely remove himself from society and lie to EVERYONE HE KNOWS (!!!) about the nature of their relationship.Man, that\'s so fucked up.Little side note on N x H, even ignoring the fact that it\'s morally wrong and kinda fucked up, it just feels so wrong! Not morally, but it\'s just awkward. I can\'t really describe it but every time they were on screen together I felt some sort of uneasiness because I feared it was gonna go to shit.To summarize, the characters are mostly one dimensional don\'t really make much sense except for Rui, who I find to be a very well crafted, believable and most important of all relatable character.My second major issue is that the story is very awkwardly written.Depending on how much you read into things, it\'s obvious by episode 1 perhaps 2 that Natsuo and Rui are supposed to end together.But by episode 10 and 11 (only ~9% of the anime to go btw), he\'s still madly in love with Hina willing to go as far as to die with her (???), which I find just wrong and doesn\'t work at all.How is the MC supposed to let go of her and learn to accept that Rui is in love with him and he might be too in such a short period of time??Well, short answer, he doesn\'t.He fucking writes a book and now everything is better.Even after externalizing it, he still loves her. Okay so what was the point ?No idea.And then Rui decides to force herself on him.Whatever, who gives a fuck. It doesn\'t make any sense and I feel robbed.I understand that it would have been just another generic ""in the end I realized I really loved you but couldn\'t admit it"" or some shit type anime end but really, that would have been so much better.You leave the watcher with a feeling of emptiness after watching 12 episodes, which is quite a feat. Really, what harm would have been done in adding one or two episodes to properly wrap up things together? That would have been so much better.Eh, who cares.I don\'t regret watching it but damn, what a bad taste it leaves in your mouth.4/10 horrible person.

Yup- most of what happens is that MC gets caught kissing or on top of another chick and the other chick finds out- gets mad or whatever. Rinse and repeat. I will give credit where credit is due though- this anime does tug at your heart in the most unnatural way.

Even so, I kept watching. I\'m happy I did because over time I realized it was a beautiful awkward tangle of love which covers the unlikely scenario ""What if the person you like and the person you randomly had sex with becoming family members?""This anime shines at making the wotcher unsettled questing actions of main character witch keeping the wotcher intrigued and engaged. The anime gets this effect by forcing the character to make hard choices. The problem with this is that there ends up...being a lot fewer people who can relate to the main character as well as making him very easy to read which can make people who disagree with his dissections even more frustrated.Another part of this anime is its choice of character, its... pretty bland. To counteract this they spice it up with situations the character placed in even if the situation is a bit unlikely. These situations evolve the characters immensely making them work well to bounce off each other.

To counteract this they spice it up with situations the character placed in even if the situation is a bit unlikely. These situations evolve the characters immensely making them work well to bounce off each other.

There's a decent 7-point score in MyAnimeList, and I'm not going to show mercy, in my report.Beginning in Episode 1, we get to know that two families are joining up to form into one. Now, I'm going to completely forget about the mixer-sex thing that begins the desperate story, as it is pretty much insignificant to the rant broiling up in my mind.I mean,...just what were they thinking with the family idea. I can understand a lonely widower and a widow can remarry, but it's simply not suited in this story. First of all, two hot chicks join the protagonist's family, the latter who is a level-headed fellow looking for love. What's the result? Non-blood-related copulation and downright wrongdoings in the house, in the name of a 'family'.The word family has never been so messed up, but I'll say that there are equivalent pieces of work, and anime that falls in the same region. The story's published in Kodansha and given a Demography of 'Shonen'! What the hell! It should've been 'Porn' or 'Messed-up-love-triangle-bullshit', or whatever if such a genre exists. The whole terminology makes no sense anymore. I guess, 'Guro Terminology' is a good genre for this TV show.The characters are a mess. We are talking of the protagonist, who has nothing to show but his bullshit dialogues and cheesy statements for the most part of the show. Side characters did a better job, but it was not enough to save the show from a critical-pummeling. The whole thing turned pretty sour for a story, reminding of shows like Yosuga no Sora, where characters turn fugitive, not for being an anti-Nazi revolutionary, but because of incest (or so it would mean, since they mentioned 'family' in the show). The protagonist Natsuo Fujii was simply horrible. I mean, he was mentioned as an enthusiastic writer and all. The only thing he ever did for most of the series - lie on the bed thinking about his dear Hina, kissing both his 'sisters', having petty love thoughts, administering suppository, and sex.A summary of the above paragraph, the Protagonist has no quality to show for its viewers.The story's about a student falling in love with his teacher. Well, that's very 'original'. Aside from the sarcasm, the story could've been okay, if the story did not begin with the conjunction of those two blasted families. I'm re-stating my point from the above paragraph here, but I'm simply tired of hearing the dialogue, 'We are not related by blood'. That's a hentai-statement and I would've rated this show better if it had marked itself Hentai instead.And the story hasn't been original. Instances of 'siblings' kissing/sex/whatever and being discovered (Yosuga no Sora), introducing an underwear thief (Shimoneta) for no reason. I mean, the viewer might come to view the show as an action-adventure kinda anime being described 'shonen', only to find the action-adventure completely indoors.The obvious 'pushing-of-luck due to relentless flirt over your own 'sister' and being discovered by society' and romance during fireworks are elements that are found. And also the fat side-kick friend who's the intellectual guru of love. It's boring, alright? We've seen enough of that crap. At least think of something original like actual terrorist bombs going off when the protagonist is having sex with his sisters, or something like that. Make it fun, not an unoriginal erotic scene.I've developed this as a liberal review, and I don't mean to condemn any form of sex and innuendos as long as they are used in the right places. But this show showcased a symbol of 'wrong' from the very beginningThe story is bad. It's that simple. I don't care if the manga's good, it left a bad taste in its execution. The characters are worse as I had mentioned above. We can't trust the show if the protagonist is a big 'pussy'. A good protagonist has something good to show, and this fellow Natsuo has nothing to give. In terms of enjoyment, it was a liability. I had to fast-forward, something which I rarely do upon newly watched shows. The art and sound were decent enough, and I pity that such investments of millions of Yen were wasted, that could've gone to better stories.It's just another run-of-the-mill anime, that was a painful experience to see to its end.

I take back my previous statement of the show being trash. Looking back, anime/manga is the definition of trash. Trash as in a piece of work that is very surface-level, made without any intention other than creating a romance comedy. I’ll explain. The manga and anime both have no deeper themes. It doesn’t explore some message with subtlety. It doesn’t explore or contain any underlying themes.  It’s not an artistic masterpiece by any means, nor is the plot clever. As the reader/watcher, the only thing...keeping you going on is either the false emotional tension, your hormones or trying to see the notoriously unsatisfactory ending.This anime defines what’s wrong with current media, be it games, movies, or anime. It’s stupid. Not everything can be a masterpiece, I get that, but this anime plays out more like a fantasy wet dream of some high schooler. It’s just dumb entertainment, not that there is specifically anything wrong. Now I’m not trying to come off as elitist, I don’t need something really deep. Anime can excel at other aspects, such as storytelling, character development, character chemistry, animation, and exploring themes. But Domestic girlfriend is extremely superficial. It relies on the quote on quote “spicy” dumpster fire of a plot to keep it going.To be completely honest, enjoy it at parts. But it's not so bad it's good territory.

Domestic na Kanojo.Welcome to my review to the anime \'Domestic Girlfriend\', in the original of course with the title as seen above. Domestic Girlfriend will be from here on in this review referred to as DomeKano, because it\'s easier. DomeKano is an peculiar anime, that\'s for sure. Why that is, that I will unveil in this review, or you can just read a different one or just go to YouTube and watch some videos about it. Anyhow, DomeKano is a TV anime made by the studio Diomedea and consists of twelve epsiodes in the standard 24 minute-is length. Diomedea has done...a number of pretty great shows; this is not one of them. Not by a long shot. So let\'s get diving!Plot/Story: Our casanova Fujii Natsuo has a crush on his female Teacher, Tachibana Hina. Then, one night Natsuo\'s friends invite him to a karaoke night. During that night Natsuo meets a somewhat shy girl with the name Rui. After some small talk Rui invites him to her home where she asks him if he would do the knick-knack with her. Just because she wants to experience it. And they actually do it. Now comes the very next day and Natsuo\'s father finally wants to marry again. And the woman he marries and married is the mother of Hina and Rui. Meeting them at the front door Natsuo promptly collapsed. Now his sisters are the teacher he is in love with and the girl he just had sex with. From there on the trainwreck starts.And this is truly a trainwreck of a story. It\'s like watching a train crash into a hard wall without making any institutions in evading the tragedy. DomeKano is a bad soap opera, a bad drama sitcom. What unfolds here is the story of an anime regarding pseudo-incest, so incest with not blood-related family members. Now the topic of incest in film can be executed very well with a good script and a good amount of drama. There are plenty or dramatic real-life cases where couples find out, sometimes years later, that they are related by blood. In the case of DomeKano we do not have actual incest, but a step down from that which is not less disgusting. However, pseudo-incest is technically not the actual one so many pornographic things use this, including of course hentai. DomeKano has many moments where it comes very close to that genre without actually going over the bounds. All this CAN be done right if the story is good and everything makes sense, this...does not. For the dramatic premise this anime has, it does little to nothing with it and instead fills each character and most moments with cheap guilt and splashed mediocre drama. On that note, instead of being dramatic, DomeKano comes off as a comedy. And that is not intentional.Art: Nothing really to note here. The animation and artstyle are painfully standard for today and because of that this aspect of the show doesn\'t shine and can receive praise. Except one scene! A scene where the head of Natsuo is replaced by a cheaply drawn expression. Obviously done for a comedic purpose, it is the only REALLY memorable thing of the show that sticks out. Also the Opening has some neat shots and color usage.Sound: I\'m mostly sure that BGM was there but if you were to ask me about those pieces of music I wouldn\'t be able to point out anything. Maybe if I had written this review during the show I may have had some BGM in my mind still, but that\'s just an assumption. As for the Opening and Ending, both are pretty good; that\'s actually all there is to it.Characters: Sigh, characters. An aspect that can raise an anime to amazing heights or break an anime and burrow it 6 feet under. The true champ of the show is Tachibana Rui, a pretty and introverted girl who didn\'t deserve the absurd and tasteless things that unfolded. Talking a lot about her would be going into spoiler territory and I don\'t want that. Let\'s just say that she\'s a nice girl who had the misfortune of her would-be love becoming her new brother. Of course feelings of affection don\'t go away that easily and even less if the ""brother"" was a random person a few weeks before. Rui takes a lot of the shit in this show with great confidence and as best as she can, without breaking. Natsuo is a sad man, pretty unfortunate how his life turned up, but instead of tackling this like an adult he dives headfirst into the madness and bathes in it. I\'m not even sure if he enjoys the situation or not. Every character can become terrible and Natsuo is such a guy. Diving deeper and deeper in instead of confronting his feelings like a sane person would. In total the entire mess throughout the show is because of him not being brave enough. Lastly, there is Tachibana Hina. A ****. Nah, she isn\'t that bad, but still pretty bad. A teacher at the school Natsuo and Rui go to, she does have secrets of her own...that obviously get discovered. And after she catches Natsuo\'s drift she follows his lead into the pits of ""This is not okay"". There are three other characters and they are far better than these three, buut you should watch for yourself and see how much better those other three classmates are. But they can\'t save the sinking ship.Overall Enjoyment & verdict: Despite all this I totally enjoyed this show to the end. It was hard to watch at times but it was kinda worth it and kinda not. It might sound contradicting but I enjoyed this show. As a comedy and as a bad drama for the sake of it being a bad drama. I was eager to see how far the relationships can fall. If the people do even worse things than last episode. It did not disappoint. Honestly, I didn\'t expect this show to be such a fun shitty ride, but it was. Would I recommend it? Definitely not. If you have enough time to watch this mark my word for it and go take a nap instead. I\'m unsure if I will remember this show, probably not.But I will remember that there was this one show that season that was really dumb and stupid but funny.And that\'s about it. Review is over.Thanks for reading and see you next time ah and I give this show a 6/10.

Keep in mind that my remarks are based on the show only and not the manga (I haven't read it).Anyway, the basic gist of the show is romance that becomes a taboo due to unfortunate circumstances. If you ask me personally, this anime expresses human emotions very effectively and explores a topic that I haven't personally seen covered before, and for that reason I love it.Furthermore, the art and music of this show is top tier. The music in particular will leave you in tears, it is...executed so beautifully (especially during that orgasm scene in Episode 7) and I think that episode was one of the saddest things I have ever come across. The longing for unrequited love.The thing that bothers me the most is that the story itself. I mean its a literal pain in the heart to watch it (who knew love triangles are that hard).For anyone curious about the show, I'll just say that watch it but keep an open mind. It isn't bad like most critics say, and moreover it explores the human aspect of us very well. executed so beautifully (especially during that orgasm scene in Episode 7) and I think that episode was one of the saddest things I have ever come across.

And some of it is a bit excessive, I suppose.Buuut I did like...the main theme, that being the relationship between the three and the morality of it.I think the main 3 characters are interesting and realistic. I think they're rather flawed people who certainly wouldn't hold up in nowadays society - and they realize this - and despite their conflicted feelings, they try and go through with it anyway.I found every episode interesting - either due to silly cringyness, nice slice-of-life, or realistic drama. I also found the subplot of trying to become a novelist a nice touch.I wish the other characters received some more love - but only so much you can do in 12 episodes I suppose.I can't quite tell what it is, but my enjoyment for this show was way more than what I expected, perhaps more than what it should be - but in the end, enjoyment is a big factor, isn't it. ^_^ the main theme, that being the relationship between the three and the morality of it.I think the main 3 characters are interesting and realistic.

He soon meets Rui, a blue-haired student (and the best girl of the series), she asks him...to go over her place, she then asks if he wants to bang, just to know how does it feels because she wants to be able to talk when other girls are talking about sex. The next day, Natsuo\'s father announce to his son that he\'s getting re-married 10 years after his previous wife (Natsuo\'s mother) passed away. And... now Natsuo is in trouble, he discovers that the women his father is getting married is the mother of his crush AND the girl he banged the day before, and there you have your love triangle of the season.Story - 6I\'ve put a 6 for the story because, I think you\'ll be agree with me, the base plot isn\'t original, we\'ve already seen plenty of times and it looks like a hentai scenario, but I think it is still fine because there\'ll be very interesting twists that\'ll make you stick to it.Art - 8The art is relatively good, the colors are fairly good and I think the animation is okay.Sound - 8The opening is just incredible, I listen to it everyday, the ost is very discreet, but still good (honorable mention to the music in ep10 which gave me so much feels even if I read the manga)Character - 7The characters are all basics, Natsuo is your average student who has a dream to become a writer has a crush on his teacher, nothing exceptional here.Hina is a young (but with big breasts, don\'t forget it\'s manga) English teacher that likes to talk with Natsuo about the stories he writes on a roof where there\'s literally nobody (like wtf, isn\'t the roof a place where some people go to eat??)Rui is best girl.Jokes apart, Rui is your basic girl that everyone will like, she\'s very careful about her family, she\'s cute and makes pout faces, what do you want more?Enjoyment - 5And here, I\'m going to be mean.Remember when I told to read the manga? I have a good reason, the anime has skipped a lot of key chapters, including character development chapters, I\'m writing this because episode 11 has pissed me so much that I couldn\'t give my opinion on the anime, they adapted like 2 volumes in 1 episode (skipping like 6 chapters in total, IN A SINGLE EPISODE, LIKE WHAT ARE DOING???), plus, we feel like Hina is just a bitch, but she doesn\'t... Every chapter that the anime skipped was important for any characters involved in them, and I think it\'s bad, this manga deserves wayyyy better than that.Overall - 7In summary, I beg you, go read this manga, I\'m not telling that you shouldn\'t watch the anime (which is why I gave a 7, otherwise I would have put a 4 or 5), but you\'ll enjoy more the story if you read it (plus the drawing are beautiful). But after all, if this anime wasn\'t born, I would never have read this, so I think I can at least thank the studio for airing this?And there you have, my first review on MAL, I hope I could convince you to give this manga a shot, I love it a lot.

(this is why I wrote a review about it anyway ^^)', ""After actually watching this I feel very strongly that the vast majority of the negative reviews are from people who are simply put off by the subject matter and had decided before even watching it that they don't like it. If you're not into the premise or it icks you out, fine- but why watch and then review something you know isn't your cup of tea?Regardless of what anyone else says or thinks, I thoroughly enjoyed this and I will staunchly defend this anime against claims that it's super nasty and filthy and one giant sex compilation. In fact, there are only two times in...the entire anime where characters do the deed! The vast majority of the anime, even though it's based around a taboo and uncomfortable-for-some premise, is actually a character-focused drama and romance.The character development is strong and the situation, as improbable as it is to begin with, is explored in a very realistic way in which the characters have mixed, confusing feelings, are thinking about how their actions affect others and what the consequences might be should they continue doing what they're doing. It's not just a bunch of randy teenagers looking for any excuse to bang all the time- to be very clear, the relationship dynamic between the main trio is one that, at its core, is about love and feelings, not sex. There's quite a bit of emotional depth here as a whole and the plot has multiple twists.If you're open-minded about the subject matter and you're fascinated by themes such as the nature of human emotions, complex multi-layered situations, inner emotional conflict, guilt, morality and being true to oneself versus being selfish, there's a lot on offer here.Additionally, the soundtrack is excellent, with huge props to the opening theme in particular. The voice acting is really solid and believable in the English dub. The animation is modern and appealing, as are the character designs. There's quite a bit of meat on the bone and solid pacing for a short twelve episode run. I was also very satisfied with the ending.Because of the subject matter and because a human flaw so many of us have is the complete inability to relate to something or be empathetic towards something that we ourselves don't necessarily feel or agree with, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to everyone. It's great for some people and wouldn't be the right watch for others. Use your own discretion as to whether this type of premise is up your alley or not. I cannot emphasize strongly enough, however, if you come into this with an open mind and you don't have preconceived notions as to what this show is or is not, you'll likely be pleasantly surprised. There's far more depth here than one would assume upon learning the base premise.OBJECTIVE RATING- 9PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 9.25-9.5 the entire anime where characters do the deed!

If the beginning of the anime catches your attention, after the first 4 or 5 episodes just put the anime down and read the manga.

The story itself would seem to be the type that's too weird to watch or enjoy, however, the show executes its story in a great way that isn't weird at all.

That experience is what I felt after watching domestic na kanojo. This anime is literally a pile of trash that you know it sucks and shit but can’t help watching it just like how teenagers listen to cardi B and her ‘rap’ music. Based on the synopsis of this anime, I just can’t take this anime seriously at all. I watch this anime just because the story is kind of ‘unique’ in the sense that such plot rarely happen in reality and i kind of got...bored with the isekai shit. Throughout the show I find myself laughing at how the plot is so stupid and realize this anime was not that bad in the end.Story-3The story was poor like shit. I was hoping for threesome or something but nothing really happen in the end. If we look at the romance point of view the plot is really stupid and cringy. But if we look at it through a comedy point of view, the awkward scenes and the lovey-dovey scenes are just stupid that I found it hilarious.Art-3Art is piss poor. Many still frame in this anime which last for 5 to 8 seconds , I was pretty piss at how diomedea uses this sort of method for many of their episodes because it really killed the characters’ emotion and impact during the scenes in the anime. Their animation style which reminded me of ’ A silent Voice ‘ where the sides of the screen is blurry and only the center is focused is used excessively to covered their shitty animation.Sound-6Op was good and ED was decent. Not much to say here.Character-2The characters were fucking poor. The main character is a guy who likes his teacher but is simply a pussy, he can’t man up and confront his feelings head on which makes the story sort of unbearable, but luckily for me I just enjoyed it as I already know it gonna be trash from the start. The teacher is also another fucking retard, I still can’t really tell if she really like the mc or just can’t think straight. In the end she felt just like your usual slut girl. The other step sister is another trash. She can’t fucking open her mouth to say ‘I like you’ to the mc instead just kisses him from time to time as if the mc got a fucking clue that she likes him.Enjoyment-8This show is bad till the point I really enjoyed watching the stupid things happening throughout the anime.

The fun thing about romance anime is that you know the climax is usually near or at the end. There are ways that a romance series should make you feel, and I don't think that hating the MC should be one of them. I think it's usually normal to dislike one of the love interests in the ever-so-popular love triangle, but to dislike (HATE) two of them? Not sure about that. Not only will you feel a lack of any real concern or sympathy for the MC, but you'll feel...that he deserves neither girl, which is not a satisfying way to end a show. Even worse, we never explicitly know why he loves one of the girls, at least in the anime. That makes very little sense in storytelling, be it a romance series or not. It definitely felt like emotions were torn apart and abused just for the sake of drama; a bad ultimatum.spoilers:The way both Natsuo and Hina behaved was disgusting.

I'd rate this series a 4/10 in terms of plot, not very structured and instead relies on character love affairs to develop the plot.Art & Sound:I experimented with this series with dub instead of sub, I didn't think it was that bad but I feel sub VA suit the characters more than the dub. Animation is fairly generic for a recent title so nothing bad in either parts; 7/10.Character:I was a bit underwhelmed with what the title had to offer in terms of characters, most of the females involved with love interests in the MC were essentially a small harem, MC just chooses what's best for the time and spreads love unconditionally to multiple females at the same time. This is probably the most common way the characters develop, their feelings for MC are realized for a moment then given the cold shoulder as soon as they find MC in another character's bed.

I'd rate this series a 4/10 in terms of plot, not very structured and instead relies on character love affairs to develop the plot.Art & Sound:I experimented with this series with dub instead of sub, I didn't think it was that bad but I feel sub VA suit the characters more than the dub. Animation is fairly generic for a recent title so nothing bad in either parts; 7/10.Character:I was a bit underwhelmed with what the title had to offer in terms of characters, most of the females involved with love interests in the MC were essentially a small harem, MC just chooses what's best for the time and spreads love unconditionally to multiple females at the same time. This is probably the most common way the characters develop, their feelings for MC are realized for a moment then given the cold shoulder as soon as they find MC in another character's bed. This seems beyond the love triangle since MC is essentially sleeping with each other whilst seducing female MCs claiming he's focused on so and so- I'd give this series a 6/10 for character development. Didn't notice the best characters but the rivalry made it less enjoyable to watch...Enjoyment is 6/10 as summed earlier - Overall, this series was  a fair 6/10 - I didn't hate any aspect of the series personally; I see a lot of room for improvement as a romance title."", ""You may think this is a shitpost because of the score, but that's for you to decide.

I have nothing negative...to say unless they don't have any good reason for everything they've cut. But they sure have cut what was the less important. It was all arcs for the secondary characters and a bit of development for the main cast.

It is a very realistic adaptation of younger people growing together but with some crazy events sprinkled in to keep it interesting. The kind of thing that happens to you like once or twice in your whole life happens every other month to them. The MC and his crush behave as their age and when you put yourself in their place you realize that it makes sense. Same goes for the rest of them. All of them develop a lot from their interactions with each other and the older characters don't change like the kids as much as they improve on who they already are instead and get a better idea of who they are and what they want which again, is very realistic.I don't wanna spoil so that's why I'm keeping it vague.This anime has made me feel quite a few things but since they've only adapted a very small and sweeter part of the whole story, it doesn't hit as hard as some later arcs. The manga has higher highs but also lower lows. Most of it is great until the MC has to make his final choice. From then on the manga kind of drags on with a lot of poor writing but at least the right and true ending has been shoehorned in.

I'd say all the characters suffer from this abnormally fast pace but Natsuo in particular suffers the worst since he goes from being this extremely realistic and believable character to someone who just wants to do it with Hina as soon as he can.

What has been animated is a part that still is quite good and while it may be pretty much a soap opera, it has attracted a reading for no reason, it is a pretty solid drama.I do however think that the anime still leaves much to be desired. It...cuts down on important side characters to get the content covered and it also moves key scenes around, causing several events to be viewed in a different light, which I cannot really consider appropriate, even if there is a general tendency in these adaptations to trim down content.

Unlike for example the trimmed content for Ashihara, Momo and Al, this isn't even that the content got removed, it's just weirdly elsewhere. Why?Apart from this, the anime is quite ok aesthetically. Which makes it a pity it falls flat on the adaptation. This anime covered some of the best parts of DomeKano, it had good visuals, an incredibly good Opening Song and many scenes, due to being animated, can be emotionally much more powerful. As it is though, I don't think this is a good anime, it is good for someone who liked the manga, to see some of that animated beautifully, but anyone who really wants to appreciate the story, just read the manga instead. Obviously, people might just say this then includes also the whole rest of the manga, but honestly, you can just cut it short at the same point where the anime ends and you'd have the same unfinished story before you, just told better. cuts down on important side characters to get the content covered and it also moves key scenes around, causing several events to be viewed in a different light, which I cannot really consider appropriate, even if there is a general tendency in these adaptations to trim down content.

Didn't make me go all sad, but it made me go cry at least.It made me think about a 19 yo Girl I talked to at a Party, she was crying...cause of her low self esteem, and the fact that her best friend is very attractive, and gets run down by boys. But she always get's to be the 2nd choice.You have a certain similarity here that instantly brought me back to that conversation.Me personally, a boy that grew up with a lot of problematic relationships, can understand the problems that protagonist faces in here. The Rui stuff is relatable, the Momo stuff was Bold and Hina is just sad truth.Incest is another thing, but that was an unneccesary writing mistake to make the situation easier to understand to the viewer, it wouldve taken 24 ep just to explain it otherwise.Spoiler:Rui really shows the most problematic Girl problem I've encountered in my life. Beeing Socially awkward, get a boy to sleep with you without feelings, fall for him later on because you can't get him out of your head.I've seen that countless times, I felled victim to that a few times.This isn't easy, this is hard. The Anime shows how she tries to stick to her feelings all the way through, that it is not a joke to feel this love, even though it wasn't needed, wasn't intended and wasn't wanted.Momo beeing an abused depressive kid, that continues to be easy to stick to her sanity. Feeling love, feeling company and feeling Joy is easy if you pay for any of these with your Body if you happen to be an attractive Girl.She show's how this works, after that has been shown she has been ignored too much, simple writing mistake. But the limitation of 12 episodes also made it impossible to give a side harem girl more then 2 episodes of attention. So they just cut everything afterwards, cant say no to that.Hina... this is hard, she beeing the only adult in an dilemma caused by teenies. She really had it the hardest, trying to be responsible, trying to impress and trying to shoulder everything that occurs in her ''Family''.Beeing into a Married guy... this is also a very problematic thing when you are beeing a grown up.

I didnt plan to watch Domestic romance because of all the negative reviews (im the type who watching animes based on reviews and rating). And I find it is important to give a decent review that this anime actually deserve, instead of those from people who didnt even actually experience real life romance and only good with keeping their hand in their pants at 6am in the morning.Story/Character: 7/10.The story of Domestic Girlfriend(s) bases on A LOT OF coincident. MC got laid with some random girl at...first met. MC was in love with his teacher at school. And then suddenly they became a family. Is it normal? No. Does it make sense then? Hell yes. We had some anime about dozen of kids fighting mecha dinosaurs and then suddenly flew into space and jumped into a wormhole, so why is this not acceptable? With that in mind, let's move on.The first arc was about relationship of Hina and Shuu. I liked how the show made me not able to hate Shuu and Hina that much in the first arc. They are adulter/ess, but what the heck we saw people moving the world for love, so why is cheating not acceptable in a drama anime? It's not acceptable in real-life, sure (or is it, i dont know) but this is fictional, and I believe we shouldnt judge the anime for that, or else all villain movies would be crap.After that, the show would throw in some unrelated part, such as relationship between Momo and MC, or MC and his mom, or Alex and the underwear thief, or Hina and her hands at midnight.... I guess they try to make it long enough for a 12 eps series, since those can be removed completely without affecting the story, except for making our MC look like a more decent guy. The story after that is mostly about the love triangle. So this is mostly about the 3 main characters.MC: I read enough reviews on all kind of romance/drama animes about how bland the main characters are. And that's the point. Instead of making unconventional, exceptional main characters like 8man in SNAFU, the authors made these bland MCs so that it would be relatable for the viewers. People blame him for being unfaithful, but if it's me I couldnt hold back if a cute girl like Rui asked for a kiss, especially when his crush kept on pushing him away. It's not like he is married or attached in anyway. It's also because MC felt really sorry for Rui that he granted her request.Rui: Definitely a waifu material, with pouty face, blue hair and red eyes. However the show failed at describing how much is her love for MC. It's like Rui loved MC very much, but after the last kiss everything went, puff, gone. And then the last moment of last ep we could see again a bit of a love with MC still remained, but then she declared an all out war against her sister. Seriously tho I thought she gave up on MC.Hina: a popular girl everyone love who actually have a dark side of dealing with forbidden relationship(s) quite frequently. Even after those times she actually accepted the relationship with MC, she still looked uncomfortable doing stuffs with him. She is actually the one who gave me the uneasiness watching the show for her questionable actions. I mean who the *** dont close their door while masturbating????All the other characters were completely forgettable, since they doesnt do much for the series, except the flat chubby guy acting as the narrator sometimes and the other teacher who nudge MC to his dream.In short, the story is unconventional, but they failed to make it interesting enough to be a good show, but not as horrible as i thought. The characters are also simply forgettableSound. 7/10The OP/ED are good, but not that great. The rest are meh.Art 7/10I dont know much about rating anime's art, but this one seems like a lower average.Overall: 7/10The show is unconventional, but not interesting, but then is also not horrible either. It's a real shame that such a potential story of adult love is poorly done, but maybe the genre itself is hard, with the example of Golden Time or White Album 2. first met.

Well yes before getting cockblocked by her like 4 times cause of(im a teacher and your my student)They proceed to fuck, teacher gets found out she moves to different city and the guy then proceeds to start fucking her sister, as i said in the first sentence it wouldve been better to be a full blown hentai,  if it were a hentai with some good sex scenes it would be a decent hentai but you get this weird ass anime where its just fucking weird to watch, that beinf said character development is non existent exept the part where the guy finaly gets to fuck his teacher, the show has 1 good thing and thats a 10 out of 10  and thats the op, its realy a good opening, anyhow this concludes my thingy dont watch it if you look for a good romance the twist the guy is in love on his teacher who in turn is the sister of the girl he fucked and she also becomes his stepsister, to sum up the story real quick guy wants to fuck his teacher(who is in a relationship) but also fucks her sister,  anyhow the dude the teacher has a relationship with is a asshole and the guy and sister make sure they break up, now the guy can fuck his teacher and stepsister right?

That's unfair. As much as what happened to the main characters, this piece of art just attracts unfairness to itself.First, there's actually NO incest here but many have just failed to see this.Second, I have to note that opening song made a very strong appearance in my playlist which is pretty rare.Third, I somehow seemed to totally understand characters, their actions and reasoning behind it. Maybe cause I find some resemblance. Well, hate me too, why not?I honestly expected it to be...some cheap drama built around underwear, sex and similar fap matters but pretty quickly it set straight that it's not.I have to admit that the number of accidents is truly overwhelming, but that's cause it's pretty hard (impossible) to reasonably squeeze 28 volumes in 12 episodes, so they did what they could. Altered or rushed the story here and there but kept the the message, the overall spirit, the feeling. Maybe doubling the number of episodes would've helped, but...Length does not seem to be the main reason for low scores as I have read. Apparently most of them are written by juveniles that have never had a strong feeling and see world as black and white, cause once again I didn't see any major character's decisions that would infuriate me.Apparently, most reviewers here know more about relationship and how things are supposed to happen and characters should act than anybody. Why are they watching this kind of anime and not applying their amazing skills this the real life then? I don't know. Maybe cause their experience is limited to relations with 2D girls. It actually feels that they sunk in their nihilistic dream world and are very upset when someone has a different opinion from theirs. So...In my opinion, It's worth the time as much as manga's worth reading as it's nearly safe to say that it's a different story of the same characters. Though, if anime was hated, same will apply to manga and therefore better be avoided. some cheap drama built around underwear, sex and similar fap matters but pretty quickly it set straight that it's not.I have to admit that the number of accidents is truly overwhelming, but that's cause it's pretty hard (impossible) to reasonably squeeze 28 volumes in 12 episodes, so they did what they could.

But believe that is also because this topic of love among teacher-students and siblings is a sensitive and problematic topic. First of all, I am not a person who would like to gloss over the topic, but I am a person who does not convert something with hatred or contempt. Briefly why. Love is often unfathomable and often difficult to manage. Especially for people at a young age.Then a short sentence on the subject of hentai so ka what you look for hentais but the anime can be compared to a hentai...in no way. The beginning is chosen a bit strange but such women also give RL. Everyone can say how they like it.Now to the anime: The story takes up a delicate and in society controversial topic which is actually quite young because until the end of 1800 it was even normal (think of my first sentence, I don't want to gloss over it) but the anime takes up the topic Take care of my eyes it is a forbidden love first between pupil-teacher and then between pupil-teacher stepsister (where you can also argue it is blood addiction or not) What the main character has for the problem is that both of his stepsisters become. And that puts him in an even worse mess.Then there was also a fight among the step-sisters over the brother they loved. with which he was drawn even more into the affair of the heart. That means he was inundated with so much love whispering that he didn't even know what now. Can even put me in the shoes of my brother doing something like that. This is pure love stress. What you shouldn't forget about the anime (so I see it's all about the topic of love among teachers / siblings, which in my eyes was taken up well and tried to treat because you tried to show that it is actually wrong, but you are What the anime still showed were the different characters: from woman / man who knows no love to woman / man with marriage (relationship) and woman / man who takes everyone who is net at 3 on the tree up to love among siblings.As I said, it is a sensitive and frowned upon topic which the anime staged well in my eyes and shows the problems that can happen with it (parents think that they should never have married for the sake of the children) The end was a bit surprising for me with ne total loss to be honest. but you should still think about it in the RL, what if you got into such a situation yourself? You fall in love with whom and suddenly the stepsister / brother becomes how do you react? clear it is wrong but you can not feel like switching off overnight so how do you deal with it. The anime goes in the wrong direction in my eyes, BUT it also shows how it would turn out if you allowed it, what kind of problems arise and whether it is worth the risk. The anime leaves the company and the audience mega splits, but you can also see that people deal with the topic, which is so good that it explains (even if only minimally).At the end I would like to say / write again that I don't want to gloss over it. And think that the anime (which is not a hentai because of 2-3 suggested erotic scenes, it is not equal to ne hentai) is still good and the music was appropriate and consistent. I can recommend it BUT it is to be enjoyed with caution, especially if you are completely averse to the topic and you are / have been in such a situation yourself.Oh, since I have always written wife / husband, I would like to add Diverse at the end, otherwise it would have been too long in no way. The beginning is chosen a bit strange but such women also give RL. Everyone can say how they like it.Now to the anime: The story takes up a delicate and in society controversial topic which is actually quite young because until the end of 1800 it was even normal (think of my first sentence, I don't want to gloss over it) but the anime takes up the topic Take care of my eyes it is a forbidden love first between pupil-teacher and then between pupil-teacher stepsister (where you can also argue it is blood addiction or not) What the main character has for the problem is that both of his stepsisters become.

That means he was inundated with so much love whispering that he didn't even know what now. Can even put me in the shoes of my brother doing something like that. This is pure love stress. What you shouldn't forget about the anime (so I see it's all about the topic of love among teachers / siblings, which in my eyes was taken up well and tried to treat because you tried to show that it is actually wrong, but you are What the anime still showed were the different characters: from woman / man who knows no love to woman / man with marriage (relationship) and woman / man who takes everyone who is net at 3 on the tree up to love among siblings.As I said, it is a sensitive and frowned upon topic which the anime staged well in my eyes and shows the problems that can happen with it (parents think that they should never have married for the sake of the children) The end was a bit surprising for me with ne total loss to be honest. but you should still think about it in the RL, what if you got into such a situation yourself? You fall in love with whom and suddenly the stepsister / brother becomes how do you react? clear it is wrong but you can not feel like switching off overnight so how do you deal with it. The anime goes in the wrong direction in my eyes, BUT it also shows how it would turn out if you allowed it, what kind of problems arise and whether it is worth the risk. The anime leaves the company and the audience mega splits, but you can also see that people deal with the topic, which is so good that it explains (even if only minimally).At the end I would like to say / write again that I don't want to gloss over it. And think that the anime (which is not a hentai because of 2-3 suggested erotic scenes, it is not equal to ne hentai) is still good and the music was appropriate and consistent. I can recommend it BUT it is to be enjoyed with caution, especially if you are completely averse to the topic and you are / have been in such a situation yourself.Oh, since I have always written wife / husband, I would like to add Diverse at the end, otherwise it would have been too long"", ""Disclaimer this is a type of retrospective that i have done after reading the Manga of Domestic Girlfriend everything in this comment is entirely my opinion and you are free to agree or disagree I only ask that you respect my thoughts and that way I can respect everyone else's with that in mind there are heavy spoilers for the manga in this article so if you are not done with it I advise that you keep scrolling however if you have finished it or do not mind the spoilers I would gladly appreciate if you would give me your thoughts thank you.Honestly this was...really good and I was sucked into the story a love story about forbidden love between a teacher and a student but after Hina left for the first time the story really flourished and Honestly I would say I was team Rui since the first chapter nad I knew she was going to have some impact on the story so after Hina left I hated ther character for leaving Natsuo with nothing but a letter but I understood why she had to do it. Then Rui and she helped Natsuo get back in his element and I loved it I was rooting for their relationship the entire time it got to the point that when Rui broke up with Natsuo I almost cried and I didn't really want to read the story anymore because I didn't see a point I just thought oh well they broke up guess he's gonna get with Hina now but that isn't what happend and when Natsuo and Rui got back together I was estatic and that joy grew even larger with the fact that they had baby on the way and they were getting married I thought to my self that they were finally getting the happy ending I wanted, but I felt there was something wrong with the couple of chapters I felt that there was a couple of chapters left and I thought what they would be considering the fact that the marriage and happy ending i longed for was rapidly approaching but then the last arc happened and what I was thinking is that the worst would happen to Hina or she would come to terms with the relationship of Natsuo and Rui. But I was utterly shocked when the broke off the wedding and that Natsuo and Rui decided to devote their lived to Hina as she had devoted her life to make Natsuo happy and it was devastating when I found out that Natsuo and Hina were going to get married it isn't what I wanted but it was what was supposed to happen. Of course I was disappointed that my dream couple didn't end up the way I wanted them too and even thought I am sad in a way I'm still sort of happy. It was a bitter sweet ended in the type of way that the story didn't turn out the way I wanted it too but all the characters were happy and that was ok too. This series made me feel lost of emotions happiness, anger, sorrow, sadness, excitement, and throughout the whole thing it gave me a warm feeling in my heart that maybe someday I can also have the relationship that Natsuo and Rui a caring relationship that is not perfect that would at times feel like it was not meant to be but in my heart it was meant to be this will always be my ideal relationship even if it didn't go the way I wanted it to go. Now I will be honest I probably have to right to be giving this series the amount of criticism I'm giving it but thats just how much I love this series and I also want so many other people to experience it they might not view it in the same light I did but thats the thing with opinions they can be agreed with and respected but in the case of Domestic Girlfriend i will respect everyone's opinions but I will not say I agree with everyone saying this is a bad series I would 100% recomend this to anyone who wants a thrilling love story but can accept the bad. With that in mind if you do not mind at times reading softcore hentai and some very awkward moments here in there lol, I rate this 8 outta 10 and I would recommend. :) really good and I was sucked into the story a love story about forbidden love between a teacher and a student but after Hina left for the first time the story really flourished and Honestly I would say I was team Rui since the first chapter nad I knew she was going to have some impact on the story so after Hina left I hated ther character for leaving Natsuo with nothing but a letter but I understood why she had to do it.

This is one of the first times I’ve rooted against the main couple in a series. The reason why Natsuo and Hina even managed to become a couple was not because they worked hard for it; it’s because the people around them accommodated their sh*tty behavior rather than calling them out for it. Case in point, Natsuo’s friend helps him tell lies to hide his relationship from Rui. In the beginning, I thought Natsuo was a decent...character for rejecting sex with Momo and helping her get her emotions sorted out. But then he goes and starts a relationship with Hina and tells lies to hide it from Rui, whom he knows has feelings for him. Normally, I don’t care if the MC is going around and collecting every girl in his neighborhood like they’re Pokémon. As a guy, I get it, it gets the attention of male viewers. But when the MC chooses to commit to one girl, and then CONTINUES to get it on with the other girls, that’s just scummy behavior that I don’t understand how anyone can enjoy. By the way, I’m not saying this because I feel bad for Hina; she’s the most wishy-washy character I’ve ever seen. I don’t understand how she goes from being a respectable adult who acknowledges that Natsuo is her student, step-brother, and A MINOR, and turns down his advances, to then giving in to everything he wants everytime he says the magic words: “Sensei, tell me what you really think 😉”. I could write a whole other essay on why Hina is a sh*t character but that’d be even more of a waste of my time than writing this review.Rui is the only character in this show who develops in any meaningful way, going from having sex with Natsuo for the sake of it to realizing what it truly means to be loved by someone. The fact that the creators decided to dedicate more screen time to Natsuo and Hina making out than Rui’s journey is the biggest tragedy in this show. Some might argue that Rui is a flawed character just like Natsuo and Hina, and I would absolutely agree with that. But flawed characters are only fun to watch if you get to see them understand their flaws and actively make efforts to better themselves. As a viewer, you can’t help but feel sorry for Rui as she tries to open up more to the people around her only to find herself being simultaneously cucked by her love interest and literal sister.In conclusion, f*ck Natsuo, f*ck Hina, and protect Rui at all costs. character for rejecting sex with Momo and helping her get her emotions sorted out.

Not satisfied with that in the first episode, we already realized that the protagonist is a transacting muleke, he already rolls in the first one, ok until then, but the anime starts to get even more wrong, you know how? His father marries and by coincidence of fate the teacher and the girl he passed on to doves are sisters and they all became a family. The anime is full of unnecessary scenes, with verbose content, like for example Hina (teacher) touching her precious parts with...an open door ??

The two things that made me happy about this one was the op, which is very hot, one of the best I've seen in terms of music, a cool animation and the other was the end when everything goes black.

Some romantic arcs in the series are either snuffed too soon or never properly begin. One might expect the protagonists to be virtuous, but sadly their actions err on the side of hypocrisy and at times, recklessness. The characters could have had more depth. On the whole, the series feels a bit half-baked and rushed, and yet somehow manages to be not half bad.The soundtrack, especially the opening song is excellent.Note: Being the filthy casual I am, I watched the dub version.

SOME SPOILERS MIGHT BE ON THIS REVIEW! READER'S DISCRETION IS ADVISED!Domestic Girlfriend is an anime that has a very weird concept with a bizarre turn of events that is surprisingly enjoyable to watch. This is the first anime in a long time that I've watched because I took a long hiatus on anime and Domestic Girlfriend was what got me back into watching anime. But let's get to the actual review.Domestic Girlfriend's concept and the plot revolves around Natsuo's life taking a massive turn of events when Hina Tachibana, a teacher Natsuo was deeply in love with and a strange girl named Rui,...the girl he had lost his virginity to, end up becoming his step-sisters after his father got re-married. This was where his life changed and become more complicated. Basically, Natsuo gets sister-zoned in the worst way possible. But throughout the storyline, Natsuo is trying to get to progress his life while striving to become a novelist and confess his true feelings towards Hina. Natsuo does run into other characters like Momo, Fumiya, Alex, and Ashibara.The first couple of episodes were pretty good and had a lot of great character interactions and development as well as a pretty good build-up. However, roughly around episode 9, things started to go down-hill and become a complete disaster. Natsuo started to become very unlikable and a complete idiot and episode 10 was where his character was pretty much awful. If I got to be honest, Episode 10 was by far the absolute worst episode of the series. Natsuo just became an unlikable idiot at this point and felt more like an obsessive creep who's desperate to be with Hina.As for the ending, episode 11's scene with Natsuo and Hina getting together and having sex was by far one of the absolute worst moments in Domestic Girlfriend. I hated watching that scene and it left a very awful taste in my mouth. As for the finale episode, it was tolerable but it's still pretty bad.Now onto some basic ratings and what I liked, as well as what I hated.Positives:-The opening/ending songs were amazing and give off a lot of Tokyo Ghoul vibes and gets the viewers pumped up.-Rui, Momo, Alex, Fumiya, and Kobayashi were easily the best characters in the series and were very enjoyable.-The execution of the concept was very well done.-The anime's first 8 episodes started off really well and enjoyable.-Some of the life lessons and messages were very well presented.Negatives:-Episode 9 started the downfall of the story and became a complete disaster.-Natsuo was an absolute unlikable idiot in episodes 9-12.-Natsuo and Hina's sex scene was awful.-Some of the characters like Ashihara did nothing to progress the story and had almost no character development.-The ending to the anime left a very poor taste in my mouth and I consider it one of the worst endings to an anime I've seen.Overall, I'd give Domestic Girlfriend a 7/10. While I find the concept and plot very weird and difficult to get into, I still really liked the anime. The anime started out good but ended pretty badly, I'm not sure if there's going to be a second season of this anime but if it did, I personally hope that it would be redeemable and make up for the god-awful ending.

Natsuo, the main character, never fails to give you a 'bruh' moment every episode. Throughout the entire series, I always felt on edge about what was about to happen; and even disappointing developments in the plot somehow didn't change my opinion about the entire series.One can easily argue that Natsuo has a trash personality, and I, by no means disagree. But that's what makes this anime great, Natsuo often makes BAD decisions that often lead to INTERESTING situations. I must confess that I absolutely despise Hina's character. Her much younger...sibling, and BEST GIRL, Rui, did much better than Hina at handling the entire situation. Rui was the most kindhearted, genuine character among the three and was treated like crap. I do know how everything will turn out, and I was absolutely disappointed. However, I still do want to see this unfold in the anime since I did really enjoy watching the show.Yes, at times this show is a dumpster fire, but it is a very enjoyable dumpster fire. I mean who watches a show called 'Domestic Girlfriend' and doesn't expect it to be messed up somehow? Don't get me wrong, I really do like this anime; but I definitely agree that it isn't for everyone.If it wasn't obvious enough, #TeamRui. sibling, and BEST GIRL, Rui, did much better than Hina at handling the entire situation.

It could\'ve been so much better, but I can\'t let that fact affect my rating. Domestic Girlfriend has really nice art style, and that\'s about it.The characters are one dimensional in personality, but had so so much potential. It\'s annoying. The MC, I actually quite liked. Some of his actions were questionable, but overall as a character, I didn\'t have any complaints. I originally liked the dynamics between him and Rui. They were funny, had chemistry, I could see it. It\'s such a shame that this was how the story turned...out. As for Hina, well. She\'s pretty. That\'s all I can say. Oh, and nice. But nice isn\'t that hard to come across, and if you asked me why he liked her, I wouldn\'t know what to say. She really didn\'t have that much personality imo. Your classic teasing, pretty, ""older sister vibe"" character who gets along with everyone she meets instantly and has complicated emotions. (In my head, this equals bland). Rui should\'ve been the obvious choice.As for Rui and Hina as siblings, I like that they didn\'t hate each other. That sounds so basic, but I\'m so used to siblings who see each other as rivals or just outright hate each other. It\'s tiring. Whenever siblings of the same sex actually like each other, I\'m amazed and immediately refreshed.And I wish we saw more of Natsuo\'s supposed ""best friend"" (I can\'t for the life of me remember his name, my bad). The relationship between the two seemed like it had a solid foundation, and I appreciated his role in the anime, despite it being so small.But aside from that, this anime was just a 5/10. Mediocre at best. The ""couple"" had pretty much no chemistry and Natsuo only just about developed towards the end. This feels like a worse copy of Scum\'s Wish. Except Scum\'s Wish didn\'t have any family problems, delved deeper than surface-level problems and had unrequited love over and over (but I hold it in high regard despite the neverending unrequited love theme). For a MC that actually had a decent personality, he sure made some stupid choices.Don\'t recommend, but if you have time to kill, this wouldn\'t be the worst way of spending it. out.

While cheesy sounding this anime puts the emotion into proper and well thought out motion, building up the emotion and romance through the series and at a slow and cautious pace, setting the series up for a truly awing conclusion.However Domestic na Kanojo does not conclude well at all, on a personal stand...point I can say this was easily the worst conclusion I have ever seen, I describe it as to be completing a running race in 1st place but then realizing that you were running the race on a false start, and finish in a complete and utter disappointment. 11 episodes of beauty and well thought out structure only to end with you walking into your own demise and even, as you could feel, anger.The main thing I can praise about this show that keeps it from being one of the worst, and even a 1/10 rating, is that the show portrays the emotion and seriousness of the relationship formed in a proper and well rounded way, that convinces and makes the viewer feel like their relationship was meant to be, even if you favour another character, you still feel that the current relationship is what is best, and root for it.Spoiler ahead:The main and complete problem with this conclusion is that with Hina you actually never know what happens, like what does she do after she separates from him, one thing I can respect is that Hina broke up with Natsuo in order to protect him from failing in his dream to become a writer, in fear of rumours of their relationship bringing him to his knees, forcing Natsuo to throw everything away to persist in their relationship. But what was done so, so, SO incorrectly, was that Hina was never given an ending, or a proper ending, she leaves on a terrible unthinkable note as if she were the antagonist, ending with nothing more than broken heart and separation, to add to this, the other girl who was persisting on Natsuo, who also happens to be Natsuo's step sister - Rui - finds herself releasing her emotional build up at the very end and persisting on a relationship with Natsuo, as if Hina was just a blockage and a nuisance, which the story DOES NOT portray at all.

Although I like romantic comedy anime and manga, but this SHIT ', ""*Spoiler Alert*Okay first of all, one of the worst love triangles I've seen in my life.Let's start with Hina: a whore girl that has an affair with a MARRIED man, and calls it 'my first love'. but easily breaks up with him, and falls in love with a 17 year old student. Really? With some childish behaviors, she calls herself a 'grown-up'. Wow.Rui: a socially awkward girl that likes to have sex, and she gets it, for the first time. In the first episode, with a guy she just met. Cool. I guess she's not that socially awkward after all. Falls in love with Natsuo...and now, her sister gets in her wow. Lol.Natsuo: seems like a socially awkward person too, but what a kind heart he has. He flirts with every girl he meets with some romantic looks. Ugh. With his kind heart, he wants Hina, Rui too. What an amazing perverted guy. Let's marry two girls, that are sisters.Overall, the story was dreadful. I mean, having sex in the first episode, with someone you just met, you have a crush on your teacher, who happens to be the sister of your first sex partner. Lol. And your father wants to remarry. Congratulations. With who? The mother of those sisters. What a coincidence.I hate this anime, it's not even a love story. It's a story of two whore sisters wanting the same pervert guy.You can't change my mind about this anime. It's the worst I've ever seen. and now, her sister gets in her wow. Lol.Natsuo: seems like a socially awkward person too, but what a kind heart he has. He flirts with every girl he meets with some romantic looks. Ugh. With his kind heart, he wants Hina, Rui too.

Instead of actually reviewing the anime, these people just basically tell us what is right and wrong in their opinion.For example, they are crying how incest sex so disgusting!! blah blah blah and so on...1. First of all. They aren\'t family by blood and they were already in love before they became a ""family"".2. Y\'all should not judge the anime even if it is incest because that\'s the plot. You should rate it by how good the plot/characters/animation etc. In general how the whole story/anime was.3. You are saying it\'s bad because...already in the second episode, they have sex, so it\'s like hentai. In my opinion that sex he had with Riu was a really good part because it was so different from other animes and it wasn\'t the ""love sex"" type so I don\'t know how y\'all dare to compare it to some relationship development. It is just ""sex"" and for a pretty funny reason that made this anime even more interesting and unique.Now it\'s time for the rest of my review:STORY: 7*The story overall is alright. It tells us about the kind of ""forbidden love"" between a student and a teacher. It\'s an emotional rollercoaster and many different things happen. Natsuo struggles with his love from the beginning and through the whole series. He meets Riu and Momo who are to the end interested in him but his real love still wins over it for so long he is able to actually keep in contact with Hina. He meets many problems which make him overthink and he has to make difficult choices.However, the ending is kinda left hanging from a cliff but it ends with a happy ending at least for me (depends on how you look at it). If you read the manga then you know that the ending there is horrible and weird as fuck. I\'m not gonna spoil but it\'s basically a UNO reverse card and without any explanation.ART: 6*Nothing much to say. It was decent, but nothing special.Sound: 9*I had to give it a 9 for the masterpiece opening. Probably my favorite song and I love how it relates 100% to the anime story.Character: 6*The characters are pretty boring overall. They are NOT bad, but they ain\'t good either. They don\'t have any backstories and it is nothing special that makes them different from each other. My favorite was Riu because she is actually the only one different and the one who is the most interesting in the whole anime.HINA is probably the one I actually hate the most. She is the one talking about ""adult"" problems etc. meanwhile she is acting the most childish through the whole series (except her ending choice). In one episode she wants to be together with Natsuo, and in the second one, she wants to end the relationship. And so on.NATSUO is way too boring for the main character. A thing I didn\'t like the most was his mentality and the choices he took. The most hated scene for me was when he saw Hina masturbating and calling for Shū at the same time. (in the end, it is explained by Hina that she ""couldn\'t"" think about Natsuo meanwhile doing that) which is in my opinion a stupid reason. It is actually not a reason IMO. I think the story and character of Natsuo would improve much if he didn\'t just run after Natsuo the whole time despite her actions. If he, for example, made a distance and showed some emotions it would be much better. Because it is nonsense. If somebody loves one person with the whole heart but basically doesn\'t react while seeing that person masturbating and calling the name of her/his EX, it just makes no common sense.SPOILER: also in the end when Natsuo and Riu have sex and they talk about the masturbating situation, Natsuo tells Riu that she shall not worry because he understands that and that he even jacked off later too when he went back to his room. (LOL?)Enjoyment: 7*It was indeed interesting and fun to watch Domestic na Kanojo.

He has a crush on his teacher(Hina)which he believes to be love. Since he cannot be with her he had sex with a girl he meets for the first time. Turns out the girl he had sex with (Rui) and his teacher crush turns out to be his step sisters. But this does not stop him he keeps on fooling around with both the sisters. Other than the 2 sisters he is also fooling around with Rui's friend a side character...(momo) and seems like he will be fooling around with his literature club head (miu) as well in the future.(Hina) A pedophile teacher, first was going out with a married man who she claims to be deeply in love with and soon as she leaves him she starts going out with his step brother / student (Natsu). Making it seem like she is among those people who love to be in amidst of chaos and in absence of it loves to create one. Forbidden relationships is her forte. She knew that her sister (Rui) is in love with the guy, but sisterhood meant nothing to her rather she suggest moving out of the house so that they could meet easily behind Rui's back, on getting caught she suggest breaking up with him but does nothing. Placing her feelings before her sisters always.As it goes for Rui she is the only character that is genuinely nice.

The series itself doesn't entirely follow the manga (even by its ending itself) so bear with me.Be warned, if you do not have the emotional capacity to deal with anything sexual, or serious topic: why are you even here? Either wise, I urge you follow the manga after watching.It's not my place to praise the anime, but tell my honest opinion about it. I thought the anime was so 2010s. Around that time, I consumed similar content and was my gateway to pretty much the anime community. Although,...my initial thoughts were that this could be a good gateway anime: I can probably only show it to a few of my friends who are interested in this kind of content.The beginning was so off: it exceeded my expectations despite to what entails to this kind of medium. And the same impact was done for the ending.Honestly, I feel dejected and kind of sad how the anime ended. I doubt there will be a continuation of this anime any time soon: it's a huge slap in the face of going to the source itself. But, there's also a lot you can learn in this anime. It's very grounded in reality. At the same time, this is still fantasy which is what charmed me to watch in the first place.I think if this came out at the time it was being made an anime, I would certainly believe people would enjoy this content: probably rate higher. But, times have change and we have too. I feel like it had a chance to be great, personally.Besides the art and music being great (especially the music because it was hard to watch for some episodes), I would say the character was pretty well written, though personally I hate the MC in the anime, and I loved him more in the manga.Like I said, I don't want to spoil much, but I will write a review in the manga section of Domestic Girlfriend.Enjoyment. I can't say I love the ending. I've mention before that I'm not gonna spoil: I have to for this portion. The last episode in the anime made me angry and sad at the same time. I didn't like what the producers did for the last episode. Honestly, I would settle for a years later type of episode. The episode had it end with Rui going back to Natsuo which I find it so detesting.It had me think two things:a) It's so depressing of the fact that Natsuo saw Hina in Rui when she was checking herself out after she went out with her friend (I think for new clothes) which she proceeds to once again (presumably) wants to revitalize their relationship that,b) got me so pissed to the point of insanity: the pain was too real and I was literally playing Joji - Love Us Again while murdering my bed and pillow. It felt so wrong to do that at in this episode which is frustrating.I'm an avid anime watcher, but never in my life had I feel so detested on an episode since partaking the medium that is anime itself.I find it hard to enjoy when trying to read the manga instead of watching it; however, I'll give an exception due to the fact that I love the show, and I am currently enjoying the manga.You can find my full opinion after finishing the manga, but overall for the anime:A solid 8: Very Good. my initial thoughts were that this could be a good gateway anime: I can probably only show it to a few of my friends who are interested in this kind of content.The beginning was so off: it exceeded my expectations despite to what entails to this kind of medium.

I was worried about this show because of some of the things I'd heard. Yes it is pandering and fan servicey, but that doesn't mean that deep down it's a bad anime. I described it once as hentai with more steps and I think that still fits because most hentai I've seen have had at least passable plots. While the story isn't amazing, it is filled with deep emotional moments that tugged at my heart. This show had me laughing, crying, and erotically engaged all throughout so I can't say it was bad, but I am objective enough to realize it...is't great either. I enjoyed it and if you've bothered to look up a review about this show I bet you'll enjoy it too. is't great either. I enjoyed it and if you've bothered to look up a review about this show I bet you'll enjoy it too."", 'Domestic Girlfriend is yet another doozie where I feel like public opinion on this one is very split.  I get why... but I also get why some people rate this as above average.  I fall into the latter.Story: Domestic Girlfriend starts us out rather starkly in that we have Natsuo, who has a one night stand with another student, Rui, both of whom experience sex for the first time.  However, Natsuo knows, at the back of his mind, that he has a major crush on his teacher, Hina.  While none of this is terribly shocking in itself, the surprising bit is...when Natsuo\'s single father decides to remarry into another family.  The problem?  The person who he marries has two daughters who are... Rui and Hina.  This creates the moment where people have a problem with this series - Rui develops feelings for Natsuo, who has a major crush on Hina, who are all now siblings.Outside of this, the rest of the series plays out with a lot of touches of both romance and drama, though we see some harem elements inserted in there too.  They take their time trying to flesh out Hina, Rui and Natsuo a fair bit, however, I\'d say a lot of what they show on Hina revolves around one main idea and it really doesn\'t give us a good idea on who she is as a complete person.  I really have no problem with how they went about Natsuo and his effect on each of his step-sisters.  He honestly acts just fine consider a) they\'re step siblings and b) he has a love triangle going on with them.  There\'s a good mix of dramatic and touching moments coming at us in most episodes, with the episode in which Rui got pretty sick sticking out to me as one of my more favourite episodes.There\'s a lot of like about the story, but there are also some weak moments.  The small arcs that I didn\'t like were a few episodes that contained Shuu or Miu - the storytelling here wasn\'t great and I felt like they went overboard on some of the bits for Shuu in particular.  It doesn\'t help that I don\'t feel either were great characters either.  I also felt like some of the moments with Hina were really forced.  I don\'t feel like the writing in a few scenes involving her were overly convincing and it does feel like Hina and Natsuo lack chemistry.  They just needed to add more as to why Natsuo likes Hina.  It would have gone a long way.Domestic Girlfriend\'s story makes up a bit of a love-hate relationship because there were some incredible moments and some pretty lackluster ones, and this doesn\'t even include the overarching story, which is obviously the part people take issue with.  I feel like the author\'s attempt at pulling in an audience was making our three main characters step siblings, but if she didn\'t, this would have been more widely accepted with similar writing.  (7/10)Characters: The cast, overall, was up and down in the same way that the story was.Natsuo\'s character was fine considering the anime story itself.  Unlike some harem anime, he\'s not a complete blockhead and honestly does have a pretty normal personality outside of things that involve Rui and Hina.  Even his judgement around these two aren\'t awful and due to this, he\'s actually a pretty likable character.  He\'s compassionate about his friends and has a very clear goal in his studies, so even if the story had problems, I wouldn\'t say his character did.I\'m definitely on Team Rui, outside of that weird first episode.  She\'s very kindhearted, though introverted and awkward, which leads her to have a hard time interacting with people.  I was a pretty big fan of how she tried to keep close with Natsuo and many of those moments really shone.  Hina, in comparison, felt a lot weaker as a character.  While she does make more adult decisions for the benefit of others all the time, in part because she is the older sibling, I feel like the rest of her character just lacked depth.  This was when I felt she didn\'t mesh with Natsuo very well.  I can see what they attempted to do with both sisters - the younger cute option vs the mature serious option - but the latter could have used more to it.One of the side characters I wished got more screen time was Momo.  She\'s very blunt and has family and personal situations that could have been expanded on a lot more than they were, including a secret that she ended up sharing with Natsuo that caught me by surprise.  Whenever a series inserts random side characters with really some shocking details to their backstory, they\'re rarely expanded on, and I really wish they did that here.  It\'s such a missed opportunity.  The groundwork\'s all there for us, but she\'s really only shown in an episode or two.  Natsuo\'s friend Fumiya is your classic case of ""your best bro"" and due to that trope, is predictable and somewhat boring.The characters all around are fine, though it is nice that Natsuo and Rui are the best of the bunch, considering their screen time.  Some of the side characters were strong, but some others just kind of felt like filler.  (7/10)Art: I feel like the animation struggled at times.  While much of it seemed crisp, I feel like some of the simple moments were static and some of the quality dipped at other points as well.  No, this didn\'t happen often, but it was there enough that I noticed it.  Aside that, the art seemed fine.  They obviously don\'t show the suggestive content so it never really feels like you\'re watching super x-rated stuff.  One neat thing they added: The singer for the OP, Minami, had her avatar shown playing in the opening theme and I really like this touch.  Additionally, the episode-name preview after the ED always showed a random model wearing a bathing suit / lingerie, which I thought was different - though random.  (7/10)Sound: Patricia Duran (Hina) and Natalie Rial (Rui) headline the main cast, who do a solid job.  Rial had the odd moment that felt a touch awkward, but her resume\'s somewhat short in that I feel like she\'ll be okay long run.  I actually really enjoyed Hilary Haag (Momo) in her role as well.  Any time you insert Andrew Love (Fumiya) into a series, I\'ll be a fan.  He\'s really good at what he does.  Austin Tindle (Natsuo), in comparison, was someone I wasn\'t super sold on though.  It feels like he tries to be a bit like some of Jessie James Grelle\'s older works, and it just doesn\'t mesh.  The music was okay for the OST, without any real complaints.  However, the OP and EDs were fantastic.  I was blown away by Crying For Rain by Minami.  It\'s got so much emotion and power to the song and the chorus is insane.  It\'s a very raw sound at times and the full version really shows it.  Alisa Takigawa sang Wagamama and Always for the ending songs and while not at Minami\'s level, were really good listens.  (9/10)Overall Enjoyment: The rating for this series would be strongly predicated on what you feel about Natsuo\'s relationship with Hina and Rui.  If you aren\'t a fan of the concept, I feel like this won\'t reciprocate very well among audiences, regardless of how well played out some of the nicer moments were done.  There was nothing overly spectacular about this series, but it was still a nice watch.  I\'d watch more if it came to that, but I don\'t sense the demand is there.

(7/10)', 'StoryThe premise for this series is unique and quite messed up. I would categorize it as one of those shows that is go bad, it is good. The worst thing an anime can be is boring and this series doesnt fall into that category. Bombshells are dropped on a good consistent basis to keep you invested in the story. However, some plot threads are uninspired and feel like they are added to pad out some of the run time. The scenarios feel very unrealistic, so if you are looking for a tightly written story, there are better anime.

This anime isn\'t a classic romance anime or harem anime and definitely will not appeal to everyone. For starters it revolves around a fairly controversial subject matter of relationships with step-siblings, on top of this it does have harem elements. So if that automatically ticks of your ""bless the lord"" detector then you would be better off shying away from this anime. Although if you can take this anime for what it is, a fictitious story that covers some pretty interesting dynamics...and unique scenarios, you will find that it has an excellent pace, surprising character development, and an overall decent story that if you look for it could offer a couple of decent tidbits of life advice. Although this is of course coming from someone who enjoyed high school dxd and is not a very stern critic of anime\'s so long as I have an enjoyable time watching them. But yanno, if you can get past the taboo subject matter of this anime and want something rather enjoyable to watch I say give it a wholehearted try then come back and debate who best girl is ;) and unique scenarios, you will find that it has an excellent pace, surprising character development, and an overall decent story that if you look for it could offer a couple of decent tidbits of life advice.

This is as realistic as anime drama/romance can get to real life. This series wasn't made for disney princesses who want things to magically end up with the best possible outcome. Life does not work like that. Love can be very cruel, harsh, and unfair.

So it would be unfair to draw conclusions despite not knowing what lies ahead of the rest of the story.All in all, I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who's looking for a very realistic and mature anime drama/romance.

I gave this anime a 1 and I still don’t think it’s low enough.Plot 4/10Some girl, Rui, ask this Natsuo, the mc, for sex. This is because she wants knowledge so people won’t say “you wouldn’t understand”. Then, he fucks her. Surprisingly he’s in love with someone else, with is a teacher. Natsuo’s father gets remarried. The person that he remarries is the mother of the girl he fucked and that teacher....Art 6-7/10There’s nothing wrong with the art.Characters 2/10The only character I didn’t hate was Rui. Every character is really dumb. Rui is only a tad bit smarter. Finding a random dude and wanting to fuck them for knowledge. I did say that I didn’t hate her but I didn’t like her much either.Hina is dumb. She’s the teacher that the mc likes. You have a high schooler seduce you and you fall for it. Are you dumb? Well that question was established very quickly. Maybe it’s because I’ve never been seduced before.Natsuo is easily my least favorite main character I’ve ever seen. He lies when he’s ass at it, he doesn’t have common ground or common knowledge, and he’s a shitty version of a fuckboy. I personally don’t like fuckboys because they are annoying and have little understanding of many things. The amount of time I wanted to hurt this main character is impeccable.Momo is a hoe. She talks about have no experience even she’s dated the whole universe. She reminds me of a sex doll. I’ve yelled “GET OFF THE SCREEN” so many times.Each character was written in such a shitty way. I don’t even want to read the manga.Enjoyment 1/10no.Overall 1/10 (I wish I could put it lower) Art 6-7/10There’s nothing wrong with the art.Characters 2/10The only character I didn’t hate was Rui.

She was introduced with the best charcter intermission. IF The girl was going to be chosen don\'t make her irrelevant at the end.ENDING!!!SO ASSS!! The way it ended with them getting caught was so bad making a bad ending. Rui disgusing herself was so pointless!! like really ""casually shopping for a wig"".  Even tho rui still end up with him it was the wrong way. DRESSED UP AS SOMEONE ELSE.OVERALL:Was enjoying it untill like episode 9 alot of...twist and turns. I was really invested in it as well along with my discord laughing and enjoing our time. The ending the whole vc was saying FUCK THIS SHIT!! We honestly wanted the mc was to end up with someone we didn\'t care. twist and turns. I was really invested in it as well along with my discord laughing and enjoing our time.

I can\'t really wrap my head around...it)Never have I been so split on an anime. Literally, I\'m torn on whether this is a compelling anime with amazing characters (less so plot) or if it\'s just another trashy show. This show is so disconnected from this world, despite supposedly taking place in modern-day Japan, but yet the characters feel so real and down-to-Earth. Like with Domestic Girlfriend the show\'s plot heavily relies on making things spicy and increasing the heat every time you watch the show to keep you coming back. I seriously had to pause the show and take a breath because things were getting so spicy (I\'m not joking) This mainly had to do with how Kazuya and his rental girlfriend handle their families and friends.And in that regard, the show is absolutely perfect. No other show (even Domestic Girlfriend) had me so on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. This is due to some harem-magic where both their grandmas know each other and they start thinking they\'re dating (there\'s a ton of more stuff like this in the show but I won\'t spoil it for you) so they have to try to keep up the act so their friends and family don\'t find out what\'s happening whilst wanting to break up as soon as possible because they\'re not actually dating.This is the type of show where you click on the next episode so fast, not because you think ""oh wow this is such amazing writing"", but rather ""this is bad for me I know it. But let me just quickly see what\'s happens next."" And repeat.Unlike other shows, Rent-a-Girlfriend does not heavily rely on NSFW content, though it is there, but alternatively, it just kind of comes off as cutesy and sweet... and to be completely honest that\'s so much better than some forced fan service.Characters (clockwise from top right) - Mami Nanami, Ruka Sarashina, Sumi Sakurasawa, Chizuru Ichinose, Yoshiaki Kibe, Shun Kuribayashi, Kazuya Kinoshita.The cast of characters was the standout of the show, with each person having their own character traits and bad sides to them; they weren\'t perfect characters and that\'s what made them so likable to me. Throughout the entire season, Kazuya constantly makes things worse for himself and the people around him, and the thing is, unlike other shows, he doesn\'t learn. He literally makes the same mistakes over and over again, and you\'re left wondering two things - ""Damn, he is a horrible person."" and ""Will he ever learn?"". The latter of those thoughts is also what kept the show so engaging to me. You want to see Kazuya grow and become a better person, you want to see the problems each character faces be resolved. But through it all, very little changes in the show\'s runtime. Like seriously watch it and you\'ll see what I mean. Now, I can see this becoming a problem for future seasons, but as for now, I\'m rooting for him to become a better person, despite it feeling like whenever he tries to take a step forward he just ends up taking one back instead.Beyond the two main characters (Kazuya and Chizuru), the show\'s cast is pretty good, with my favorite character being Ruka, as she has a good backstory a surprisingly complete arc in the shows small runtime. The only character I felt was a little left out was Sumi Sakurasawa, as the episode she was in felt like filler (the only in the show) and she did very little to advance the plot.And no, dear reader. I will not talk about waifus. I will not talk about waifus. I will not talk about- Chizuru and Ruka are waifus. Be quiet not for me but just in general. Let me just say that some waifus don\'t work in real life; their main qualities and points of character are ones that would just not work in real life, no matter how amazing they are (Zero Two cough cough) but with the girls in Rent-a-Girlfriend, they seem so...real. Ok that sounded weird just give me a second. The characters themselves are so good, but despite that, they\'re still people I\'d believe could exist in real life, but the only thing is Ruka had the words ""second best"" placed on her since the first time she appeared. Though this face is just... something a certain friend of mine would post a lot for absolutely no reason.All of this has lead up to one point - the harem genre itself. Recently, the genre has been rather bloated with the same stories, the same tropes, and the same characters popping up in each of these shows. All of what I\'ve mentioned above makes it stand out so much from the blandness of the genre and I think that\'s what makes it all the greater. It\'s super unique in its premise and the show\'s characters, while nothing super new, are unique and relatable enough to really enjoy this show.Now, I\'m going to draw a comparison to Bunny Girl Senpai here and say that this show is definitely not that, even though I thought it was going to be. This definitely integrates the ""Rent-a-Girlfriend"" title into the show (not just the first three episodes) and while it isn\'t a complete bait-and-switch, and doesn\'t offer nearly as good of a story or characters as Bunny Girl Senpai, it definitely isn\'t just complete fanservice and no plot as some people may think it is.The animation is gorgeous, there was no noticeable CGI at all in the show, and all the character designs are stunning with the backgrounds and locations being surprisingly well-detailed, and each shot is super consistent in terms of quality to the last. This has to be some of the best animation I\'ve seen in a harem anime (Sorry Bunny Girl Senpai, you lose this one).The score is where this show, in my opinion, suffers the most. A good portion of the show has absolutely no music and just ambient sound, which, for a show of this nature is fine, but when the score does kick in it sounds bland, boring, and repetitive. It\'s a small issue but it definitely lacks in this department... though the intro song is made by The Peggies, the same band that make Bunny Girl Senpai\'s intro, and it is probably the one redeeming piece of music in this show (Kimi no Sei is still better though) Also just thought I\'d throw in - there\'s a hilariously forced advertisement for the Peggies in the show and I just cracked up when I heard it.As for other flaws in the show, if you take this from a different perspective, there are many many things that are wrong with this show. But if you take it as it is - a harem show with a wild plot and even wilder events, with some really nice, cute, down-to-Earth characters, you get a really well-rounded show. I will say this show is definitely not for everyone. If you enjoy a good Shonen anime, this is not for you, despite it saying on Wikipedia that this show is a shonen anime... seriously what the heck), and if you hate crazy shows, this is again, not for you (though I will say it\'s not as crazy as something like, Konosuba so don\'t worry too much). But if you take this at face value, this is a truly amazing show with the strangest setup but the way it executes it, and with the characters at hand, this show excels at everything a good harem anime should be.8/10 - This show had me pausing at moments to just catch my breath and take a moment. I can\'t recommend this enough if you enjoy a good romance show like this. Can\'t wait for season 2! it)Never have I been so split on an anime.

The characters themselves are so good, but despite that, they\'re still people I\'d believe could exist in real life, but the only thing is Ruka had the words ""second best"" placed on her since the first time she appeared. Though this face is just... something a certain friend of mine would post a lot for absolutely no reason.All of this has lead up to one point - the harem genre itself. Recently, the genre has been rather bloated with the same stories, the same tropes, and the same characters popping up in each of these shows. All of what I\'ve mentioned above makes it stand out so much from the blandness of the genre and I think that\'s what makes it all the greater. It\'s super unique in its premise and the show\'s characters, while nothing super new, are unique and relatable enough to really enjoy this show.Now, I\'m going to draw a comparison to Bunny Girl Senpai here and say that this show is definitely not that, even though I thought it was going to be. This definitely integrates the ""Rent-a-Girlfriend"" title into the show (not just the first three episodes) and while it isn\'t a complete bait-and-switch, and doesn\'t offer nearly as good of a story or characters as Bunny Girl Senpai, it definitely isn\'t just complete fanservice and no plot as some people may think it is.The animation is gorgeous, there was no noticeable CGI at all in the show, and all the character designs are stunning with the backgrounds and locations being surprisingly well-detailed, and each shot is super consistent in terms of quality to the last. This has to be some of the best animation I\'ve seen in a harem anime (Sorry Bunny Girl Senpai, you lose this one).The score is where this show, in my opinion, suffers the most. A good portion of the show has absolutely no music and just ambient sound, which, for a show of this nature is fine, but when the score does kick in it sounds bland, boring, and repetitive. It\'s a small issue but it definitely lacks in this department... though the intro song is made by The Peggies, the same band that make Bunny Girl Senpai\'s intro, and it is probably the one redeeming piece of music in this show (Kimi no Sei is still better though) Also just thought I\'d throw in - there\'s a hilariously forced advertisement for the Peggies in the show and I just cracked up when I heard it.As for other flaws in the show, if you take this from a different perspective, there are many many things that are wrong with this show. But if you take it as it is - a harem show with a wild plot and even wilder events, with some really nice, cute, down-to-Earth characters, you get a really well-rounded show. I will say this show is definitely not for everyone. If you enjoy a good Shonen anime, this is not for you, despite it saying on Wikipedia that this show is a shonen anime... seriously what the heck), and if you hate crazy shows, this is again, not for you (though I will say it\'s not as crazy as something like, Konosuba so don\'t worry too much). But if you take this at face value, this is a truly amazing show with the strangest setup but the way it executes it, and with the characters at hand, this show excels at everything a good harem anime should be.8/10 - This show had me pausing at moments to just catch my breath and take a moment. I can\'t recommend this enough if you enjoy a good romance show like this. Can\'t wait for season 2!', ""[MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS]In this review, we will be focusing only on this anime - how it was portrayed, how are its soundtracks. Generally, how it was animated into an anime. As we can see, the adaption came from the manga.HOW IT WAS ANIMATED?- If you would read the manga and watch the anime, you would see a very poor adaption. The anime skipped a lot of important scenes which made holes in the anime. If the manga gets adapted again for season 2, maybe this will be difficult for the viewers to understand the whole story. Another thing is, it ended in a cliffhanger.I...personally recommend reading the manga instead. Not a fan of reading the manga? You can watch the anime and read the manga after, maybe you would get motivated after watching the Anime.To be honest, the story is not that bad. We may see this kind of situation seldom however, we cannot deny that fact that it happens in some family. It's just that, the anime had an improper ending that's why it's not that good. But if you would read the manga, it's actually a very good story personally recommend reading the manga instead. Not a fan of reading the manga?

The ending somehow left you hooked up and proceed to manga. The conflict part is excellent and logical, providing you with some real life love problems. You can try to reflect on those problems and solve as if you were in each of their positions. But, as far as it goes till the ending of the manga. the plot somehow kind of ruined everything. i will only describe it as: ""One rotten apple will spoil the whole barrel."" AS OVERALL STORY JUDGING,...I will rate it as 7.So next for the art and sound, For the art, i will be referring to the scenes drawn and the details. I would say the art is good, it has achieved a standard for a typical shounen and shoujo romance anime should have. The voice actors in the anime really suit each of the characters in the anime. what I meant ""suit"" is it really brings up of how the character should act and their personality.Now to the characters, I feel that this anime depicts the character really well although the downside of the ending of the manga ruined it. I am judging this anime by the overall so yeah it does really has good characters shown: their personality, thoughts, actions. I would rate it as 8.As for enjoyment, i would like to leave yourself to really appreciate it. As for me, a good series with a frustrated ending giving me a PSD for days.So yeah, That\'s all for my review. Thanks for reading it. I appreciated your time and attention. Hope you have a good day.

Hope you have a good day.', ""The “story” itself isn't the big problem with the anime, because, as with many bad-school-drama animes we have on the market, it's almost always the same thing.However, we have development and drama over situations where just sitting down and talking, like normal human beings would, would solve about 90% of the problems.But Domestic at Kanojo works even worse than the market clichés, because when a dramatic conflict (which usually stems from the idiocy of the characters) gets too silly or boring, the story simply shifts to a “new arc”, where more conflicts will happen. imbeciles or boring.An adaptation that is a compilation of exaggerated drama,...characters weak to the point of being forgettable, and forced incest. In short, that's what Domestic Girlfriend, the anime based on Kei Sasuga's original work, is.Once upon a time, in a distant land, there was a passionate imbecile named Natsuo Fujii, the typical boy devoid of any relevant characteristics that could make him a good protagonist.He's even a good human being, he's kind and all, he knows how to breathe, walk, etc., but that we're already used to seeing in works of this kind.You know that male main character with dark hair, with dead fish eyes that don't show many emotions and is always able to help everyone around him simply “just because”?Adding these super-original aspects with a thirst for sex as alarming as that of the protagonist of School Days, we get Natsuo, the knight who rides the four-headed monster!I think mangakas/writers like to opt for this type of protagonist who doesn't have much personality so that the people who watch/read the work can identify themselves more easily. Or maybe put yourself in the boy's shoes, I don't know.But on the good side: who in their right mind would want to be in the place of this paltry protagonist?Their romance motivation is very weak (both from Natsuo with Hina, and from Rui with Natsuo). This “he's nice to me” thing doesn't stick anymore, my dear Japanese authors. It doesn't stick anymore.Some of the characters that surround the main core of idiots are quite interesting, like the bar owner, who is a very badass homosexual and ex-Yakuza.The Japanese literature teacher is also cool, because he is also a very cool guy and always gives some very realistic and human tips to the windbag protagonist.I admit that at least in this the Diomedea studio was right. The features are very beautiful. The character design was good and the animation level was above average. For an anime like this, it's pretty cool and well done.The soundtrack itself is weak. The effects and melody playing in the background, I mean. It's usually just a meowing piano. So there's nothing to highlight here, other than, of course, the sensational opening song: “Kawaki wo Ameku” by Minami.Obviously, I lacked commenting on many other points that left me disappointed in the work. Like Hina sensei masturbating with the door open, or Natsuo “catching” Rui at home, with the door also open (oh but these people are DUMB).Seriously, it's okay for you guys to want to cuddle up at home with your stepsister (lie, don't do that).But for the love of God right! At least close the fucking door. NO ONE WOULD DO IT WITH THE DOOR OPEN. THIS IS JUST ONE MORE PROOF THAT IT'S FORCED TO FUCK- enough, if you want to know more about it, watch the anime.Go there. Sharpen your sword well, the monster is angry!The big moral in Domestic na Kanojo is: there is no moral. Anime doesn't teach you anything, it doesn't give you anything, it doesn't touch you at all.Furthermore, it became impossible to sympathize with characters so lacking in charisma and stupidity. Outside a story where it is clear that the real intention is to ensure many “spicy” scenes without a well-crafted context.It's funny that the gossip scenes had a really good animation, that's why it really makes it look like it's a hentai hahaha characters weak to the point of being forgettable, and forced incest.

Guy has sex, Guy also has a crush on his teacher, Father gets married, Girl he had sex with and his teacher are now his sisters. The worst part is, this explanation is most of the show. But does that make it bad, I don't personally think so. I think the first thing I should gush about is the op, that shit SLAPS. I swear my ears fell off to how much of a banger that song was. To be honest I feel like there are only 3 important characters to touch on, Natsuo, Hina, and Rui. Natsuo first...of all, I despise his design. I swear there was no thought put into that atleast. He's a writer and literally CANNOT say no to a woman. Which is sadly a perk for him because ladies are all over him. Onto Rui now, She's got a very nice design, she was the girl that Natsuo went ham on, she keeps a lot of things professional and secret. I honestly don't have a lot to say about this character. She's.. okay is all I'm gonna say. Now my personal favorite character is Hina, and oh boy she is a mess. Hina is Natsuo's english teacher, Her boyfriend is also having an affair with his wife and Hina which is uh... not good guys don't have affairs. So then after that he decides to cut ties with Hina and practically gives her to Natsuo, so then those two fall in love yadda yadda. Then on a school trip, Hina and Natsuo are caught doin da nasty in a hotel room (FUCK). So Hina has to move because she doesn't want to ruin Natsuo's school life, but she gives him keys to her house and shit so it's aight. Which is basically the ending. Now one thing happens to Hina in the manga so MEGA spoilers right now, so if you're still reading skip this part. Hina FUCKING dies, kind of. She just goes into a coma. But it's okay because she wakes up soon. Hina and Natsuo get married after-ward (so woohoo). The scenery in this show is something I can definitely commend although the art style is uncomfortably realistic, but I can deal with it.That's basically it, I'm not gonna say this is a must watch.. BUT! You will most likely enjoy it if you do decide to watch it. of all, I despise his design. I swear there was no thought put into that atleast.

He loses his virginity to Hina's sister Rui not knowing that Hina and Rui are related. Later his dad announces that we will be getting remarried and to Natsuo's surprise his dad is marrying the mother of Hina and Rui. Throughout the show Rui develops feelings for Natsuo which is a shock because she is usually to herself but while that is happening Hina develops feelings Natsuo as well while Natsuo's feelings towards Hina grow. The story is easy to follow and predictable in some parts but the...ending is questionable. Its understandable why Hina transferred schools and ghosted her family for Natsuo's sake even though she loved him but in the end where Rui gets in top of him and kisses him makes me wonder how that relationship will workout because technically Rui and Natsuo are technically step siblings. This wondering is probably answered in the manga. This is why (in my opinion) I gave the story a 7/10.(Characters)Honestly there really weren't anything interesting to the characters because it seems like everything was laid out. A teacher that falls in love with her student/step brother, a boy that falls in love with his teacher/step sister and a girl that falls in love with her step brother. My favorite female character Rui. I honestly just love her attitude. She's a good cook, somewhat mysterious and that pouting face... immaculate. My favorite male character would have to be Natsuo. Natsuo stood out to me because he wants to be a novelist. i want to write my own stories too but some of the things I write lack the wow factor and Natsuo was in the same position until he poured his heart into his writing from a breakup. There weren't a lot of interesting characters so Rui and Natsuo were the only ones that stood out  to me. This is why (in my opinion) I gave the characters a 7/10.(Enjoyment)I watched the first episode about 3 times because I just didn't like the shows beginning but the 4th time I came around to this show and actually sat through the beginning it wasn't bad at all. I'm a sucker for romance anime and this show was a lot for realistic than any other romance anime I have watched so far. I think that is why I enjoyed it so much because it was actually realistic. I also really enjoyed this show because of Natsuo because we had two things in common. One being that once we find a girl we like we will simp for them and love them LMAO. And two being that Natsuo and I both share a passion for writing. I do wish that I could have read the novel that Natsuo wrote I think I would have enjoyed it alot.

I think is a fair one, i had problems with the pacing I thought it was pretty slow, but overall it's a fun show to watch, people might dislike it because of the hole plot, but I think it's an unusual thing.Natsuo growth as a person is the best part of the anime, next to the end we see him overpass hard situations and turn them into his own luck! There were fun side characters and fun moments, but I can't talk much of the anime without spoling it. So, It's not a top anime, but I...don't think it's pure trash.

I watched this as the last one of the 3 popular “girlfriend” anime I was watching, and I knew I was in for something when instead of starting off with the line “I have a girlfriend” (as RAG and Kanojo mo Kanojo both do in the opening monologue), it starts off with the guy losing his virginity in a, at the time, a one night stand. A good way to describe how the events happen in this anime is that it uses the same “shock value” ideas of fire...punch by shoving as much shit as possible into it, but makes it all romance and sex-related. Every single episode every 5 minutes something happened that made me want to punch the screen in secondhand embarrassment or other awful things. Other than the stepsibling pain moments, I had varying opinions about the characters. I’m pretty sure that the characters were good in the manga and it was lost in the adaptation or step-siblings nonsense because although some of them felt underdeveloped or were not developed that well I could see what they were trying to do with most of them. I even liked one, Rui Tachibana. The animation was also just pretty meh, and the art style was interesting but not necessarily good or bad. If I wasn’t in pain from step-siblings' nonsense the entire time and barely able to watch it, maybe I could see what they were trying to do; however, there was stepsibling nonsense, the entire time, causing much discomfort.Oh, I almost forgot the op is the best part of the whole show.

I saw the anime and regretfully read the manga in its entirety and now I'm having an existential crisis examining my life choices that lead me to the thought that it would be a good idea to watch/read this series.  Spoilers & bad language follows.First the series seem geared to guys, because of the taboo love scenes.  The main protagonist is a sensitive artist who cares about everyone and just so happens to attract various women who throw themselves at him.  He of course is a gentleman to them and never takes advantage...of them, except if there his OWN SISTERS.  LOL my god....I cant believe they really thought that was a good idea.  OK so there step siblings but still.  So the main character I have problem with besides Natsuo is Hina.  She is a high ranking chomo in every sense of the word.  I know that boys have this older teacher fantasy, and many have the attitude of age is just a number.  But to be so infatuated with a boy you probably only got pubes a few years before you meet him is disturbing.  Even after the relationship was over and he was busy humping his other sister, she was still so infatuated by him that he could not let go.  It is disturbing.  The nail on the coffin for this series is the build-up to the dumpster fire ending.  The whole series really revolved around the relationship what would build around Natsuo and Rui, even having a kid together.  But because they feel bad for Hina, they say fuck our feeling and just stopped loving each other.  Make it make sense.  At the end chomo get the student she groomed.  Rui becomes a single mom and their kid has some fuck up dynamics to deal with.  I kinda feel bad for hina really, she could of had a wonderful character development where she understood that her feelings/relationship with this younger guy was wrong but maybe due to the stress of being in a affair with a married man, and she could mature to a level of understanding where although she did not regret her pass she could learn from it and move on in a mature manner fitting a woman.  Instead she is stuck as the childish chomo who can barely cook.  Its a good thing that Rui had a kid for Natsuo because the way Hina drinks her eggs are probably pickled.  I saw the alternative ending but it seems just as haphazardly put together as the original ending, that even switching around the characters meant nothing at that point.I wish I would of read reviews before I went into it, if only I could take my time back.  The only redeeming thing about it at this point is reading the hilarious review other have written about the series.

And the ending is like nothing changed, Rui still loves him even though she said she\'ll dislike him.

The romance element of the story is hampered by the overall wooden and unnatural dialogue which makes character connections seem weak and dramatic moments possibly fall flat. However, no other storyline in anime leads to this many screwed up, cringy but hilarious and melodramatic, entertaining moments. Domestic Girlfriend is not a serious anime, its not a sophisticated...drama but it is in fact a soap opera comedy and its a good soap at that.Characters - nothing special, except Rui who is genuinely fun to be around and is also the only main character who isn't a completely awful human. As for the other two mains, they are frustrating and overall not investible but they still have fun interactions with other characters. The side characters are where Domestic Girlfriend has its greatest success and biggest failure, the café workers are superb, they speak sense often (which isn't common in this show), they are funny and used just sparingly enough. Some of the other side characters are awful though, we spend episodes with characters such as Momo (she actually started off quite well) who do nothing really for the story and are by their second episode just pointless. Overall, the characters keep the show fun but aren't very special and some are embarrassingly dull.Art and OST are all fine with nothing special, expect for the OP which is great.It is very possible to enjoy Domestic Girlfriend, I did a lot to be honest. But you need to realise that this isn't Berserk or Death Note and its not trying to be, its trying to be a spicy romance and therefore it should be judged as a spicy romance, which it succeeds at despite its many pitfalls.

That is probably the only way for me to express gratitude for making me laugh that much, although I am aware it\'s genuinely supposed to be a serious ""drama"" which is hilariously ridiculous just based on that premise alone.I can see the appeal that the author probably thought this might have as a mature story (the tragedy of forbidden love due to social standings), and I don\'t even consider it that morally corrupt (depending on their ages which was not...very clear to me), but the moment they decided to combine:- the teacher-student love dynamic- the OTHER incestual sibling love. I didn\'t really care much for the incest side of things since they are 17+ already and not blood related (yes I am serious), but shit\'s still a bit weird.- other depraved themes such as, from the top of my head, the loose girl cutting her wrists, and homosexuality- the harem aspectit should\'ve been obvious this was waay too ridiculous to make into a thoughtful story (which it seems to take itself seriously as) and not a comedy.I\'ve just checked and it seems they are 17 and... 23? Which does indeed make it pretty damn weird. Guess it was stupidly hopeful of me to pretend they were like 18 and 21 or something and try to enjoy it as a bonkers narrative at least but turns out it\'s even too gross for that.Anyway... analysis.Putting their ages aside and judging it solely as the deep story of forbidden love due to their social standings as student and teacher... it\'s not too bad in itself, but any intrigue or meaning there may be to that is pretty much fully cancelled out, in this case, by the way it\'s executed, in my opinion. Please stop calling her sensei 5 episodes into your romance, it\'s just so damn weird I couldn\'t digest it. Generally Natsuo\'s dialogue is decent and, compared to most rom-com protagonists, he can actually speak to girls (not to the extent that he realistically pulls the kind of bad bitches he pulls, but still). But when it comes to his relationship with Hina, he just seems like a pushy robot, I get that his love boner is making him act up, but practically everything after the first confession boils down to - ""we can\'t do this"", ""but I love you, let\'s do this"". Every time they meet. And he seems so eager to get in bed every time that, looking on as an adult myself... can\'t help but think that Hina should\'ve thought better at that time.23 and 17 is one hell of an age gap on paper, but realistically might not be all that much in terms of maturity depending on who it is. I don\'t think that side of things in itself is that ridiculous, rather, her status and profession as a high school teacher gives her that respect and intellect in our eyes where we think it\'s a bit inconceivable for her to act the way that she does. It\'s just male fantasy in my opinion and by no means a realistic or compelling story (not that teachers haven\'t done these things - usually they\'d get called terrible things though they\'re not always as young as Hina). Just... her personality, to be acting like that, is probably not the most realistic for a seemingly reasonable, mentally sane high school teacher overall.They struggle for the whole season in that regard and that is basically the main storyline (until they get caught, which, by the way, was kind of weird? How were their identities so clear based off that picture?). I get it. I think (spoiler) in the manga they get together eventually, but the fact they didn\'t here is probably for the better.Toss in the other shithead for the whole love polygon theme, some other weird characters to fill the 12 eps, and you\'ve got yourself a show.Some things (aside from the tropes mentioned at the beginning) don\'t make a lot of sense and/or are cliches, such as:Rui\'s evolution as a person, how she transforms from totally friendless to a half-capable social being like 2 episodes in just because Natsuo lectures her on how to interact with people. If it was that easy for her to change/learn, she would have already, considering she had lived on this planet for 17 years. If she has half a brain, too, everything that Natsuo was saying is practically common sense. I find it hard to believe that there would be as many socially incapable idiots in that country as anime shows us.Rui\'s evolution romantically, how she is the overdone archetype that I won\'t bother naming because it\'s cringe in itself. Short, cold, goes from acting moody/rational/ignorant towards the MC to liking him, blushing, etc etc. The classic.All the girls\' looks, Hina and especially Rui in particular. I know that they are anime girls, but I felt this thing was particularly off compared to most ecchi in terms of how unrealistically slim they are whilst still having massive natural badonkadonkers (also the shape).Natsuo being as nice as he is sometimes, chasing Rui to apologize etc etc. There is almost nothing that unexpected in this anime, even when I thought the potential for that was there, it seems that aside from the premise and some of the characters it didn\'t have the balls nor the writing to have its characters act or its plot advance in any non-standard way (in those specific situations).Natsuo lying to Rui about going to Fatty all the time without telling Fatty or planning for any sort of consequences. It was very stupid. Did he think Rui would never ever meet Fatty again especially at his workplace, a place she had come to several times before, and the VERY RELEVANT subject of discussion of him going to Fatty\'s house all the time would never pop up? Like I said, at least instruct Fatty in that regard, if only he played along well, it would\'ve been much harder to get found out. This way it was just... waiting in plain sight to be found out. Weak writing, basically. Oh and the fact he used the exact same lie, again, and without instructing Fatty, again, was profoundly disturbing to my intellect.The public displays of affection between Natsuo and Hina. I can understand them not expecting to get caught the way they were and it was questionable in the first place, as mentioned. You can even talk freely at school for all I care. Just don\'t kiss and hold hands in the halls maybe. In that sense, I guess Natsuo\'s novel is also worth mentioning.Natsuo\'s literary adventure, pouring out his emotion via writing was cute and I don\'t have big issues about that part of the storyline, but the teacher turning out to be his favorite writer, and him winning the biggest amateur award or whatever that was, were probably pretty cliche choices in terms of writing.That\'s all off the top of my head right now. Probably there\'s a lot more stuff like that and not much original and meaningful quality. Ironically, the self-harming girl might actually be the best character for the real themes she embodies, whereas everyone else is- overdone archetype whose main purpose in life seems to be her relationship with the MC (Rui). In that sense she feels merely like a tool to fulfill the love polygon theme;- equally unrealistic cheerful waifu (Hina). Felt like a robot, more than anything. I know love is a strong thing, but the really mellow way in which she acts made me feel as though she felt nothing else apart from (pretty shallow-feeling) love for Natsuo. Another of the author\'s tools, basically;- nice guy / sort of bland protagonist. Though I\'ll give Natsuo some credit for actually having a well-defined dream that he chases all whilst he has the love thing going on as well, which is something not a lot of protagonists in such shows have, actually, or at least those shows don\'t focus on anything else apart from the romance.- weird loud annoying (unrealistic imo but who knows) ""American"" guy. He is defined by his unique/weird character and liking Rui\'s looks, both of which are not special or compelling traits in any way.- bland parents, nothing there.So considering all the cliches, some of the nonsensical choices the characters make, some of the really predictable and/or overdone developments, the lack of anything much different to that, and the general shallow feeling of some of the most important human aspects of the narrative (such as characters\' feelings of love or sadness) that flicker sort of easily, it never really worked for me as a story or as anything particularly meaningful or realistic. So I had to take it lightly from the start, which worked wonders, because the premise alone and some things that happen are hilarious if you\'re not too grossed out by their age difference. I will genuinely remember it fondly because I laughed so much, and, frankly, it\'s quite a brave narrative regardless of there being little substance to it if you were to think about it more deeply. If it were to be more self-aware instead of taking itself as seriously as it does, I would\'ve gladly been even more lenient with the ratings. very clear to me), but the moment they decided to combine:- the teacher-student love dynamic- the OTHER incestual sibling love.

I know love is a strong thing, but the really mellow way in which she acts made me feel as though she felt nothing else apart from (pretty shallow-feeling) love for Natsuo. Another of the author\'s tools, basically;- nice guy / sort of bland protagonist. Though I\'ll give Natsuo some credit for actually having a well-defined dream that he chases all whilst he has the love thing going on as well, which is something not a lot of protagonists in such shows have, actually, or at least those shows don\'t focus on anything else apart from the romance.- weird loud annoying (unrealistic imo but who knows) ""American"" guy. He is defined by his unique/weird character and liking Rui\'s looks, both of which are not special or compelling traits in any way.- bland parents, nothing there.So considering all the cliches, some of the nonsensical choices the characters make, some of the really predictable and/or overdone developments, the lack of anything much different to that, and the general shallow feeling of some of the most important human aspects of the narrative (such as characters\' feelings of love or sadness) that flicker sort of easily, it never really worked for me as a story or as anything particularly meaningful or realistic. So I had to take it lightly from the start, which worked wonders, because the premise alone and some things that happen are hilarious if you\'re not too grossed out by their age difference. I will genuinely remember it fondly because I laughed so much, and, frankly, it\'s quite a brave narrative regardless of there being little substance to it if you were to think about it more deeply. If it were to be more self-aware instead of taking itself as seriously as it does, I would\'ve gladly been even more lenient with the ratings.', 'Of all the bad romance anime I have watched, this one was probably the most disappointing. I felt so utterly unsatisfied by the ending that I wanted to ""rage rate"" this anime a 4. I want to sit back, reflect, ask myself, was it really this bad? I might give it a shot in this review.I liked the characters. The main lad was the exact way all of the MC\'s in this genre are. Clueless, dumb, generic, horny and insensitive,At every point of the way he proves how naïve he is and worse that that, willing to take advantage of a situation. There are moments...in this anime where he is quite sexist and predatory. It\'s very frustrating to watch, but also quite relatable and it proves the point that he is... a literal kid. It\'s also frustrating to see how he hurts Rui in the proces of being a clueless little lamb.At this point you should already ask yourself why I continued watching.Well, I did like Rui and I did like Hina.I like the way the story was realistic in the sense that Hina knew from the start how impossible their love was. I like that she couldn\'t stop herself and I like how the consequences for her relationship with Natsuo were serious and dramatic. I liked her character and to me personally, she seemed to resemble that feeling of watching your youth at it\'s last stages. Desperate to grasp onto the last bits. She tries to dodge the responsibilities she has as an adult, but in the end they catch up to her and she (imo) deals with them gracefully.I loved Rui. She may not have been very clever and likable at every point of the story, (which would be a flaw in itself) but she was very loyal to her gut feelings, making her a very reliable character. I really liked watching how she took care of Natsuo when needed and the moments where she made herself vulnerable to Natsuo felt very genuine and emotional. It sucked to see her getting lied to and it sucked how Hina pursued Natsuo whilst knowing Rui\'s feelings. Rui is strong, knows what she wants and has a lot of growth through the series. This really made me wish that Natsuo would wake up and come to love her.The side characters were nice. They didn\'t get a lot of depth but their presence genuinely made the series better. Specifically mister yakuza bartender and writer teacher dude.Really it\'s a difficult question if it was ""that bad"", but I can\'t believe I watched all of it.Mixed feelings are indeed the proper description of my feelings. They could have made a better story with this concept. 5/10 in this anime where he is quite sexist and predatory.

The mc's dad and the sisters' mom end up marrying after both went through a divorce I think (I don't remember exactly and...I couldn't be bothered to go back and fact check). Now given that the younger sister and the mc (which are both the same age) did it before they knew about the parents relationship, which I totally get, but the fact that she eventually continues the pursue him after their parents elope and they move into together is where this begins to seem like if a reality show and one of those videos from your favorite adult site had a baby. And it doesn't help that the teacher he had a crush on (eventually turning into a deep love for her) ends up being the older step sister, and then they eventually bone. And while all this is happening the younger step sister is still putting the moves on her now step brother! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for a good love story, but this one weirded me out and I found myself cringing a whole lot more then I normally do watching romance animes.After reading this, if you're still considering watching, just go watch step sibling porn at this point you dirty horndog.I don't normally write reviews, so you know it's if even I'm writing one.

I think some will like it all the up until episodes 11,12 where it just gets depressing fro no reason they reply could have done a much better job I men the story was already written pretty good but of course they have to go off script and ruin it. It is one of the most unique romances haven seen one like it. The animation was pretty good. The characters were a mess that...had flaws and worked through them had flaws and worked through them', 'As always, this review may contain a few spoilers.Well, let\'s keep it simple. Not sure why the MAL score for this anime is quite low (6.66 as of now), but it\'s actually a very good anime. There are a lot important messages that can be taken (although it depends on how the way you think). For example, you better not try to date your own teacher, etc. This anime is clearly at the border of ""H"" anime. Therefore, you better watch this with the family (more fun ofc).Animations: Kinda disappointing (a bit bad)I first thought that this was made before 2018 because how...it looks. The average 2019 anime qualities are still better than this. For example, let\'s say Kaguya-sama. Both are released in Winter 2019. But Kaguya-sama has better animation quality than this. So basically, the animations are pretty much worse than average 2019 anime.Soundtracks (OP, ED, and also BG music): Probably average?The OP is definitely pretty good (from the music side), I mean like it\'s made by Minami. But one thing, it\'s just not memorable or that iconic. Same goes for the EDs, even though not made by Minami too, but those are still pretty good. As for the background music, I find it quite terrible. Why? There are a few moments when it\'s supposed to be sad, but the background music is that of ""idk, party probably""? We all know that BG music plays a very important role when it comes to dramatic moments and such (it adds the atmosphere). Sadly, this is where they failed.Plot/storyline: GreatAs I said in the beginning, I don\'t get why people rate this so low though? The plot is pretty clear and the storyline is neat. The pacing is also pretty much perfect, not too fast, not too slow. And because of that, I personally don\'t feel bored watching this at all (fyi: I watched this 12 episodes in the same day). Oh yeah forgot to mention, this anime is full of emotions, and it\'ll make your emotions change, and mixed together at some point. It somewhat also not cringe at all.Character developments: GreatEpisode per episode, slowly the characters undergo changes in the way they think, talk, do things, etc. It\'s not just one, two, or three. In my opinion, all of the characters experience great character developments. The most visible character development here is Rui Tachibana (the blue haired girl). At first, you can say she was kinda indifferent, ignorant, and doesn\'t held any feeling towards anybody. But after a few ep, her character changes quite a lot.Conclusions (Overall): 8/10I guess that\'s probably all of it. The anime is definitely not perfect, but you definitely must give this a shot. And remember one thing, WATCH THIS WITH YOUR FAMILY FOR THE BEST EXPERIENCE!!! it looks. The average 2019 anime qualities are still better than this. For example, let\'s say Kaguya-sama.

"", 'I tried to get rid of the sadness of the end of Shingeki here, what are the chances of it going wrong?Throughout the anime we follow Natsuo and Rui, who thought they would have a deeper relationship (because of the beginning), however it was more empty than a Brazilian carnival relationship, leading up to the protagonist\'s platonic love for his teacher Hina.I thought it was really cool that very heavy issues were on the table, because it\'s not just Natsuo who has a romance with Hina, but also Miu with Reiji who in this case is a student with the teacher, yes that kiss between...them in the library for me highlighted everything.But ok, going back to Natsuo and Hina, I was really rooting for them precisely because it was an adult romance, she is not the exemplary woman after all she was being the lover of a married man and Natsuo is even worse, he performed the sexual act with a stranger! , to make matters worse, even now with a ""brother"" status, he couldn\'t stop himself from trying to kiss his ""sister""/teacher (It\'s okay that we know about platonic love but..., right guys, do you understand me?) and he still stayed with the same girl (Unknown from Carnival) inside her own house (she being the supposed sister too), not to mention that he even tried something with ""momo"".All this with him hiding his love for Hina at all times, so for me that makes him a despicable character hahaha, but ok I understand that he is a human with many flaws, just like Hina, so I believe that this crazy love that he has for her, he saved her from a problem with the married guy and she finally experienced real love. So I\'m rooting for both of them, before you say yes, I hated this ending, even giving him the chance to love Rui was a sad little shame in the series.Even though I\'m aware that his life needs to go on..., I don\'t know, I love Mikasa who will be crazy about Eren and faithful to him until the end..., ahhh what the hell, I\'m remembering Shingeki again 😓. ."", despite the regrets, I liked the work and I disagree with those who said that the manga better addresses Natsuo\'s romance with Hina, hey, I loved all these episodes for Natsuo and Hina, it\'s not possible that I was the only one. them in the library for me highlighted everything.But ok, going back to Natsuo and Hina, I was really rooting for them precisely because it was an adult romance, she is not the exemplary woman after all she was being the lover of a married man and Natsuo is even worse, he performed the sexual act with a stranger! , to make matters worse, even now with a ""brother"" status, he couldn\'t stop himself from trying to kiss his ""sister""/teacher (It\'s okay that we know about platonic love but..., right guys, do you understand me?) and he still stayed with the same girl (Unknown from Carnival) inside her own house (she being the supposed sister too), not to mention that he even tried something with ""momo"".All this with him hiding his love for Hina at all times, so for me that makes him a despicable character hahaha, but ok I understand that he is a human with many flaws, just like Hina, so I believe that this crazy love that he has for her, he saved her from a problem with the married guy and she finally experienced real love.

I watched it because of...the opening. I do not regret my decision though, as there were some quite appealing and sweet moments. Other than that, it was most likely a waste of time.First things first, we a got typical ML - average japanese schoolboy, who is nothing special aside from his writing hobby and a lack of mom. Same old story, same jaded topic. Well, there\'s a plenty of titles with exact same setup, so we can give it a chance, right? RIGHT?As a typical Marty Stu every woman loves him just because he exists. Through all the series ML does nothing, literally nothing, and all the time the mAgIc of cOiNcIdEnCe makes things happen to him. When a event is somehow triggered by his own actions, it does either nothing or something so insignificant that it does not affect the plot in any way.Think about this: the guy betrays every woman who\'s showing any kind of affection towards him, and even if they see him do this, nothing changes. NOTHING. Neither he or any other character learns from their mistakes.In the end they\'re faced with the exact same issue they were faced in the beginning and it\'s like ""okay fine"". The fact that the only time when ML shows his will and does the exact opposite of what he was told to do is in a bookclub scene somewhere in the middle of the whole season says a lot about the him. Also he is so dull, you\'d rather get attached to a supporting character like his chubby bestie or the yakuza guy.Speaking of dullness: the only female character I can recall something about is Momo. She has a LITTLE bit of a history and at least I can understand what led you to the position she\'s in now. Does anybody care? No. After the scene with ML she\'s basically out of the picture, only showing up somewhere in the back for no apparent reason.We know nothing about Rui/green-haired girl, we know almost nothing about Hina and actually everyone except for the yakuza guy who is absolutely badass and funny and, as predictable as it is, has no screentime. This is the mistake which led to the absolute dullness of basically everyone in the story. You can swap any romantic interest between their places in the story and nothing will change because all of them are unlayered clichèes.You might say - ""well, Hina has layers"" - but does she? She acts immature, knows, that she acts immature, continues to act immature till the very end choosing the exact same escapism there was in the beginning. She is boring. But it\'s not the issue.The issue is: everyone is boring there. The reason for it is really simple - none of the characters live through the story. They are more like inexperienced actors trying to play their roles with zero idea who are they playing. They succumb to events like dummies, take nothing from it and proceed. Whatever happens matters not, because they will always be the same. And it\'s really hard to relate or to like/dislike a character when this character isn\'t really invested in it. I watched Domekano as if I watched a really cheap soap opera made by 3 not-even-film-students 2 of which are actors. Except for the fact that the chars there are animated so the problem is within the writing.Don\'t fall for this trap, Kawaki wo Ameku only lasts a minute and a half, and the episode is like 24 mins. No, they won\'t play it twice. I really hope I can still find a way to listen to it withong having cringebacks all the time. the opening.

You can swap any romantic interest between their places in the story and nothing will change because all of them are unlayered clichèes.You might say - ""well, Hina has layers"" - but does she? She acts immature, knows, that she acts immature, continues to act immature till the very end choosing the exact same escapism there was in the beginning. She is boring. But it\'s not the issue.The issue is: everyone is boring there. The reason for it is really simple - none of the characters live through the story. They are more like inexperienced actors trying to play their roles with zero idea who are they playing. They succumb to events like dummies, take nothing from it and proceed. Whatever happens matters not, because they will always be the same. And it\'s really hard to relate or to like/dislike a character when this character isn\'t really invested in it. I watched Domekano as if I watched a really cheap soap opera made by 3 not-even-film-students 2 of which are actors. Except for the fact that the chars there are animated so the problem is within the writing.Don\'t fall for this trap, Kawaki wo Ameku only lasts a minute and a half, and the episode is like 24 mins. No, they won\'t play it twice. I really hope I can still find a way to listen to it withong having cringebacks all the time.', 'This Show is absolute garbage! I had gone into this show completely blind looking for a ""Wholesome Romance"" to watch and had heard from a certain ""someone"" on a podcast that is was good so i had started it. immediately i was thrown into an incestual mess that all i could say was that i was stressing. And throughout the show it just seems to get worse. episode 7 had me completely broken and making me think about my existence and what was i even watching. i am on a streak where i am yet to drop a show so i had forced myself to...complete it and it was one daunting task. if you like the feeling of post anime depression then go ahead and watch this piece. Final thoughts is just go watch JoJo\'s instead. complete it and it was one daunting task. if you like the feeling of post anime depression then go ahead and watch this piece.

Nobunagun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19855/Nobunagun,"[""A schoolgirl with a giant gun. Got your attention yet? It’s not every day that we get to see a young girl who holds the soul of Oda Nobunaga. More so, how about the concept of monsters known as ‘Evolutionary Invasion Objects (EIO)’ attacking people? To take this premise and formulate it into an anime takes guts. And that’s what Nobunagun tries to do, on first case anyways. But for what’s worth, Nobunagun is just another slapstick attempt to create an anime with an action girl. There’s little taste that is favorable in this show that comes off as a dumb-down shoot fest.Taking on the...premise, the show is fairly simple despite the complexity of how it starts out. We have a young girl named Shio Ogura with at tomboyish personality. She is a Japanese high school student who seems to be curious around the world. Unfortunately, she comes off a bit as an outcast with only few friends. From the surface, it’s easy to notice that she is a caring girl but has some strange tendencies. Nonetheless, she enjoys her life just the way it is until the faithful day to Taiwan for a field trip; the day that she will never forget.The series takes off with its banal trope involving some sort of invasion by the mysterious Evolutionary Invasion Objects. They come off as creatures taking on abnormal features with bug-like body structures. In retrospect, it is a trite and generic theme as series over the decades have done similar style of presentation. While it’s not a total war on another planet type of story, it still adapts itself as the ‘organization out-to hunt down supernatural creatures’ theme. Meet DOGOO (Defense Organization aGainst Outer Objects), a government agency that trains “E-Gene Holders”, normal humans gifted with special abilities to deal with these EIOs. One unique attribute relating to the E-Gene Holders is the fact that all its users are infused with spirits of historical figures. For Shio, she has the spirit of Oda Nobunaga within her. It matches with her style perfectly considering Shio’s ebullient personality. But for it’s worth, the series embraces on this power to combat the enemy to save humanity.Nobunagun would come off as a fun series if it worked itself by character building. Unfortunately, the only characterization features Shio and lesser extent to other characters. The show explores a few type of relationships ranging from professional, caring friendships, and a potential romance. On a professional level, Shio comes off as a clumsy soldier. Despite being dedicated, she makes mistakes and often blames herself for it. Shio’s colleagues often treats her like a kid because her fresh status as an E-Gene Holder. The only development she receives on a professional level deals with the progressive power increase of her abilities. In essence, Shio’s relationship with her colleagues remains vague and lacking. But on a friendship levels, Shio does shine a bit more after saving her fellow classmate, Kaoru Asao. Despite their friendship being a prominent motivation for Shio to fight, their similarities are worlds apart. Asao comes off as a popular girl with an elegant figure enveloped with lady-like manners; the classic Yamato Nadeshiko. Shio on the other hand is the typical klutz with a hotheaded personality and somewhat of a petite figure. Yet somehow, the two fit like two peas in a pod by their strong friendship all after that one faithful day at Taiwan’s field trip.Characterization is generalized as being almost insufferable throughout the show. Most characters’ backgrounds are hardly explored. With the show being only one-cour (13 episodes), it lacks many degrees with developing the characters beyond their generic standards. Even Jack the Ripper, a prominent E-Gene Holder holds only the bad boy persona. His relationship with Shio transits into somewhat of a romance although it’s left as a weak subplot. Obviously, the show isn’t a love story considering many circumstances. Even comedic wise, Shio and Asao has some yuri-undertones with their interactions throughout various episodes. Other characters from Shio’s second platoon can only be appreciated for who they are at best with their various behaviors. Haplessly, none of them are really noticeable for their behavior such as the teasing, kissing, and constant silly arguments over little matters.The DOGOO agency is also stereotypical with their projects to annihilate its enemies. While it tries its best to help humanity, the agency also display hypocritical behavior when their own agents cause collateral damage involving casualties. Their image of the pseudo mad scientist gives off a weak impression beyond their motivations. And of course, their characterization is hardly a focus since the show concentrates its story on obliterating the EIO.Action features as perhaps a driving force to motivate viewers to watch the show. Gainax composes the battle sequences but most of it comes off as cheesy and frivolous coordination. It goes full throttle when the battle comes into scenes to demonstrate intensity. But most times, it’s just there. It lacks emphasis, intelligence, and most of all direction. Most episodes have the characters fight for typical reasons such as friendship and survival. Expected would come off as a first word for this type of execution. But really, Nobunagun performs crazily and is all over the place. It doesn’t demonstrate psychological aspects or present any sense of morality. In retrospect, it formulates itself as mindless battles of berserk and flippant execution.On a plus note, the show can be fun to watch for its worth. Shio’s a character that can be relatable on some standards and it’s nice to see her change a bit, even if it’s not significant. Comedy also works on numerous occasions with its dialogues. Shio’s face expressions also become an antithesis of the ‘damsel in distress’. She symbolizes a classic tomboy. It’s also memorable to see how such a character can get along with others when they are so different from her in the show. Fanservice is also tolerable on most parts with camera angles focusing on some compromising positions. Skin is generally kept in tone with the characters’ battle outfits rather than portraying it as a sex appeal. Shio doesn’t represent an eye candy in the first place so this works out consistently for her character. In fact, most of the characters in the show feels natural and display who they are rather than hiding it behind like a mask. One other interesting point to note is the way it displays its dialogues through gag bubbles and references. It comes off as a fun device to get viewers into attention.Courtesy of animation Studio Bridge, we get its visual aesthetics but only in a few ways. Known recently for its production involving Devil Survivor: The Animation, they demonstrate some acceptable degree of their style. Yet, this might come off with mixed feelings. For one, the animation style feels goofy and amateur. The way it presents its visuals feels like an avant-garde. Its modus operandi composes of oblique structures, amateur character designs, and simplistic backgrounds. The monsters in the show are presented as being acceptingly malevolent. It can draw some attention in but most of the time becomes generic by their mindless behavior. Otherwise, most of the E-Gene Holders display their toughness. And while the show isn't indulged with fan service, there are some lascivious scenes when it comes to tentacle EIOs. You get the picture...Soundtrack comes off as energetic and hyper, perhaps too much. But that’s not necessarily a drawback for this series. In fact, the OST works out best when it’s coordinated with its lively tone. It brings out its dynamics that matches its exuberance. Both the OP and ED song clearly reflects this way with its strong and rapid lyrics. There’s also degrees of calm music during emotional scenes. Character voices such as Shio, Jack the Ripper, and Asao also matches naturally to their persona. Just be ready for the craziness.Nobunagan is a show I would watch when I need a dose of energy. The way it comes off is molded with tropes and clichés. Only the main characters stands out the most although a lack of characterization limits their true visage. The story is honest to its premise but the development comes off as dull. However, do expect a mindless ride of fun if you’re in for the full throttle action. It won’t be on a level of TTGL, Kill la Kill, or something you’ll have your eyeballs glued to the screen. Rather, expect a girl packing big guns and some attitude. premise, the show is fairly simple despite the complexity of how it starts out.

A fairly normal, typical school girl who has trouble making friends, turns out to be the central role is just fantastic and refreshing.  The way the characters/powers, based off of some of the most infamous, famous persona\'s in history, are portrayed in this series is something that I have never seen in any other series. Using these historical figures to inspire the characters or ""reincarnations"" could prove to be difficult. But it was done extremely well in this case. Being able to...develop the chemistry between the team members, and develop each character so in-depth is just one of the many reasons this series is so great. Other than that, the story and plot are extremely entertaining and unique, and there is a ton of action! Every episode brings about another wave of action and includes some very well placed comedic relief. Lets not forget to mention some of the budding romance, and extreme comradery between some of the said characters that makes for some interesting scenarios and situations. There is indeed some fanservice, which exists in a majority of series these days. But it\'s not to the degree that it will overwhelm you.

Character designs are covered in full body armor each displaying their historic spirit & specific traits which is complimented by the eye catches in each episode. One of the highlights of this series is...how it is ""influenced"" by several animes of the past or at least can be compared to. One example is the color tone changing similar to Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure\'s anime adaptation. Other examples include the invaders being similar to ""The Blue"" from Blue Gender as they evolve with every encounter.The same can be said to either Shaman King or Fate/Zero due to their usage of historical figures.Sadly, the cast is kind of bland leading to a couple of ""erotic"" moments thrown in just for the hell of it. The lead Sio Ogura is okay as a military otaku who is just quirky character with a few cool moments. I was hoping for more interaction between the host & their spirit which doesn\'t really happen until the last episode.Being based on a ongoing manga, the anime seems to give an passable conclusion as this series won\'t seem to do will if it goes beyond its limit. However, the music for the anime is excellent; being filled with rock & electronic music which suits the semi-hot blooded tone of the show. In other words, Nobunagun  is not the coolest thing ever but at least it knew what it wanted to do; a slightly dark anime where colorful characters kill aliens via power suits while jamming to an engaging OST. how it is ""influenced"" by several animes of the past or at least can be compared to.

Though, the invaders\' (Evolutionary Invasion Objects) intelligence and tactics used by both parties were something new for me, and kept the show somewhat intense.Ogura\'s getting influenced by Nobunaga badassery was an eye candy for me (she was the only one though?). Thankfully it wasn\'t overused; every scene...that included it was fun till the end.On the overall, the series started strong. But nearing the end, if I went to peek at the first two episodes again I would feel that the it has became much less fun than before. I still believe the series has wrapped up really neatly though.Characters (6):If I could comment on the character designs, I\'d say the writer was being a hipster, giving them designs full of roundness, also resembling what lots of people has said, Megaman...Nobunagun has more characters than our usual shows. Adequate explanation and screen time for everyone is difficult to achieve while maintaining their dedicated action time. I\'d say that the producers have done a really good job in pacing/balancing action time and introducing/explaining the new/side characters (Commander and First Platoon) given only 13 episodes.Regarding character voices, I didn\'t have any issues with them. Seeing Ogura\'s CV is new, it was pretty good. Only Dogoo and Asao (at the start) had voices that seemed off.Dogoo.. well seeing his design I guess he\'s like a kyubey.Asao as a character was weird at the beginning, they tried to force her into the story in a manner that didn\'t work well for me. All the drama between Ogura and Asao felt off, unrealistic etc, at least at the start.Art (5):The producers were apparently trying to be different with the art in this show.The colours of shown in this anime are quite thick and dark, even outside of the battle scenes. I guess it\'s the company\'s way of suggesting a sinister atmosphere, and unsettling/disturbed air after the EIOs appeared.The drawing and presentation of background scenery is more on the simple side, not a lot of budget has been placed on it.Also they tried to present something different by using pointers/floating words, pointing out ""drooling girl"", ""bed hair"", etc, and using flower-patterned or camo-patterned shadows. These \'different things\' were however inconsistent, shown only at the beginning and sometimes randomly after, which ultimately made them insignificant and irrelevant.Despite these downsides, the over all animation is good, even during action scenes. Camera angles/perspectives were fine as well.Sound (7):Once again the anime tries to be different, this time for the OP. It\'s like the studio saying ""hey look this isn\'t mainstream crap"" at your face. Personally, I like the OP though. I think it makes people who like this show like it much more, and likewise, make people who dislike it do so even more. Respect for the dead men! They really mean it, i guess..Regarding the OST, some were good others were just normal.. nothing much to say about the OST.---Nobunagun is a series that I didn\'t regret picking up, didn\'t regret finishing either. It is underrated at worst, seeing many people have dropped it for the art/design/story. However in terms of story/action presentation I can say that it is better than a lot of other series out there.Fanservice is present but very mild, they drew the line well. They know what they were supposed to do. The producers paced episodes well, so there weren\'t really much rushes and those stuff. Of course, there\'s only a few manga volumes out so I can\'t really compare.

One of the biggest things which draws us toward an anime are the stories they are willing to tell that you just aren’t going to see in any other works of fiction. In what other medium are you going to find stories about people creating galaxy-sized mecha out of pure will power alone, or a love story about a young man and—literally—his right hand? The stories of anime are perfect for some and too weird for others.So where does Nobunagun, our anime of interest, fit into all this? Well, what’s the plot?In this series the personalities...and abilities of influential persons throughout history have been stored and passed down in special genes known as E-Genes. Unbeknownst to her, the young military otaku, Ogura Shio, possesses one such gene deep in her body. During a school trip to Taiwan, freakish insectoid monsters attack her and her classmates. Desperate to save them, the E-gene within her awakens revealing Oda Nobunaga who lends her his power in the form of a massive gun which she uses to eradicate the monsters.The monsters, known as Evolutionary Invasion Objects, are being hunted and destroyed by the government agency Dogoo, which finds Ogura and recruits her into their ranks and changes her life forever.The plot for Nobunagun is a very standard “military organization beats up the aliens with teenagers with weapons” but with a twist this time. The thing liable to turn away the wandering viewer is the strange concept of the characters using the powers of historical figures as weapons. But let’s make something clear, that concept in and of itself isn’t bad. Weird sure but not instantly bad. The key word here is ‘execution’ and if a show like this were unable to execute that premise correctly, then it would fail at drawing in the larger crowd.Does Nobunagun fail? Well, let’s take a closer look at each aspect of this series to find out, beginning with the art style.Nobunagun clearly wants to be experimental and do something different with its art. The series is at its best in its use of lighting, contrast and color to create atmosphere and tone. At times this series can make great use of shadow and blacks against light to add imposing form and weight to the face of a character or the hideous form of an insectoid monster. Another neat but welcome oddity is the series adding fourth-wall-breaking tags to further describe or illustrate a certain thing—for the sake of comedy mostly. Such as in the first scene we have many little letters pointing to our heroine in her bed, labeling her as a drooling and sleeping girl. So this series certainly can’t be accused of being uninventive or boring with its use of color and lighting.Without that however, the lazy character designs and crooked, barely-passable animation would become more apparent. During tense action scenes when a tide turning moment is about to occur the series does invest a bit of budget to make it look good, but many of the other monster of the day battles throughout Nobunagun can look very stiff, jerky and worst of all lazily animated. Without the harsh color tone changes during battles to obscure it, it would be much, much worse.Another small thing to mention which could be bad or good depending on the person watching, is the unique, Megaman-escque character designs for the battle suits in the show. They can only be described as large limbed, mechanic battle apparel with an almost sailor uniform influence. They are very silly, but a possible acquired taste to most.The Evolutionary Invasion Objects are very insectoid or fish-like in appearance and they only really grow from small bugs to bigger bugs. They can serve their purpose as being threatening, and different groups of them find new ways to attack and make use of their powers, but their designs stick within boundaries. However, the implication that these creatures are evolving from primitive life to more complicated and powerful life forms, is a chilling thought.Now about the characters. Nobunagun contains a pleasantly full roster of characters, not too big and not too small. Other members of the government agency Dogoo, like Ogura Shio herself, posses the genes and powers of historical figures and manifest this power via external mechanical weaponry.  Some of these members include Jack the Ripper, Isaac Newton, Galileo Galilei, the list goes on. The manifested weapon each character wields is usually relevant to the historical person who they possess the genes of. Such as Jack the Ripper utilizing all forms of blades and knives and Galileo having telescopic vision. Some are kind of on the fence or just in the realm of relevance but the premise is very silly to begin with so accuracy isn’t really a big deal here.Each character has their own distinct personality to bring a dash of flavor to the over all package, but at their worst most are flat, undeveloped, one note and defined largely by a single trait or cliché. Because of this, many characters are simple mouth pieces with a small quirk which sets them apart from the other mouth pieces. Such as Isaac Newton likes to kiss people and turns into a bad ass in battle and…? Galileo loves Vidoq and…?This is also the case for Ogura Shio who is very clumsy, excitable, goofy and nerdy (especially about the military things which she enjoys), but she is not a bad person at heart. Despite a few moments of baby-step character progression and a few critical moments in battle where the spirit of Oda Nobunaga helps her kick ass, she is one of the weaker, but not weakest members of the cast because she does not change at all, no matter what she goes through. She is basically the same character she was since the beginning of the series and it can be frustrating when she’s still acting like a clumsy air head after all she’s gone through. By the end of the series, however, her small moments of development do shine through but she still has a long ways to go.The voice actors for the show range from seasoned veterans such as Akira Ishida and Suzuki Tatsuhisa (who do a great job in their roles), to smaller named VAs who still bring voice to their character very well. Being a kind of… underground show as it is, there are, of course flat sounding voices who don’t perform well but they’re reserved for the faceless mooks dying in battle, not the main cast.Unfortunately the worst offender in the cast is Mutou Shiori who voices the main character herself. This is Shiori’s first role in an anime, and hearing her I’d think it was her first voice acting role period. While her voice fits Ogura Shio’s character, it is very, very flat, unemotional and without tone and she doesn’t really improve throughout the show’s run. It is a very shaky first performance but the actress has potential, and does give Ogura a very normal sounding high school girl voice. Here’s hoping she improves in any future roles she may have.The soundtrack of Nobunagun fits this series like a glove. It is diverse, different, but still within a theme. What is that theme? METAL! The wailing and chugging guitars punctuate the combat scenes in this show perfectly, and boil your blood with excitement. But the soundtrack isn’t all head banging and drum smashing. There are orchestral pieces for the emotional moments, and bouncy chiptune-escque bits for the times Ogura is fangirling over military hardware. The shining star of the soundtrack being “Stone Forest Strategy” which is only used once but is definitely a scene that you’re not going to forget any time soon. Much like the art style, but being more consistent and properly executed, it is the best and most fitting aspect of the series.Nobunagun is a bit of a melting pot of experimental ideas in both visuals, audio and plot. Many of these things bring a distinct flavor to the show itself and which differentiates its overused core premise (monsters invading, kill them) from the millions of other anime which have done it. However these small things are not enough to save the series from its biggest handicaps which are poor writing and execution. In one word this series is goofy and plays very much like a lame monster flick. You got your guns, yer fan service, yer explosions, yer cheese. This is not a series meant to be taken seriously, and I feel as though the creators didn’t take it very seriously either. The writing is by no means good, but it’s fun if you turn your brain off for a little while.The plot is formulaic, very monster of the day, and the means in which they defeat them always boil down to beating the monster up as much as possible. The enemies slowly get bigger over time, and occasionally they destroy them in slightly creative methods, but the formula stays the same. With a majority of the cast being static, we never feel a sense of fulfillment or progression from these mundane episodes.While this show was never meant for main stream appeal, if you want a goofy, cheesy, and fun-stupid anime about people killing giant insects and squids with the power of historical figures. Look no further. and abilities of influential persons throughout history have been stored and passed down in special genes known as E-Genes. Unbeknownst to her, the young military otaku, Ogura Shio, possesses one such gene deep in her body. During a school trip to Taiwan, freakish insectoid monsters attack her and her classmates. Desperate to save them, the E-gene within her awakens revealing Oda Nobunaga who lends her his power in the form of a massive gun which she uses to eradicate the monsters.The monsters, known as Evolutionary Invasion Objects, are being hunted and destroyed by the government agency Dogoo, which finds Ogura and recruits her into their ranks and changes her life forever.The plot for Nobunagun is a very standard “military organization beats up the aliens with teenagers with weapons” but with a twist this time. The thing liable to turn away the wandering viewer is the strange concept of the characters using the powers of historical figures as weapons. But let’s make something clear, that concept in and of itself isn’t bad. Weird sure but not instantly bad. The key word here is ‘execution’ and if a show like this were unable to execute that premise correctly, then it would fail at drawing in the larger crowd.Does Nobunagun fail? Well, let’s take a closer look at each aspect of this series to find out, beginning with the art style.Nobunagun clearly wants to be experimental and do something different with its art. The series is at its best in its use of lighting, contrast and color to create atmosphere and tone. At times this series can make great use of shadow and blacks against light to add imposing form and weight to the face of a character or the hideous form of an insectoid monster. Another neat but welcome oddity is the series adding fourth-wall-breaking tags to further describe or illustrate a certain thing—for the sake of comedy mostly. Such as in the first scene we have many little letters pointing to our heroine in her bed, labeling her as a drooling and sleeping girl. So this series certainly can’t be accused of being uninventive or boring with its use of color and lighting.Without that however, the lazy character designs and crooked, barely-passable animation would become more apparent. During tense action scenes when a tide turning moment is about to occur the series does invest a bit of budget to make it look good, but many of the other monster of the day battles throughout Nobunagun can look very stiff, jerky and worst of all lazily animated. Without the harsh color tone changes during battles to obscure it, it would be much, much worse.Another small thing to mention which could be bad or good depending on the person watching, is the unique, Megaman-escque character designs for the battle suits in the show. They can only be described as large limbed, mechanic battle apparel with an almost sailor uniform influence. They are very silly, but a possible acquired taste to most.The Evolutionary Invasion Objects are very insectoid or fish-like in appearance and they only really grow from small bugs to bigger bugs. They can serve their purpose as being threatening, and different groups of them find new ways to attack and make use of their powers, but their designs stick within boundaries. However, the implication that these creatures are evolving from primitive life to more complicated and powerful life forms, is a chilling thought.Now about the characters. Nobunagun contains a pleasantly full roster of characters, not too big and not too small. Other members of the government agency Dogoo, like Ogura Shio herself, posses the genes and powers of historical figures and manifest this power via external mechanical weaponry.  Some of these members include Jack the Ripper, Isaac Newton, Galileo Galilei, the list goes on. The manifested weapon each character wields is usually relevant to the historical person who they possess the genes of. Such as Jack the Ripper utilizing all forms of blades and knives and Galileo having telescopic vision. Some are kind of on the fence or just in the realm of relevance but the premise is very silly to begin with so accuracy isn’t really a big deal here.Each character has their own distinct personality to bring a dash of flavor to the over all package, but at their worst most are flat, undeveloped, one note and defined largely by a single trait or cliché.

Frankly, I kinda find it a too dorky to say the least and whoever wanna do a cos play of them...characters would probably think twice. Ok, let go with Shio\'s  combat outfit; I can\'t say if she is is wearing a cat suit or was she wearing a tight dress, also her big big gun  was just too dorky, who ever did such poor illustration of her really should have armed her with a minigun, second, Newton\'s combat outfit, with one big leg that serves as her weapon of sort, for would be a point where I would wanna kick this series illustrator on his ass, just what was he thinking of giving a hot lady like that such terrible illustration, there was also Gandhi, geeez, having tow big hands as his fighting equipment???????Fuck, he should have just been given the power of telekinesis, frankly with such corny illustrations I would really love to beat the crap out of this series\' illustrator.Sound and Enjoyment: Fair 6.Well, I kinda like the opening, but not the closing, and I do find Shio\'s voice a bit cute and so as Adam\'s voice who seemly an epitome of a heroic but mysterious man. Thought, it was a bit of a run of a mill kind of anime it was still enjoyable enough.......only bearly.Character: Pathetic 1.I ain\'t gonna mention any of the characters here, all I could say was for the series creator of this thing, he really knows how to desecrate the name of those historical figures, even thought nothing bad was said about them, just using their name is a desecration.Overall: Good 7.Well despite of this anime\'s over the top character\'s and its run of the mill plot, I think that this anime still deserve a good score, since the action, a couple of comedy and that Adam X Shio moment did provided some entertainment....so should this anime have a season 2?????????

I was unable to complete it since it was exceptionally bad.The story was at best ok ( and that is so if you are feeling quite charitable). I mean its a classic story type. Weird good guys fight against the odds to protect the world from alien forces of some type. Pretty cliche but this series managed to fail in the expressing that story.Art is something that is quite subjective. Having said that I have to confess that the art here was exceptionally horrible. The...backgrounds were poorly made, the characters were trying to be unique something that lead them to look like excrement, the fighting scenes were boring and difficult to follow and in general the whole artistic vision was either lost due to implementation or nonexistant to begin with.The soundtrack was pretty boring. Except the opening song, which I found to be quite enjoyable, all the rest of the music was well bellow par. Nothing stood out and nothing seemed to complement the scenes. It was a unique combination of bad art and music.The characters were quite ridiculous both in appearance, attitude and personality. Plus the way that they have been set up with their respective powers is quite stupid. Whoever created them must have been bored and uninterested in the end result.As you already understand I am unable to write about enjoyment when I am thinking that if I was ever tasked with the duty to torture another human being to extract any information I would probably force him/her to watch this series again and again and again. The term cruel and unusual punishment comes to mind when mentioning this series.In conclusion I would not recommend this series to anyone unless you feel you deserve to be punished. backgrounds were poorly made, the characters were trying to be unique something that lead them to look like excrement, the fighting scenes were boring and difficult to follow and in general the whole artistic vision was either lost due to implementation or nonexistant to begin with.The soundtrack was pretty boring.

And to my slight dismay, will probably never get another season.***Spoiler Free***Story (7): An eccentric high school girl on a field trip finds herself in the middle of conflict between a shady agency known as DOGOO and a swarm of aliens known as the ""Evolutionary Invasion Objects"". As DOGOO is losing, the girl comes into contact with one of DOGOO\'s weapon\'s and unlocks a power within her long passed down. She turns out to be the reincarnation of a great historical figure, and most of the other MC\'s...are also reincarnations of thereof. This fact alone made for watching the anime much more interesting, but it never really went anywhere with it.Art (5): While it seems to work for this anime, I was never really a fan of heavily color saturated animes. Think of the art style here as a less extreme version of No Game No Life, espcially during the fighting scenes, where they change their entire color template for some reason. The main armor the characters where is very pseudo Megaman and Tron-ish. I was always conflicted with that.Sound (6): Really, this anime is lacking in the music department. It\'s sountrack is decent at best, albeit it has an amazing opening. The sound effects are great as well.Characters (5): At the end of it all, and even before, I never really felt any connection to the characters. They\'re all pretty bland and generic. I can sum it down to : The clueless MC, the douche genius, the crazy loli, the horny fanservice, the slacker, the wierdo, and the one guy that\'s supposed to be cool.Enjoyment (8): Although Nobunagun is objectively poor, it never really failed to amuse me. Almost every episode was action packed or clean comedy. Even the exposition was entertaining, and some of the best I\'ve seen.Overall (6): If you like shy, eccentric girls with a huge, pseudo-mini gun for an arm, chances are Nobunagun is for you.

That cutesy little play on words is the reason that something as brain-dead as Sharknado was ever allowed to gain any traction, and now I\'m seeing it here. The last thing I need are upcoming anime titles for the next season with pandering, mindless, testosterone-charged names. That being said, Nobunagun is an action show in a market overcrowded with them that is serviceable at worst, but does not one thing to make it really any different from any other title in the modern genre.STORY 7: Aliens have invaded and are harboring themselves for a full scale...invasion #2108 for a story premise. These seem to be the kinds of anime I\'ve run into since 2001 with shows like Zaion, Blue Gender, Argentosoma, or any other given title where if the antagonists aren\'t a bunch of bored-looking shonen villain misfits sitting around a table, then it was just a bunch of insect aliens straight out of Starship Troopers. I will give credit where credit is due, these bugs I actually liked better than the aforementioned shows, as they evolved tactics as the battles waged on (mind you, only because the heroes are complete morons and fight with the same damn battle strategy EVERY single time), but the general feel for even a 13 episode show is ""Creatures show up here. You guys go blow it up."" Even towards the end, I never got the feeling it was building towards anything truly climactic. So with villains that offer nothing for the viewer to invest in and barely seem like a threat after the first two episodes, and a team of fighters that just hang around ""a place"", the plot was just coasting, hoping to substitute countless action sequences and unfunny comedy instead of writing something to sink my teeth into. Most of my props to towards the original idea of using historical figures as a source of power. It\'s a pretty ingenious idea that is grossly miscast with this setting. There could have been a great chance for some social commentary on the state of human affairs (look to your past to solve the problems of the future, or something. Anything other than bug monsters!!) over the selection of these abilities and why the choice of a renegade like Oda Nobunaga to be the leader.ART & ANIMATION 6: It\'s about on par with anything else that\'s recently come out. Only during the many, many, many hack\'n\'slash gun battles does the scenary will switch into this negative filter when the AU balls are activated. It\'s never explained why, and I just found it to be distracting. Some of the CGI is used subtly and cleverly, like with Ghandi\'s barrier (which is what it is, you jackass! Stop throwing a fit when someone calls your barrier a ""barrier"". What do you prefer, Ice Cream Rain Dance?? Cotton Underpants!?!).The character designs look dated to me. I\'ve seen these comedic facials, hairstyles, and visual gags for eight years now. At least each character looks distinct enough and I can tell them apart when they are wearing their uniforms as opposed to 300 generic faces all wearing Soul Reaper garb. The AU Ball outfits, however, leave a little too much to be desired. Preferably, Jack The Ripper, who is bearing the essence of an infamous serial killer and is supposed to be the series\' resident badass, but looks like he\'s dressed in Rini\'s Sailor Scout shirt with puffy shorts!! If you\'re dressed like that, you BETTER kill someone.SOUND 4: That opening theme is horrendous! Sounds like some crappy, rejected Nu Metal that plagued the United States in the early 2000\'s. Ogura Sio spends all of her not-action scenes talking faster than Shia LaBeouf after snorting his own body weight in cocaine and then walking on the set of Revenge of the Fallen. Everyone else sounds bored.CHARACTERS 4: Nearly the entire cast of Nobunagun is littered with everything that drives me crazy about anime (save Asao, she is a sweetheart, which is why she\'s kept out of the show)) None of these characters have a personality trait outside of their casted roles. While I think it\'s cool that a female is the lead and isn\'t a total moron, she has nothing else about her other than her knack to prattle on constantly about military arsenal! And that really is about it with her. Jack could\'ve been a great comedic foil, but instead he just kind of stands there acting stoic. Jess has boobs and collagen lips, Ghandi is allegedly that soft-spoken one, but is a creep for no real reason, Galileo is the twerpy school girl, and Voldicq is the cold, Vulcan-like strategist who favors calculated results over human emotions. I just described the main cast in all the detail the series provided me with in two sentences. Outside of the fact that they are all one-dimensional cookie-cutter archetypes, I doubt they would hang out with each other if they weren\'t forced into close quarters. It\'s like someone paid them to act chummy. At least Asao is pleasant when she\'s present.REWATCH VALUE 5: At 13 episodes, it\'s a breeze to watch, but I don\'t think there was a particular point that would make me want to revisit the show. It\'s an easy enough for viewing pleasure if episodes of another show you might be watching isn\'t available yet. Comes off as a good starter series for someone just getting their feet wet in anime.OVERALL 6: As I have been trying to get back into the swing of watching newer anime on a regular basis after having a meltdown with the medium two years ago, an easy going action title like this one might have been what the doctor ordered. It has some missed potential with the concept behind the powers of prominent historical figures being used to thwart evil. Faceless alien invaders are just the wrong kind of villain for this and they should\'ve battled someone(s) attempting to exploit these abilities. So while it may sound like I shredded this show completely, it isn\'t as bad as I initially thought, but it isn\'t as good as it could have been.PROS: Nobunaga fighting aliens with a gatling gun.CONS: Very underwhelming overall. Bland as all hell characters. That old lady is a terrible person. invasion #2108 for a story premise.

I\'ve seen these comedic facials, hairstyles, and visual gags for eight years now. At least each character looks distinct enough and I can tell them apart when they are wearing their uniforms as opposed to 300 generic faces all wearing Soul Reaper garb. The AU Ball outfits, however, leave a little too much to be desired. Preferably, Jack The Ripper, who is bearing the essence of an infamous serial killer and is supposed to be the series\' resident badass, but looks like he\'s dressed in Rini\'s Sailor Scout shirt with puffy shorts!! If you\'re dressed like that, you BETTER kill someone.SOUND 4: That opening theme is horrendous! Sounds like some crappy, rejected Nu Metal that plagued the United States in the early 2000\'s. Ogura Sio spends all of her not-action scenes talking faster than Shia LaBeouf after snorting his own body weight in cocaine and then walking on the set of Revenge of the Fallen. Everyone else sounds bored.CHARACTERS 4: Nearly the entire cast of Nobunagun is littered with everything that drives me crazy about anime (save Asao, she is a sweetheart, which is why she\'s kept out of the show)) None of these characters have a personality trait outside of their casted roles. While I think it\'s cool that a female is the lead and isn\'t a total moron, she has nothing else about her other than her knack to prattle on constantly about military arsenal! And that really is about it with her. Jack could\'ve been a great comedic foil, but instead he just kind of stands there acting stoic. Jess has boobs and collagen lips, Ghandi is allegedly that soft-spoken one, but is a creep for no real reason, Galileo is the twerpy school girl, and Voldicq is the cold, Vulcan-like strategist who favors calculated results over human emotions. I just described the main cast in all the detail the series provided me with in two sentences. Outside of the fact that they are all one-dimensional cookie-cutter archetypes, I doubt they would hang out with each other if they weren\'t forced into close quarters. It\'s like someone paid them to act chummy. At least Asao is pleasant when she\'s present.REWATCH VALUE 5: At 13 episodes, it\'s a breeze to watch, but I don\'t think there was a particular point that would make me want to revisit the show. It\'s an easy enough for viewing pleasure if episodes of another show you might be watching isn\'t available yet. Comes off as a good starter series for someone just getting their feet wet in anime.OVERALL 6: As I have been trying to get back into the swing of watching newer anime on a regular basis after having a meltdown with the medium two years ago, an easy going action title like this one might have been what the doctor ordered. It has some missed potential with the concept behind the powers of prominent historical figures being used to thwart evil. Faceless alien invaders are just the wrong kind of villain for this and they should\'ve battled someone(s) attempting to exploit these abilities. So while it may sound like I shredded this show completely, it isn\'t as bad as I initially thought, but it isn\'t as good as it could have been.PROS: Nobunaga fighting aliens with a gatling gun.CONS: Very underwhelming overall. Bland as all hell characters. That old lady is a terrible person.', 'For me, it was one of the best anime that i ever seen.There is action, romance, sci-fi. The art is not common and the colour are used very well. The story may seem normal or like another anime but it is not. Using famous character from the past and discovering about them is very interessing.The main character is a nerd about military plane but it made us love her because she is not a weak person. She may seem but is not. In fact, she does not look a like those typical character and that is why the anime is so interesting !!Please watched it...! And I hope my review helped you ! ! And I hope my review helped you !', ""This is a fun little show. Nothing special, but not offensively bad either.The story is a typical 'teenager with magical powers saves the world' tale. It doesn't really do anything new, but it's a good enough base to build off of.The characters are surprisingly engaging for such a silly light hearted show. The protagonist is fine, a bit bland, but with enough personality to qualify as the main character.Although none of the supporting characters are amazing, they are all memorable and some slightly subvert expectations, which is always welcome. You can believe that they have lives outside of the story that is being told....The powers that the characters have are also a little bit different and interesting.The show's style is silly, but distinct and deliberate, and I think that it works. The overall quality seems to be lacking the 'smoothness' that nicer looking shows have, and the character designs are a bit exaggerated and bizarre. However, it all feels right.Although I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this to anyone, I wouldn't discourage anyone from watching it either.

The truth is that the story, like the characters, starts out looking pretty simple in the first episodes, but with the passage of time you realize that it is not as bad as it seems.The first thing that stands out is that the powers are based on great figures from the past from all areas. The enemies,...the objects of evolution, although they seem simple, develop the content of the main story, because what in the first episodes looks like they are going to be an increasingly stronger bad guy than the previous one, ends up becoming a story, although not the best in the world, quite entertaining.Characters: (1.25 / 2).The characters are quite stereotyped, and quite simple in general, but also being so many, there are a wide variety of personalities that give a little grace to the series.What I like about the characters is the evolution that Shio, the main character, has through the anime. And as I commented in the story, the characters improve over time and develop little by little. You are not going to see anything extraordinary either, but I think that in general it is a series that if it lasted longer could have been much better, because it has stories like Jack the Ripper, Nobunagun or the Commander's quite interesting.Art: (0.5 / 2).There is little to comment on the art, bad. This is one of those anime where the story or the characters stand out much more than the animation, in this case Bridge, the studio, has not put all its resources into this series.The characters are simple to the point, not to mention the combat armor that seems to have been drawn by my little cousin, the same scenarios and objects of evolutionary invasion are even more seedy. Furthermore, the animations in combat are simple and repeated. Perhaps the best are combat vehicles.Sound: (1.25 / 2).Sound is average. Nor are we going to remember Nobunagun with the best soundtrack in history, but it's not bad. Use an effective music for combat, which gives a sensation of movement, and a calmer one in the moments of pause in the series. In general the sound effects of shots, explosions, etc ..., are good, for this part well.The opening although I personally do not like it, I must admit that it goes quite well with the series, action and more action. The ending is average too.Enjoyment: (1.75 / 2).Nobunagun is one of those series that, despite not having anything special, is quite entertaining. Although the first episodes are somewhat boring, these are improving with the passage of the series.An anime of pure action and where each character has its special power, where there are fights each chapter. Being a fairly short series, 13 episodes only, it passes quickly.Overall: (6 / 10).To summarize a series that is not bad, based purely on action and some strategy. The characters seem very flat but at the end they tell their stories, which begins to make it interesting. It gives me the feeling that with a better art team and a few more episodes it could be a series with potential. the objects of evolution, although they seem simple, develop the content of the main story, because what in the first episodes looks like they are going to be an increasingly stronger bad guy than the previous one, ends up becoming a story, although not the best in the world, quite entertaining.Characters: (1.25 / 2).The characters are quite stereotyped, and quite simple in general, but also being so many, there are a wide variety of personalities that give a little grace to the series.What I like about the characters is the evolution that Shio, the main character, has through the anime.

I hope that they make a season 2 soon because it will be epic. Though i have to say one thing the last episode did not feel like a season finally it felt like just like an end to a normal episode but it was still a really good episode, that is all i will say about.

The first scene is innovate and quite impressive, however it starts to quickly go down hill from there. Overall Id give it an 8.ANIMATION 10: The art is crap. I would not be surprised if I found out that the whole series spent $10 on the animation in the entire series, however, the show manages to effectively use those $10 in a way that makes the show enjoyable. The show expertly, and effectively uses dark colors, lighting contrasts, and color switches to hide the limited budget, and set the mood at the same time. The...show’s use of perspective and camera angles in the first scene is expertly done, and It felt as if there was an actual camera, and like I was actually walking down the hall. Overall, while the art is not great, the way the show uses its available resources is amazing.CHARACTERS 6: the characters were pretty average. Only a couple stood out, especially personality wise. I did like the the use of historical figures and the powers were related to the character. The MC being a weapons nerd was kind cool.STORY 5: story was meh. It was pretty average. Pretty much any generic alien invaded earth.VOICE ACTING (ENGLISH DUB) 9: voice acting is pretty good. I love the use of a wide variety of accents from all over the world. The MC fit well with their voice actor.MUSIC  8: the music for well with the theme of the show. It did a decent. I quite enjoyed it. Also the use of music throughout the show helps to set the tone. The music durring fight scenes was not shabby either. show’s use of perspective and camera angles in the first scene is expertly done, and It felt as if there was an actual camera, and like I was actually walking down the hall.

But, everyone says that for any anime that isn’t “ Evangelion “ or “ Madoka Magica “ you know, the classics. Critically acclaimed, for a reason. But what makes an anime good, or bad, what is the middle ground? What are the factors?Nobunagun has as many good factors as it has bad factors, it balances itself out. Nobunagun is that middle ground.It’s as cliche as saying something is cliche really, a story about an ordinary girl being caught into the middle...of a battle when she least expects it and ending up joining the team, leaving her normal life behind discovering she is actually the best of the best! I have no true opinions about the story, it’s not necessarily bad as it is just basic. Being cliche isn’t inherently bad, I liked “ Seraph of the End “ which is considered cliche and I admit that it is. Whilst this show being cliche, there’s not really a story to follow as every episode is different and you can honestly start the series on any episode. However, I still like anime and manga that don’t have a real story. I love “ Laid Back Camp “ and I also really like “ How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift? “ as they are genuine page-turners filled with a balance of entertainment and education sprinkled in with humor and some genuine emotional moments at times.The only real episodes that imply there is some background are the first two, maybe three episodes. Which are my favorite. I still like some of the other episodes however, but it can get stale fast as most of the characters are extremely one-sided and all act similar. You never really understand why the characters are here, you never get to hear their story, they are there just to help support our main character who is the only actual character with depth which is extremely disappointing. I would love to find out Jack the Ripper’s story, and it would be interesting to see if any of the teachers were or are still e-gene holders. I would also love to see new enemies and more genuine interactions with the characters that aren’t fan-service. But, if you’ve seen one episode aside from the first three, you have seen them all, the only thing changing being a battle sequence which are usually entertaining paired with the great soundtrack and the beautiful visuals. Infact, this anime has one of my favorite anime openings. The one being “ respect for the dead man “ which is honestly way better than it should be.Would I recommend it? Not really, but I didn’t hate it. I have no real reason to keep watching either, by episode 5 it got boring and it never really reached it’s full potential. of a battle when she least expects it and ending up joining the team, leaving her normal life behind discovering she is actually the best of the best!

Osu!! Karate-bu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6031/Osu_Karate-bu,"[""I usually avoid watching OVAs and anime movies since I mostly get bored fast and lose interest halfway.But with Karate Bu, it was a different story.I gave it a shot at first since I'm a huge fan of old school anime, and boy I'm thrilled I did that.This show is full of manliness, and even if you didn't like martial arts you have to give it a shot.The theme is about a high school karate club ruled by the great head of Osaka, Takagi.He is different from your normal main characters, I think he's more like Takamura from Hajime no ippo.The story is mostly narrated...by one member of the karate club named Matsushita, but I think Takagi is the main hero of the story.These series of OVA tells the story of the Osaka's pride of its renowned karate club, which lead to numerous challenges by other schools and gangs from different prefectures.The story is very compact, and the characters all are original and very intersetingI really enjoyed this until the end, and it's really a rare thing to say about an OVA. by one member of the karate club named Matsushita, but I think Takagi is the main hero of the story.These series of OVA tells the story of the Osaka's pride of its renowned karate club, which lead to numerous challenges by other schools and gangs from different prefectures.The story is very compact, and the characters all are original and very intersetingI really enjoyed this until the end, and it's really a rare thing to say about an OVA.""]"
Pokemon (2019): Kami to Yobareshi Arceus,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50673/Pokemon_2019__Kami_to_Yobareshi_Arceus,"[""Should have been called something like Pokemon (2019): The Raging Berserker Heatran, because that's what we pretty much got for majority of the four episode special, I feel slightly cheated here. Arceus, after seemingly much internal debate, finally decides to give a shit and shows up at the end, when the danger is at it's peak.Celebrating the release of the new Pokemon game Legends: Arceus, we have Ash and Go back in Sinnoh where they meet up (coincidentally I might add lol) with Dawn and Brock and the Champion Cynthia.

Maybe it's just because I don't like Heatran that much and they decided to work the story around this Pokemon.Yes, there was some fanservice, Brock taking his shirt off (homage to gen 1 though already happened in Sun and Moon) or Cynthia battling, but it was short and minimal. Again, left wanting more.The best part was Arceus not giving a shit about Team Galactic's final plea to the whereabouts of their beloved boss lol...5/10 for an underwhelming edition of Pokemon.
