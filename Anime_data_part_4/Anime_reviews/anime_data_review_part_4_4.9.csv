Azur Lane: Queen's Orders,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49793/Azur_Lane__Queens_Orders,"[""Azur Lane: Queen's Orders is a refreshing departure from the usual Azur Lane fare, which typically focuses on action-packed battles between anthropomorphic warships. Instead, this spin-off anime centers on the day-to-day operations of the Azur Lane base, following the misadventures of the ever-reliable Queen Elizabeth as she steps up to take charge in the absence of the ailing Commander.The story is surprisingly unique, offering a glimpse into the inner workings of the Azur Lane organization and the personalities of its shipgirls beyond the battlefield. It's a lighthearted and comedic take on leadership, bureaucracy, and the importance of teamwork.Here are some of the things I liked...about Azur Lane: Queen's Orders:The humor is spot-on and never feels forced.The characters are all likable and relatable.The anime tackles some surprisingly mature themes.The animation is top-notch.The music is catchy and memorable. about Azur Lane: Queen's Orders:The humor is spot-on and never feels forced.The characters are all likable and relatable.The anime tackles some surprisingly mature themes.The animation is top-notch.The music is catchy and memorable."", 'Azur Lane: Queen\'s Orders is a fun spin-off of the principal story: Azur Lane, an anime based on a video game with the same name.Even though I am not a game player, I enjoyed the main Azur Lane anime, and I think it has a lot of potential for its great characters and intriguing story.Azur Lane: Queen\'s Orders is a pair of OVAS that fans of Azur Lane (like me) will enjoy. It is fun, and it is full of beautiful characters. I especially like the second OVA due to its massive reference to diversity and different cultures.But at the same time, the downside of...this story is that Azur Lane: Queen\'s Orders is the second spin-off that has been released (the first one was Azur Lane: Slow Ahead!). Even though I was enjoying Azur Lane: Queen\'s Orders, at the same time, I was wondering, ""When will the second season of the main story?"" That feeling never let me fully enjoy Azur Lane: Queen\'s Orders.In the bottom line, Azur Lane: Queen\'s Orders is a pair of Ovas 100% created for fans. If you are not a fan, you have nothing to do here.At the same time, if you are a fan, you will enjoy this anime, but it will let you have a feeling that will bother your soul and won\'t make you 100% happy. this story is that Azur Lane: Queen\'s Orders is the second spin-off that has been released (the first one was Azur Lane: Slow Ahead!).

Cardfight!! Vanguard: will+Dress,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49819/Cardfight_Vanguard__will_Dress,"['I recommend to whoever likes Vanguard would take a chance to watch this new sequel anime and for newcomers as well. The third season does indeed improved from the first season in terms of showing more of the card fighting. It’s a little strange to tell newcomers to watch a sequel to only be confused but due to the complaint from many people that the first season has less fighting, I do suggests going onward with the third season which felt more like a fresh start from what the anime studio has been doing for the previous seasons. Let’s just say we have some new...characters joining in the series that showcases one of them being a new player with a tutorial on how to play, and a new tournament arc. However, if not, do go watch the first two seasons so you won’t be confused if you don’t mind the lack of card fighting; although, the second season does show a bit more than the first season. The art-style and animations are still great but I believe they rather downgrade the art-style a little which is whatever since it still looks good. I’ve read that some people wanted the former characters from the original anime such as Aichi and Kai to make a come back which I don’t think will happen in this sequel due to it being a new era after all. It’s time to start fresh with new characters and a new story. characters joining in the series that showcases one of them being a new player with a tutorial on how to play, and a new tournament arc.

I think the third season really suffers from focusing on the card game itself and being self absorbed in this tournament thing. That was never the...interesting part of the show... so, I am quite disappointed.This arc was extremely weak in terms of characterization of the new main cast. The new girl, Urara, is just a genius and that's it. She's shy and gets super focused while playing the game but it is super lacklust the way they characterized her. Other participants are also very boring with the exception of Michiru and Raika. I like the fact that they have some sort of connection to each other that does not involve the main character!The other thing that I really liked is Yuuyu and Mirei's heart to heart about representing their teams and being a leader. I thought that was rather good. She's the best character in the whole show imo....Anyways, Vanguard fans, you got what you wanted.

Battle Programmer Shirase,https://myanimelist.net/anime/579/Battle_Programmer_Shirase,"[""Story: Unfortunately, the story was cut off after 15 episodes, and although the 15 episodes do tend to stick out on their own, the story quickly falls into a routine of Shirase being in his house, through some accident ends up in an uncomfortable position, and his next employer(always an Akizuki) walks in and sees him like this. The story quickly progresses through the various cybercrime cases Shirase takes, this routine repeating itself across each one.Art: Standard anime artwork, nothing new or innovativeSound: The voice actors for this anime are spot-on. No men with girly voices, rather, they all have the voices corresponding to their...characters. The sounds of everyday life such as that of Shirase's fingers clicking on a keyboard add a small sense of realism.The characters: If you looked up Shirase on a dictionary, you'd find him associated with ecchi and other such words. He is an easygoing rouge programmer who only cares about his programming and Misao-chan. Shirase is great-uncle or something like that to Misao, and she is just barely finishing elementary school, which might feel very improper to mainstream audiences who aren't accustomed to this aspect of japanese culture (lolicon).Enjoyment: I personally enjoyed this short series, although the rather abrupt end was a source of disappointment to me. When you see the ending, you just know they could have kept this series going a bit longer. All in all, it leaves you wanting more, even if you feel it gets repetitive after a while, it does add a certain light-heartedness to this genre of hacker anime, typically dominated by anime similar to Ghost in the Shell. The inclusion of a possible love interest in the last 2 episodes is something I enjoyed, but again, due to the abrupt end, you are left wondering what might happen after, especially with the subtle hint at Shirase's future in that last image they show.Overall: A decent anime, considering it is only 15 minutes long. Don't expect much, the abrupt end will leave you feeling cheated, even though the episodes are only 15 at 12 minutes each. Recommended to the hard-core programmer crowd for a few laughs, and to everyone else, this is rather a parody of programmers. characters.

An ecchi comedy about a programmer who doesn\'t work for money seems like just the kind of trash that I love. But now I can say with confidence that this is the worst anime I\'ve ever watched. It\'s a masterclass on how not to make a good show.Sexualisation of minors and incestuous relationships. Short episodes with long and unnecessary recaps at the start of half of them. Offensive treatment of a trans character. Lazy animation, with lots of scenes being obviously re-used. Characters being introduced, set up as if they are going to be significant, and then never seen...again. A female character moaning orgasmically and uncontrollably from having her hip groped.And then there\'s the ""hacking"", which requires a paragraph of its own. Many shows portray hacking with terrible tropes, and you would be hard pressed to find a sin on /r/itsaunixsystem that this show DOESN\'T commit. But, not satisfied there, the show comes up with some new and original awful hacking tropes. Such as, instead of typing frantically, the main character executing an immensely implausible hack by just pressing one key, the ""return"" key. Talk about making it look easy. Using a computer without looking at it is nothing new and is possible in real life, but the main character in this show is somehow able to read a report without being able to see the screen.None of these things are enough to break a show. The issue with BPS is that it has nothing except these things. The storylines are boring. The characters are boring. The show has exactly one joke, and it knows it because it re-uses it 5-6 times throughout the series and follows it up with canned laughter each time. And the joke isn\'t even very funny.All of this makes me wonder if perhaps BPS is a parody. If so, it fails on that level too, because parodies are meant to critique and make fun of stupid tropes, not just to emulate them. Instead the kindest thing I could say about this show is that maybe the staff\'s goal was to make the worst anime ever, and in that case I believe they succeeded. again.

Short review.Battle Programmer Shirase is underrated.The story is simple yet it doesn't lack much as it's a sci-fi comedy. Some jokes are repetitive, but every time they are presented in different ways which make them work.There are recaps here. You can skip them, nothing wrong with it. BPS was airing at the beginning of the 21st century on TV once a week, that's why they are here. I admit that they're quite long though.Characters are the strongest point of this anime. Main characters have unique and memorable personalities. Akira Shirase, even though he seems to be your typical perverted weeb at first, is...a kind man who does his amazing job as a programmer and is not afraid to look strange, he is being himself. Misao Amano is a caring primary school girl, a relative of Shirase that visits his house nearly every day to do the chores and cook for him. There's some amazing chemistry between those two, but it's not like Misao is the only female in the cast. Don't get the wrong idea, this anime is not a harem failure.Side characters are mostly being the comedy relieves, however, a decent part of them is good plot-wise. There is only one hateable character, but thankfully, she appears rarely and only in the last episodes, as I recall.The art is slightly above average. This anime is a lightweight ecchi with not much fanservice, so I guess the animation and artwork are okay.Sound is better than visuals. Voice actors match their characters greatly. OP and ED are catchy and memorable.To conclude, Battle Programmer Shirase is not complex. What makes it work is the execution, which is not top-notch, with its mistakes, yet is beautiful and inspired. They had really put soul into this anime before releasing it.Thank you for reading my review.

Even though there were 15 airings, it took 3 or 4 airings to complete an episode. So there are really only 4-5 episodes. So don't expect a fully developed plot line. In fact, the anime ends when you feel like it should begin.With that said, it is extremely funny. The main character is hilariously apathetic to everything except antique computer parts and his hormones.The situations he is put in are equally entertaining, and his superhuman feats of programming to solve them make the concept have a tremendous amount of potential which battle programmer Shirase...doesn't quite reach.Definitely worth watching though, because it's so short. The biggest shortcoming is not having more time to have a real plot. doesn't quite reach.Definitely worth watching though, because it's so short.

After all these years though, I now don’t care much about it since it didn’t really have much of a context to work with and was even going in circles with the scraps it had laid out.The story is about a...super genius programmer, used by the government to prevent a criminal hacker from doing various major acts of terrorism. He is a slob so his underage female cousin comes to his house to help him in his life. So in every case, the exact thing happens. A government official would come to inform Shirase of the danger and would always meet him at the moment the little girl has accidentally bumped onto him in a very naughty way. He will immediately imagine a lot of erotic and psychologically depressed stuff before Shirase will take a computer and do his thing to prevent the opposing hacker… And that is pretty much all of it.It sounds typical the way I describe it and frankly speaking it doesn’t try to mess with its formula much. Heck, even the jokes are repeating in the exact same way. But in practice the show manages to be very funny because each episode is short in duration and has fast pace. Plus the jokes are both bold and despite bordering paedophilia and being rehashed, they are always based on misunderstandings and not on the real thing; thus nobody is insulted. The protagonist is also the lazy but smart type of hero, who is always liked by most viewers for simply not belonging to the shounen lead archetype or the harem lead archetype which plague most anime. Having his cousin as a contrast to further boost his presence, as well as nobody else in the cast with similar traits to steal some spotlight, Shirase is one heck of a guy.In all, it is not that great of a comedy. The jokes are hilarious but it is questionable if you laugh after the third time they are used in the exact same way. The production values are poor, the story is going in circles, the hacking battles aren’t exciting, and there isn’t any actual progress in any way.

Anima Yell!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37206/Anima_Yell,"[""Anime almost feels like a religion sometimes. Anyone who is a faithful follower will recognize that the concept of CGDCT (“Cute Girls Doing Cute Things”) always has a spot in every season. It’s 2018 and we had series like Yuru Camp that expressed the joy of comfy camping, Comic Girls to showcase the concept of manga crafting, and even Harukana Receive about beach volleyball with sexy sporty girls doing athletic things.  Manga Time Kirara seems to never run out of ideas and their family of magazines will probably never disappear in our time. Before I die, Anima Yell is another show that I checked...off the bucket list that I didn’t regret.Anyone familiar with Doga Kobo will easily know their talent that usually adhere to schoolgirls and slice of life. Anima Yell doesn’t derive far from their usual trend although it has an interesting concept about cheerleading. From the first few episodes, we are introduced to Kohane Hatoya, an energetic schoolgirl who have fallen in love with the sport of cheerleading. What’s her goal? It’s basically to form a club with her friends and share their passion and joy. Say hello to the main cast consisting of Hizume Arima, Uki Sawatari, Kotetsu Tatejima, and Kana Ushiku.Now I’ll be honest. If you’re not familiar with Doga Kobo’s other works, then it may be hard to embrace this show. Their modus operandi generally has a female main cast that sometimes also consists of soft shoujo-ai. You can see them through some of the character interactions although Anima Yell is light on this. There is one episode with a short plot about how to get the crush of a girl while other episodes consists of teases. The center of attention is Hizume Arima, the cool girl and ace of the group. At school, she’s admired as a beauty and often attracts attention whether she likes it or not. It’s no secret that other girls wants her and that even includes one of the group’s own members, Kana Ushiku.But let’s go back to square one for a bit. The one that started this all is the ultra-upbeat girl, Kohane Hatoya. While she isn’t a child prodigy with impressive skills, there’s no doubt that her personality is influential to others. She is always helpful and can make friends with just about anyone. This even includes Hizume, the cool girl who isn’t easy to open herself to others. Kohane’s love for cheerleading borders on obsession and often causes hilarious scenes between her and others. My impression of Kohane is that she’s pretty much the poster girl of selling the main context for this show. She’s there to deliver her passion and is ready to be received by the audience. There are many episodes where her personality enables others to see what she enjoys in. And such, her group grows more in a positive way.For such a charming anime, you may wonder what to be aware of the main plot. Honestly, it’s very loose as each episode presents itself like a storybook. It ties the whole show together through the essence of cheerleading with a great amount of colorful personalities. Each of the main cast is diverse enough to stand out individually. However, I do admit that some characters are less likable to others. Personally, I find Kotetsu Tatejima’s timid personality to be borderline annoying. Her lack of confidence sometimes feels embarrassing to watch and is no doubt in my mind the weakest link in the group. This is a sharp contrast compared to Hizume, the girl with previous experience in cheerleading. In fact, the series even has background story about why she got kicked out of her old squad until she decides to embrace the love of cheerleading again. Beyond the main cast, there isn’t much to say about any others as most of the episodes consists of throwaway characters. In other words, any minor character you see rarely appears again and easily forgettable.Well, they've done it again. Thanks to Doga Kobo’s colorful art style, Anima Yell stands on its feet as an adorable show with cute girls. Cheerleading in this series is portrayed as an upbeat sport and the characters (especially Kohane) show great enthusiasm. There’s an abundant amount of character expressions that often stretches themselves over the line with its humorous gags. Kohane is the main culprit of this due to her excitement about cheerleading. Often, she just pushes any situation into such direction and it’s pretty damn priceless. The character designs for the cheerleading outfits themselves are well decorated with vibrant touches and stylish colors. Surprisingly, I’m also impressed by the overall direction of the choreography. There's even excitement expressed by the body language of their performances. Their performances in this show also keeps its pace and carries an adamant momentum that's hard to keep eyes off of. I’m not a big fan of cheerleading but there wasn’t one episode that made me walk away from those performances. Well done again, girls.I bet anime fans are questioning in today’s world if we have too many shows about “cute girls doing cute things”. Now, we have cute girls doing cute cheerleading things. But really, Anima Yell isn’t here to jump on the bandwagon. Instead, it’s a show that has a lot of heart thanks to Kohane’s club with her friends. off the bucket list that I didn’t regret.Anyone familiar with Doga Kobo will easily know their talent that usually adhere to schoolgirls and slice of life. Anima Yell doesn’t derive far from their usual trend although it has an interesting concept about cheerleading. From the first few episodes, we are introduced to Kohane Hatoya, an energetic schoolgirl who have fallen in love with the sport of cheerleading. What’s her goal? It’s basically to form a club with her friends and share their passion and joy. Say hello to the main cast consisting of Hizume Arima, Uki Sawatari, Kotetsu Tatejima, and Kana Ushiku.Now I’ll be honest. If you’re not familiar with Doga Kobo’s other works, then it may be hard to embrace this show. Their modus operandi generally has a female main cast that sometimes also consists of soft shoujo-ai. You can see them through some of the character interactions although Anima Yell is light on this. There is one episode with a short plot about how to get the crush of a girl while other episodes consists of teases. The center of attention is Hizume Arima, the cool girl and ace of the group. At school, she’s admired as a beauty and often attracts attention whether she likes it or not. It’s no secret that other girls wants her and that even includes one of the group’s own members, Kana Ushiku.But let’s go back to square one for a bit. The one that started this all is the ultra-upbeat girl, Kohane Hatoya. While she isn’t a child prodigy with impressive skills, there’s no doubt that her personality is influential to others. She is always helpful and can make friends with just about anyone. This even includes Hizume, the cool girl who isn’t easy to open herself to others. Kohane’s love for cheerleading borders on obsession and often causes hilarious scenes between her and others. My impression of Kohane is that she’s pretty much the poster girl of selling the main context for this show. She’s there to deliver her passion and is ready to be received by the audience. There are many episodes where her personality enables others to see what she enjoys in. And such, her group grows more in a positive way.For such a charming anime, you may wonder what to be aware of the main plot.

Where is the chair?After the major success of 'Bring it On', 'Ninja Cheerleaders' and 'Fired Up!', it was only a matter of time until anime got its cheerleading series starred by cute girls, and it's cute, indeed.The cast is ridiculously energetic and excited about everything to a point that this thing has been fun to watch.

You have been warned.Based off a popular manga of the same name Anima yell is a comedy, sports and school genre based anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a girl who loves to be helpful and caring towards others were to come across an activity and sport that would not just allow her to improve the way in which she can help...and support others but also do so in the company of like-minded individuals who share her passion for wanting to help and motivate others through their actions as cheerleaders. The subject matter of cheerleading has always been a rather curious topic in my eyes as while I understand the core concepts behind it, I always thought that the effects that it will have on the ones being cheered on were only marginal due largely to the fact that its restricted to sports which relies more on the skill of the player more than anything. However, the insight into the kind of motivation that cheerleaders have for entering that sport as well as the kind of training that it requires to be good at it really helped change my mind. The first episode of the series I felt left a pretty good impression on me as it not only did well in introducing the main characters of Kohane and Arima but also of the kind of motivations that one can develop for wanting to enter the sport of cheerleading. While certainly impressing me, I have to say that one of the core reasons for me deciding to watch this series to the end was my curiosity of whether Kohane’s carefree personality will be able to endure the harsh training that comes from being a cheerleader.Taking place in a fictional town in modern day Japan the overall story of Anima yell follows the adventures of Kohane Hatoya a 14-year-old middle school student who despite her young age has already developed a reputation for wanting to be helpful and caring towards all that she encounters as she walks the path that is called life. In the past Kohane had a chance encounter with a middle school cheerleading squad whose performance and the effects that it had on the morale of the audience have left such a vivid impression on Kohane that it awakened within her a determined attempt to introduce the activity of cheer to not just her friends but to everyone that she meets as well. After entering middle school Kohane becomes determined to promote the activity of cheer to others but is dismayed to find that such a club does not exist in the school. Though disappointed at this Kohane doesn’t lose heart and after a chance encounter with the person that motivated her to take this path Kohane soon managed to fulfill her earnest desire of creating a cheer club and began her training to become a cheerleader aiming to bring joy and motivation to all that she meets. Though the training will be hard and the performances tiring to Kohane being able to bring joy to others and help motivate them in their actions is all the motivation that she needs to go about her duty. But Kohane will not be alone in this endeavor for joining her will be a host of characters whose reason for joining the club may be varied but all have a genuine desire to not just improve themselves but also through their hard work hope to bring joy to others and help bring light to their life. These include the quiet and curious Kotetsu, the kind but determined Arima, the perceptive and understanding Uki and the confident and proud Kana. Together these girls must not only learn to overcome their differences but also learn to bond with and forge friendships with each other as they try their utmost to use the skills and techniques that they have learned in their hard training to bring joy to others by giving off fantastic performances.KohaneKohane Hatoya portrayed by new seiyuu Yuka Ozaki is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 15-year-old middle school student Kohane on initial appearance can be seen to be a positive, cheerful and highly energetic girl who tries hard to be helpful to everyone that she meets in her daily life. A kind, caring and friendly person by nature Kohane while determined to help people can also be seen as being rather innocent with her actions as she in her quest to help those in need has a habit of reacting without thinking about the larger issues that may be in play. However, while it can be seen as a disadvantage, in this case, it can also be seen as a strength as well as Kohane thanks to her overactive nature can be relied upon to take up any job no matter how difficult it seems to be. This when combined with her determined nature allowed the members of the cheer association to garner up a solid reputation within weeks of their forming. This determination to fulfill the requests that are made upon the association by their clients is best seen in the myriad number of performances that Kohane and friends give in the course of the series. While Kohane may be prone to misunderstand instructions that often lead to accidents in practice I felt that this aspect of her actually made her more endearing as it showed that despite the complexity involved in training Kohane is still trying hard to take it all in and become an effective cheerleader.As the series goes on and Kohane’s personality is expanded upon Kohane’s personality gradually starts to change. In the beginning of the series while noted to be a positive, cheerful and energetic person by both her fellow classmates and her fellow club members Kohane was also noted for her rather short attention span which when combined with her clumsy nature served to make most of them doubt her commitment to the cause of becoming an effective cheerleader. As the series progresses it can be seen that Kohane while certainly clumsy and not having much focus actually tries hard to not just master all of the techniques and knowledge that is needed to be an effective cheerleader but also endeavor to overcome one of the main weaknesses that she has that prevents her from being one. This determination to master both the techniques and knowledge that she needs to be an effective cheerleader as well as to master her inner fear I felt was well done and contributed greatly to changing not just the opinions of others towards her and the club but also in proving to herself that she too is capable of providing motivation to others by acting out her dream role of being a cheerleader. While Kohane’s determination to become a cheerleader may have sounded like a temporary goal for her in the beginning I thought that Kohane’s gradual development from a fangirl that only knew the basics about the main roles that they have to actually becoming a cheerleader after not just seeing but also experiencing all the training that they have to go through was done really well within the series and I really enjoyed seeing Kohane put all of this knowledge into practice in her attempts to fulfill the requests that were made on the club. The character of Kohane I felt was an interesting character that demonstrated well that if you have a strong enough reason to motivate you no task and role is beyond you. I felt that her seiyuu Yuka Ozaki did an excellent job portraying the character of Kohane.Kotetsu TatejimaKotetsu Tatejima portrayed by Tomori Kusunoki of Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale online fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the cheer club. A 15-year-old girl and a classmate of Kohane Kotetsu on initial appearances can be seen to be a quiet, curious but nervous person by nature that tried hard to not stand out from the crowd. As a result of this quiet and nervous nature of hers, Kotetsu was also noted to have very low self-esteem and had great trouble in making her own views known to others as well as take the initiative on matters that genuinely interest her. This latter part is shown well in her struggle to both talk with Kohane and the members of the cheer club and her attempts to avoid them.  Despite her unwillingness to stand out from the crowd it’s surprising to note that Kotetsu possesses quite the talent for playing the piano and if she had overcome her nerves then such was her skill that she would have been able to make a career out of it. But alas this talent also proves to be a double-edged sword for her.As the series goes on and Kotetsu’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that Kotetsu’s nervousness and low self-esteem is a side effect of the skills that she had developed in playing the piano. As a result of this Kotetsu while proud of her skills at playing the piano also possesses a deep fear within her and is fearfully afraid that if she reaches out to others and tries to bond with them these would all someday vanish. However, after seeing the kind of activities and training that the cheer club takes part in and seeing the effects that this has on the audience these doubts of hers gradually starts to vanish and Kotetsu while still hesitant to some degree begins to slowly move out of her shell and try to bond with Kohane and the others. While still easily flustered and constantly worried about her performance Kotetsu as the series goes on gradually starts to change as a result of seeing the hard work that the other members of the club show as they not just perform for their clients but also train hard to prepare for them. While still quiet to some degree Kotetsu gradually begins to take a more active role within the club trying hard to contribute to not just the meetings that the members attend but also work hard during both practice and during the actual performances. While still nervous at performing in front of people to a degree Kotetsu rather than shrink back in fear as she would have done previously instead finds strength from her friendships with the members of the club and tries hard to not let them down.  The character of Kotetsu I felt was an interesting one that did well in showing the kind of struggles that schoolgirls her age may encounter as they come to grips with society. In particular, I feel that Kotetsu’s core struggle which was her problems with her nerves and self-esteem and her journey to overcome this by learning to not just bond with others but also develop her confidence of being able to perform on stage was used really well here. Seeing Kotetsu gradually develop in confidence as she deepens the bonds that she has with her friends and improve the self-confidence that she had lacked at the beginning I thought was nice to see especially the realization that she isn’t alone in this endeavor and that her friends are standing beside her.  I felt that her seiyuu Tomori Kusunoki did an excellent job at portraying the character of Kotetsu.KanaKana Ushiku portrayed by Haruka Shiraishi of Aico incarnation fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the cheer club. A 15-year-old middle school student and one of Arima’s classmates Kana on initial appearances can be seen to be a confident, perceptive and proud person by nature. However, while proud Kana at the beginning of the series was also noted to somewhat haughty in her attitude especially in the manner of which she interacted with Kohane and the members of the cheer club. This stems largely from the admiration and respect that she has towards Arima that comes from the shared past that existed between them in the past. As a result of this Kana’s relationship with Kohane and the members of the cheer, club was frosty at best. However, while her attitude can make it difficult to interact with her at times it can be seen that Kana is also someone that has a strong sense of responsibility and would not shirk from taking it when needed. This is best shown when she took Uki’s place during a performance to make up for her mistake.As the series goes on and Kana’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that beneath her proud nature Kana is someone that is caring by nature and does try to look out for others when she can. While her initial attitude towards Kohane and the rest of the club was harsh it can be seen that this was borne out of the respect and admiration that she has for Arima. As the series goes on and Kana begins to see the genuine fun and sense of happiness that Arima displays as she interacts with the members of the cheer club this antagonist attitude towards them gradually starts to soften. While still retaining the strong pride that defines her character Kana also starts to take steps to mend relations between her and the members of the club by joining them and showing them the skills that she managed to achieve in the past. While realizing that she cannot keep Arima to herself Kana also becomes determined to stand by her side and help bring the wishes of her into reality. As a character, I felt that Kana was an interesting one that did well to not only contrast the members of the club but also represent a link between Arima and the past and doing well to expand on her backstory. The gradual change of Kana’s attitude from a prideful and somewhat rude girl who was sure that she knew everything about her to one where she realized how little she knew as well as her attempts to mend relations between her and the members of the cheer club was something that I thought was done well with her character as it represented a significant shift in her personality as a result of the revelation that she experienced.UkiUki Sawatari portrayed by Mikako Izawa is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the cheer club. A 15-year-old middle school student and a classmate of Kohane Uki on initial appearances is seen to be an intelligent, kind and perceptive person by nature that acts somewhat as a foil for Kohane and trying hard to rein in some of her more over the top decisions. A childhood friend and the guardian of Kohane Uki, unlike her esteemed charge, was seen to be an understanding, caring and rational person that despite the trouble that she causes her is shown to care deeply about her well being which is indicative of the deep bonds that exist between them.As the series goes on and Uki’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that Uki also has struggles of her own that she tries hard to keep from her friends. At the beginning of the series, Uki was shown to have a deep fear of being seen as cute which I felt was rather amusing. Unlike Kohane and Arima at the beginning of the series, Uki was shown to not have much interest in cheerleading and indeed seemed rather averse to it. However, as the series goes on and Uki begins to see the kind of fun that Kohane and Arima have in both training and in actual performances this aspect of hers gradually starts to change. While initially hesitant about taking up the role due to the fact that she doesn’t want to be seen as cute and also because of how embarrassed the outfits are this aversion gradually vanishes as she comes to understand not just how much hard work goes into being a cheerleader but also how much of an effect it can have for those that are being cheered on. The character of Uki I felt was an interesting one that served well as one of the more rational members of the club and functioned well as a counterweight to Kohane’s mischief. In particular, I felt that her level-headed, and confident attitude contrasted rather well with her inner fear of being seen as cute by others.Hizume ArimaHizume Arima portrayed by new seiyuu Yuina Yamada is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the cheer club. A 15-year-old middle school student Hizume on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, kind and calm person who seemingly prefers to remain apart from her classmates. While an intelligent, level-headed and composed person that would no doubt be able to be popular if she made the attempt at the beginning of the series as a result of her wall Hizume was seen to be rather aloof for a mid-school girl and can be seen to be someone that trusts slowly and views others with something approaching wariness. As a result of this Hizume at the start was widely seen as being difficult to approach and as a result, had few if any friends within school until she met Kohane. While initially treating Kohane with an element of distrust thanks largely to Kohane’s persistent nature and her determined attempts to befriend her and learn about the sport of cheerleading this relationship gradually transformed into that of friendship something that had been utterly alien to Arima since her transfer. In the interactions that she has with Kohane, it can be seen that Hizume while a quiet person by nature was someone that was fast thinking, considerate and stoic and treated everything with utmost seriousness. This latter point is clearly shown in the training that she puts Kohane and the members of the cheer club through as here we can clearly see the care that she puts in as she carefully teaches them all the knowledge that they need to be effective cheerleaders. Despite her calm and composed nature, it can be surprising to see that Hizume can also get angry at times as well something that Kohane had the misfortune of encountering within the series.As the series goes on and Hizume’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen beneath her quiet and aloof personality Hizume is actually a kind and gentle person by nature that will help those that are in need when needed. While initially wary of Kohane as the series goes on it can be seen that Hizume gradually grows to respect her a great deal because unlike her, she is able to stay positive and cheerful at all times and indeed she began to believe that she’s a natural at being a cheerleader. As a result of this high opinion towards her Hizume as the series goes on develops something of a soft spot for her and while still training her carefully and taking great care to make sure she actually understands the topics she also tries to balance it out by regulating the tension that comes from training by telling jokes a side to her that I felt was cute. As the series goes on however it can be seen that this strong bond that she enjoys with Kohane also has a flip side as well as it can be seen that despite her composed nature Hizume is surprisingly vulnerable to being alone as a result of the incidents that took place in the past and when placed in a situation in which she believes she will be left alone she will enter a depressed state something that I felt was amusing but at the same time indicative of the importance of the bond that exists between Hizume and Kohane. The character of Hizume I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed. Her gradual evolution from a quiet, stoic and confident girl who pushed everyone away to someone that was not just kind, caring and attentive but more open with her feelings I thought was done really well. Seeing Hizume gradually overcome the trauma that she suffered in the past and learn to not just forge friendships with her classmates and members of the cheer club but also rediscover the joy that being a cheerleader can bring to her and to the people around her through their performances was something that I really enjoyed seeing. I felt that her seiyuu Yuina Yamada really did an excellent job portraying the character of Hizume.AMVAnimation wise I felt that the series made great use of bright and clear animation that did well in showing the types of locations that the cast visit. At the same time, I also thought that this also did well in enhancing the various performances that the cast gives over the course of the series. The character designs for the girls as well as the designs for the uniforms in which they wear both in terms of school uniforms as well as the cheerleader uniforms I thought were really well done with the character designs doing a great job of differentiating the girls from each other and the cheerleader outfits showing the unity of the club. The various performances that the cheer club gives over the course of the series I thought were done well and were helped greatly by the varied types of stunts that were added in.In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Jump Up Yell and One for All which was both sung by Kaminoki Koukou Cheering Bu a unit that consists of the series main seiyuu’s of Yuka Ozaki, Yuina Yamada, Mikako Izawa, Tomori Kusunoki and Haruka Shiraishi. Both of these songs I felt were pretty catchy ones and resonated well with the series main premise of bringing cheer to others. In terms of voice acting, I felt that each of the voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or support ones. In particular, I feel that Yuka Ozaki, Mikako Izawa, Yuina Yamada, Tomori Kusunoki, and Haruka Shiraishi deserve special praise as I feel that they all did a fantastic job portraying the characters of Kohane, Uki, Hizume, Kotetsu, and Kana respectively.Overall conclusionOverall Anima yell was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strengths, in my opinion being its interesting premise, story, well designed and developed characters, a great fusion of comedy and learning experiences and excellent chemistry between the main characters.The overall premise of the show I felt was an interesting one as cheerleading as a subject matter has not been featured in anime before and as a result, this opportunity to see the kind of challenges and training that potential cheerleaders have to go through and the motivations that fuel them was an interesting experience. While the act of learning how to become a cheerleader served as one of the main themes for the premise that wasn’t all as the series also skillfully paired it with the development of each of the main characters and the many struggles that each girl struggles with as they take up the mantle of being a cheerleader. The overall story that makes use of such an interesting premise I felt was also a highlight of the series and I felt that it did a great job at showing not just the kind of developments that each girl goes through as they not only see the kind of things that cheerleaders have to learn as part of their duties but also see how such experiences aid in helping each of the girls overcome the personal struggles that each was struggling with. This last part was helped greatly by the requests that the cheer team undertakes over the course of the series all of which was well thought out and featured a surprising variety among them. Seeing the girls not just work hard to bring joy to their audiences in the performances but also in the process seeing the kind of effects that it has on the girls themselves I thought demonstrated this concept well.Overall Anima yell was an impressive anime that made great use of a unique premise, a great story that skillfully paired the main theme with the development of the main cast and a great blend of comedy and drama elements that’s backed by solid and cute animation and a relatively new but talented voice cast. In terms of final score, I would say that Anima Yell deserves a final score of 8/10. and support others but also do so in the company of like-minded individuals who share her passion for wanting to help and motivate others through their actions as cheerleaders. The subject matter of cheerleading has always been a rather curious topic in my eyes as while I understand the core concepts behind it, I always thought that the effects that it will have on the ones being cheered on were only marginal due largely to the fact that its restricted to sports which relies more on the skill of the player more than anything. However, the insight into the kind of motivation that cheerleaders have for entering that sport as well as the kind of training that it requires to be good at it really helped change my mind. The first episode of the series I felt left a pretty good impression on me as it not only did well in introducing the main characters of Kohane and Arima but also of the kind of motivations that one can develop for wanting to enter the sport of cheerleading. While certainly impressing me, I have to say that one of the core reasons for me deciding to watch this series to the end was my curiosity of whether Kohane’s carefree personality will be able to endure the harsh training that comes from being a cheerleader.Taking place in a fictional town in modern day Japan the overall story of Anima yell follows the adventures of Kohane Hatoya a 14-year-old middle school student who despite her young age has already developed a reputation for wanting to be helpful and caring towards all that she encounters as she walks the path that is called life. In the past Kohane had a chance encounter with a middle school cheerleading squad whose performance and the effects that it had on the morale of the audience have left such a vivid impression on Kohane that it awakened within her a determined attempt to introduce the activity of cheer to not just her friends but to everyone that she meets as well. After entering middle school Kohane becomes determined to promote the activity of cheer to others but is dismayed to find that such a club does not exist in the school. Though disappointed at this Kohane doesn’t lose heart and after a chance encounter with the person that motivated her to take this path Kohane soon managed to fulfill her earnest desire of creating a cheer club and began her training to become a cheerleader aiming to bring joy and motivation to all that she meets. Though the training will be hard and the performances tiring to Kohane being able to bring joy to others and help motivate them in their actions is all the motivation that she needs to go about her duty. But Kohane will not be alone in this endeavor for joining her will be a host of characters whose reason for joining the club may be varied but all have a genuine desire to not just improve themselves but also through their hard work hope to bring joy to others and help bring light to their life. These include the quiet and curious Kotetsu, the kind but determined Arima, the perceptive and understanding Uki and the confident and proud Kana. Together these girls must not only learn to overcome their differences but also learn to bond with and forge friendships with each other as they try their utmost to use the skills and techniques that they have learned in their hard training to bring joy to others by giving off fantastic performances.KohaneKohane Hatoya portrayed by new seiyuu Yuka Ozaki is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 15-year-old middle school student Kohane on initial appearance can be seen to be a positive, cheerful and highly energetic girl who tries hard to be helpful to everyone that she meets in her daily life. A kind, caring and friendly person by nature Kohane while determined to help people can also be seen as being rather innocent with her actions as she in her quest to help those in need has a habit of reacting without thinking about the larger issues that may be in play. However, while it can be seen as a disadvantage, in this case, it can also be seen as a strength as well as Kohane thanks to her overactive nature can be relied upon to take up any job no matter how difficult it seems to be. This when combined with her determined nature allowed the members of the cheer association to garner up a solid reputation within weeks of their forming. This determination to fulfill the requests that are made upon the association by their clients is best seen in the myriad number of performances that Kohane and friends give in the course of the series. While Kohane may be prone to misunderstand instructions that often lead to accidents in practice I felt that this aspect of her actually made her more endearing as it showed that despite the complexity involved in training Kohane is still trying hard to take it all in and become an effective cheerleader.As the series goes on and Kohane’s personality is expanded upon Kohane’s personality gradually starts to change. In the beginning of the series while noted to be a positive, cheerful and energetic person by both her fellow classmates and her fellow club members Kohane was also noted for her rather short attention span which when combined with her clumsy nature served to make most of them doubt her commitment to the cause of becoming an effective cheerleader. As the series progresses it can be seen that Kohane while certainly clumsy and not having much focus actually tries hard to not just master all of the techniques and knowledge that is needed to be an effective cheerleader but also endeavor to overcome one of the main weaknesses that she has that prevents her from being one. This determination to master both the techniques and knowledge that she needs to be an effective cheerleader as well as to master her inner fear I felt was well done and contributed greatly to changing not just the opinions of others towards her and the club but also in proving to herself that she too is capable of providing motivation to others by acting out her dream role of being a cheerleader. While Kohane’s determination to become a cheerleader may have sounded like a temporary goal for her in the beginning I thought that Kohane’s gradual development from a fangirl that only knew the basics about the main roles that they have to actually becoming a cheerleader after not just seeing but also experiencing all the training that they have to go through was done really well within the series and I really enjoyed seeing Kohane put all of this knowledge into practice in her attempts to fulfill the requests that were made on the club. The character of Kohane I felt was an interesting character that demonstrated well that if you have a strong enough reason to motivate you no task and role is beyond you. I felt that her seiyuu Yuka Ozaki did an excellent job portraying the character of Kohane.Kotetsu TatejimaKotetsu Tatejima portrayed by Tomori Kusunoki of Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale online fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the cheer club. A 15-year-old girl and a classmate of Kohane Kotetsu on initial appearances can be seen to be a quiet, curious but nervous person by nature that tried hard to not stand out from the crowd. As a result of this quiet and nervous nature of hers, Kotetsu was also noted to have very low self-esteem and had great trouble in making her own views known to others as well as take the initiative on matters that genuinely interest her. This latter part is shown well in her struggle to both talk with Kohane and the members of the cheer club and her attempts to avoid them.  Despite her unwillingness to stand out from the crowd it’s surprising to note that Kotetsu possesses quite the talent for playing the piano and if she had overcome her nerves then such was her skill that she would have been able to make a career out of it. But alas this talent also proves to be a double-edged sword for her.As the series goes on and Kotetsu’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that Kotetsu’s nervousness and low self-esteem is a side effect of the skills that she had developed in playing the piano. As a result of this Kotetsu while proud of her skills at playing the piano also possesses a deep fear within her and is fearfully afraid that if she reaches out to others and tries to bond with them these would all someday vanish. However, after seeing the kind of activities and training that the cheer club takes part in and seeing the effects that this has on the audience these doubts of hers gradually starts to vanish and Kotetsu while still hesitant to some degree begins to slowly move out of her shell and try to bond with Kohane and the others. While still easily flustered and constantly worried about her performance Kotetsu as the series goes on gradually starts to change as a result of seeing the hard work that the other members of the club show as they not just perform for their clients but also train hard to prepare for them. While still quiet to some degree Kotetsu gradually begins to take a more active role within the club trying hard to contribute to not just the meetings that the members attend but also work hard during both practice and during the actual performances. While still nervous at performing in front of people to a degree Kotetsu rather than shrink back in fear as she would have done previously instead finds strength from her friendships with the members of the club and tries hard to not let them down.  The character of Kotetsu I felt was an interesting one that did well in showing the kind of struggles that schoolgirls her age may encounter as they come to grips with society. In particular, I feel that Kotetsu’s core struggle which was her problems with her nerves and self-esteem and her journey to overcome this by learning to not just bond with others but also develop her confidence of being able to perform on stage was used really well here. Seeing Kotetsu gradually develop in confidence as she deepens the bonds that she has with her friends and improve the self-confidence that she had lacked at the beginning I thought was nice to see especially the realization that she isn’t alone in this endeavor and that her friends are standing beside her.  I felt that her seiyuu Tomori Kusunoki did an excellent job at portraying the character of Kotetsu.KanaKana Ushiku portrayed by Haruka Shiraishi of Aico incarnation fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the cheer club. A 15-year-old middle school student and one of Arima’s classmates Kana on initial appearances can be seen to be a confident, perceptive and proud person by nature. However, while proud Kana at the beginning of the series was also noted to somewhat haughty in her attitude especially in the manner of which she interacted with Kohane and the members of the cheer club. This stems largely from the admiration and respect that she has towards Arima that comes from the shared past that existed between them in the past. As a result of this Kana’s relationship with Kohane and the members of the cheer, club was frosty at best. However, while her attitude can make it difficult to interact with her at times it can be seen that Kana is also someone that has a strong sense of responsibility and would not shirk from taking it when needed. This is best shown when she took Uki’s place during a performance to make up for her mistake.As the series goes on and Kana’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that beneath her proud nature Kana is someone that is caring by nature and does try to look out for others when she can. While her initial attitude towards Kohane and the rest of the club was harsh it can be seen that this was borne out of the respect and admiration that she has for Arima. As the series goes on and Kana begins to see the genuine fun and sense of happiness that Arima displays as she interacts with the members of the cheer club this antagonist attitude towards them gradually starts to soften. While still retaining the strong pride that defines her character Kana also starts to take steps to mend relations between her and the members of the club by joining them and showing them the skills that she managed to achieve in the past. While realizing that she cannot keep Arima to herself Kana also becomes determined to stand by her side and help bring the wishes of her into reality. As a character, I felt that Kana was an interesting one that did well to not only contrast the members of the club but also represent a link between Arima and the past and doing well to expand on her backstory. The gradual change of Kana’s attitude from a prideful and somewhat rude girl who was sure that she knew everything about her to one where she realized how little she knew as well as her attempts to mend relations between her and the members of the cheer club was something that I thought was done well with her character as it represented a significant shift in her personality as a result of the revelation that she experienced.UkiUki Sawatari portrayed by Mikako Izawa is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the cheer club. A 15-year-old middle school student and a classmate of Kohane Uki on initial appearances is seen to be an intelligent, kind and perceptive person by nature that acts somewhat as a foil for Kohane and trying hard to rein in some of her more over the top decisions. A childhood friend and the guardian of Kohane Uki, unlike her esteemed charge, was seen to be an understanding, caring and rational person that despite the trouble that she causes her is shown to care deeply about her well being which is indicative of the deep bonds that exist between them.As the series goes on and Uki’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that Uki also has struggles of her own that she tries hard to keep from her friends. At the beginning of the series, Uki was shown to have a deep fear of being seen as cute which I felt was rather amusing. Unlike Kohane and Arima at the beginning of the series, Uki was shown to not have much interest in cheerleading and indeed seemed rather averse to it. However, as the series goes on and Uki begins to see the kind of fun that Kohane and Arima have in both training and in actual performances this aspect of hers gradually starts to change. While initially hesitant about taking up the role due to the fact that she doesn’t want to be seen as cute and also because of how embarrassed the outfits are this aversion gradually vanishes as she comes to understand not just how much hard work goes into being a cheerleader but also how much of an effect it can have for those that are being cheered on. The character of Uki I felt was an interesting one that served well as one of the more rational members of the club and functioned well as a counterweight to Kohane’s mischief. In particular, I felt that her level-headed, and confident attitude contrasted rather well with her inner fear of being seen as cute by others.Hizume ArimaHizume Arima portrayed by new seiyuu Yuina Yamada is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the cheer club. A 15-year-old middle school student Hizume on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, kind and calm person who seemingly prefers to remain apart from her classmates. While an intelligent, level-headed and composed person that would no doubt be able to be popular if she made the attempt at the beginning of the series as a result of her wall Hizume was seen to be rather aloof for a mid-school girl and can be seen to be someone that trusts slowly and views others with something approaching wariness. As a result of this Hizume at the start was widely seen as being difficult to approach and as a result, had few if any friends within school until she met Kohane. While initially treating Kohane with an element of distrust thanks largely to Kohane’s persistent nature and her determined attempts to befriend her and learn about the sport of cheerleading this relationship gradually transformed into that of friendship something that had been utterly alien to Arima since her transfer. In the interactions that she has with Kohane, it can be seen that Hizume while a quiet person by nature was someone that was fast thinking, considerate and stoic and treated everything with utmost seriousness. This latter point is clearly shown in the training that she puts Kohane and the members of the cheer club through as here we can clearly see the care that she puts in as she carefully teaches them all the knowledge that they need to be effective cheerleaders. Despite her calm and composed nature, it can be surprising to see that Hizume can also get angry at times as well something that Kohane had the misfortune of encountering within the series.As the series goes on and Hizume’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen beneath her quiet and aloof personality Hizume is actually a kind and gentle person by nature that will help those that are in need when needed. While initially wary of Kohane as the series goes on it can be seen that Hizume gradually grows to respect her a great deal because unlike her, she is able to stay positive and cheerful at all times and indeed she began to believe that she’s a natural at being a cheerleader. As a result of this high opinion towards her Hizume as the series goes on develops something of a soft spot for her and while still training her carefully and taking great care to make sure she actually understands the topics she also tries to balance it out by regulating the tension that comes from training by telling jokes a side to her that I felt was cute. As the series goes on however it can be seen that this strong bond that she enjoys with Kohane also has a flip side as well as it can be seen that despite her composed nature Hizume is surprisingly vulnerable to being alone as a result of the incidents that took place in the past and when placed in a situation in which she believes she will be left alone she will enter a depressed state something that I felt was amusing but at the same time indicative of the importance of the bond that exists between Hizume and Kohane. The character of Hizume I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed. Her gradual evolution from a quiet, stoic and confident girl who pushed everyone away to someone that was not just kind, caring and attentive but more open with her feelings I thought was done really well. Seeing Hizume gradually overcome the trauma that she suffered in the past and learn to not just forge friendships with her classmates and members of the cheer club but also rediscover the joy that being a cheerleader can bring to her and to the people around her through their performances was something that I really enjoyed seeing. I felt that her seiyuu Yuina Yamada really did an excellent job portraying the character of Hizume.AMVAnimation wise I felt that the series made great use of bright and clear animation that did well in showing the types of locations that the cast visit. At the same time, I also thought that this also did well in enhancing the various performances that the cast gives over the course of the series. The character designs for the girls as well as the designs for the uniforms in which they wear both in terms of school uniforms as well as the cheerleader uniforms I thought were really well done with the character designs doing a great job of differentiating the girls from each other and the cheerleader outfits showing the unity of the club. The various performances that the cheer club gives over the course of the series I thought were done well and were helped greatly by the varied types of stunts that were added in.In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Jump Up Yell and One for All which was both sung by Kaminoki Koukou Cheering Bu a unit that consists of the series main seiyuu’s of Yuka Ozaki, Yuina Yamada, Mikako Izawa, Tomori Kusunoki and Haruka Shiraishi. Both of these songs I felt were pretty catchy ones and resonated well with the series main premise of bringing cheer to others. In terms of voice acting, I felt that each of the voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or support ones. In particular, I feel that Yuka Ozaki, Mikako Izawa, Yuina Yamada, Tomori Kusunoki, and Haruka Shiraishi deserve special praise as I feel that they all did a fantastic job portraying the characters of Kohane, Uki, Hizume, Kotetsu, and Kana respectively.Overall conclusionOverall Anima yell was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strengths, in my opinion being its interesting premise, story, well designed and developed characters, a great fusion of comedy and learning experiences and excellent chemistry between the main characters.The overall premise of the show I felt was an interesting one as cheerleading as a subject matter has not been featured in anime before and as a result, this opportunity to see the kind of challenges and training that potential cheerleaders have to go through and the motivations that fuel them was an interesting experience. While the act of learning how to become a cheerleader served as one of the main themes for the premise that wasn’t all as the series also skillfully paired it with the development of each of the main characters and the many struggles that each girl struggles with as they take up the mantle of being a cheerleader. The overall story that makes use of such an interesting premise I felt was also a highlight of the series and I felt that it did a great job at showing not just the kind of developments that each girl goes through as they not only see the kind of things that cheerleaders have to learn as part of their duties but also see how such experiences aid in helping each of the girls overcome the personal struggles that each was struggling with. This last part was helped greatly by the requests that the cheer team undertakes over the course of the series all of which was well thought out and featured a surprising variety among them. Seeing the girls not just work hard to bring joy to their audiences in the performances but also in the process seeing the kind of effects that it has on the girls themselves I thought demonstrated this concept well.Overall Anima yell was an impressive anime that made great use of a unique premise, a great story that skillfully paired the main theme with the development of the main cast and a great blend of comedy and drama elements that’s backed by solid and cute animation and a relatively new but talented voice cast. In terms of final score, I would say that Anima Yell deserves a final score of 8/10.', ""Occasionally you start to wonder whether everything that comes out today is just a rehash of something older, and to some degree, this is true. Most ideas that exist have already been used in the past, so for shows to break the mold they either have to do something very well, or do something niche enough to where people don't notice it as much. Anima Yell follows the latter by using cheerleading as the focus point, something I'm sure many of you haven't seen much of before. However, is a niche idea enough to make it stand out? Let's take a look.The first thing you'll...notice when watching Anima Yell is the obvious enthusiasm coming from the girls as they passionately cheer (or chair as they like to pronounce it) on. This energy level keeps the entire show fun and cheerful for the most part. Throughout the show, Kohane joins up with and cheers with other girls with similar ambitions to her. Throw in a beach ep after eight or so episodes and you've got yourself a classic cute girls doing cute things anime. Standard affairs such as them having to overcome slight hardships and a happy conclusion is contained within Anima Yell.The characters are one of my bigger gripes with this show; they feel very distant in a way. As the show progressed, even though they started to develop, I couldn’t help but feel a lack of connection to them, so their development payoff didn’t end up affecting me as much as it should have. They stay consistent for the entirety of the show though, so if you don't have the same problem as I had, you should like them a lot.As far as the art goes, it’s nice to look at and the girls are cute. The girls have funny facial expressions when in the middle of a skit of theirs, which adds to the overall cuteness. The sound is decent, fitting tracks play when they need to, and the voice acting is solid.Overall, Anima Yell tries to be different by using cheerleading as its selling point, but it succumbs to the average nature these shows tend to fall under after a while unless they excel in something, which I didn’t see Anima Yell doing. Nevertheless, it was a fun watch and I can recommend it to people who are a fan of cute girls doing cute things shows. notice when watching Anima Yell is the obvious enthusiasm coming from the girls as they passionately cheer (or chair as they like to pronounce it) on.

Well, not with one person by the name of shortie Hatoya Kohane, whom by the sight of cheerleading, mentions: ""I found something I wanna do, and that is called...CHAIR!"" Her childhood friend Uki Sawatari finds it a joke...""Chair"" (literally)?Eventually, this act of kindness (from Kohane) forwards that...joke up to experienced-but-frightening Hizume Arima, their own homeroom teacher Inukai (whom she obliges), shy-with-stage-fright(ened) Kotetsu Tatejima (or Kotecchan), and eventually Hizume\'s old cheerleading group-cum-crush-of-a-teammate Kana Ushiku (through Hizume\'s bidding). these 5 characters would form the Kaminoki Highschool Cheerleading Club, which is the ""create a high school club"" archetype, while maintaining the SoL-moe aspects throughout the series.So, similar to 4-koma manga adaptations is where there isn\'t really existence of a story (or plot if you will), because certain things will eventually loop the same old boredom once through, then recycles the jokes all over. But, what salvages the series are the characters, starting with the MC Kohane herself. She is kind, she sometimes act like a chirping bird due to the way she converses with the others, and at times attempt even the silliest jokes that turn to regret soon. But what Kohane has going for her is the never-say-die spirit, even when at the slightest amount of cheer for encouragement (mostly Basket-senpai for their school\'s girls\' basketball team). That\'s where Uki comes in as a mum-like feeling of watching over Kohane as a kid, and also guiding over others and learning cheerleading with everyone else. Not to mention the childhood friend love, it exists here as sort of means of infatuation between Uki\'s secret desires and the elusive Kohane.Kotetsu (or Kotecchan) is the shy, reserved one, but does to her excellence when alone. So it\'s no wonder when she shivers at the thoughts of presenting herself to others outside her comfort zone, and goes into her blank space of thought. But with bit by bit of push, she eventually makes it so that her fear of showcase doesn\'t hinder her emotions and in direct force, transforms her fear into fun.Hizume and Kana\'s on-the-rocks relationship is something worth to take note for. For one, when Hizume was pitched the cheerleading regime once again from hopeful Kohane, her dark past was something of a trauma that she could not shake off, due to insider competition and rivalry, so much so that when she left her old group, that burden of perfection was gone. But now with Kohane, Hizume realized that releasing her old strides and making them new with promises that assure the group can stay motivated, that is where she begins to rally the fun in cheerleading, and even rivals never denying the change that made her a better person (but she constantly fears Kohane\'s 2nd thoughts of leaving cheerleading, which are damn hilarious). As for Kana, let\'s just say that her boasting to Kohane and Co. for underestimating Hizume\'s greatness causes her to have an infatuation, the look-up-to model for perfection, that in turn, directs her love for Hizume in pure Yuri fashion (always nice and funny to see her blemish in hot-red-full facial expression in Hizume\'s presence). Other than agree-to-disagree, she coaches Kohane and others to do things correctly and give aspiration as means of encouragement.What I do like about the characters is that no matter their intriguing chemistry with one another, they constantly pull off funny and hilarious one-liners that just doesn\'t make any logical sense, even if there are a few in-betweens. Hizume\'s constant fear of casual backlash, Uki and Kana\'s obsession with their significant others, even Kotecchan\'s depressional moments, good stuff.Again, Doga Kobo\'s aesthetics always pull it off in the simplest but lavishing way possible, and it\'s nice to see good art and animation that blends very well in showcasing simple story and not-so-complex character designs and the like. A firm nice touch is what this series need, and it\'s more than enough. Same goes with the music, well, mostly cheerleading music (apart from OP and ED), which again is a nice compliment to the journey of these 5 characters which presents their form and conformance to one another, that despite their differences, they can trust one another and dance to the beat with synchronization.Somehow lately, CGDCT shows are quite mainstream now, but if you find yourself loving moe-blobs dancing and cheering around like nobody\'s business, then this show\'s for you.

Well, it’s about chair- I mean cheerleading, and it pulls off some very nice yuri relationships.Characters:Starting with the characters, unique to this series is that each character’s name features an animal pun. We have Kohane, the most energetic of the group, who loves helping others but is also afraid of heights, she’s represented as a bird, Uki, who acts tomboyish but secretly likes cute things (including Kohane), is represented by a monkey. Then you have Hizume, a former cheerleader who can be incredibly serious and dense, but her character does...a complete 180 when she starts cheerleading. She’s represented by a horse, and if you didn’t notice, yes, she wears a horseshoe as a hairclip. Kotetsu often says what’s on her mind without thinking and keeps an eye on her weight, she’s represented as a tiger. Finally, we have Kana, an initially shy girl who turns out to just really admire Hizume (seeing all the yuri yet?). She’s represented by a cow.Animation:So, you’ve got a wonderfully vibrant cast brought to life through Doga Kobo’s animation, the studio who have brought you shows such as the wonderful Yuru Yuri. The cheerleading sequences in this show are surprisingly well animated, although they generally don’t last very long. One thing I have to give credit to the animators for is that all these sequences are done traditionally. Yup, there’s no bad CG plaguing this show despite what you would think from a show involving dancing. The comedy in this series is generally visual comedy, so it helps that the animators know when to pull out all the stops, and also when to dial it back and simplify the characters a bit. One of the great jokes in the first episode is about Kohane mistaking the word cheer for chair. It’s stupid yes, but it works. The animal puns are followed through as well, with Kohane often going into a bird-like state.Music:Now, you can’t talk about cheerleading without talking about the music and man you’ve got some jams in here. I’d never really thought about cheerleading until watching this show, but you would think that any show involving dancing would need some convincing tunes, and Anima Yell has exactly that. Each insert song that accompanies a cheer performance is wonderfully energetic, and just like the cheerleaders, I wasn’t able to wipe the smile off of my face. Same goes for the opening and ending which I haven’t skipped once, unlike other shows. Also, in episode 5, there’s an excellent transition into the ending song, and that’s one of my favourite things in anime period. It works even better here because the song doesn’t just start up randomly, the characters are actually doing a cheer performance to the song.Yuri Respect:Yuri anime has been growing a lot in the industry, with shows like Bloom Into You and Citrus heavily focusing on Yuri, and shows like Comic Girls and even Darling in the Franxx having yuri subplots or recognizing yuri relationships. Anima Yell handles this topic extremely well, particularly in episode 3, and treats yuri relationships like a normal thing, as it should be. The characters are completely respectful upon hearing a fellow student has feelings for another girl because it’s just such an innate thing for them to do. Within the main cast it is laid out that Uki has feelings for Kohane, although this is used more for comedy, and that Kana has feelings for Hizume. This relationship is built up much more, with more than one episode focusing on it. Episode 10 in particular focuses the most heavily on the two’s relationship, depicting Kana’s shyness and over-the-top respect towards Hizume, and Hizume’s struggle to understand Kana’s feelings due to how Kana is unable to calm down around her. Unlike other shows that bait you with relationships that never go anywhere, Anima Yell is very clear in telling you, that yes, love is in the air, and whilst the story obviously isn’t going to go in any serious romantic direction, it’s nice that the characters feelings are taken seriously.Story/The Power of Cheer:After learning the basics and being prepared to cheer, the basic formula of the series follows the cast of characters as they accept cheerleading requests. These range from anything as informal as cheering one on to confess, to formal events such as a basketball or soccer game, or a stage performance. Anima Yell’s strength lies in the power of these performances. They turn out to have such a motivational an influential impact on those who are being cheered for, and in the basketball team’s case, the cheer is used as a good luck charm, as they request a cheer performance a second time due to the fact that they won their prior game after they had been cheered on. The club eventually cheers at Uki’s younger brother’s soccer game, changing his perception of the people who cheer him on in the process. The power of cheer affects not only those being cheered, but also the cheerleaders themselves. Kohane at first has trouble recruiting both Uki and Kotetsu into the club and Kana also initially refuses to join, but after they see the pure happiness and energy emanating from the cheer performances, they decide to join in the hopes that they too can experience that feeling.Conclusion:In a year full of Devilman Crybaby’s and Goblin Slayers’, as well the stresses of life in general, it’s nice to have a show to look forward to each week that just makes me inexplicably happy. I wasn’t expecting much from this show, and it’s really blown me away. It goes to show you really can’t judge an anime by how it looks or by its (criminally low) MAL score. It’s been a fantastic year for anime, with Violet Evergarden, A Place Further Than The Universe, Yuru Camp, and the previously mentioned Devilman Crybaby all not only being some of the best anime of the year, but some of the best anime I’ve ever seen. And while I wouldn’t say Anima Yell reaches the high’s of those shows, it was special to me in its own little way. I guess you could say I now know the power of chair - I mean cheer. a complete 180 when she starts cheerleading.

I’m all in, that’s something that hasn’t really been done in anime. Now that I’ve finished it, I can safely say that my excitement kind of paid off. While it wasn’t anything spectacular, it still hit all the beats of a good slice of life anime. There’s nothing to really dislike about it, but there’s nothing there to make you want to sing praise for it either. The characters were all likable, their designs were cute, their interactions were fun and enjoyable, and they all fit specific character...archetypes, which could be good or bad depending on how you look at it. On one end, you’ve seen these types of characters again and again in other slice of life anime. At the same time, it’s not like these character types are bad or unlikable, they just lack uniqueness. At the end of the day, Anima Yell is a very normal slice of life. It’s solid, but nothing you haven’t seen before unless you’re really into seeing some cheerleading. The practices and dance routines were interesting and something I wish they went a bit more into. There is ONE scene in particular that is worth seeing alone in episode 3. Despite not being a full Yuri or Yaoi anime, there was a genuine coming out scene from a character. Sadly, it’s never expanded upon or referenced again. In fact, the rest of the show uses Yuri as a comedic device instead of being straightforward and serious like it did once before. It doesn’t detract from the overall enjoyment, but I would’ve loved to see more of these moments. The art was good, but could’ve been better in certain scenes. The music is definitely a highlight for me, I don’t think I’ll stop listening to the opening and ending anytime soon. I’d also love to see a second season that expands on the cheerleading club with more advanced techniques. There’s a lot of hidden potential, but I do feel like this is a one and done anime seasonal. archetypes, which could be good or bad depending on how you look at it.

Kohane has always loved to help others out, the byproduct of that mindset is that she never strives to do things for herself. That all changed shortly before her start of high school upon seeing a middle school cheerleading team in action. Unfortunately, her new school doesn't have a cheer team, naturally this doesn't stop her from attempting to create her own. Her first task is to of course gather up some teammates, and what better person to start asking for help then one of the cheerleaders that was...on the very same team that inspired her in the first place. A surprisingly good moe comedy awaits you, ready to cheer you up in more ways than one!There were a number of cute girls doing cute things anime that I had tried and dropped or thought little of during 2018, Anima Yell! was one of them. 2018 was a very interesting year in that regard, because Just like Anima Yell! shows like Mitsuboshi Colors, Comic Girls, and my personal favorite Harukana Receive, are all anime I had little exceptions of. Only to then come crawling back to them and praising their entertainment value, followed by calling myself an idiot for not realizing sooner. Anima Yell! on that note has come back to haunt me here in 2020, and I'm more than okay with that, here's why.Anima Yell! is a really upbeat comedy, and promotes positivity at every opportunity through jokes and the subject of cheering itself in a way that feels genuine and humble. All the credit for accomplishing such a narrative goes to the characters, who are so fun and more layered than you'd expect from a moe comedy anime. When we are introduced to them, it's easy to view them as your typical collection of anime girl archetypes. The genki girl, the kuudere, the shy one, etc etc. To my surprise though, as Anima Yell! progressed, it used not just it's dialogue, but also it's humor to better demonstrate the character's overall personality. Some of those jokes also happen to be very self-aware and/or include rather blunt responses, expanding the character's nature and habits further. A surprising hint of depth to say the least, hilarious in practice for comedy to say the most! Aside from the great varied comedy, the cheerleading aspects are easy to understand, and that recurring theme of encouragement stays strong from beginning to end.Looking back, many other cute girls doing cute things anime are always fun to have around. At times though it's hard to find the ones out of the hundreds if not thousands that are worth our time. I myself, despite dedicating a lot of time to watch anime weekly, and being a fan of moe anime in general, find it hard to fit in that one extra anime in my queue. After all the time and effort though, it's 100% worth it.

This series is essentially YuruYuri but with cheer outfits on. For anyone looking for a series to get deeply invested in, you may be a little disappointed. Personally, I love these kinds of series but Anima Yell fell flat for me for a few reasons.1. The series is insanely trope driven, especially in terms of the types of characters included and how they’re developed (which isn’t much development at all compared to other sports series).2. The plot is a little all over the...place in terms of the overall goal the girls want to achieve. First, it was to cheer people on. After, it’s just to have fun. Then, it’s to cheer in a large competition (while having mediocre skills) just to prove to Arima’s team that she’s doing well after being kicked off. For the plot to be worthwhile, they should’ve took a page out of Sound! Euphonium’s book and strives for the contest from the get-go, even if it was to just have fun and not win or qualify for other competitions.3. I hoped that this series would start a conversation about realistic competitive cheer like Haikyuu does volleyball. However, this show is geared toward people who would otherwise have no interest in the sport and just want to see high school girls flounce around in small outfits as opposed to showing the greater sides of cheerleading- teamwork, sportsmanship, technique, history, etc. Obviously, none of this was to be expected but it would’ve been nice if the show took this turn.Overall, I honestly don’t think it’s a bad show. It serves the purpose of brightening the audiences mood and giving us cute characters to cheer on while they try their best at the sport of cheer. I think it’s a fun watch especially for people who like moe anime and I’d recommend it for that reason. Otherwise, it’s just alright and not really worth a rewatch in my opinion. I don’t think I’m going to read the manga because the anime didn’t advertise the story well enough but if you liked the characters and want to see what happens next, go for it. place in terms of the overall goal the girls want to achieve.

I was honestly certain they would find a way to have them end up practicing on the rooftop because there were no other rooms in the school and that the big cheer competition was going to be the catalyst for saving their school from closing due to declining birthrates. There's nothing bad about that, I enjoyed Love Live and the like, I just think it's funny to make the comparison.Cheerleading is something I've never understood very well, perhaps because I'm not a woman or perhaps because I've never played a competitive sport that had them. This...anime helped me gain a little bit more of an appreciation for the role Cheer can have in that environment, due in large part to the enthusiasm of the protagonist girl. The Japanese or at least the anime version of cheer is maybe a little different than the idea of it we have in the west, propped up by movies like Bring it On and it's dozens of sequels. I think Cheer can lose its focus very quickly when its starts being too focused on itself and less on the thing for which it is named, cheering people on. I think that's why the idea of cheer competitions confuses and infuriates me so, it's supposed to be something designed to motivate people through a challenging event or competition, not a competition in and of itself.This anime did a good job focusing on the positive aspects of Cheer and how it can be used to motivate and uplift.

Please don't read this until you've finished watching the series.)For those who've checked out what I'm into, I'm a big Precure fan and one of the seasons I've watched is the legendary Hugtto Precure. The main character for that show is designed with the cheerleader motif in mind and would become one of my favorite characters.So, when I saw another show that's ALL about Cheerleading, I'm all for it. And wow, I was not expecting this.Anima Yell looks like just another slice of life anime to the average viewer, but personally, this anime was great! For once, an anime that...I was pumped up for until the very end, haven't had that feeling in a long time.Story: 9/10The story of Anima Yell is quite basic and in typical slice of life fashion. Our protagonist, Kohane, one day saw the amazing sight that is cheerleading. She was immediately hooked and wanted to start her own Cheer Club at school. Over time, she recruited our other parts of the cast whom she'd become great friends with- Hizume, Uki, Kotetsu, and Kana. They have some good ol' cheerleading fun and learning more about it in the process.I've had my share of slice of life animes in the past, but most of them feel as if you don't really have to watch every episode to watch any given episode. But with Anima Yell, it felt different. Maybe it's just I've been learning more about how anime works in general in the past year, but Anima Yell is structured in a way that gives quite decent development to the crew and to each character, allowing the story to be considerably consistent and more enjoyable since I get to watch the cast grow, both as individuals and as a cheerleading squad.I like how the series tried to break stereotypes people have about cheerleading. For example, both Uki and Kotetsu originally found cheerleading embarrassing (And I do admit it kind of is, given I have been forced to do it before,) but after Kohane and Hizume show them the ropes and what it's all about, they were hooked. It sort of gives off a vibe that some things aren't as stupid as you think, like how in episode 9, where Uki's brother had the impression originally when his sister had to cheer for him, and ending up being more passive about it.The progression of the plot was very gradual and interconnecting, something that I have rarely seen in the genre thus far, making Anima Yell very intriguing and great to watch for me.Art: 9/10The animation style for Anima Yell was nothing new, really, but the way they animate each character was important as this anime is quite an active one for obvious reasons, and they nailed it in my opinion. They also took the time to compliment the many comedic jokes and scenes throughout the series with hilarious facial expressions and special effects which I think add a nice touch.Sound: 10/10In most animes, I don't really know how to judge this category, but this time I know from the get-go to give this a 10 because I can't believe the producers managed to make so many cool and catchy tunes just for the sake of the several performances in the show! It really livens up the atmosphere and even gets viewers like me going.Character: 8.5/10To start, we are of course going to talk about Kohane. Kohane is a bright girl with a great passion for helping others and, of course, cheering them on. Throughout the series, Kohane never deviated from her cute cheery self unless the plot provides her the situation to, but outside of that, she learns throughout the series what it truly means to be a cheerleader and what makes the role so special.Hizume is up next and it almost feels like, toward the end of the series, she became the main character as we start connecting her to her past head-on. She was afraid of her obliviousness in terms of socializing with others causing her to become isolated, and she has been criticized for it. But in working together with Kohane and the others, she learned to open herself up to both others and cheer as a whole.Uki, Kotetsu, and Kana joined midway, and they showed interesting growth with themselves by joining the Cheer Club as well, breaking their initial skepticism with cheer (Uki and Kotetsu), and getting to bond with those she holds dear (Kana.) You can start to see a trend that the show wants to help each character build a learning curve for cheer and for their personal growth, and I think this show did a really great job on it. If anything, I wish Anima Yell could be a 24 episode series instead of 12.The only nitpick I have is related to that last part- The story can get a bit too focussed on Kohane and Hizume's development. If we had more to see for the other three, maybe what I just mentioned could give off an even greater result!Enjoyment: 10/10As a fan of the magical girl titan that is Precure, I enjoy flashy things and things that could get me bouncing in my chair.This anime does that, and my expectations were blown away just from the first episode. The story is very colorful and filled with life, and is one of the few shows I've seen so far except Precure, where I would be pumped up and excited to continue watching from where I left off, for the entire season.Any story that could get me excited about it from beginning to end is a good story in my book, that's what I think.The show also had great humor and lovely character interactions that make my heart very warm. I enjoyed the show from beginning to end, and couldn't stop smiling. (Unless the show throws out some awkward situation. That I can't help with.)Overall: 9.1/10Anima Yell is a story filled with wonder. I could watch it while I'm bored with nothing to do, or I could watch it if I ever need something to cheer myself up. That's what the series wants to do- To give cheers to all its fans. And with all that said, I think this anime is something that I feel like living through all over again anytime in the future.Of course, please don't just take my word for it, go see what others think too! (This is the first time I reviewed an anime that is not Precure, after all.)

It sort of gives off a vibe that some things aren't as stupid as you think, like how in episode 9, where Uki's brother had the impression originally when his sister had to cheer for him, and ending up being more passive about it.The progression of the plot was very gradual and interconnecting, something that I have rarely seen in the genre thus far, making Anima Yell very intriguing and great to watch for me.Art: 9/10The animation style for Anima Yell was nothing new, really, but the way they animate each character was important as this anime is quite an active one for obvious reasons, and they nailed it in my opinion. They also took the time to compliment the many comedic jokes and scenes throughout the series with hilarious facial expressions and special effects which I think add a nice touch.Sound: 10/10In most animes, I don't really know how to judge this category, but this time I know from the get-go to give this a 10 because I can't believe the producers managed to make so many cool and catchy tunes just for the sake of the several performances in the show! It really livens up the atmosphere and even gets viewers like me going.Character: 8.5/10To start, we are of course going to talk about Kohane. Kohane is a bright girl with a great passion for helping others and, of course, cheering them on. Throughout the series, Kohane never deviated from her cute cheery self unless the plot provides her the situation to, but outside of that, she learns throughout the series what it truly means to be a cheerleader and what makes the role so special.Hizume is up next and it almost feels like, toward the end of the series, she became the main character as we start connecting her to her past head-on. She was afraid of her obliviousness in terms of socializing with others causing her to become isolated, and she has been criticized for it. But in working together with Kohane and the others, she learned to open herself up to both others and cheer as a whole.Uki, Kotetsu, and Kana joined midway, and they showed interesting growth with themselves by joining the Cheer Club as well, breaking their initial skepticism with cheer (Uki and Kotetsu), and getting to bond with those she holds dear (Kana.) You can start to see a trend that the show wants to help each character build a learning curve for cheer and for their personal growth, and I think this show did a really great job on it. If anything, I wish Anima Yell could be a 24 episode series instead of 12.The only nitpick I have is related to that last part- The story can get a bit too focussed on Kohane and Hizume's development. If we had more to see for the other three, maybe what I just mentioned could give off an even greater result!Enjoyment: 10/10As a fan of the magical girl titan that is Precure, I enjoy flashy things and things that could get me bouncing in my chair.This anime does that, and my expectations were blown away just from the first episode. The story is very colorful and filled with life, and is one of the few shows I've seen so far except Precure, where I would be pumped up and excited to continue watching from where I left off, for the entire season.Any story that could get me excited about it from beginning to end is a good story in my book, that's what I think.The show also had great humor and lovely character interactions that make my heart very warm. I enjoyed the show from beginning to end, and couldn't stop smiling. (Unless the show throws out some awkward situation. That I can't help with.)Overall: 9.1/10Anima Yell is a story filled with wonder. I could watch it while I'm bored with nothing to do, or I could watch it if I ever need something to cheer myself up. That's what the series wants to do- To give cheers to all its fans. And with all that said, I think this anime is something that I feel like living through all over again anytime in the future.Of course, please don't just take my word for it, go see what others think too! (This is the first time I reviewed an anime that is not Precure, after all.)"", 'Do you like CGDCT? You\'ll probably find this to be fine. It\'s quite the orthodox show, applying archetypal, but I suppose, likeable characters? The series tells, and never shows. You figure out the MC\'s personality based off of other\'s comments. ""She really loves to put others before herself, and she needs to do something!!"" This gets rehashed and said a million times in the first episode alone. If this isn\'t lazy storytelling, I don\'t know what is. What about the mysterious, but cool beauty that has a painful past? I could go on, but it\'s basically the same tropes done and executed at a standard...level. level.', ""Such a cute anime! Short enough to be consumed in a single day. Also has quite a few lesbian undertones, if you're looking for something with wlw themes.Story: 5/10As is customary for slice of life shows, there isn't really a story present. The show mostly just follows the girls through various cheerleading requests with little tying them together. Still, not having to follow a story lends well to this type of show because you get to just turn your brain off and watch cute anime girls do cute anime girl things.Art: 7/10Very typical anime art style, but it's cute and colourful which suits the show...well! It's very pleasant to look at.Sound: 8/10I love cheerleading music so much. It's always so upbeat. The rest of the sound has a very bubbly feel, which really suits the feel of the show. I don't normally pay attention to sound, but the sound in this show scratched my brain just right.Character: 9/10None of the characters are ground breaking, and they all tend to fit into certain slice of life or sports anime tropes. You've got the bubbly MC, her serious best friend, the stoic dark-haired prodigy, the shy newcomer and the tsundere-type. There's also a large cast of supporting characters, but they're not worth mentioning because they don't get much development. However, as I've said in other reviews, having tropey characters isn't necessarily a bad thing. I found them to be enjoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 10/10Very cute and enjoyable.

I never imagined that an anime centered around cheerleaders could be so incredibly entertaining.The characters are fantastic, with Kohane stealing the show with her comedic brilliance. This anime delivered numerous moments of pure joy and uncontrollable laughter.Witnessing the championship unfold was intriguing, although it unfolded primarily in the final episode. This leaves room for excitement about a potential upcoming season where the team dedicates themselves to securing championships. Who knows what the future holds? However, even with the setback of being eliminated in the preliminary rounds, what...truly matters is the enjoyment factor.On the whole, this anime is a delightful and heartwarming experience that I wholeheartedly recommend.---------Pt/BrDemorei um pouco para terminar esse anime, mas foi extremamente divertido. Nunca achei que um anime sobre líderes de torcida seria tão divertido quanto foi.Ótimas personagens, mas principalmente a Kohane, ela é hilária. Esse anime me proporcionou diversos momentos de alegria e risada.Foi interessante ver um campeonato acontecendo, porém foi apenas no ultimo episódio. Isso gera um ânimo para uma eventual próxima temporada onde o time começa a se focar em ganhar campeonatos? Quem sabe.

Blassreiter,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3407/Blassreiter,"[""Right, this is my second review. I'll try to control myself on length this time. Take note that I'll update the review at the end of the series. Additionally, no summary will be provided. This anime's main page has a brilliant one already. So, off we go.Story (8/10):The story extremely interesting in the sense that it evolves from small incidents to macrosmic effects. In the first few episodes, one couldn't really tell where the story was going, who the main characters were and just what was going to happen next. However, slowly, but surely the dam broke and plot flowed to swamp us. We are...placed in an out of Japan setting with the familiar plot of demons rising to attack humanity, but suddenly we can't be sure whether that's all there is to it. I look forward to seeing it grow as the recent episodes seem to hold an extremely promising future for this series.Art (7/10):I never really like Gonzo's animation. Sure its pretty, but somehow there are some times you wish it didn't do that. The artwork of Blassreiter is clear. The settings are quite well done, living up to standards of being set in a small German town. The Demoniacs, however, really don't fit to my taste. The designs look good, until they're in action. Well, most of the protagonist designs look good (Examples include Gerd and Joseph) But,(spoiler) Malek's demoniac armor looks really....ugh...at times (end of spoiler). Nevertheless, the action scenes are generally well done, if a bit confused. Most of you'll enjoy it, but don't expect Last Exile or Gankutsuou level animation or artwork.Sound (6/10):Perhaps the weakest point in the series. Both OP and ED are really good, particularly the ED (first time, I ever downloaded an anime ending of Gendou). However, the soundtrack in between isn't really significant. You're usually too engrossed in the storyline to even notice the sound. Vocal acting meets most of the standards of the series, but ain't to my taste. It might be to yours, though.Character (10/10):This series's characters are hands down one of the most realistic and powerfully depicted personalities this season. You may think I'm lying, but I'm not. You will learn to HATE Jill Hoffman. You will feel Malek's pain even though you may not have lost someone close to you. You may find yourself questioning Gerd's intentions and wondering just who the hell Beatrice is. Development of characters is rapid, but also realistic. There personalities may not be thoroughly distinct, but you will find that they may be like one of you: A sister in confusion about her brother's actions or a disillusioned man trying revive his hero's faith or a lone wolf watching from afar, living day by day for revenge. Sounds far fetched, but see for yourself.Enjoyment (8/10):Blassreiter managed to keep me awake until 3 am (where I'm living anyway) every Saturday or Sunday, just to get a chance to see a new episode. I am enjoying the series quite a bit. It beats your general run-of-the-mill shonen that gets over 200 episodes, but barely achieves anything in that time a million times over. It's sad that this must end at 24 episodes, but then again, maybe its one of those animes that have to end there. Those are generally the good ones.Overall (8/10):Whew, I thought this was going to short. I'm glad if you've read this far. My advice to you is, don't look at the top anime score. That's what people thought when they watched the first couple episodes. This is a heavily underrated series and I hope that this review convinces you to watch it too.

Thank you for reading."", 'Blassreiter is not among the highest rated animes on MAL, and for a reason.But that reason has nothing to do with any supposed inferiority of the series, nor is it about any glaring fault in the show - Blassreiter is a good anime. It\'s also understandable why many haven\'t considered it great, or not even all that good.The biggest fault in the show is it\'s seemingly lack of any clear direction or plot. In the first few episodes we see a bunch of these weird, robot-ish, human-like creatures running around causing havoc, including turning a motorcyclist idol into one of them. Along with the infected...Gerd Frentzen the other main cast of Amanda Werner, a hot pinkette with a cool and professional attitude, her hot-headed partner Hermann Saltza, and the dark and mysterious Joseph Jobson, whose unimpressive screen time at the beginning of the show wouldn\'t at first suggest him to be a main cast member.As many of you may have already figured out from the short descriptions above, a cast of unique and compelling characters is not one of the show\'s merits. Amanda is again one of your typical strong female-type of character whose usually calm and collected at her job, but, oh so surprisingly, is capable of showing a good bout of defiance and passion when it comes to her loved ones and what she sees as just. Hermann is almost her polar opposite, doing his job with personal feelings constantly at the surface and always, quite loudly if I may add, questioning his orders when they contradict his sense of right and wrong. Joseph is there to heavily add on the show\'s gloom and doom with his brooding air of a misunderstood hero who secretly fights for the good guys despite everyone thinking of him as a villain.A good portion of the show\'s dark air stems from the characters\' feel of guilt and responsibility over, well, various things. Amanda feels she hasn\'t been quite the big sis she should\'ve been for her adopted brother Malek (the angsty crybaby), Sasha for creating some pretty damn advanced technology that just got used the wrong way, Joseph for pretty much everything, and so on. The constant, over-the-top blaming for one\'s self over matters beyond their control is nothing new in fictional characters who\'re supposed to appear heroic; an aspect that sure as hell isn\'t any less annoying in Blassreiter. On more than one occasion I found myself cringing at the characters\' angsty antics, which did little to help the show\'s enjoyability.""Mature storyline"", boasts the show\'s summary. As the show goes on it becomes evident that by mature, they mean shitty. Not the storyline itself, but rather the pasts and circumstances of each character. Shit seems to be the share of especially the poor and foreign folk in the show\'s fictional German society. We see this through Malek and Joseph, mainly, who both have been the target of some truly hideous cruelty for no other reason than that they\'re not as well-off as the people around \'em. The series does make a powerful attempt at gaining the viewers\' sympathies for the characters by showing us in great detail and abundance the torment they\'ve been through. Unfortunately some of this effort was lost on me, for the ""harsh reality"" card being played as clumsily as it sometimes was in this anime has a way of making me laugh rather than weep. Sure the poor have always been looked down on at some level, but come on. A poor kid getting beat up by a rich one time and again to ensure his church keeps getting donations, and in a modern society no less? Okay.In the same vein of showing how crappy the world is for some, Blassreiter seems to take every chance it gets to jab at Christianity. Shit happens, people pray, and God does nothing. Blah blah blah. Never think of me as a vigorously religious person, but to me nowadays trashing religion is like most of black metal. Immature and silly. Perhaps I\'m just too sensitive about the Japanese trying to depict the western way of life or something.So why, after all this bitching, do I think Blassreiter was good, you ask? Short answer: it just was. The longer one? Well...On the occasions I actually bothered to tune it on (I\'m a rather lazy anime watcher nowadays), Blassreiter kept me entertained. It wasn\'t an anime that rushed through its plot 1000000mph, but let the events roll at their own pace. It\'s not like I would especially mind fast-paced anime (TTGL ftw), but I do tend to appreciate it when a story takes its time to tell whatever story it has to tell. And though Blassreiter went through its story at a moderate pace, it didn\'t exactly lapse into sluggishness either; there was something going on in each episode to keep the viewer on their toes. Also the complete turnover the series takes around halfway through was, though sudden, an interesting twist.The artwork of Blassreiter is also worth mentioning here on the plus-side, even with the fact that most anime is a parade of eye-candy. The machinery depicted in the anime is generally really neat looking, though flying motorbikes and such quirks tended to appear more amusing than cool. A big hand to the character designs as well; I could stare at Amanda\'s shiny green eyes and luscious lips forever. Also, I hope you like cleavage shots. You\'ll be having a hard time watching Blassreiter if you don\'t.Though I spent a good while beating on the show\'s forced realism with cruelty, the aspect does accentuate the fact that Blassreiter is not your heap of moe-blob BS. Which is always a plus in my book. And no matter how much I\'d think that gluttoning with harshness is just plain lame, a scene of a poor boy confessing crimes he didn\'t do with his hand on a bible while the true culprits sneer around him did clutch my innards. Always a good sign for an anime to be able to do that.So yeah. Wanna see a solid, serious anime that\'ll keep you entertained till the end but with which you don\'t have to fear it\'ll shatter the earth below you? Grab Blassreiter.

Grab Blassreiter.', 'All right, this is to be my first anime review for myanimelist.net so inexperience is to be expected:)Blassreiter or ""Pale rider"" is newest addition to list of Gonzo\'s works (done in collaboration with Nitro+). Elements of contemporary anime are clearly shown in this series like extensive use of CGI, futuristic setting focusing on technological advances and moral/ethic consequences arising from it degrading humanity in process. This could be summarised as the main theme of series around which plot revolves. Classical motives of redemption, friendship, duty, loyalty and love are also present in the plot driving character actions in certain way or other.Story in short revolves...around nanomachine virus spreading across Germany infecting humans which after infection become Demoniacs-demon like creatures stripped of humanity. Although premise isn\'t new or epochal it is executed great with many twists and turns keeping tension high. Only a few anime could do that ""I must watch next episode...NOW!"" feeling. Melancholy, dramatic, painful and tragic elements are indeed intensive spicing things up and stirring viewers emotions. Great!Now onto characters! They are truly the stars of this show! I humbly think that everyone could find some character he could establish a bond with! Driven by their inner thoughts, wishes and their past they are diverese but also sharing common concepts like grief, burden and friendship. All I can say further without spoiling something is: superb!Art, although debated is IMHO a milestone! Great presentation, action sequences, camera angles, design of characters and tech stuff like vehicles, mechas... Demoniacs are done entirely in CG which is quite nice giving their details and crazy fight scenes it couldn\'t be pulled off by a conventional animation! Now i think also it is a matter of taste, especially art&design (some love e. g. Miyazaki or some other style and some don\'t but it has no implications on quality of that style whatsoever). Quality in Blassreiter is evident! Excellent!Music. Highest grades here also! Strong soundtrack was a pure enjoyment beginning from opening themes (""Unripe Hero"" was one of the best I\'ve heard in a long time) and great moving battle action backgrounds, through character themes (Xargin theme\'s also one of best ever composed, heights achieved by  the ones of like Aeris theme from FFVII). ""Wish for the stars"" was beautiful and fitted perfectly! Overall: great!In the end...enjoyment review. While not a masterpiece (although short by a little in my standards) this series won\'t disappoint! Fans of quality action SF anime will (should) be pleased as I think will majority who decides to dive into Blassreiter\'s world! As far as I\'m concerned Blassreiter will always be high in my book being one of my top 10!Thank you for reading! around nanomachine virus spreading across Germany infecting humans which after infection become Demoniacs-demon like creatures stripped of humanity.

As far as I\'m concerned Blassreiter will always be high in my book being one of my top 10!Thank you for reading!', ""Right, Blassreiter.I didn't really expect much going into this, and I have to say that was a good thing.Don't take me wrong, there were a few times where this show actually shined, but aside from those times, it felt mostly boring.Many characters felt somewhat predictable (with the exception of Amanda, but that's mostly because after a bit of development she remains the same for the entirety of the show...).As a positive note, they did focus on many characters (which is nice if you like a diverse cast).While watching the episodes, you'll soon notice something quite annoying, which may be a minor point to some of...you, but it may also make you *sigh* because there's no point to it.There are some intervals during each half of an episode, it's just a splash scene with some of the characters and some sound, however, the music played here is bad (specially during the 2nd half of the series), and this also servers no point. It's just a useless gimmick.Something I thought I should say - I usually have a very high tolerance to the shows I pick to watch, even if they are bad, and I usually marathon them. However, with Blassreiter, I found myself wanting to do other things and simply not come back to it.One last thing before I continue, there is gore on this anime, and the general theme is grim.Now that I got that out of the way, let me go over some specific points (art, sound etc).-Sound: 4/10The music is mediocre IMO. The OP and ED are forgettable, and I found myself skipping over them after the very first episode. This is not to mention the 2nd OP/ED, which are even worse. Sound effects are okaysih, nothing to praise or hate. I have to mention yet again the cringey splash screen which you'll be seeing every episode (not too bad during the first 12 episodes, but gets ridiculous later on).Art: 5/10This is the first thing you'll notice, and if you're like me, this will bother you a lot -BAD CGI. Now, when I say bad, it's really bad. The art assets animated through CGI seem like something you'd see in a 1998's movie or so, it's glaring and annoying. Of course, art isn't the end all be all of anime, many more seasoned anime viewers know this, but for a show that doesn't really deliver anything special on many fronts, this is a big problem. I'd much have preferred traditional animation here but ah well... The only good thing I can say about the art is what I already said earlier, there's very diverse set of characters, so you'll most likely find one you can identify with.Story: 7/10I'm giving this a 7/10 for creativity, the premise is something I hadn't seen before, even though you'll find some cliches here and there. The problem is, there isn't anything new in the way it was executed, in fact it was quite predictable who would turn out to be a bad/good guy, when someone would sacrifice him/herself etc.Also - the ending felt rushed in some ways, but I don't want to go into much detail because I'm not really sure how to convey what I mean with this without spoiling it, so I'll leave it at that.Enjoyment: 5/10I didn't enjoy this that much. It was so-so, but there were times when I wasn't really sure I could endure it for much longer, and I just wanted to play games/study do something else instead of watching it.-Overall, this wasn't horrible, but it also wasn't good. Which is why I'm giving it an overall score of 5/10.If you have nothing else to watch, then maybe you should pick this up, given that you are willing to deal with bad soundtracks/CGI/gore, if not, then don't even come close to this one.I hope this review was helpful to you, thanks for reading, and sorry about any grammar mistakes! you, but it may also make you *sigh* because there's no point to it.There are some intervals during each half of an episode, it's just a splash scene with some of the characters and some sound, however, the music played here is bad (specially during the 2nd half of the series), and this also servers no point. It's just a useless gimmick.Something I thought I should say - I usually have a very high tolerance to the shows I pick to watch, even if they are bad, and I usually marathon them. However, with Blassreiter, I found myself wanting to do other things and simply not come back to it.One last thing before I continue, there is gore on this anime, and the general theme is grim.Now that I got that out of the way, let me go over some specific points (art, sound etc).-Sound: 4/10The music is mediocre IMO. The OP and ED are forgettable, and I found myself skipping over them after the very first episode. This is not to mention the 2nd OP/ED, which are even worse. Sound effects are okaysih, nothing to praise or hate.

The only complaint I had was that in the beginning it was hard to discover who the main characters were, I cant say anything about this without spoiling it though so that concludes story. There are also many twists, turns, and &quot;Oh Snap&quot; moments to be had in the story of Blassreiter.Art 8/10: While the CGI could be better it shouldnt be the deciding point of wether the anime is good. CGI helped the anime alot since it allowed the action to...be more fast-paced and allowed them to put in very nice camera angles. The traditional animation is also very good the scenes are well animated.Sound 7/10: The songs for the openings and endings are some of the greatest i have heard. SFX is also very good, the voice acting is so superb that if you listened to it without watching you might think they were real.But the series is lacking very much on battle-style music during the show.While the dramatic music is very good there is little music for action sequences and if there are they are very short-lived.Character 10/10: You couldn't ask for a more realistic cast of characters. From the troubled,sorrowful lives of some to the happy lives of others, every character reacts to their situation as a real person would. They also express their emotions as a human would. It also realistically displays how some cant see past the wall of differences and come together (Spoiler) such as how citizens view others who are poor or suffering as &quot;outcasts&quot; and tend to beat them. Such is the case for Malek, Johann, and Joseph (in his past) (spoiler end)Enjoyment 8/10: While the series is going through the plot at a moderate pace the placement of Story-focused and Action-focused keeps it from getting too repetitive. I recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys action, demon, and story-driven showsOverall 9/10: While most people think the pilot episode wasnt the best way to kick off (overuse of CGI) you should watch about up to episode 7 before you make decision. While it does have its flaws, Blassreiter is trying new things such as: being a demonic force spreaded by (SPOILER          ) nanomachines,mixing action,demons,some religious references (nothing too offensive), and mecha into one they are also releasing it on streaming websites (such as Youtube, Crunchyroll, and BostTV) at the same time as the Japanese release. So thats my review, once the series is finished i will be able to make a better review.

Blassreiter is a severely underrated anime,my recommendation is to give this anime a chance.Personally, i enjoyed this a lot. If you want an anime that's different this is the one for you.Story (9/10):The story extremely interesting in the sense that it evolves from small incidents to macrosmic effects. In the first few episodes, one couldn't really tell where the story was going, who the main characters were and just what was going to happen next. However, slowly, but surely the dam broke and plot flowed to swamp us. We are...placed in an out of Japan setting with the familiar plot of demons rising to attack humanity, but suddenly we can't be sure whether that's all there is to it. I look forward to seeing it grow as the recent episodes seem to hold an extremely promising future for this series.Art (9/10):I really like Gonzo's animation. The artwork of Blassreiter is clear. The settings are quite well done, living up to standards of being set in a small German town. The action scenes are generally well done, if a bit confused. Most of you'll enjoy it, but don't expect Last Exile or Gankutsuou level animation or artwork.Sound (10/10):Perhaps the weakest point in the series. Both OP and ED are really good, particularly the ED (first time, I ever downloaded an anime ending of Gendou).Character (10/10):This series's characters are hands down one of the most realistic and powerfully depicted personalities this season. You may think I'm lying, but I'm not. You will learn to HATE Jill Hoffman. You will feel Malek's pain even though you may not have lost someone close to you. You may find yourself questioning Gerd's intentions and wondering just who the hell Beatrice is. Development of characters is rapid, but also realistic. There personalities may not be thoroughly distinct, but you will find that they may be like one of you: A sister in confusion about her brother's actions or a disillusioned man trying revive his hero's faith or a lone wolf watching from afar, living day by day for revenge. Sounds far fetched, but see for yourself.Enjoyment (9/10):Blassreiter managed to keep me awake until 3 am (where I'm living anyway) every Saturday or Sunday, just to get a chance to see a new episode. I am enjoying the series quite a bit. It beats your general run-of-the-mill shonen that gets over 200 episodes, but barely achieves anything in that time a million times over. It's sad that this must end at 24 episodes, but then again, maybe its one of those animes that have to end there. Those are generally the good ones.Overall (9/10):Whew, I thought this was going to short. I'm glad if you've read this far. My advice to you is, don't look at the top anime score. That's what people thought when they watched the first couple episodes. This is a heavily underrated series and I hope that this review convinces you to watch it too.

Thank you for reading."", 'Alright, I don\'t normally write reviews, but I\'ve got a lot to say about Blassreiter.Blassreiter was one of the worst anime I\'ve ever seen in my lifetime. But let me give it the benefit of the doubt and start off with what\'s good about it. (TL;DR below)Pros: The story pacing overall is fairly decent. Not too slow, not too fast. The story itself has nothing wrong with it, in fact it\'s not half bad. They don\'t try to pump it full of different genre\'s that don\'t mix.Now onto the cons!Cons: This is the type of anime that tries waaaay too hard to make you feel...sad about a character\'s death despite the fact the character is so underdeveloped they only count as a supporting character because of the extra screen time.The character development overall is some of the worst I\'ve ever seen. Bringing up plot devices and killing them off in the same episode in order to force development on the main characters.Speaking of the main characters. Think you know who they are? Well you don\'t. Because for half the anime the main character acts more like a side character. The biggest plot twist of the entire anime is finding out who the actual main character is.Have you ever watched an anime where they bring up suspense devices that hold no meaning to you? Well I hope you like anime like that because this one has a ton of it. You\'ll be hearing lines like ""Oh no it\'s the X377. How dare they use that? if we don\'t stop it we\'re all doomed!"". And the name X377 holds more meaning that some of the suspense devices they use in this anime.Do you like cliche character architypes? Well I sure hope so because every single one of these characters could be the face of the word ""cliche"". Want more proof? How about Villains who yell ""How dare you!"" or ""This is impossible!"" when they\'re losing?Have you ever watched an anime where the flashbacks/backstories are more interesting than the main story? You haven\'t? Well you will when you watch Blassreiter.How about Bullsh*t endings that try to force closure in without you noticing how dumb it is? Hope you like that, because that\'s what you\'re gonna get at the end.Do you like watching anime where halfway through about 5 characters you don\'t know show up and the badguy is suddenly an ally and with NO explanation at all? Well if you do, then you should watch Blassreiter, you\'ll love it.Despite the endless amounts of skin tight mecha suits, big boobs, that one nude scene, and tons of blood gore and action... It was extremely boring and hard to watch. I mean some of the action was good, but after it was over you were still bored.____________________________________________________________So to summarize and for those TL;DR readers out there... This anime is so bad that not only is it the first anime I considered below 5/10 in rating, but it\'s also so bad that it convinced me to write and entire review about it.

Do not watch.', 'Blassreiter is a seinen sci-fi anime that deals with the concept of hatred & justice but viewers should be warned of the heavy usage of cgi. If that doesn\'t bother you then the series itself is a good story but has some minor problems.The story of Blassreiter takes place in Germany where these creatures known as Amalgams aka Demoniacs other better understood as ""robot zombies"" due to them being formed out of corpses & can merge with technology. To stop this threat the XAT are formed to combat these Amalgams, eventually the story moves towards this battle of good evil with the XAT members being...the main characters however, that\'s when this story comes across some pacing issues.For starters, the anime rotates its lead every 4-5 episodes as characters tend to die then we follow our next lead etc. This is good as no character is safe from plot armor, however it doesn\'t flow neatly at times. One reason is the character Joseph who by ep 13& 14 we learn of his backstory whose heavily involved with the series villain, Xargin. Because of this odd choice, Joseph who should be the center lead makes random appearances in the beginning of the series & even after his story is revealed he doesn\'t become the main focus. While the other XAT members are alright characters to follow, it does feel strange that the villain\'s main nemesis is hardly given the spotlight.Another problem with the show is its symbolism to religion can feel forced at times. Much of the shows deals with revenge & various depressing topics such as suicides & abuse which often creates these revenge situations. It makes sense to speak of religious topics in this situation but some scenes feel forced & preachy.Overall, the anime itself is interesting as it does take advantage of its sci-fi mythology of Amalgams & certain characters do feel believable. This is one of those rare series that takes itself very seriously to the point where it can feel depressing at times. Other highlights of this series is its OST being performed by Norihiko Hibino (Metal Gear Solid series) & some of the writing is done by Gen Urobuchi (Fate/Zero, Madoka Magica, Phantom Requiem for the Phantom). Blassreiter is unique sci-fi diving into humanity\'s scorn for destruction, however it would have been better if certain characters got more appearances in the series or a more steady pace in story telling. the main characters however, that\'s when this story comes across some pacing issues.For starters, the anime rotates its lead every 4-5 episodes as characters tend to die then we follow our next lead etc. This is good as no character is safe from plot armor, however it doesn\'t flow neatly at times.

A Japanese anime NOT set in Japan,  that kills off its first protagonist in the first few episodes and nukes all the second protag's shit, with zombie-like creatures that merge with vehicles, nano-machines and mechs galore, Sounds like a action junkies' dream come true right? Well if you agreed you'd be all wrong and a bag of chips when it comes to Blassreiter, but more on that later. For now lets start with the positive.The animation is great, the 3D sections are done with a similar rendering method to MMD but its been so finely tuned, that shifting from...the hand/digitally drawn artwork to 3D isn't jarring, and keeping 3D things 3D without looking out of place even when the scene is mostly 2D must have been rather difficult to pull off. S-Rank Animation!The world is fairly well fleshed out, with the tech making sense in its own mythos, a subtle Angels vs Daemons aesthetic contrasted well by a morally grey world where Angels will make Monsters from Humans because it suits them. A-Rank World Building.The sound is good, with only some minor clipping when things explode that isn't severely noticeable unless you're using a theater sound system with the sound jacked up, otherwise the sound isn't particularly special, a lot of the effects get recycled with only just enough variance in tune to avoid getting stale. all the voices sound like they've been recorded with bog standard condenser microphones, which sometimes produce contrasting audio to the sound effects, which sound like they where recorded in differently sized rooms to the voices, but all these things are minor problems only audiophiles will be bugged by in any major capacity. B-Rank SoundAt the 13th episode or so I gave up. Reviewer Integrity be damned. I was SO BORED of the constant whinging these people do when they aren't busy having the shit kicked out of them or yelling for various uninteresting reasons, and the Story does NOTHING of interest with the great world its built, leaving it all bland enough that mid-episode I started playing Monster Strike out of boredom.

Are you able to atone for all the sins you have done?“No matter how cruel the world is, life has meaning” – Joseph JobsonI know it is strange to start a review by giving the significance of this anime and the message it leaves behind, but I believe it is something in life that is kept quiet about.Suicide…Self Sacrifice… Submission… Never Lose Hope... Never Give UpWhile watching this anime, which I highly recommend, not for the artwork but for the story think about change. Think about the importance of human life and being alive...each day. Think about why you were born into this world. Do not ever forget that you having a meaning in this world and that you are important.The name of the anime “Blassreiter” which is a German word that translates to “Pale Rider” is a very unique name. Many anime’s are either named in a very simple matter… for instance “Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo” which translates to “The Pet Girl of Sakurasou” which literally translates word for word what the anime is about, or you have anime’s like “K” where there is no solid meaning but you can pull hints from like the names of each episodes or maybe translating it as “Kings” by pulling information from the songs used, and what the anime is about. But Blassreiter is different, I am sure many of you don’t know what a “Pale Rider” is as I was unsure, but upon investigation it means “a horseman” and in those terms I understand fully why the anime was named that, but I will not explain why because it does contain a huge spoiler. You will have to watch the show to find out what the true meaning of this show is.Within watching the first 2 episodes of this anime, I was already confused. They throw all these terms at you like “Amalgams” and “Demoniacs” and to be honest after those first 2 episodes I just became hooked. The first day I watched 16 episodes, and the next day I watched the remaining 8 episodes. I do sometimes manage to go through other series at this accelerated pace, but most of the time I will end up skimming some of the episodes and skipping over unnecessary parts that are just their as fillers, this show however I managed to practically watch the whole show through.Story:At first I thought the story had no clear direction in which it was going, but after a while you figure out generally what is going on. The story takes place in a “fictional Germany” and research is conducted to create almost like “perfect humans” but for war.  There are 2 distinctive sides in this show, a military group called XAT, which is trying to stop the outbreak of Demoniacs, and then the other side which I assumed you have figured out.Characters:There are 4 main characters in this show that I will be talking about.Gerd Frentzen: aka “Champ”. He is the undefeated racing champion and seen as an idol by many.Joseph Jobson: He is a unique character whom you probably will not understand his intentions until later on in the story, and you can decide if what he was doing was correct. In my opinion, aside from being one of the most important characters he is also one that teaches you the most important lessons.Hermann Saltza: He is an officer of XAT and also Gerds best friend who sticks up for him no matter what.Amanda Werner: This is the character that so highly resembles Mayor Lil from “Ergo Proxy”. Almost everything about them is identical and being able to see a character like this just put such a big smile to my face. Aside from that, Amanda is an officer of XAT and is partnered up with Hermann.This is one of the shows where character development was huge and all the main characters had such a big impact. Many shows I watch, you see main characters who get tons of screen time but you wonder what their real purpose is, and after finishing the show you realize… nothing they just needed to add someone as a filler almost. Those types of shows tend to sadden me the most because they always had the potential to be able to shine. This show I became absolutely attached to all the main characters but if I had to choose one it would have to be “Amanda Werner”. There is no other obvious choice for “me” because of how similar she is to Mayor Lil. Mayor Lil is by far one of my favorite characters, from her personality, all the way to her looks and design. So me becoming attached to Amanda Werner was no big surprise after all.Artwork:I have to be brutally honest I am normally not super critical about artwork, but the artwork in this show was absolutely horrendous. Maybe horrendous is a little bit over kill but I am sure you understand, it just angered me to the bottom of my soul. To have such an amazing story and such amazing characters, for it to just be killed by the artwork is just such a shame.  What I hated the most out of all was just the design for Demoniacs, they just looked horrible and the designs were very repetitive throughout each Demoniac. Aside from that factor, the artwork for the rest was okay. Also going based on the battle scenes everything just happened too fast. I don’t mean “fast” as in they could have added some episodes in here and there for more development I mean it just hurt my eyes to watch the fights. Everything was just all over the place and it was hard to follow what was actually going on, and the next thing you know someone was dead and you missed everything. I cannot stand shows that do this; to me it is just like people who are too lazy to throw their trash away. This show was almost too lazy to go into more detailed battle scenes and just threw it together like a mosh pit.Sound: OP/EDI am just going to go through some of the songs used in this anime, starting from the end.The Last ED “Sweet Lies” – by Itou Kanako which is only used in the last episode (24) was by far the best one of this anime. The setting and mood that this anime left you in alongside then hearing this song was just soothing. This song was so perfectly chosen. Honestly when I was finished watching the show and then this song came on at the end it literally brought me on the verge of tears (I don’t tend to cry during animes but I get that watery feeling like when you are about to cry). This song just made me unbelievable happy and left such an amazing feeling that I was speechless at the end. Not many anime’s are able to evoke such an emotion. Even as I am listening to the full song while writing this (and I just finished the anime about 20-30 minutes ago) I feel as though I just finished watching it seconds ago and I am back in that moment.The second OP “Unripe Hero” – by Minami Kuribayashi was just absolutely stunning. The lyrics of the song are soo fitting towards this anime. In General, OP/ED tend to be chosen very well, but in this particular case the Last ED was by far the best.I can probably spend quite a bit of time on the songs used in this anime but the last one I want to talk about is the 3rd ED “A Wish for the Stars” – by Itou Kanako. Using the same artist again is something animes tend to do a lot of, and honestly it is something that leaves a really good impression. Now this song was honestly just as good as the Last ED but I cannot say it was because even though it had the same tone, the mellowness and serenity left inside the melody… I am going to try my best to put what is inside my head into words but I doubt it is going to sound 100% accurate. By using this song for about half the anime, I loved it but it just cannot beat using a song once for an ending that practically fits perfectly together like a puzzle. By all means thought this song was amazing. This show really kicked off using such amazing songs for the OP and especially for the ED!Enjoyment:There is really no place to start other than saying “if I managed to watch this in 2 days, it must mean something”.  Like I wish I was able to take what is inside my brain right now and write it in words, but we all know that is nearly impossible so we have to compensate. On an enjoyment rate of 1-10, this scale cannot be used for how good it was, it is just over and beyond amazing. At first I was not expecting much because this show just threw soo much at you as I stated above but in the end I feel as if it managed to really kick through and leave such a big impact. Like honestly I have watched over 150 animes and I am going to say this is going be one of the few that I re-watch, I am not going to say like re-watch from episode 1 to episode 24 every minute, but I will probably re-watch at least 12 of the episodes fully, that is just how amazing of a show this was. The thing is like the suspense that this show left from watching the first time is something that I almost see as nearly impossible, to be able to evoke the exact same feelings at the same level as watching it the first time. Now I could be wrong but when I do re-watch this show I am going to probably skim through many of the episodes but will watch some of them thoroughly again.Just as a little added special, I noticed that the top 2 recommended animes were Blood+ and Darker than Black. I am not going to say those are bad choices but in my opinion they are not correct. By far the most relevant anime relating to Blassreiter is Ergo Proxy. Once I was around episode 5 of Blassreiter that show just kept on popping up into my head and of how similar it was. I would highly highly HIGHLY recommend watching Ergo Proxy. The second show which I would recommend is Ga-Rei: Zero. I am not sure how to explain it but the stories are very similar, about self sacrifice and being able to protect what you love. Also Ga-Rei had one of the most amazing scenes on the final episode. What made me think of this show, was not only the story but the final episode. Like I can just remember vividly the music in the background which was soo similar to this its unbelievable. When I watched Ga-Rei I didn’t think I would be able to find an ending scene like that, but Blassreiter has managed to do it.Well that was a very long review I just wrote… If you have any questions or comments please just send me a pm or write on my wall, I will try my best to answer to the best of my power! I will accept any type of feedback on to how to better improve my reviews, but please be constructive as well! Please also check my other reviews. Also if you want me to do a review on a certain show (whether I watched it yet or not) I will try to prioritize. Also check out my blog post (http://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=723679), to help me with future reviews! each day. Think about why you were born into this world. Do not ever forget that you having a meaning in this world and that you are important.The name of the anime “Blassreiter” which is a German word that translates to “Pale Rider” is a very unique name. Many anime’s are either named in a very simple matter… for instance “Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo” which translates to “The Pet Girl of Sakurasou” which literally translates word for word what the anime is about, or you have anime’s like “K” where there is no solid meaning but you can pull hints from like the names of each episodes or maybe translating it as “Kings” by pulling information from the songs used, and what the anime is about. But Blassreiter is different, I am sure many of you don’t know what a “Pale Rider” is as I was unsure, but upon investigation it means “a horseman” and in those terms I understand fully why the anime was named that, but I will not explain why because it does contain a huge spoiler. You will have to watch the show to find out what the true meaning of this show is.Within watching the first 2 episodes of this anime, I was already confused. They throw all these terms at you like “Amalgams” and “Demoniacs” and to be honest after those first 2 episodes I just became hooked. The first day I watched 16 episodes, and the next day I watched the remaining 8 episodes. I do sometimes manage to go through other series at this accelerated pace, but most of the time I will end up skimming some of the episodes and skipping over unnecessary parts that are just their as fillers, this show however I managed to practically watch the whole show through.Story:At first I thought the story had no clear direction in which it was going, but after a while you figure out generally what is going on. The story takes place in a “fictional Germany” and research is conducted to create almost like “perfect humans” but for war.  There are 2 distinctive sides in this show, a military group called XAT, which is trying to stop the outbreak of Demoniacs, and then the other side which I assumed you have figured out.Characters:There are 4 main characters in this show that I will be talking about.Gerd Frentzen: aka “Champ”. He is the undefeated racing champion and seen as an idol by many.Joseph Jobson: He is a unique character whom you probably will not understand his intentions until later on in the story, and you can decide if what he was doing was correct. In my opinion, aside from being one of the most important characters he is also one that teaches you the most important lessons.Hermann Saltza: He is an officer of XAT and also Gerds best friend who sticks up for him no matter what.Amanda Werner: This is the character that so highly resembles Mayor Lil from “Ergo Proxy”. Almost everything about them is identical and being able to see a character like this just put such a big smile to my face. Aside from that, Amanda is an officer of XAT and is partnered up with Hermann.This is one of the shows where character development was huge and all the main characters had such a big impact. Many shows I watch, you see main characters who get tons of screen time but you wonder what their real purpose is, and after finishing the show you realize… nothing they just needed to add someone as a filler almost. Those types of shows tend to sadden me the most because they always had the potential to be able to shine. This show I became absolutely attached to all the main characters but if I had to choose one it would have to be “Amanda Werner”. There is no other obvious choice for “me” because of how similar she is to Mayor Lil. Mayor Lil is by far one of my favorite characters, from her personality, all the way to her looks and design. So me becoming attached to Amanda Werner was no big surprise after all.Artwork:I have to be brutally honest I am normally not super critical about artwork, but the artwork in this show was absolutely horrendous. Maybe horrendous is a little bit over kill but I am sure you understand, it just angered me to the bottom of my soul. To have such an amazing story and such amazing characters, for it to just be killed by the artwork is just such a shame.  What I hated the most out of all was just the design for Demoniacs, they just looked horrible and the designs were very repetitive throughout each Demoniac. Aside from that factor, the artwork for the rest was okay. Also going based on the battle scenes everything just happened too fast. I don’t mean “fast” as in they could have added some episodes in here and there for more development I mean it just hurt my eyes to watch the fights.

Then the story develops into a full on apocalypse type scenario; while our main amalgam/human characters are fighting against the demoniacs for the safety of the townspeople, society still fears and detests them, and the issue of the demoniacs/amalgams even shows...to become a global worry. I absolutely love the incorporation of the media aspect in this show, it adds to the mass hysteria/impending apocalypse vibe and makes the story seem all the more real.I think one of the best things this show has going for it is it's originality, now I'm not saying the plot is extremely original for an anime, but it has so many different aspects to play to so many different people's interests. It's got military, mecha, racing, apocalypse, inhuman creatures/ superhumans. I think the most original thing about this show though, is the design for the amalgams, being they're 'cybernetic' creatures, humans that can transform into these agile, armored, superhuman creatures; that the armor of the amalgams isn't separate super armor, it's part of that person, and everyone's (Joseph, Gerd, Malik, and Hermann) amalgam forms are different and unique to that character's personality.Honestly, I really enjoyed this show, and I feel like I liked it more after I had been finished with it and continued to think about it's story and characters.

Also battling the threat is a mysterious young man named Joseph who also wields the power to turn into a Demoniac, though he is able to maintain his normal mental state unlike those who become infected by the strain. The series is divided up into several arcs exploring how several characters in the series become affected by the Demoniac strain and what they seek to gain through utilizing...its power. Behind the scenes, a couple mysterious individuals are exploiting the strain and personal traumas of those milking the power of a Demoniac for their personal gain.For the most part, Blassreiter is solid with developing its plot and characters in terms of exploring how certain characters become affected by the Demoniac strain, the causes of it and why said characters desire to utilize its power. A number of the characters in the series have some rather tragic back stories that serve to drive their decisions with utilizing their newly found power as a Demoniac. The negatives of having such power are explored as some abuse it for their personal gain without realizing the moral ramifications of their actions while others are driven to madness by it as such where they struggle to maintain their humanity or lose it all together. The series slowly reveals the origins of the Demoniac threat and what connection Joseph has to them as he is seemingly acquainted with the main enemy threat responsible for spreading its plague among the German populace.Still, the series isn't without its faults. The series can at points get a bit heavy handed with how it portrays its drama and religious themes. In terms of drama, Blassreiter can be quite melodramatic with depicting the developments of its cast and said drama can get overbearing as such where one may have trouble caring seriously for it at points, most notably with aspects of Joseph and Malek's backgrounds. Also, the show's attempts at religious symbolism feel really forced as attempts to milk Christian iconography and Bible verses to try expressing something meaningful come across more awkward than natural. Beyond this, the show isn't really offering much new with its premise as aspects to its storytelling have been milked in one form or another in sci-fi, action and drama titles. Also, do be warned this baby can get rather graphic with its content as there is a high death count in Blassreiter and characters tend to die in some rather bloody and messy ways at points.Visually, the show is rather pleasing on the eyes for the most part. Character and scenery designs sport subdued color tones and a good amount of visual detail that do well at complimenting the dark and gritty mood that Blassreiter wishes to show off. The visual highlight to the series comes in the form of the Demoniacs and any mecha from human forces being utilized for battle scenes. While the 3D CG animation used in their rendering sticks out like a sore thumb with the regular animation, it is still nicely rendered and onscreen action with mecha and Demoniacs is fluid and intense, making this a nice feast for the eyes with action anime fans.While having its issues and not really breaking new ground, Blassreiter is still a decent time-killer with what it has to offer up for a dark action-drama. While not up to par with Bokurano and Gankutsuou, Blassreiter is still one of the more decent offerings made by Gonzo. its power.

This is portrayed like something you'd read in a history book. All sides are shown, but some characters (the main characters, obviously) are more important/favored and thus have more screen time.

You can\'t ""rate"" ANYTHING by any normal means or scale. Numbers don\'t equate to the resulting emotions and internal questions created by art. As men create art, the only way to fully and truly comprehend it and ""rate"" it is to watch it for yourself. This anime especially fits that. The best works of art are the ones that half of people say they hate, and half say they undyingly worship. This is one of those...works.

He is a writer for many Japanese visual novels, light novels, and of course anime and his signature style of writing has a dark style, nihilistic themes, and tragic plot twists, earning him the fan nickname ""Urobutcher."" He did work for the visual novel software company NitroPlus, which most of the shows he worked on were involved also, but for this title we’re reviewing today, this is an original work and collaboration of NitroPlus and Studio Gonzo.The story is set in a fictional Germany and centers on...the outbreak of biomechanical creatures called ""Demoniacs"", who rise from corpses and attack people savagely.[4] The Demoniacs have the ability to merge with most technology including cars and motorcycles, not only gaining control of them but also enhancing their performance greatly. Against them is a group of people known as XAT (Xenogenesis Assault Team) who police these Demoniacs in an attempt to keep the peace and discover the reasons for the ""Demoniac"" change. All the while, a number of human-turned-Demoniacs appear. Some use their powers for good, others for evil. One will rise above all other Demoniacs to become known as the ""Blassreiter”Once going into the show, I was a bit confused going into the plot as it first felt like a motorcycle sports show, although most viewers got confused from that first episode (and by now, people will notice Urobuchi’s way of tricking the audience within the first few episodes of an anime and then it’ll show its true self) and the first opening thinking it was like that but after that gimmick was done, it did play out like a sci-fi action show, set in a foreign land (well, Germany) with some really depressing dark tones (such as dealing with bullying because of one character origins’ and nationality, i.e. being an outsider and questioning why no one will stand for justice and possibly their god as well – yeah, the show does slap around religion to an extent), especially going through most of the main characters’ flashback stories and what’s going on with them now. The story goes through character arcs with the main ones, in order being Gerd Frentzen, Malek Werner, Joesph Jobson, Hermann Saltza, and Amanda Werner.Some of the characters written does provide some mystery and interesting character development but the thing is it is only the ones with the character arcs….well, all except Gerd as he doesn’t really stick in the show for that long, at least as an important part. Other minor characters doesn’t really stick out much as some of them are mostly red shirts that are obviously going to die. Joesph did provide mystery in his character, Malek did made me feel sympathetic to what’s he going through, Amanda is that character that tries to keep it all together, Hermann is the hot-headed character who will do anything to save the people he know and Gerd…..is that unlucky guy who got it troubling when the show started.As for the animation, Gonzo learned some things about the CGI usage in their show and how it can sometimes stands out as blocky and weird and not in the best of shape. However, in comparison to Gonzo’s other anime works, this one is slightly above average. The artwork is also fine with its setting being in Germany and when going into a flashback, it really compliments the setting very nicely.For the music, I really didn’t felt anything from the score or any of the opening and ending songs were standing out. They were some standard j-rock openings and calm, serene and relaxing j-pop songs and the score were just standard action anime music.For the FUNimation dub, someone’s vocal range showed in this anime and I’m proud to say that Todd Haberkorn was the most improved in this show, mainly because if you watched the shows he’s in (Hetalia, Sgt. Frog, even Shiki), the nasally whiny voice of his always appeared and it’s not like I don’t like it. It’s good, particularly in Sgt. Frog but in here and more recently as he does English dubs in L.A., he shows more of a deep yet smooth voice, which he does very well. Hell, you’ll forget that this is a guy who voiced a green space alien frog. (Yes, I like Sgt. Frog. So what?) As for the other cast members, Travis Willingham was alright, Jamie Marchi was good and Micah Soulsod (or the VA people mistaken for Johnny Yong Bosch a few times) was decent as well.FINAL VERDICT: This show is hard to understand at first but if you’re not that confused, you might get into it although I know some of you won’t. I would recommend this show to you, but I would say that this really acquires your attention or read ahead before going into the show (just don’t go for spoilers if you want to experience it as a surprise). the outbreak of biomechanical creatures called ""Demoniacs"", who rise from corpses and attack people savagely.[4] The Demoniacs have the ability to merge with most technology including cars and motorcycles, not only gaining control of them but also enhancing their performance greatly. Against them is a group of people known as XAT (Xenogenesis Assault Team) who police these Demoniacs in an attempt to keep the peace and discover the reasons for the ""Demoniac"" change. All the while, a number of human-turned-Demoniacs appear. Some use their powers for good, others for evil. One will rise above all other Demoniacs to become known as the ""Blassreiter”Once going into the show, I was a bit confused going into the plot as it first felt like a motorcycle sports show, although most viewers got confused from that first episode (and by now, people will notice Urobuchi’s way of tricking the audience within the first few episodes of an anime and then it’ll show its true self) and the first opening thinking it was like that but after that gimmick was done, it did play out like a sci-fi action show, set in a foreign land (well, Germany) with some really depressing dark tones (such as dealing with bullying because of one character origins’ and nationality, i.e. being an outsider and questioning why no one will stand for justice and possibly their god as well – yeah, the show does slap around religion to an extent), especially going through most of the main characters’ flashback stories and what’s going on with them now. The story goes through character arcs with the main ones, in order being Gerd Frentzen, Malek Werner, Joesph Jobson, Hermann Saltza, and Amanda Werner.Some of the characters written does provide some mystery and interesting character development but the thing is it is only the ones with the character arcs….well, all except Gerd as he doesn’t really stick in the show for that long, at least as an important part. Other minor characters doesn’t really stick out much as some of them are mostly red shirts that are obviously going to die. Joesph did provide mystery in his character, Malek did made me feel sympathetic to what’s he going through, Amanda is that character that tries to keep it all together, Hermann is the hot-headed character who will do anything to save the people he know and Gerd…..is that unlucky guy who got it troubling when the show started.As for the animation, Gonzo learned some things about the CGI usage in their show and how it can sometimes stands out as blocky and weird and not in the best of shape.

That’s our MC ladies and gentlemen, who, in spite of repeating that statement on multiple occasions, just couldn’t seem to find meaning in anything he did.Story: 3The base story of Blassreiter is actually an interesting idea at its core. A mysterious infestation, an organization out to stop it, and a mysterious main character who is using this evil power to reign in justice; yes, it’s no Shakespearean work, but I think your common anime viewer would raise a brow of...interest. However, that number I’ve put in the top right corner of my review says something went wrong somewhere and I’m here to tell you all about it.The most immediate complaint is that this anime is a directionless fiend; ever feeding off of your desire for the story to start making sense.  You’ll wait, and wait, and wait, and by god, you’ll keep on waiting till the show displays “The End” to you. For those who waited like me, I’m sorry for your loss. I’ll petition for a statue to be created in memorial to our time wasted.  ~R.I.P. Gone but not forgotten~The next big issue is undoubtedly the overwhelming amount of self-pity that every character has, which is nothing these other reviews haven’t complained about, but it is important I repeat what an issue it can be. The self-loathing not only seems to be in every character, but I believe it is the sole reason the story takes forever to progress. They could have probably crammed all twenty-four episodes into twelve if most characters would stop hating themselves long enough to do something.The last obvious issue would be the heavy religious relationship the show tries to have. While there is absolutely nothing inherently wrong with that, the show does a terrible job at executing it. I couldn’t help but feel it was there “just cuz”, and it failed to make any reasonable connection to the plot in the end.Thankfully, I can say that the show does have some redeeming qualities; even if they are squandered away later. Specifically, the series shines brightest when the show was at its darkest. The deaths of some characters were quite emotional, even if you never cared much for them, and a couple (key-word) of character backstories felt well written and were probably the best parts of the show.Before I move forward, I have one last important complaint about the story. Blassreiter has the single worst ending to an anime I have ever seen. A powerful claim, I know, but after careful consideration it was the conclusion I came to. For the vast majority of the series, I would have rated my enjoyment somewhere between a high 7 to a low 8 at its best. The last 3-4 episodes were maybe a 3 on the enjoyment scale with the last episode being a 1. I wish I were exaggerating. Never in my life have I watched something execute itself so poorly. It was almost like the creators gave their series finale to their worst enemies. I won’t go into details, but it was awful.Art: 8The bulk of the show was done in what I believe is CGI. I will have to give Blassreiter this: They have the best computer animations I’ve seen on anime. Seriously, after seeing this, I don’t understand how the CGI for the Berserk Movies and Knights of Sidonia are so bad. I don’t understand how it works, nor will I pretend to, but I think it would be nice for them to learn something from this series.Music: 8I thoroughly enjoyed most of the soundtrack to Blassreiter. My favorites being, “I still Have Hope to Live” and “Xargin”. Even if you don’t want to watch the show, give “Xargin” a listen to. As for “I still Have Hope to Live”, it made several scenes emotional all on its own.Characters: 2My intro to this review doesn’t speak highly of our precious MC. He gets surprisingly little screen time and is the Self-Pity King amongst a horde of self-pity monsters. Depression tends to be a common trait amongst characters who find themselves in “mature” animes, it just happens that almost all Blassreiter’s characters have it now or get it later. This, for obvious reasons, caused every character to suffer from poor writing. Everything action the MC took seemed aimless. Joseph never really gave the audience any clear reason to his purpose or how he was going to accomplish it. For that alone he was worthless to the story. However, he was not the only character seemed to serve no purpose, but even the main antagonist seemed to be absolutely pointless. He just seemed to show up spontaneously, say a couple of lines, and then be on his way. His goals were dreadfully unoriginal and so was his personality.  I doubt I would need to connect the dots here, but if our protagonist and our antagonist suffer from poor writing, the show sucks.Overall:  4Unfortunately for this anime, Music and Art won’t make up for an awful plot and even worse characters. Characters drive a story and a good story is why you watch. Blassreiter is not worth suffering through terrible character decisions and slow story progression. I stamp a 4/10 on this mess and don’t plan on seeing it again. interest.

In fact, the components of this that are mech related embody everything that I don\'t like about that genre. This isn\'t really a mech anime though, it is actually more of a blend of a tragic/philosophical/character driven narrative that shines most when mechs are no where to be found.The story starts fairly cliche... a group fighting evil robots to save the world. Over time, the plot expands and grows into a cluster of different organizations and groups, many different characters and story arcs and a huge philosophical battle over the ""correct""...fate of the world. This is one of those neat anime where the good and bad guys both make sense and all of the characters are relatable and their character development is rational based on their experiences. I understood all of the characters and why they did what they did,.That being said, there are definitely issues with this anime. At around 20 episodes in I seriously considered dropping it. I didn\'t know why because I enjoyed the story and thought it was interesting and different but something was off. Then it hit me... this anime is just too damn long and there are too many characters. It feels like this was a 2 season anime with roughly 2/3 of a season worth of filler. What\'s weird is it isn\'t like a normal filler where the main characters just sit around doing not a whole lot but instead there are whole arcs and character sets that could have been entirely eliminated and the main story would have been stronger.If you\'re looking for a mech anime, you will not like this (generally sloppy fights and terribly CG). If you\'re looking for something with a lot of characters and a tragic story with philosophical and religious undertones you may enjoy this. Keep in mind that the story goes all over the place and there are a ton of characters but if you\'re OK with that you\'re in for an interesting ride. fate of the world.

I was actually looking forward to it when I saw the trailer because the effect was good like an online game, but haven’t had the chance to watch it. Then when I had the time I was disappointed. I really expect something from this, but when I watch it I have this heavy feeling that I can’t explain like a burden so I dropped it. Well the story was good and kinda like a resident evil with all those virus thingy that will make you...a demon and make you lose your sense but the twists in the story doesn’t seem to have that twisty effect on me.The fight scenes are good though the blood and gore of killing just doesn’t go well with their appearance when they transform into their demon selves; they look more of those sentai masked riders which I found very humorous. Even if I wish to laugh about their appearance the scenes have this always heavy atmosphere so I can’t. The characters are good and all for me are likable even the bad guys. The female characters are pretty and the males’ ranges from ugly to hot. The female lead, Amanda is great and isn’t like the stereotype characters with a sexy body and mash for brains. The one I really like is the male lead Joseph because he’s HOT, though he’s unsociable, stoic and nonchalant type of coolness is very common. I really want them to end up together as a compensation for the pain they gave me, though I know this isn’t a shoujo animé and there isn’t that much to hope for about that, still I wish with all my heart to have that romance feel at least. I’m not actually expecting a romance in this animé at first but after a while I just begin to wish for it as a form of salvation for this animé.  Plus the ending is I don’t know a very big "" JUST WHAT THE HELL  DID THAT MEAN?!"" They’re there but they’re not, are they a program or are there really a fantasy in there? Like another world or a magical thing that binds them. I began to rethink what genre this should be because it’s a sci-fi but the ending is not sci-fi-ish at all it’s more of like a fantasy  power fiction. Oh well good thing I finished it already if you wanna watch it be prepared for an alternative animé so that when you feel you can’t take it just switch to another. a demon and make you lose your sense but the twists in the story doesn’t seem to have that twisty effect on me.The fight scenes are good though the blood and gore of killing just doesn’t go well with their appearance when they transform into their demon selves; they look more of those sentai masked riders which I found very humorous.

But no, it is worse. First of all, mecha is not exaclty my favorite genre but I can make some exceptions (not in this case). I found this so boring I need to do a review, specially because of the ending.Story: Okay, the story is not that bad, it\'s cliche, saving the world from monsters is basically it. There are a lot of anime that follow this patron but this one didn\'t do it the best.Art: The art is not that bad,...I think is the only thing I liked about this. Scenaries were fine and characters were well designed, I think that\'s one reason why I decided to watch this, because the characters looked nice.Sound: Since I watched this a long time ago, I can\'t talk about the sound but from what I remember, it was decent.Character:(SPOILER, kinda)This is the worst part.First of all, you realize who\'s the main character after 3 episodes, because everyone is constantly dying and you don\'t even get to know the character well.Main character tries so hard to be cool but damn, Sasuke Uchiha has more personality than this guy. They tried to include the typical ""sad story about his past"" but it\'s really dumb TBH. I didn\'t get to like him at all, neither dislike him cause it was so mediocre I didn\'t have any reasons to hate him. Plus he\'s weak and lazy, doesn\'t try to get stronger and that\'s why the ending sucked so much.Like I said before, a lot of characters die for no real reason before you can possibly love them, and the ones who last longer don\'t even care, they\'re just there cause they had to keep some of the characters or something like that. Even if they try to include a sad story, it just turns out pathetic and doesn\'t do what it\'s supposed to do, you just don\'t get the feels.Enjoyment: I guess I like 2 or 3 scenes, but everything else was super boring.Overall: 3It\'s really, really bad, no wonder why nobody knows about this anime and they shouldn\'t. Just don\'t get close to this anime. I think is the only thing I liked about this.

Do you like/know what Kamen Rider is? Can you stand heavy use of dated CG? Do you take issue with characters being introduced just so they can be killed off? If any of these are deal breakers for you Blassreiter is probably not for you. It might sound like I don\'t like this show, but that\'s not the case; it was just a unusual show. It didn\'t age terribly well, and it had some odd writing quirks. If...you\'ve ever seen Kamen Rider you probably get why I made the comparison.Story: 8/10: Blassreiter had the potential to be a really good show IMO, but it\'s biggest fault was that the sow didn\'t know what it wanted to do with itself. All together too often we get episodes that basically feature a freak of the week or otherwise don\'t contribute in any meaningful way to the plot. Which is even worse since this show could have easily stripped away these episodes and been a 12 episode show.Art: 7/10 The actual 2D visuals are pretty good IMO, I never saw anything that made me want to gouge out my eyes, and there weren\'t any jarring moments of ""Holy crap that had to be intentionally bad"" (All eyes on YOU Gundam AGE) The 3D CG was pretty terrible at first, but I got used to it fairly quick. The fight scenes can be a bit of a clusterf*k at times, but you can still generally tell whats going on.Sound: 4/10 Both OP\'s were pretty good and I liked the ED\'s well enough, though they were pretty unmemorable. As far as the proper OST goes there only 1 track I ever really noticed playing, and it\'s not even that good. The only reason sound gets as good of a score as it does is because I rather liked the Dub.Characters: 7/10 I really wanted the characters to shine, but they mostly fell flat. Gerd was really interesting, it\'s mostly downhill from there. Amanda was hardly an actual character, she was mostly a set piece to other peoples character arcs. I hated Malek for like 90% of the show\'s run. He could\'ve been semi-interesting, but they end up re-using a lot of his backstory for Joseph, which was intentional, but I still feel like it hurt Malek. I did rather like Hermann until the last few episodes. He was supposed to be hard headed but there limits to how far you can take that. Let\'s not even get STARTED on Zwölf they were just there to pad out the show, and it would honestly been better without them. The most interesting (I.E. The ONLY really interesting Characters IMO) were Joseph and Xargin. I can\'t really go into what makes them so interesting without spoiling the show, but it had an interesting take on handling the main characters being religious.Enjoyment: 7/10 I WANT to score it an eight, but honestly the ending was bad enough to dial back my enjoyment. Blassreiter is by no means a perfect show, hell a lot of the time it has more going against it then it does with it, but overall I still think it was pretty fun, and even had some good ideas; even if they didn\'t really execute them very well. you\'ve ever seen Kamen Rider you probably get why I made the comparison.Story: 8/10: Blassreiter had the potential to be a really good show IMO, but it\'s biggest fault was that the sow didn\'t know what it wanted to do with itself.

It had an interesting premise of man merging with machines, known as demoniacs.  Joseph Jobson is a demoniac, but he hasn't been totally corrupted by the process as he holds on to his humanity.  He tries to help other people not to become demoniacs.  It interesting as you watch the show and some become demoniacs right away, but others fight against and are not completely corrupted, or in other words don't completely fuse with the machine.What made this story enjoyable was how the story progressed and the final outcome.  It...was kind of weird seeing people merging with machines and freaky.  I did like all of the action though and there was some resolution.  It's a cyberpunk action fest.  I enjoyed it more than Texhnolyze mainly because of all the cool action. was kind of weird seeing people merging with machines and freaky.

Little did I realise that Blassreaiter not only fails to live up to its set-up and pedigree, it's also one of the most straight up boring shows i've ever forced myself to sit through.The story overall is ok, but still loaded with cliche and dumb ass-pull moments. The story moves along quite quickly on an episode-to-episode basis, but still somehow feels...like it's moving at a snails pace while you are sitting and watching. Plot arcs come and go at an alarming rate, often resolving with no obvious purpose to the overall story. By the time the show ends, you will be hard pressed to remember anything that happened in the first half of the show or why it was important to the conclusion (mainly because it wasn't important!).Art direction is also ok, but your enjoyment is going to come down to how much you enjoy the CGI action/robot sequences. Personally, the actual look of the CGI wasn't overly offensive, but the way the action scenes played out was. A typical CGI 'fight' will often just boil down to two or more creatures/jets/mechs etc. circling around each other at high speed, firing off missiles at each other, and constantly dodging/blocking everything at the last possible second. This looks kind of cool the first few times, but after a while it's just dull and at sometimes a bit nauseating. Theres no pacing or intimacy to the action, it's often more like watching someone else playing a video game. You don't feel connected to the characters or their struggle when all you have to look at is a bunch of flashing lights. I'd take the still-frame action scenes from the 1997 'Berserk' anime over something like Blassreiter's 'flashy' action.The Traditional animation is perfectly functional but completely un-invigorating. Like a lot of Gonzo's other work, it's very Substance over style. Character designs range from bland to stupid- Amanda being the worst offender. I'm not sure how the Audience is expected to take her seriously when she intentionally leaves her jump suit unzipped down to her Naval for 'ventilation' purposes even during moments of critical drama or character death scenes. If the show was a bit more light-hearted then a fan-servicey design like this wouldn't seem so out of place, but when combined with the down to earth/serious personality of the character, creates a bizarre contrast. The show could have benefited from more humour to break up the sour-face missery of the typical conversations the show is drenched in.The characters overall are a mixed bunch, very few of them really resonated with me. A lot of characters do not get sufficient screen time to really connect with before they are killed or otherwise removed from the story. I couldn't tell you who my favourite character was, because none of them stood out by the end. As I've mentioned before, their are no light hearted roles in BR, everyone is sour-faced and miserable at all times. I didn't even really care who won the final battle, as whoever it was wasn't going to be less mopy than the loser so it probably wouldn't have affected the ending.Overall I did not enjoy much of Blassreiter. That is, until the last few seconds of the show...MAJOR SPOILERIf you wan't to watch this show, I'm about to discuss the very end of it, so you might want to stop reading now:At the very end of the show, Amanda meets up with Malek on a random-ass hill somewhere. And guess what, Malek has a surprise for her: everyone in the who that died, good and bad, is still alive as a hologram inside Malek's motorbike. Their faces are all projected against a beautiful rainbow, and everyone get to say hello to Amanda. Isn't that sweet?I don't know about anyone else's reaction to this, but after being bored out of my wits for 24 episodes, Blassresiter finally provoked a reaction from me:I fell out of my chair laughing!After all the Po-faced SRS BZNESS of the entire show, droning on about the nature of Morality and Death and all it's other quasi philosophical BS, to have the show pull something so ridiculous in its last few seconds came completely out of left field. What was the point? Was it ever hinted at that everyone was alive in hologram land? Doesn't it negate the point of the characters suffering and die-ng if they all just go to happy hologram land anyway?For a few seconds I could only stare in disbelief, but at the point where the villain's hologram goes 'I'm sorry' I couldn't take it anymore. Did he really just apologise? Really? Is that the dramatic payoff to that villain's character arc? It's just stupid.Ok I'm ranting now.

I was looking for something mecha/scifi, and this looked like it might be a decent fit.When I saw what the demoniacs were, I just thought this was dumb.The cross cell/cgi animation was so bad I just couldn't take it. I mostly stopped watching this because it was painful to watch....It's been a while, but I seem to recall the voice acting, maybe just the dub, was terrible.I'm not super enthusiastic about anime in general, but scifi/mecha/action are kinda my thing.

This just looked like an abomination. It might be someone's thing, it's just not mine."", 'This is my first real review of an anime. So here it goes.Story: 8It had a really great premise, the dead coming back to life as machines, but there were points where the story became arbitrary and it felt like there was unnecessary information. What I truly enjoyed about this anime was the fact that it all took place in Germany. It is a change from the aliens always invading Japan. Also the fact that a bunch of humans without much help from any technology besides their weapons and their cycles (at the beginning), they were able to take out demoniacs without any...help from a super powered monster that is 10x strong than anything else and could easily win with a single blow. This anime definitely was a breath of fresh air in comparison to many other animes.Art: 7The regular human art was just regular, nothing spectacular or stellar about it. It was basically the run of the mill characters that you really get from any anime. As for the demoniacs, or Blassreiters, their design was very interesting and unique. Each one having their own form that fit their personality, as long as they were the main character. For the minions or the rogue demoniacs that you see at the beginning, you honestly really could not tell one from another. Of course that is the whole point, all eyes on the main characters, but often times that did make the fights confusing. Same thing can be said for many of the XAT members, although each pair had a unique color, if you were not really paying attention, you could easily get confused as to which character you are currently spectating and the demoniac that they are fighting. Multiple times, I had some issues separating Gerd from the rest. In addition, the CGI wasn\'t terrible, but it was by far pleasing. It felt so out of place for this anime. Suddenly they would go to the average, 2d (in a 3d design) to CGI racing. Even the demoniacs looked pretty normal, well as normal as a 6-7 ft robot alien can look. They did not look that strange among their environment, almost like they belonged there. The CGI felt more like a, see this is what we can do, but that was it. It felt like a show of advanced technology that was totally out of place.Sound: 7I found the music interesting, but they only seemed to have one track available. For me it felt distracting and annoying at times. I would focus too much on the sound track than the actual fight or event that is occurring. At times it felt like it was unnecessary and did not add anything to what was happening. Music is supposed to be motivating and get you pumped, often times it really didn\'t need any music because they had so much background noise, it filled up the empty silence most animes would contain if they didn\'t add background music. The music really did not mix well with the blades clashing, the guns, the squeezing of tires, or just crashing of bots (human or demoniac). Usually I appreciate the music, but this time it just seemed partially unnecessary. That is to say that the music isn\'t great, but it just felt so repetitive. As for the actual sound affects, they were appreciated and they went well with the actions being performed.Character: 7Unlike many animes, this anime actually did give time to character backgrounds. They didn\'t just make them 1 dimensional characters. The only issue is, they were not in the anime long enough for me to really care about them. Even though they got a backstory, it felt like it was partially thrown in to make us feel pity or proud for a character. Even characters like Mallock and Gerd felt really pointless. Gerd especially felt absolutely pointless. There was no premise for him to be in this anime, really his purpose was to make Jarmon look like less of an untrusting asshole. Without Gerd\'s pointless 3 or 4 episode appearance, Jarmon really would be a 1 dimensional character that could die and we didn\'t give a damn about. With Joseph being one of the main protagonists, you really did not see or hear much from him unless he was injured or saving someone else\'s life. Other than that, you really only saw Jarmon, Amanda, or the XAT team. I know it is important to give other characters some personality or some purpose, but Joseph felt more like that ex-machina that is thrown in when needed. Kind of as a reminder of, oh yeah this guy is supposed to be the main character. Guess we should include him eventually.Enjoyment: 8In general I liked this anime. Although you see all my negative comments, it actually was quiet enjoyable. You definitely got a family vibe from the XAT team. Everyone was willing to sacrifice their lives for the safety of another. The action was great and unlike many anime, this anime showed that they really don\'t need ""human controlled"" demoniacs to take down the bad guys. Just give them some guns and hell, they can kill them all, it will just take them some time and may possibly risk the lives of others. The human controlled demoniacs like Joseph and Gerd just make killing them just a little easier and quicker. Although certain parts felt unnecessary or drawn out to an ungodly proportion that really should not exist in an anime that is 24 episodes long, it definitely had it\'s action packed moments.Not after saying all of this, I did watch the entire anime. Definitely was not my favorite, and I doubt that I will truthfully ever back to it of my own free will, but it was enjoyable. I definitely say give it a chance, but my advice is skip the first few episodes because they felt pointless. I will admit that I did have to skip through some parts, because they were drawn out or were only necessary for the character development and nothing else. help from a super powered monster that is 10x strong than anything else and could easily win with a single blow.

Before you go into this series, I want to forewarn you: The first 9 episodes are chaotic. In fact, when you first start the series you will wonder if you missed a season somewhere. No. This series starts assuming you know everything about Blassreiter.  The art is good, but this series relies heavily on CGI. Not the good kind of CGI. Low-mid budget CGI. The frequent switching between CGI and 2D will often frustrate you,and you will develop a hate for all things 3D.  If you prefer English dub,...I must warn you that the first 9-10 episodes are dubbed very poorly and you may have to switch to subtitles to get through the first part of the series.  To put it simply, the first half of the show is pretty apalling in every area. After reading this, you may be thinking Blassreiter sounds terrible. Well it is and it isn't. The series starts off poorly in all the areas mentioned above, but once you make it to the middle of the series everything improves - the plot, CGI (somewhat), characters, and even the English dub. All in all it's definitely worth a watch as the story is fairly unique. I recommend this series if your into: sports bikes, nano-machines, biological weapons, human piloted robots, weapons of mass destruction, religion, and/or Germany.

Even though it fails to live up to its own expectations, the artwork succeeds more in a figurative sense. Dark tones and numerous Gothic references set the depressing mood of the show, but when it leaves these dark corners the show...really starts to burn in the light. This series is best watched at night, and would have been far more appealing to the eye if more of it took place after sundown (maybe that\'s an exaggeration, but just watch it and see if you disagree that the daytime sequences aren\'t nearly as compelling as the nighttime ones).Sound (5)- Well, I spent far too much time on Art, so sound will need to be quick. Overall, the soundtrack doesn\'t do much to add to the show\'s atmosphere, and outside of the awkward and unfitting film-noir esque ending sequence, the show\'s music didn\'t leave much of an impression on me.Characters (7)- Most of the characters in the show were compelling and interesting, if a little flat. While I was glad to see Joseph and Malek growing ever so slightly, many of the other characters go through the entire series without even the smallest shift in personality and end up  as tired stereotypes.Story (9)- Now this is the real kicker. Certainly, it may be easy to deride the show for its overly-depressing tone, I found the story to be very compelling, adding a sense of reality and relatability to the characters. The dark backstories may at times be too depressing and slightly repetitive, but they still work for the show. The weakest area of the plot is in the emergence of these evil robot creatures and the response to them, and the show is especially slow in the beginning because of this. If one can accept the basic premise of the show however (easier said than done) it can quickly become one of the most entrancing plots developed. Beware though, as this show tries its hardest to make you feel like crap, and does its job very well...Overall, Blassreiter may be hampered by small weaknesses in underlying plot structure and annoying combinations of CGI and out-of-place music, but the show\'s dark atmosphere, religious parallels, and central message of hope in a world filled with evil and despair will leave you anxiously watching up to the very end. really starts to burn in the light.

There are no words i can use to describe the contempt i have for this dumpster fire.It sounded interesting and the synopsis drew me in but the first 10 mins of watching this i felt disturbed by the wacky 3d, very low budgetI stopped watching after the first episode based on the other reviews I'd be willing to bet that the story becomes better after some episodes.But i'm not gonna risk it after watching the first episode the cgi is just so bad i can't take it......>.<.Not only that but the story feels all over itself...JUST FROM THE FIRST EPISODE, very overwhelming and fast paced feels like a cartoon ffs JUST FROM THE FIRST EPISODE, very overwhelming and fast paced feels like a cartoon ffs""]"
Cello Hiki no Gauche (1982),https://myanimelist.net/anime/1049/Cello_Hiki_no_Gauche_1982,"[""Classical music really does have some good stuff with it.Gauche the Cellist is a movie that tells the story of a guy named Goshu that just tries his best to be a better cellist player. His hopes are put down by the conductor that's managing the orchestra. Surely, this was a big downer for Goshu. Being bad already and out of tune at playing his instrument, he doesn't get any support from anyone at all. He then decides to practice harder back at his cabin so he can prove his master wrong. As he does, random animals appears out of nowhere. That's where the fun...starts. The plot is really very straightforward, until those talking animals just showed up mysteriously.The movie's animation, I'd have to admit, isn't all that great. Considering that it's made back in the '80s, I consider the bad quality of the animation. I wouldn't be too generous giving it a higher mark, but below a 'fair' score would also be too harsh, with the account that it is an old movie. There's nothing much really to talk about concerning the art. The setting takes place for a short time at the school building where the conductor and other students were, and most of the movie focuses on his cabin, where most of the story happens. The cabin is in the middle of a rice field, and maybe on the outskirts of a jungle just across a bridge. But it's really nice to see a view of that place, which reminds me of how a simple life should be lived as back then. Even dragonflies are focused by the animators flying around, along with other insects/birds that usually just get ignored.The sound was good. Gauche the Cellist focuses on classical music obviously, since a cello is part of the title in the first place. If you appreciate this kind of music, then this will surely be a good movie to watch. I'd say the voice acting could have been done better though, since some parts of the movie I can't even hardly hear the voices at all (it just lowers all of a sudden sometimes). But again, an old movie, so I gave it some considerations. The playing of the cello by Goshu was also enjoyable for me, and when he actually got better at it, which was really a good listen.The characters are mainly a person, then a bunch of animal creatures. Each of those animals seemed to teach Goshu about something that he has yet to discover for himself. It's like one of those stories with moral lessons where animals talk. Exactly just like that. Those animals really got the smarts to pull off helping out a guy in need. Even the conductor back at where Goshu performs have that angry-looking face that just makes one wants to punch him right on the face. He's that irritating that I laugh it out for being irritated at that guy. Really unique characters, with added flavor, making animals do the work.As I said, if classical music doesn't bother you, then this movie is worth checking out. Despite the old animation, it's really a movie that I enjoyed. Nodame Cantabile was also a fun series that focuses in classical music, and this movie should just be added to anyone's collection if they're into that.I really recommend Gauche the Cellist mostly to music enthusiasts, specifically to Nodame Cantabile fans that watched the show because of the music as part of their reason. I can see why this movie isn't all that popular, but I really recommend it to anyone that likes something new to watch, something different. starts.

Comforting like a hot mug of hot chocolate in front of a warm fire! A rarely seen Takahata gem. A film any musician should appreciate. ', ""The movie is not too popular I guess since its very old now (1982). But its a Ghibli movie so one would be attracted just by the Ghibli tag to watch it once. The same happened with me as well. While searching for music genre I accidentally came across this movie. But was really glad that I did. So a few thoughts on the movie now:Story [9/10]: The story is rather simple actually. Based in the countryside of Japan in the era of the 80s. Goshu is a Cello player in a choir. Always making mistakes on some of the fine playing whenever the choir...is practicing. The conductor of the choir thus gets mad at him many a times. Goshu tries hard to perfect his playing by practicing on the Cello at his home every night after finishing his chores for the day. Every time during his practice he is interrupted by one of the animals living nearby his home. Yes the house is away from the town he goes for his choir practices everyday, so there are lots of small animals, birds around. Though he is interrupted every time by these animals they somehow help him by teaching the tunes he is trying to perfect.The story is very well written. I always find that stories written in the olden times were much much more imaginative than they are nowadays. Continuity of the story in the movie is good and it builds up an atmosphere of the typical countryside. Overall there is a feeling of -i watched something very nice- at the end of the film exactly because of the atmosphere that the movie creates.Animation [7/10]: Animation is okay. I think good according to the technology of the 80s probably. Movements of the charatcres and the animals shown are smooth enough most of the times. So its not all that bad.Art [7/10]: Art again I give a 7. Characters drawn are too fat. but the animals are drawn well. The landscape portrays the countryside well. Goshu's home looks really nice though its in a sort of an isolated place away from town.Sound [8/10]: Music is good. Western Classical songs played during choir practices and when goshu is practicing at his home. Background music is okay again good considering the time in which it was made.Character [10/10]: All the characters in the choir are very well portrayed. Gives an essence of the typical countryside folks. Animals also have been given distinct personalities very much suitable as to what kind of animal it is.Enjoyment and Overall [9/10]: Really enjoyed watching this old movie for a change. The Ghibli type elements of fantasy are there in this movie as well. Enjoyed seeing the countryside in the movie. Overall a good watch. is practicing.

They\'re perhaps the most ""okay"" studio working in the industry today and none of their shows I would consider being all that good, with the exception of a couple maybe, but, even then, those exceptions are still nothing all too remarkable. They always make shows that sound good on paper, and, when read, sound like they could be good shows, but they usually lack the creative talents and efforts to carry this through and their shows always just end up feeling either downright terrible or just ""meh"" for lack...of a better term. Nowhere is this more evident than with their latest title, Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism, which, with a narrative and idea this silly, could have made for a good rule of cool show if it had more energy put into its animation, but it feels, like most of their work, that they wanted to create something really cool and cinematic looking, but didn\'t have the necessary talent or creative force to do so. Despite being a relatively fun show none the less, the anime needed much more charisma in order to carry itself along for the entire duration and the shows just falls short of reaching that rule-of-cool aesthetic and vibe it was so clearly aiming for. In that regard, the show feels very much like a previous Silverlink show, Chivalry of a Failed Knight, which, despite being vastly greater than most other light novel adaptations and is all around a decent show, also falls just short from being good due the studio\'s general lack of creativity in visuals, while, at the same time, having a decent script with decent characters, something that Busou also carries on as well. Either way, let\'s dive into this insane, nutty show!Busou\'s narrative as a whole is one that is incredibly linear and straightforward. The show will not surprise you with any grand plot twists nor does it bring anything new to the table either, and it doesn\'t really have much direction. What I mean by that is that the characters don\'t really have anything in the way of a \'goal\' or a motivation in the narrative, other than the main character wanting to collect five stamps from a group of five girls, all of whom carry swords. Oh, did I forget to mention that? Yes, for some reason, the school has allowed each one of the girls to carry a weapon due to the once all girl\'s school, becoming co-ed, allowing boys to join and, out of fear, request to carry said weapons as a means of protecting themselves. These weapons range anywhere from a sword to a whip to even a giant, damn bear! This aspect of the show is incredibly stupid, but the show as a whole is so tongue in cheek and takes itself so lightly that this aspect feels like a part of the world that is presented to us and doesn\'t feel all too jarring or even strange. Since the show doesn\'t take itself so seriously and more so laughs at its ridiculous setup, I can excuse this obvious dumb stuff. Due to each one of the girl\'s weapons, and general scary nature, the boys who do attend this school are put to humiliation and are forced to wear girl\'s clothing as a way to blend in with the school.  Enter our main character, a cocky, bad-ass asshole, by the name of Nomura, who goes against the demands of the girl\'s at the school, and the rest of the show sees him fight against five girls, who are called the Five Swords, a group who are the strongest, and most skilled with the sword, who go around correcting problematic students and the such. And that\'s about it for an overall plot, but the show carries this narrative with such a silly over the top atmosphere and tone, that I find it a lot of fun to watch the battles carry out and the characters feel dynamic and interesting enough in personality to carry the weight of the show.The anime is incredibly dumb and stupid in a lot of ways, from sumo wrestling a giant bear to the plethora of various battles and fights, but, at the same time, the show also feels self-aware enough to know that the entire thing is incredibly dumb, and fully embraces all of it. Whenever the characters are in battle, bold white text will appear on the screen showcasing the name of their attacks, akin to something like Kill la Kill, with plenty of close-up shots of the characters reacting to certain events while they gasp. Both of these elements help to sell the show\'s rule of cool vibe it is aiming for and helps to make it fun and fairly entertaining for me personally. However, there are some moments in the show that I feel are a little too stupid for its own good. One such example is when the main character is attempting to hide behind a bear, a pet of one of the members of the Five Swords, which also happens to be female, as he accidentally touches her breasts. Instead of being funny, which is what I believe the writer was attempting, it just comes across as being strange, jarring and uncomfortable to watch as well.  Another example that may put some people off is when he fights one of the girls naked in the bathing areas. It can be distracting, and some may even consider tasteless, but I found the fight fun enough to carry the scene, and the nakedness of the girl is part of her tactic for winning the fight and adds on a little bit of characterisation for her character. Some other criticisms about the show may stem from the amount of blood and edge the show does try and convey, especially near the end, and I can understand why. It can seem kind of jarring to go from simply hi-jinks to a complete bloodbath as shown in episode ten, but, on the flip side, at the very least it provides some narrative stakes for the final fight and makes the villain out to be much more menacing and threatening too. The use of blood never really came across to me as being forced since it at least made sense in the context of the battles since all of the characters were using razor sharp blades. Another troupe that I wasn\'t too fond of, is that two of the girls fall in love with our main character and end up acting catty and bitchy to each other as they fight over him. I\'ve always disliked this in anime since it reduces the female characters as nothing more than petty women, but here it didn\'t feel as bad as what I have seen before, and for the most part, there is an actual reason why these girls have fallen for this guy, as opposed to them simply wanting the main guy\'s dick just because the plot demands them to. This doesn\'t make this element any better, just a little bit more bearable in the long run.I was honestly surprised at how much I enjoyed the show and found myself actually excited and immersed during the action scenes, especially during the final fight. The series is so over the top and so dumb that I believe it does work from an entertainment standpoint alone, and while I wouldn\'t consider the entire narrative and characters to be terrible, it certainly needed a lot more work to make the show good.Each one of the characters has a stupid obvious gimmick whether that be in design or personality, but, at the very least, many of the characters at least have some depth, no matter how little granted, to make them feel a little more like actual people than bland archetypes. The main lead, Mamoru is essentially a better version of Glenn from Akashic Records, in that he is far more consistent and does the whole bad-ass cocky bastard rather well. I genuinely liked this character, and his back-story, unlike Glenn didn\'t feel as if it were included just for the sake of evoking cheap emotion from the audience, despite how generic and by the numbers this back-story actually is and how little of it we actually get to learn. A character like this holds up well for a silly narrative since he simply a lot of fun to watch and complements the silly nature of the show, although I wouldn\'t call his character good by any stretch. He fills his purpose fairly well, has some decent comedic moments and is a fine character. Rin\'s character has a massive hatred of men and wears a death god mask over half of her face since her mother called her ugly when she was a child and made her wear a mask over her face at all times when she went out with her. This back-story is quite dumb and rather, again, silly, but at the very least it provides an explanation into why this character acts the way that she does and the purpose behind her mask, rather than it remain a silly gimmick like those presented in Hand Shakers for example. Mary was a lot more generic than these two previously mentioned since we barely learn anything about her past and just assumes the ""girl with big boobs"" role while also carrying around a dictionary since she is Le François. She can be pretty annoying due to her attitude and general stuck-up-edness (that\'s not a word, I know) but otherwise, she is pretty forgettable. One of my favourite characters in the show is Satori, not only for how well her voice actress conveys her messed up mentality and rather sadistic sword fighting but because there was a decently executed plot twist in episode nine. It\'s not something to blow your mind, but I felt it was a decent twist none the less, and I did enjoy every scene she was in. While she doesn\'t necessarily see much development (as does the rest of the cast) she still gets some decent characterisation. The other two members of the Five Swords,  Warabi and Tsukyo, were also likeable, and Tsukyou especially manages to pull off the strong swordsman character rather effectively, and that\'s one thing I can praise the show for. The main character, while very strong, still isn\'t able to blow through all of the girls with ease and finds himself cornered more often than not, having to think up some clever way to win. While this isn\'t on the same level of tactical fights I\'ve seen in some other shows, it at the very least, creates some narrative tension and stakes and makes the girl characters feel more like fighters than in your typical light novel series where the girls are all presented as being weak without the help of the boring male self-insert character. The final villain was decently executed and I felt a genuine sent of excitement seeing the main character and her fight in the final episodes, with a decently explored back-story explaining their rivalry and the reason why it spawned in the first place giving more weight to the scene. The character interactions were fine but often the dialogue feels very simple and trite, with two characters just yelling how great they are, and sometimes the comedy between certain characters could fall flat on its face.The animation consistency was fairly good with a lot of character movement and attacks but the art consistency took a large hit as a result of this. It\'s good enough in conveying the action on screen and some moments can look downright great, but overall it\'s just fine. I liked the character designs themselves and the general colour design too, and the opening is catchy as hell! While in terms of visuals, it\'s just a bunch of random fights, each one flows into each other fairly well. The music is fine and does its job but is ultimately rather forgettable once you\'ve finished watching the show; nothing all too remarkable aside from the opening and ending tracks. Overall, I believe this anime did achieve what it set out to do to a certain extent. While it is an overall decent show, I would be lying if I said that I didn\'t have fun watching this show and I would recommend this anime for anyone looking for a dumb, easy ride, although I doubt this show will be remembered in a few months. of a better term. Nowhere is this more evident than with their latest title, Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism, which, with a narrative and idea this silly, could have made for a good rule of cool show if it had more energy put into its animation, but it feels, like most of their work, that they wanted to create something really cool and cinematic looking, but didn\'t have the necessary talent or creative force to do so.

One of my favourite characters in the show is Satori, not only for how well her voice actress conveys her messed up mentality and rather sadistic sword fighting but because there was a decently executed plot twist in episode nine. It\'s not something to blow your mind, but I felt it was a decent twist none the less, and I did enjoy every scene she was in. While she doesn\'t necessarily see much development (as does the rest of the cast) she still gets some decent characterisation. The other two members of the Five Swords,  Warabi and Tsukyo, were also likeable, and Tsukyou especially manages to pull off the strong swordsman character rather effectively, and that\'s one thing I can praise the show for. The main character, while very strong, still isn\'t able to blow through all of the girls with ease and finds himself cornered more often than not, having to think up some clever way to win. While this isn\'t on the same level of tactical fights I\'ve seen in some other shows, it at the very least, creates some narrative tension and stakes and makes the girl characters feel more like fighters than in your typical light novel series where the girls are all presented as being weak without the help of the boring male self-insert character. The final villain was decently executed and I felt a genuine sent of excitement seeing the main character and her fight in the final episodes, with a decently explored back-story explaining their rivalry and the reason why it spawned in the first place giving more weight to the scene. The character interactions were fine but often the dialogue feels very simple and trite, with two characters just yelling how great they are, and sometimes the comedy between certain characters could fall flat on its face.The animation consistency was fairly good with a lot of character movement and attacks but the art consistency took a large hit as a result of this. It\'s good enough in conveying the action on screen and some moments can look downright great, but overall it\'s just fine. I liked the character designs themselves and the general colour design too, and the opening is catchy as hell! While in terms of visuals, it\'s just a bunch of random fights, each one flows into each other fairly well. The music is fine and does its job but is ultimately rather forgettable once you\'ve finished watching the show; nothing all too remarkable aside from the opening and ending tracks. Overall, I believe this anime did achieve what it set out to do to a certain extent. While it is an overall decent show, I would be lying if I said that I didn\'t have fun watching this show and I would recommend this anime for anyone looking for a dumb, easy ride, although I doubt this show will be remembered in a few months.', ""tl;dr: Not particularly strong in terms of plot or depth but has a good balance of cool and stylish moments as well as comedic and amusing moments with a likable cast of characters.The anime is trying to do two things, be cool and be amusing. It's not trying to have a good plot or deep characters or anything like that. There's a good variety to how both of these are done though and there's a good balance of the two, so it works well in such a way there are a lot of fun and likable characters. For example, the various main characters have a...cool edge to them in very different ways, and they also all have strange things about them that make them hilarious in different ways, the exception to the latter being Andou who is pretty much just pure bad ass, while the best example of both of those traits is Nomura, who is an incredibly unique protagonist and is pretty much just a steady stream of great one liners, both hilarious or cool, and crazy combat potential, which is also often accompanied by one liners. Some characters do get fleshed out somewhat with backgrounds and such, and there's even some decent character and relationship development, but its not really much in the focus and mostly just serves as a basis for Nomura to drop one liners and seem awesome. The exception to that is centered around the relationship between Nomura and Andou which has some more depth to it and serve as the finale for the season, though while it is probably the coolest of the anime's arcs the story is still only okay which shouldn't be surprising as story isn't really one of the anime's strengths.A lot of why the anime is so cool is the action, which manages to be impressive in that its mostly grounded but has just a bit that goes beyond being realistic. This assertion may seem strange because all sorts of crazy stuff happens like fighting bears and because the entire setting is crazy with it being a normal school but people randomly carrying swords and getting into near death fights without getting in trouble, but with the tone and atmosphere that's what it ultimately felt like. There's also a steady stream of ability names appearing on screen with fancily stroked kanji which despite seeming dumb actually makes things feel more legitimate, though that's probably only because I don't know jack about actual swordsmanship or martial arts. So the action was cool and exciting. With that said, ultimately things did seem a bit simplistic in that each character only has one thing going for them, even Nomura who only really has one move.The art style and animation was mostly decent in that designs and framing were good and there were some great scenes, but quality felt off at times. The anime also felt kind of cheap in that there were a lot of points that it felt that it was clearly padding for time which definitely hurt pacing, especially if you're marathoning it. The eye catches were well done. The OP was great both in terms of audio and visuals. The ED was decent enough in both.

But what I like about this show is that it contradicts the prejudice of every women. That not all men are enemies, and not all men are pervents. The story isn't that marvelous, but it gives justice to every man in the school. It's like winning their trust show, and you'll gonna like it. Unlike Prison School, if you're familiar with it, this show is more like showing the good...side and clarifying the misunderstanding between men and women that they can co-exist to one another without any barrier. I like the development actually. If you are a man, you'll gonna root for the Main male character, but if you are a women, you'll be triggered because it's like they're protraying that despite how strong women are, women are fragile with their feelings, and they need the D afterall.

"" once there was a delinquent boy.. who got expelled from school and had to join a new school which was being dominated by girls and they all wanted to straighten him up but ended up falling for him... THE END"". Ever heard of something like this.. ya i know . So this pretty much sums up the entire anime and almost  very other harem anime nowadays.This show here is nothing but a sorry excuse of a harem anime with almost no originality and is full of shitty cliches that would make no sense. You would rather...wonder about why are the children even allowed use swords and whips in school .Armed Girl\'s Machiavellism is anime based on the manga of same name and is made by LINDElFILMS. Now the studio is known for making some great harem like  Yamada kun and the seven withes but TBH even i am not sure why they would make such anime anime now. The story follows Fudo Nomura, strong delinquent who was expelled from his school for engaging in a fight where he defeated almost 40 people, and now he studies at Private Aichi Symbiosis Academy which is ruled by a group of girls called \'Supreme 5 Swords"" whose mission is to correct out all the boys after the school became co-ed.He is really skilled when it comes to fighting and has a lot of knowledge about various martial art styles. He even has his own orignal technique called "" Magic Bullet"" through which he can defeat almost anyone with just a  single touch. All the members of supreme swords wanted to defeat Nomura but instead ended up defeated and for some reason they all fell for him (don\'t ask me why).Now , the protagonist might be the only character who is somewhat bearable in the entire show. Almost every girl presents a pretty bad impression and their is personalities are also unbearable at some points. Rin, who is the leader of the group, fought against Nomura and somehow accidentally ended up kissing him and later on developing a crush on him. Their interaction in the beginning seemed promising but later on she turned out to be violent girl with a tsundere personality. And  introducing girls like tamaba, warabi and tsukuyo just shows how they threw up almost all the generic character tropes in the show without any proper sense.Another major character in the show is the Empress also known as Amo. At start of the series she was shown to be the strongest delinquent in the school who even the  supreme swords couldn\'t handle . She had a extremely violent bitch like personality who would kill anyone for almost no reason. But later it was revealed that she was in love with nomura and was a yandere personality and would kill anyone who would come between them... even Nomura .Now i would praise the anime for doing a good job when it came to martial arts. They did well in explaining the techniques and  arts used in show and the fights seemed to make some sense. But hey! an anime where even a bear does martial arts.. now that might be something you Have to see.Now after watching the entire series the only question which came in my mind was.. Just why. Why even create such a thing ? watching this made me feel that the creators were not even sure where they were going with this thing. They just threw up almost everything  that came in their mind with worrying about it making even a bit of sense. There is no memorable character or dialogue whatsoever and most of the characters are almost unbearable to watch. The setting is also nothing special, just a  simple High school where for some reason everything including swords, whips, bears , blades are totally allowed but a boy wanting to enjoy his freedom is not.Now THB there\'s nothing much to say about the art . It might as well be the only good thing in the anime. The character design is also pretty generic with nothing to praise or complain about. The sound track is also pretty good, The op Builds up some hype for a good fast paced hardcore action anime.... which unfortunately this  show is not. The battle music is nothing good or original either but fits there anyways.Now in the end... this show is nothing good . Its not exactly really bad either and you might even find it decent if you are a fan of such kind of shows but I can\'t bring myself to like this show. There is no originality or even a good plot. The characters are just generic and boring , and their interactions also felt somewhat cheesy and the jokes don\'t do much either.

The setting in itself seem to be the most ideal setting for any feminist to wish for, where the school is fully dominated by women with rights to possessed a weapon and physically use it to assault others or cut them without any consequences being done to them (like em police, government, the principal should do something about it); you could also add in the assimilation of femininity, by making all...men turn gay with make up, since this school that was once an all girl school, and most female student saw men as vile, vicious, or a rapey beast.  Aside from showing all the female student's ignorance of men, the pretentious gays in this show look very disturbing, especially that fucking big head dude. And I just dont see any reason to make these kind of disturbing character other than wanting people to shy away from the series.All that aside, this is just your typical cliche anime, with many of the anime tropes and setting, filled with women and a legit badass MC; where he gets a harem out of it by dominating them in a fight. Usually it's the other way around where the harem starts before the fight, but this anime go through that process of acquiring em ladies through beating them, where the MC usually show no or very little sexual interest, or having shown any signs hinting of a romance between his harem partners.  Talking about the character, some girls in the show, especially the blonde hair one and the croissant hair looking girl, does give u that cringy-ness being added on to the show. I mean their fucking character imitating or speaking in a very horrible accent of a foreign language and try to pretend one is weebish and cringed just like I said. Plus, the blonde hair girl is just your typical big boob, with a tsundere like personality that usually blurt out stuff that imply that she's actually a very slutty on the inside (well the big boob already kinda give that point across to its viewers). That's not to say that the show is consisted of disturbing and cringy characters, there are some pretty cool ghastly girl who gives off a macabre vibes, cute and adorable lolis, and so on.There's not much to the story really aside from a very few flashback screen of our MC's past, or of other character in the show that belong to the member of the five sword, aka, the student council of the school? or just a group of respected girls who control the fucking school I guess. In addition to that, the story progression of this anime is pretty slow, and almost makes you wanted to skip to the part where action and stuff finally gets to happen in the anime. This ofc is not that much of an ordeal, but it just gets boring u know? Excluding all the cute interaction scene, some ecchi that some of u may liked (I definitely dont, I cant handle the tease u know? I would rather watch a hentai), panties shot, awesomely animated fight scene, and so on. But hey, the cliche of people from the five sword people talking when one of their members, or them and a group of their henchmen fighting against the MC, that's actually pretty annoying.In conclusion, it's a fun show, it may get boring at times but nevertheless, it's not that bad if you wanna see a different kinda harem story involving men hitting girls, and later have them go after the MC's D at their very own discretion. men turn gay with make up, since this school that was once an all girl school, and most female student saw men as vile, vicious, or a rapey beast.

MC's D at their very own discretion."", ""Warning possible SpoilersReading the description of this anime it definitely reminded me of Prison School luckily though this wouldn't be that well known cringefest instead we got something that was actually very entertaining to watch.The story centres on Fudou Nomura a delinquent who has been sent to The Private Aichi Symbiosis Academy to be controlled after getting into a fight, but he isn't a pushover and to gain leave from the school he must get a stamp from each of The Supreme Five Swords easier said than done.Now honestly the story to begin with starts out very simple which is Nomura trying to get a...stamp from each of the five girls who are part of the The Supreme Five Swords which always ends up with him fighting them and boy are these fights entertaining, overtime as he defeats each girl the next one always being a little stronger and those that get defeated do start to fall for him which makes you think it turns into you're usual cliched harem hell no this doesn't happen here as only two of the girls really fall for him while the others just either help him out or stay in the sidelines.When the final battle happens though it does turn into a love-hate type of thing which didn't ruin the show for me, but it kinda seemed like a meh way to end it even though those final episodes were really intense to watch.When you look at the genres and think hhhmmm somethings missing technically you're right since comedy is also a big factor in this show, but really it is mostly an action show which did surprise in some way because looking at the poster you'd think otherwise, but when I watched it every episode had a big fight which was surprisingly entertaining as not many anime's can be entertaining when it focuses mostly on action yet this one can.Now aside from the good fights the characters are also what makes this show very good as some these characters really stand out.Fudou Nomura is the male MC and he continues the trend of asshole characters that we have seen a few times lately, but just like those guys he's pretty damn cool and a badass hell he also has morals too as some of the girls do try to taunt him yet he manages to control himself which was a surprise to see and despite having to fight these girls he doesn't hate them afterwards sure he doesn't get along with them, but he does compliment them sometimes and is grateful whenever they help him out in a situation.Rin Onigawara is the first girl Nomura encounters, Rin was one of my favourites of the show because even though she is one of those bossy types she does actually have a nice cute side which was always adorable to see especially in moments where you see her and Nomura connect a little more, sadly though she was paired up with a character that pretty much got on my nerves which sorta hurt Rin's reputation a little.Mary Kikakujou is the second girl Nomura encounters and she is to me the worst character of the group, she has a french background so she prefers a rapier instead of a Katana and despite being the girl with the big oppai she is annoying as hell well not annoying to the extent that I hate, but she was annoying and honestly she didn't really offer much to the table either as everyone else pretty much overshadowed her.Warabi Hanasaka is the third girl Nomura encountered, she only escapes worse because she actually became friends with Nomura and helped him out a few times, she does have an over eccentric personality often making herself feel like a queen along with having that annoying chuckle her type of characters have which did feel overused at somepoint though luckily she doesn't use it as often once Nomura defeated her plus you won't see her without Kyou-bou who is Warabi's pet bear and fighting buddy who also becomes more friendly with Nomura after fighting him.Satori Tamaba is the fourth girl Nomura encountered, Satori definitely became another favourite because she is incredibly weird and really devious as she tries to put Nomura in a difficult position at some point, she always speaks in a slow fashion making her seem dimwitted which isn't the case and certainly has a lot less shame compared to the other girls when it comes to fighting.Tsukuyo Inaba is the final member that Nomura encounters and she is actually blind so she relies heavily on her hearing to move around which makes her notice things much quicker compared to the other girls, she is pretty much a Kuudere since she is very quiet and doesn't show much emotion, but she is very powerful and shouldn't be underestimated.Kirukiru Amou is the antagonist of the series and despite not appearing much until the final episodes she is a very cold, ruthless and dangerous person as she uses her own hands much like Nomura as weapons except she uses them like swords and if it weren't for the Academies headmistress she would probably have killed a few people although despite her badass appearance the whole reason why she goes out on a frenzy is because she had a crush on Nomura and she only wanted to be his friend which didn't really go well for her and that seems like a very stupid reason to go around hurting everyone.Now the artstyle was really good as the choreography of the fights was done well and there didn't seem like any CGI was involved which made it even better, but there really wasn't much else as the characters seemed okay with they're designs, but isn't something I haven't seen before along with the school and other things although you can definitely tell between the differences of living standards for the female and male students.Now the Action which is the main sauce of the show is really good, enjoyable to watch and last for a good while which is definitely a good thing because I don't want fights that are over in seconds and luckily these fights can drag on for almost an entire episode which shows that the show stays true to it's word.There is also some other stuff that isn't in the genres like Comedy which was actually very funny, I liked the chemistry between Nomura and the girls as he usually jokes around with them when usually it's the other way around so it's nice to see a male protagonist getting the advantage over harsh female characters and there are a lot of jokes between the two sides that are really funny, there is also a fair amount of Ecchi/fanservice though not to the extent where it's distracting well except where Satori fights Nomura nude which is something that definitely surprised me, but the other moments like this are spread out very nicely and don't really go much further than that.Overall this was an entertaining show that could have a season 2, but considering that Nomura achieved his goal I'm very unsure and the way the show ended seemed fine so I'm not sure if this needs a second season, putting that aside this'll definitely be a good show for those fans who are looking for a good action anime. stamp

situation.Rin Onigawara is the first girl Nomura encounters, Rin was one of my favourites of the show because even though she is one of those bossy types she does actually have a nice cute side which was always adorable to see especially in moments where you see her and Nomura connect a little more, sadly though she was paired up with a character that pretty much got on my nerves which sorta hurt Rin's reputation a little.Mary Kikakujou is the second girl Nomura encounters and she is to me the worst character of the group, she has a french background so she prefers a rapier instead of a Katana and despite being the girl with the big oppai she is annoying as hell well not annoying to the extent that I hate, but she was annoying and honestly she didn't really offer much to the table either as everyone else pretty much overshadowed her.Warabi Hanasaka is the third girl Nomura encountered, she only escapes worse because she actually became friends with Nomura and helped him out a few times, she does have an over eccentric personality often making herself feel like a queen along with having that annoying chuckle her type of characters have which did feel overused at somepoint though luckily she doesn't use it as often once Nomura defeated her plus you won't see her without Kyou-bou who is Warabi's pet bear and fighting buddy who also becomes more friendly with Nomura after fighting him.Satori Tamaba is the fourth girl Nomura encountered, Satori definitely became another favourite because she is incredibly weird and really devious as she tries to put Nomura in a difficult position at some point, she always speaks in a slow fashion making her seem dimwitted which isn't the case and certainly has a lot less shame compared to the other girls when it comes to fighting.Tsukuyo Inaba is the final member that Nomura encounters and she is actually blind so she relies heavily on her hearing to move around which makes her notice things much quicker compared to the other girls, she is pretty much a Kuudere since she is very quiet and doesn't show much emotion, but she is very powerful and shouldn't be underestimated.Kirukiru Amou is the antagonist of the series and despite not appearing much until the final episodes she is a very cold, ruthless and dangerous person as she uses her own hands much like Nomura as weapons except she uses them like swords and if it weren't for the Academies headmistress she would probably have killed a few people although despite her badass appearance the whole reason why she goes out on a frenzy is because she had a crush on Nomura and she only wanted to be his friend which didn't really go well for her and that seems like a very stupid reason to go around hurting everyone.Now the artstyle was really good as the choreography of the fights was done well and there didn't seem like any CGI was involved which made it even better, but there really wasn't much else as the characters seemed okay with they're designs, but isn't something I haven't seen before along with the school and other things although you can definitely tell between the differences of living standards for the female and male students.Now the Action which is the main sauce of the show is really good, enjoyable to watch and last for a good while which is definitely a good thing because I don't want fights that are over in seconds and luckily these fights can drag on for almost an entire episode which shows that the show stays true to it's word.There is also some other stuff that isn't in the genres like Comedy which was actually very funny, I liked the chemistry between Nomura and the girls as he usually jokes around with them when usually it's the other way around so it's nice to see a male protagonist getting the advantage over harsh female characters and there are a lot of jokes between the two sides that are really funny, there is also a fair amount of Ecchi/fanservice though not to the extent where it's distracting well except where Satori fights Nomura nude which is something that definitely surprised me, but the other moments like this are spread out very nicely and don't really go much further than that.Overall this was an entertaining show that could have a season 2, but considering that Nomura achieved his goal I'm very unsure and the way the show ended seemed fine so I'm not sure if this needs a second season, putting that aside this'll definitely be a good show for those fans who are looking for a good action anime."", 'STORY: 3/10CHARACTER: 4/10ART: 4/10SOUND: 7/10ENJOYMENT: 8/10OVERALL: 6/10The concept of turning delinquent’s boys into girls in order to be accepted in this school isn’t easy to swallow and it’s unclear how this alarming act of extreme violence is acknowledged by everyone under the name of ‘Peace’. The world building is retarded and extreme to the point where the school finds everything sexually wrong! To think this kind of mentality is drilled into all the students is scary, for who knows what the hell would happen once they spread out in society! The MC gets tortured just because he was in a picture with another naked girl??...Where did the girl’s punishment go?? Just cause she’s from the 5 Swords group, she is to be forgiven?? The fact that teenagers are carrying weapons (the 5 main girls are acquitted with real swords!) to physically beat men is not an acceptable premise nor the fact that those 5 main girls are dosed off on hormones and resort to actually killing each other for very stupid reasons! Do remember this show has no Comedy tag so I took it seriously and I didn’t enjoy a lot because the show couldn’t defend these ridiculous claims! So, I just switched off my brain and started watching this anime simply as a ‘Popcorn Flick’ and you know what? I started to have fun, was laughing at the well-timed jokes and all the craziness along with it! I realized you must accept this weird idea to enjoy the anime which worked like a charm! Despite the show’s promise at the beginning, it can’t seem to capitalize on it due to the lack in depth with its story and characters. And the Harem is simply shoved down our throats as every girl falls for the MC, I bought the first girl and was kinda okay with the second one, but the rest were just shoehorned! And they fall for him after he beats them in combat which is also achieved in a corny manner! So where does this anime work then? The answer is Comedy and I’m very surprised as to why this anime has no ‘Comedy’ tag. The jokes and their setups were bold in its execution, a little creative, a tad bit repetitive but they were timely performed. Sadly, the final arc was lazily told, choppy edited and stupidly rushed which leaves a bad taste in your mouth when all is said and done!Nomura (MC) comes off both cool and badass but he’s bland with very senseless and questionable motives that sometimes make him unlikable, no a better word is unrelatable. The work done on his facial expressions were lousy which didn’t help his case either but he’s not your generic clueless MC. Nomura is a hot-headed guy who just wants some peace and will do anything to get his freedom! Aside from him, all the characters are One-Note who have only 1 object on their minds! All the girls start as strong Feminist, but the main female characters slowly change after spending time with the MC. I am not gonna go into details because we have many girls here, but they all generally have some bad trait to them as well as a unique sword fighting style. They are cute sure, but they are also very stupid which makes them annoying, especially Satori and that French (or Spanish) wannabe girl with the wig and that maddening LAUGH!!! Empress is the only character that exhibits potential, but they even spoil her in the end by giving her no depth at all.The art is pretty much your average Harem anime style with choppy editing and I had a big problem with the character designs. The girls were well-defined, both in their looks, expressions and attires while Nomura had mediocre overall work done on him! Also, the Voice Actor for Nomura had an annoying voice to him which was a poor choice since the girls came off better in this department as well. The fight styles are a 50-50 to me! On one hand, they were more credible in the sense of being accomplished with pace and rhythm. No one was shouting their Special moves or style out loud, but they rather appeared as text at the bottom. But then the sword play displayed didn’t always look unique, sometimes it felt like they were just swinging around! The OP is nice, and while the soundtrack is nothing beguiling, I totally dig the ED due to its catchy tune.Yet despite all the fighting styles of the girls, Nomura beat them all with either his Special move or come up with some convenient technique which made the show predictable and boring. You would think the rest of the girls could have come up with some way to avoid his Special move but nothing of that sort is even mentioned! And the armour plot here is ludicrous to the point where a character would be get all slashed up and lose lots of blood but the very next day they are completely fine! The one arc which showed capacity was the past of the MC so they saved that till the end to create a finale for the show which sucked because they turned this into a bullshit cliched arc that was rushed and totally ruined the character, Empress for me! The final fight was decent, but the big payoff didn’t work because you aren’t invested in the feelings of the characters nor the story for it to work! How can you when you are given half episode of flashbacks as storytelling! The Comedy seriously saves this anime from a disaster as it kept you entertained for the whole 12 episodes. I am only giving this anime a high rating just cause the Comedy caught me off-guard because the rest is just meh. Where did the girl’s punishment go?? Just cause she’s from the 5 Swords group, she is to be forgiven??

I am only giving this anime a high rating just cause the Comedy caught me off-guard because the rest is just meh.', ""Armed Girls Machiavellianism is an anime that certainly improves as it goes along.  Every season, there usually some shows that I change my ratings for throughout their air time, no matter if it's lowering the score or upping it.  This anime anime was certainly one of the cases where I upped my score a little (at least in value, but not overall), but it wasn't until it was almost at the end (after episode 11).  I really liked it despite the aspects that can seem generic, but it felt different.  I'm not going to pretend I'm a critical person here because...I'm not all that critical most times.  This show felt different and it really drew me into what was happening on screen, but I want you to consider that this is not a review written by a critical person so do not try to star arguments over the review even though I know may people consider it generic; I just want to try to prevent trouble before it starts, even though the chance of it occurring is low, in my mind.Now at the basic level, the story has nothing more than a trouble making teenager, name Fudo Nomura, who is enrolled at a co ed school, that is completely dominated by females to the point that guys are expected to weir ugly female face masks and that even a group with elite sword skills, the supreme five swords, pretty much run much of the school and are in charge of correcting the males, especially the ones who don't follow the rules.  Surprisingly, it actually becomes a really good story that draws you into what is happening.  It shifts more towards focusing on Fudo earning his stamps on his permission slip so he can leave the academy while following the rules.  It starts off with him simply facing off against different girls in the five swords early on and becomes more entertaining and gripping later, and actually has some nice twists while still not being complicated.  Even though it seems like  a harem at times, it's not and it doesn't go overboard with the harem like scenes.  It becomes really character focused and is quite comedic, and the ending is amazing, considering how the show is.  I'll give the story an 8.The art seems different too.  It's not very colorful, but it certainly doesn't feel plain.  Some of the character designs are a little weird, such as with Satori, Rin, and Chouka.  They're not off putting, but the designs for Chouka and Satori do lower the art score a little for me.  The back grounds and actual animation seemed pretty consistent with some occasional drops at the beginning of episodes and a few times in the middle of certain episodes, but it's not that noticeable.  The character designs, backgrounds and animation quality were actually really good or even great as a whole.  The creators did a great job at making sure stuff didn't seem out of place and the times that the quality did drop seemed to be conveying a more serious tone when everything shouldn't be extremely vibrant and overly colorful.  I definitely feel like most of the main designs are really unique, despite some of them being creepy, like with Satori, and the animation quality drops didn't seem like it was just due to laziness.  Since there were some obvious quality drops though and 2 really weird character designs, Satori and Chouka, this category doesn't feel like it has earned a 9 in my book, even though I like the majority of the other designs a lot as well as the majority of the art, but I don't think there are enough problem to totally drop my score that much, so an 8 it is.The soundtrack has some great battle music  and other scores that added to the intensity of scenes really nicely.  Shocking Blue is actually a really good and maybe a great opening, but I'm thinking it's more towards the very good side.  Decide is one of the best ending themes I've heard; it really shows one of the anime's main messages with it's lyrics, which I'd say is that the characters stick with each through thick and thin when they get one another and they're not going to simply someone leave their side without a good reason.   That's my take on it anyway, and it's an unexpected one considering how the girls act towards Fudo early in the story, and how unlikely it is that a school dominated by females would have females that are willing to go through great lengths to keep a guy at their sides (not in the sexual way).  I give the music an 8.The character portion is difficult to describe and I'm only actually to describe Fudo Nomura.  Before, I'm asked why I would cut out the rest of main cast from my review, I'll give a simple reason.  Honestly, I find it hard to actually describe the girls in convincing words to people that probably have not watched the show yet, as I think my description would make them sound too generic and uninteresting.  I feel that the female cast,especially, needs to be experienced for yourself to actually determine if you like the cast or not.  I don't feel like my thoughts can be expressed clearly and concisely here and describing them wouldn't reflect my true thoughts.Now that I gave my reason, which is longer than I expected it to be, I'll describe Fudo Nomura.  He doesn't come off as a guy who thinks he is superior in every way to the girls he is fighting.  He doesn't seem to hold back in his fights and he doesn't fight to show off his skills.   The final episode explains why he fights in a great, yet very simple way.  He fights to show where he stands, and not just to win.  I think that is actually a great way to fight and it could help prevent you from clouding your judgement with rage and eagerness to win;  I'd rather win of course, myself, but I find it to be a great way to approach a fight still.  He interacts well with all the girls too despite his attitude about sticking to his ground and not agreeing to submission, very easily, when it even happens.  I find him to be a great mix between a capable main character and one that is viewed as weak.  He's not the best fighter and doesn't easily win fights without putting in effort like some characters, but he's not helpless either, and he certainly is capable of holding his own in martial arts based fight, which the type of fights seen int he anime.  I give the characters another 8.  It's not the best cast, but it's still a really good cast with a great main character.My enjoyment score is a 9  I always really enjoyed the anime, but I started to like it more and more gradually and the amazing ending for the way show is and everything else that happens throughout the last two episodes brought up my enjoyment score a bit drastically from the lower 8 range up to my current 9.  It's a show that surprised me and surpassed my initial expectations.I hope more people watch the show and like it.  It doesn't feel generic like many people think.

It doesn't feel generic like many people think."", 'Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism is a very simple, fast show. Unsurprisingly, I don\'t have much to say about it.The premise of a school overtaken by armed girls allows for a lot of crazy things to take place. There\'s a masculine guy fighting girls, each one with a different weapon and fighting style, there\'s a girl who has a bear, who he also fights in a sumo match, there\'s tons of fanservice that is implemented in a way that actually isn\'t just for the sake of itself, as it attempts to create some comedic situations and even characterize some with the sheer idea that they like to...walk around or fight without any clothes. I would say that the reason it works, is because of the main character himself.Homura is just a guy who wants to go to a normal school, and be a free, cool dude, but isn\'t allowed to. In order to be free he has to get stamps from all the higher ups in the girls\' ranks. Because the school is a correcting facility, he immediately is forced to uphold the law that says all boys will be turned into good citizens by turning them into transvestites (don\'t ask, I don\'t know what exactly is that supposed to help with as well. My best shot would be that it makes them lose all of their bravado and make them behave). He refuses, gets in a fight, falls on the girl he was fighting and accidently kisses her.Cue the cliche kissing music.Soon after all the other members of the ""Supreme Five Swords"" take interest in him and he has to beat them up and get them to act normally so they can give him the stamp. Slowly but surely they all warm up to him, he warms up to them and some drama starts occurring. Homura works well, because there\'s a lot of other viewpoints showcased bit by bit, he has a cheeky personality and his own, distinct fighting style, not to mention that he is ripped. All of this makes him a good, recognizable MC, doesn\'t feel like a self-insert at no point. He\'s characterized well enough. While his presentation feels fairly natural, with the characters Homura fights after the second half of the show, it can feel forced and rushed. The entire deal with the Empress in the last three episodes could symbolize that perfectly. It works, it\'s explained, but it has absolutely no impact as it feels like just another rushed characterization.If I were to talk about the girls and how they behave, I would take away most of the fun from this show. They don\'t exactly have deep personalities, though some have their reasons, so telling you what they are would get rid of most of the content. The most entertaining part about this show is by far meeting new girls and finding out about their fighting styles, their personalities and their reasons for getting interested in Homura. Once again, those aren\'t anything deep, but with so many cool, well designed characters, you do have this itch that tells you that you want to know more about them. Besides, you wouldn\'t need anyone\'s explanation to know what they\'re all about, this show doesn\'t hide it. It\'s always been very straightforward with their personalities.The visuals are fine, but because it is Silver Link after all, they only look okay because the things that are shown need little animation. There aren\'t many shots where characters actually fight, rather there are ones where they attack, cut into a different camera angle, another attack, another cut, the other person attacks, another camera cut. You can see how this can leave some less than impressive results. That\'s not to say that there aren\'t any impressive-looking moments, it\'s just that the it\'s really inconsistent. The art style itself is okay, the school is designed properly and there are different places for each fight, the character designs are great and can tell you a lot about their character just by looking at them, just as an example Rin wears half of a devil mask. Isn\'t that immediately intriguing? The fact that those sort of things get explained as you go is also a huge plus. Another thing that really caught my eye are the clothes and school uniforms. This show has a great sense of fashion, there\'s a lot of nicely fitting outfits with matching colors. I have to praise them for that.The director seems to have had some ideas as to how to present certain moments, there\'s surely a good amount of thought put into them, especially the mostly well scripted fight scenes, but there are periods of time where everything looks more generic than even it\'s art style. Not to mention some needlessly cheesy scenes, like the rose petals flying through the air as Homura and his last opponent get up close. It\'s not this kind of series, it never was, it doesn\'t fit. The directors tried quite a bit, but it wasn\'t quite enough.The sound is... well... it sure does exist and it sure does its job, but were I say more about anything other than the pretty good and fitting opening and the ending, I would have some hard time. The sounds of metal as it hits Homura and the instances where he uses his Magic Bullet are the only ones that stuck to me, despite there being much more. The silliest one would have to be the bear\'s voice actress who tries so hard to be mad and loud, but actually sounds frail and weak in each roar. That\'s not a positive by the way, it\'s almost pathetic. The soundtrack definitely improves all the scenes to some degree, but the musical directing isn\'t anything great here, just like the visual directing.This is about everything that you need to know about Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism without going into spoilers. If you want to watch it, you should. It\'s a solid battle series with a good, yet simple cast, gets better the more of them are introduced. It\'s easy to binge, looks pretty enough and has a lot of cool and dumb moments that should stick with you for a while. It has some solid comedic timing and knows how to script its fights and some casual scenes. Unfortunately this is about all it does and it had some weaker points here and there in terms of its writing, it always swirled around the mediocre to good range, however if you feel like spending some quality time with some quality armed waifus, you should give it a shot.As always, this is purely my opinion, I recommend you to develop your own. walk around or fight without any clothes. I would say that the reason it works, is because of the main character himself.Homura is just a guy who wants to go to a normal school, and be a free, cool dude, but isn\'t allowed to.

While his presentation feels fairly natural, with the characters Homura fights after the second half of the show, it can feel forced and rushed. The entire deal with the Empress in the last three episodes could symbolize that perfectly. It works, it\'s explained, but it has absolutely no impact as it feels like just another rushed characterization.If I were to talk about the girls and how they behave, I would take away most of the fun from this show. They don\'t exactly have deep personalities, though some have their reasons, so telling you what they are would get rid of most of the content. The most entertaining part about this show is by far meeting new girls and finding out about their fighting styles, their personalities and their reasons for getting interested in Homura. Once again, those aren\'t anything deep, but with so many cool, well designed characters, you do have this itch that tells you that you want to know more about them. Besides, you wouldn\'t need anyone\'s explanation to know what they\'re all about, this show doesn\'t hide it. It\'s always been very straightforward with their personalities.The visuals are fine, but because it is Silver Link after all, they only look okay because the things that are shown need little animation. There aren\'t many shots where characters actually fight, rather there are ones where they attack, cut into a different camera angle, another attack, another cut, the other person attacks, another camera cut. You can see how this can leave some less than impressive results. That\'s not to say that there aren\'t any impressive-looking moments, it\'s just that the it\'s really inconsistent. The art style itself is okay, the school is designed properly and there are different places for each fight, the character designs are great and can tell you a lot about their character just by looking at them, just as an example Rin wears half of a devil mask. Isn\'t that immediately intriguing? The fact that those sort of things get explained as you go is also a huge plus. Another thing that really caught my eye are the clothes and school uniforms. This show has a great sense of fashion, there\'s a lot of nicely fitting outfits with matching colors. I have to praise them for that.The director seems to have had some ideas as to how to present certain moments, there\'s surely a good amount of thought put into them, especially the mostly well scripted fight scenes, but there are periods of time where everything looks more generic than even it\'s art style. Not to mention some needlessly cheesy scenes, like the rose petals flying through the air as Homura and his last opponent get up close. It\'s not this kind of series, it never was, it doesn\'t fit. The directors tried quite a bit, but it wasn\'t quite enough.The sound is... well... it sure does exist and it sure does its job, but were I say more about anything other than the pretty good and fitting opening and the ending, I would have some hard time. The sounds of metal as it hits Homura and the instances where he uses his Magic Bullet are the only ones that stuck to me, despite there being much more. The silliest one would have to be the bear\'s voice actress who tries so hard to be mad and loud, but actually sounds frail and weak in each roar. That\'s not a positive by the way, it\'s almost pathetic. The soundtrack definitely improves all the scenes to some degree, but the musical directing isn\'t anything great here, just like the visual directing.This is about everything that you need to know about Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism without going into spoilers. If you want to watch it, you should. It\'s a solid battle series with a good, yet simple cast, gets better the more of them are introduced. It\'s easy to binge, looks pretty enough and has a lot of cool and dumb moments that should stick with you for a while. It has some solid comedic timing and knows how to script its fights and some casual scenes. Unfortunately this is about all it does and it had some weaker points here and there in terms of its writing, it always swirled around the mediocre to good range, however if you feel like spending some quality time with some quality armed waifus, you should give it a shot.As always, this is purely my opinion, I recommend you to develop your own.', ""This anime might seem same as any other harem anime, but the plot and the whole summary is actually pretty different. As we all know the main character is a transfer student and his new school has some weird rules where they force males to dress and act like a girl, but he refuses. Shojo part of the anime isn't bad either, character development as for the main character is pretty good but doesn't cover other supporting characters, well that's because anime itself is pretty short. Art is pretty solid and the sound isn't bad either. I gave it 10/10, yes it is a harem...anime but it also has a unique plot and if nothing it's pretty funny. So if you're not a huge fan of harem anime, watch this one just to laugh a bit. anime but it also has a unique plot and if nothing it's pretty funny.

We're a boarding school that helps delinquents such as yourself correct your ways and build a brighter future. Now our ways of rehabilitation are a bit different from your usual school. A group of 5 girls, known as the Supreme Five Swords, oversee everything that goes on here. All students are permitted to a baton to protect themselves from boys such as you, with the higher ranked students given more capable defensive measures. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the most important detail. You need to crossdress or we'll stab...you.Armed Girl's Machiavellism is about Fudou Nomura, the next kid on the chopping block for our weapon wielding students. Well, that was the plan, but he proved to be a little too much for them to handle. Soon, Nomura finds out he needs to acquire stamps from each of the Supreme Five Swords if he wants to have some freedom around his new stomping ground. So, he decides to go get them the best way he knows how. Brawling. The story seems interesting at first with its 1v1 showdowns, until it devolves into a simple harem creator. Defeat them, they respect you and usually fall in love with you. Throw in some mediocre comedy that can either have you slightly chuckling or groaning in disappointment, and it just doesn't give you much to like about it. With the word Machiavellism in the title, you expect perhaps a few mind games or betrayals to spice things up, but it doesn't seem to appear anywhere in the show. Just an expectation that ends up falling short.The main focus of the show is obviously the action as Nomura faces off against opponent after opponent, but it doesn't really do it well. Either it's repetitive and predictable, with Nomura's Magic Bullet defeating them left and right, or it's mixed in with some annoying dialogue and pop-ups explaining the different styles of fighting techniques shown in the anime, ruining the flow of the scenes instead of being informative. The animation is also quite shoddy, lowering the quality of the already lacklustre fights. You do get a few action scenes that feel pretty decent, but it just fails to keep its consistency across the show.The characters are interesting at first, I have to say that at least. Nomura is a pretty good main looking at his carefree personality and interactions with other characters, and the Supreme Five Swords and other recurring individuals have their own little quirks that make them quite likeable. The way some of them talk, bringing in other languages into their speech pattern, feels like an incredibly forced attempt at ethnicity, but it's tolerable most of the time. Some tragic backstories are also mentioned but not really explored, as if they were just trying to add some depth into their cast but decided to give up halfway. Then they start bringing up love and friendship. Again, how is this got anything to do with Machiavellism? It feels like the show had very little idea of where it wanted to take its characters, so they end up trying different things to try and figure things out.Armed Girl's Machiavellism has potential, but like plenty other shows before it, it fails to do anything special with what it has. It was slightly entertaining at times, but the negatives outweighed the little positives this anime had. There are probably a lot of people that could derive some type of enjoyment out of this, but sadly I cannot recommend this show to anyone.

Well.....JUST BECAUSE OUR MC DOESN\'T LIKE THE SCHOOL RULES.Yep, that\'s it that is the plot.The character design is okThe fights are pretty much our typical mc struggling and fighting the so called 5 swords(Who obviously lose).His so called yandere friend nearly kills him why well cause he hung out with...some other student.And guess what the ""Friend"" here is a girl(So very unexpected) And for some reasons of all the schools she could go to she would obviously land into the mc\'s school.And obviously our mc surely kicks ass even though he couldn\'t do it before.And did I mention that the mc has a harem in this? Wow so original some other student.And guess what the ""Friend"" here is a girl(So very unexpected) And for some reasons of all the schools she could go to she would obviously land into the mc\'s school.And obviously our mc surely kicks ass even though he couldn\'t do it before.And did I mention that the mc has a harem in this? Wow so original', 'If I had to describe this anime in one short phrase it\'d be ""shallow entertainment of the highest caliber"". I don\'t know that I\'ve ever seen a more simplistic, straightforward, dare I even say cookie cutter harem/action/school/comedy anime, at least not one I enjoyed this greatly. Still though, this anime knows what kind of show it is and I had a blast binging it.One thing that makes Armed Girl\'s Machiavellianism (that\'s the first and only time I\'m typing out that long-ass word in this review) stand out among its peers of the generic harem/action genre is that fact that effort was clearly put into the...action and fight sequences. Look, they ain\'t anywhere near KLK or TTGL level, but they\'re definitely above average and did enough to get me pretty hype at times. It\'s also worth noting that the animation quality does NOT drop after one episode like in some action anime. Likewise, the music, voice acting, and sound effects are also all-around very solid on a consistent basis, there wasn\'t any one thing I\'d single out as truly exceptional but it was all very good.I really liked the characters, even though the MC was very typical in a lot of ways and the girls were pretty much waifu-bait. One thing I will say about the MC is that he isn\'t a fucking wimp and even if everything else about him is pretty basic, that makes the anime a lot more enjoyable than if he were some pushover. I\'m a sucker for waifu-bait, so I liked most of the girls. It\'s ridiculous how quickly and easily they fall for the MC though. First they try to correct his ""delinquent"" behavior by challenging him in a fight (they use swords and he has sword-proof gloves and a special ""magic bullet"" move). Once he beats them, they go almost instantly from trying to chop his nuts off to trying to liking him and trying to protect him from the next girl who will try to chop his nuts off. It\'s just hilarious to me how quickly this transition happens, it\'s so bad and stupid that it\'s funny.When you get right down to it, with the girls falling quickly for the badass, charismatic MC and every other guy in the school being a submissive crossdresser (due to being ""corrected"" by the sword-wielding girls), this is pretty much the most obvious harem-wish-fullfillment type of deal you could possibly get. Just a word of warning, if you go in expecting any realistic male-female romantic interaction in this anime, you\'ll be taking it too damn seriously!The middle part of the anime was probably the best for me, the show has a pretty average climax, final fight, and ending (not one I would say is disappointing but didn\'t exceed expectations quite as well as the rest of the show). The beginning of the show introduces the characters pretty quickly and gives us a good fight right in episode one. The reason I say the show was the best towards the middle was because that was where the situations the fights took place in started really getting fun and ridiculous (sumo-wrestling a bear or fighting in a bath and using lewdness to distract and throw off your opponent for instance). It was a really fun ride and left me wanting more. Perhaps if this show were 24 episodes or so and there was more time for more of those fun, ridiculous fights to happen, I\'d have given this show an elite-tier rating of 8, but alas, it wasn\'t meant to be.Well, that about wraps up the bulk of this review. Chances are, if you read all that crap, you\'re either thinking ""damn, I gotta watch this show, sounds fun"" or ""yeah, no way I\'d enjoy this, I like a good story and/or dislike waifu-harem wish fulfillment"". Well, I don\'t actually know what you\'re thinking but I\'ve done my best to paint a pretty clear picture of what type of show this is, now it\'s your call if you wanna watch it or not. Personally, I really enjoyed this anime and I LOVED Satori, she\'s best girl for sure and is the latest victim in my ever-growing list of ""lesser known top-tier waifus who don\'t have nearly enough merch and fanart.""Overall score - 7.5/10 (Great) action and fight sequences.

But then recently, a guy called LexBurner made a video on this anime and portrayed it as more of an interesting attempt of following Kill la Kill (which I haven't watched, but will eventually after my exams).  This pepped my interest, and with Lex's description, I've decided to give it a...go.Holy **** this is enjoyable.First of all, aside from the mc, everyone is in some way as generic as it gets. You can tell by their designs which type of characters they are. The fun thing is that, at least in my opinion, the fact that they don't even hide it and use that trait exclusively makes it so much more fun to watch than those anime who try to pretend that their characters aren't generic. The mc, on the other hand, although not the most interesting character ever (I would attribute that to Okabe Rintarou), is entertaining to watch.Overall for the character, a solid 7Regarding the story, nothing happened aside from setting the scenes and characters in the first season through individual arcs. What I would say is that they are sometimes hilarious and in most cases not offensively stupid (not that it does not happen, don't get me wrong)Mediocre 5.5 (rounded up to 6, I'm not that picky)Art and music:Subjective feelings, don't have anything to comment onFor the enjoyment, WTF is this enjoyable. The most obvious element to this high score is our MC, his reactions to stuff happening around are genuinely interesting, which could be best shown through how he held back not touching the boobs even though his face shows that he obviously wants to. Another aspect is how the show will throw you off guard by going out of their way to do some stupidly hilarious yet not offensive stuff.For those who want serious plots, characters and themes like Steins;Gate, you're at the wrong place. For those who want to have a laugh to relieve stress, this might be what you want (as comedy is subjective)Overall a strong 7/10 go.Holy **** this is enjoyable.First of all, aside from the mc, everyone is in some way as generic as it gets.

I really can\'t fault the reviewers here, with the way things are in the world today, anyone under forty can\'t even comprehend common sense in relationships between men and women. Unfortunately that\'s going to make it impossible for them to enjoy this....Maybe they should take a few minutes and watch ""The Taming of  the Shrew"" to get their heads screwed on right.If you are going to enjoy this you need to treat it like the screwball comedy it is. Think of the front page, or Mr Blandings builds his dream house, it\'s not meant to resemble reality and it operates on not on logic but comedy logic.  The school is a stupid idea, so was Classroom of the Elite, Kakeguri, etc, etc. On it\'s own it\'s a maybe a 5 on the funny meter, and it\'s got about an 8 or a 9 on the interesting meter. You have to be willing to accept the idea and laugh with it.Once you get past the concept there\'s lots of good gags in here, unfortunately they\'re all at the chuckle or a little better level. The biggest problem is they overwhelmingly involve attacks with deadly weapons that also have wounds being inflicted. When a boulder falls on the coyote it\'s funny because he never gets hurt. If he got turned into bloody paste it\'s not only not funny it\'s really mood breaking.  Think of the life of Brian, where they take one of the least funny events in human history, the crucifixion and manage to turn it into a laugh riot. They just don\'t manage it here. Like I said they get chuckles but no belly laughs, which is a shame because it could have been better.There\'s also the problem of using the same gag too, toooo, toooo often.  Real proof that once it\'s funny, 50 times it\'s a migraine.The characters are a little too nasty to be truly funny and I certainly didn\'t feel for them.  The girls just didn\'t do it for me. You can have comic psychopaths, but it has to be handled as comedy. I don\'t know what\'s up with the Japan there\'s some things that just aren\'t funny. Imagine bewitched exploring Samantha being tortured by the inquisition, in serious fashion. It would ruin the show.  Nomura is OK but he never goes far enough and lets himself gets walked over too much.  That would have been fine if he was a doormat character but he isn\'t. They could of done themselves a favor by borrowing from William Shatner in the Trek episode Elaan of Troyius. It\'s a good watch for this and really shows fun ways to deal with yanderes. Taming of the shrew would have also been a good read for the writers.The voice acting is good. and the music is good but doesn\'t really maximize the comedy. I don\'t usually bother to score the opening and ending music because after the first time, but if you\'re interested it\'s some sort of bubble gum rock in Japanese.Final verdict, it\'s very watchable and enjoyable, but could have been a lot better.

Also theres one major antagonist who seems to have a past with the MC and she will likely be the last boss of the series.What was supposed to be a harem / ecchi filled boring shounem anime because of its cute and well developed charaters , the fierce battles , the intense dialogue and the good animation quality and ost  becomes maybe the AOTS.. altough the show is not over yet i get the feeling that the conclusion will live to expectations.

If you\'re on the hunt for another harem show, with the typical ""doesn\'t take shit from anyone"" MC (if I remember correctly) and typical tropes for the female characters, then you\'ve found the right show. Look, you and me both know, you didn\'t just randomly stumble upon this show. You probably searched up ""good harem shows to watch"". If that\'s the case, this show will most likely satisfy any of those ""harem cravings"" you get after watching bigger harem shows...like Nisekoi, Date a Live, High School DxD, The QQ, etc... Honestly, the show itself was really unmemorable - it wasn\'t anything special - but it\'s watchable.

Ending was pretty decent main climax was mediocre but overall I still liked watching. Don't know why people rate it so low though. From a specific angle, and in the right light, I get it kinda but it's just sad to see so many people disliking it. Not to say it's gold, there are plenty of...shows better than this, but it's still not as bad as you might presume. For a harem anime anyways. shows better than this, but it's still not as bad as you might presume. For a harem anime anyways."", 'In many respects this show is nothing we haven\'t seen before. Even the ""first boy to enter a previously \'all girls\' school"" gimmick has been tried and I have to be honest, although i\'ve watched my fair share of harem as something of a guilty pleasure i still consider it to be the lowest common denominator out of all of the genres short of maybe ""magical girls"".But all that said and out of the way, this show is not as it would appear by its cover alone. Ironically, despite the above being major pet peeves of mine, another is what i have come to dub...the ""Satsuki Kiryuin"" (Antagonist from Kill la Kill) Syndrome of high school plots. That in which the school president is always a female and controls more power than most mafioso bosses would care to brag about in public. Under which of course, all the boys are powerless to defend themselves or their dignity. I\'m all for strong female characters, but this trope is so exhausted at this point it completely lacks any mental flavour. Fortunately, we\'re given hints to the humanity Satsuki Kiryuin of Busou Shoujo\' a lot sooner than is typical of this character archetype, making her feel much more like a person.Thankfully, this show\'s main character comes from the Kazi no Stigma school of thought; where not only is he also a competent badass himself, but is also not afraid to duke it out with the ladies. A welcome tangent from the tired cliché\'s of contemporary chivalry we\'re saturated with these days. That\'s not to say he isn\'t a gentlemen when he feels like it, but the mix of minor narcissism and ego is a welcome ingredient we don\'t get enough of from our average MC\'s.Unfortunately, beyond the primary protagonist and antagonist the show unashamedly falls into some expected tropes, you could literally cut and paste the supporting characters from ""Hundred"" and been none the wiser. It is sad when a character exists purely on the merit of their cuteness, but this is part and parcel of a harem plot i suppose and i can only say it doesn\'t exactly fail in its intentions so i can\'t mark it down too much.There\'s really not too much to be said about the story itself, it\'s a fair foundation for the concept, i suppose ""if it aint broke, don\'t fix it"" applies here. Starting fresh in a new school environment is a common fantasy of many of us, even if it isn\'t original it is universally relatable; as is, for guys, getting into lewd situations with the ladies.One certainly can\'t really complain about the art either, it is more than sufficient with a pleasant attention to detail. In a way that is a skill in and of itself for the artist. Knowing where to invest your time and talents, the detail is exactly where it\'s needed, when it\'s needed and i can really appreciate that as a viewer.There is a certain element of parody/irony involved as far as the humour is concerned which i can also fondly appreciate. It\'s not really a part of the story per se and frankly speaking the story could be a lot better if it really wanted to to make the show a real piece of art, but it\'s doing an adequite job of supporting the characters to get the basics in and the humour is just a bonus for enjoyment. the ""Satsuki Kiryuin"" (Antagonist from Kill la Kill) Syndrome of high school plots.

In order to ""protect"" the girls from the boys, they are all allowed to carry weapons and there is a council of sorts which distributes punishments to boys who steps out of line or don\'t submit by feminising themselves. In comes the MC...who refuses to bow down and is a saviour to ""all men"". Honestly this show is like the wet dream of anyone who frequently uses the terms ""feminazi"" or ""SJW"" or ""whiteknighting"".Anyway my first crtiicism is why is it set in a school? It makes no sense, the characters never go to classes or anything, it just seems like a poor excuse to have teenagers get into awkward erotically charged situations. This could have been easily set in a world outside of a school where women are the dominating gender and it would have had the same effect. Actually that would have made more sense as it feels abit stupid that the council has some weird judicial authority over the other students. But that\'s never explained to any extent. The school is just a backdrop that could be any location.My second criticism is that ultimately the show has a shallow core plot. We have basic motivations to propel the story but they wring hollow when there is such terrible world building because honestly what the anime does is set the stage and then it\'s the MC fighting one girl after the other.My third criticism and subsequently what annoyed me the most are why are the girls on this show so fearful and hateful of the boys? It makes no sense for teenagers of that age. It is literally a way to make the girls seem irrational in their beliefs and ripe for ""correction"" and ""submission"" by the MC.Art 5The show is animated passibly enough. It won\'t wow you in any way or make you cringe at how terrible it is. And that extends to the art direction which for a show that prides itself on it\'s ridiculousness is disappointing. I mean the show isn\'t really stylised or anything so it stands out like for example ""Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls"", neither are the action sequences aimated with any panache like ""High School DxD"", nor are the character designs anything out of the ordinary aside from possibly the cross-dressing side character. I mean I guess for me the ultimate test would be, imagine you saw someone cosplaying as a main character in this show some months down the line after seeing this. Would you instantly recognise who they were? And my honest answer would be no because they all kind of look like any other derivative character.Everything just feels so bland.Sound 5I usually skip the Opening and Ending but I went back and listened ot them for this review. They\'re both alright, catchy tunes but don\'t seem to stand out or I guess ""fit"" the show but since the show is so generic, I guess it\'s kinda appropriate.The VA\'s\'s do a pretty good job considering the quality of the rest of the show, but there\'s only so much you can do with a  paper thin script.Character 3Well the fact that even having seen all the episodes I only really knew the names  of 2 characters off the top of my head should tell you how invested I am in them. But let\'s look at each of them in abit more detailFirstly Nomora Fudou is our typical hgihchool MC for this type of show. He is cocky, powerful, carefree, noble and lewd... oh you say the last two contradict each other... well yeah they really do, see the thing is Nomura as a character doesn\'t make much sense. His motivation in the anime is something along the lines of gaining some freedom and the shows creators are content with that being that, it\'s the basic catalyst for him to challenge the girls to a fight but it does nothing to advance his character in any way or give him any depth. Going back to his nobility/lewdness contradiction, the personality conflict ususally plays out with his interactions with the girls, he will outright flirt with the or make creepy remarks but yet will act all noble and such when they reciporcate or offer themselves (ugh) to him. And it\'\'s not presented in a way where he\'s playing with them, rather it\'s a genuine contradiction in his character making his intentions truly hard to follow.It has to be said, being a harem show, all of the girls will to different extents gain some kind of feelings for the MC, he will \'break the ice\' around their hearts so to speak. The problem comes where all that is truly required is that he beats them in a fight (aka tames them) which does nothing to make them truly intriguing and that\'s their collective main trait alongside being women who want to subjugate men. But they all have their secondary traits to distinguish them I guess:Onigawara Rin - The first girl is the stereotypical tsundere character... you\'ve seen them in a number of shows, nothing different. She has a little backstory but it\'s so transparent that it\'s just there to show why she is interested in Nomura.Kikakujou Mary - arrogant, rich girl who is half french... again you\'ve seen her hundreds of time and when they come to her focus episode you know where things are going.Hanasaka Warabi - One of two loli characters. Probably the most interesting because of her replationship with her pet bear and is kinda bratty I guess, her moivations aren\'t made very clear except that she feels the first two didn\'t do their jobs properly, after she loses she\'s just kinda there. She is really just the child with the bear.Tamaba Satori - Your first Yandere like character... erm psycho airhead, again nothing much to be said about her. She has some backstory regarding her sister but it\'s just there to emphasise how unhinged she is.Tsukuyo Inaba - Your second loli character. They imply that shes really powerful throughout the whole show and then in the end she still plays a semi damsel in distres role.Amou Kirukiru  - Your second Yandere character. She\'s the main antagonist but she barely has a presence in the whole show and only really appears at the end. Typical psycho with only the basic of motivations all centered around Nomura.There are some side characters but honestly they\'re just there, there\'s nothing worth writing about them.So there you have it, basic character tropes with motivations purely centred around the MC..Enjoyment 5In spite of my criticisms, the show has it\'s moments. I don\'t mind the ecchi content and the type of humor that can come with it. Whilst alot of jokes fall flat, it had a few laugh out loud moments such as a hallway scene where Nomura has to hide behind the pet bear so not to be seen.The fight scenes were passable but never truly exciting or engaging. I never felt a sense of danger for the MC because ultimately for a harem show about ""correcting"" women you knew he was going to come out on top so they fell flat. I think the best fight scene was likely the first one when you\'re still assessing the show and learning about the characters. When the second fight scene ends almost the same as the first than you realise the rest of them are likely to follow the same trend and thus they lose all their excitementOverall 4 (Honestly I don\'t know how 4 can be ""decent"" and be between poor and mediocre)Really what can I say? This show will likely please the viewers who see ""feminism"" as the ultimate evil and that women need putting in their place or something. But for everyone else they should avoid it. It does nothing to stand out from the crowd. The ""Plot"" is contrived, the characters are walking stereotypes,the animation is passable though not offensive, the fight scenes won\'t keep you at the edge of your seat, the jokes can be hit-or-miss depending on your sense of humour. This show tries to combine alot of elements of better anime and ultimately doesn\'t excel at any of them. Your time could be better spent watching something of a higher quality.Last little tidbit... be wary of the shows message and really think critically about what it\'s saying. This show isn\'t a ""hurrah"" for male gender rights all it is doing is enforcing existing stereotypes for both sexes. who refuses to bow down and is a saviour to ""all men"".

The school has the 5 swords which are 5 of the best girl fighters and the empress. These 5 swords force boys to act feminine or leave the school.Our protagonist Nomura is a new transfer student and he is like ""No way freedom for all"" and then for some reason he has to fight all of the 5 swords.The story is...dumb, really dumb. It honestly makes no sense why he is even fighting the 5 swords but each arc is based on fighting one of the fight swords. Every time he wins the 5 sword member joins his side for some reason...Except near the end where they are just rushing to try and end the series so the last member just joins him without any logical sense.Art: 5/10It\'s okay but nothing special. The fight animation isn\'t that special either and neither is the art style. But it ain\'t terrible.Sound: 5/10The OST does it\'s job but it ain\'t memorable whatsoever. The sound effects are decent as well.Characters: 3/10The characters feel different from one another. However, the characters just side with the MC after being beaten and some fall for him for no logical reason. The side characters also support him because???The only potentially interesting character was Amou the Empress who only properly does something at the end but it was rushed so it just gets resolved in a poor fight. The abilities don\'t make too much sense either like auto counter but it\'s a shounen so whatever.Enjoyment: 5/10It was okay and that is really it dumb, really dumb.

Do you remember when you were a kid and you had to eat those veggies your mom cooked for you? Well I do and I seriously always hated it but the meal always came with veggies and some meat. You see, i would always take a bite from the meat and then from the veggies. The veggies tasted like fcking crap compared to the meat. And it would go on like this, every single meal.And the same thing is happening to this anime here. I mean honestly this isnt anything good, mediocre at best. But the thing...is, when you always watch good anime, like anime with the score of 8 or higher, then at some point you dont realize how awesome it is. You gotta watch the anime thats a bit ""shittier"" after the good ones or else you (or maybe just I) wont be able to enjoy the good ones. And i took a long time to realize that. To realize that the veggies made the meat taste so awesome. And to realize that the veggies tasted like shit because they were made by my mom.Story - 5-little spoilers (only the first few episodes)-It isnt anything special. A dude comes to a school that has recently become coed after being a girls only school for a long time. And the girls were terrorized from the guy so they began to wield weapons. The dude is a typical guy who seems weak af at the start but then has some hidden tricks and skills and starts beating the girls who wield those weapons. They then fall in love with him and stuff like that, so generic.... but not really bad because its a safe plot i guess...Art - 8Art is probably where they can score the most. Characters are looking good and the background and scenes as well. The anime earned itself a praise here *hurray*Character - 5Like i said, the guy seems weak but then has hidden skills. So nothing special about the dude. The girls (black hair and blondie) who fall in love with him are basically the same character but with different appearances. Both highly tsundere, both in love with MC... The only difference may be their fighting styles.Enjoyment - 7I actually quite enjoyed the fights. The MC has his special hand to hand combat skills whilst fighting against swords. Here perhaps we have something original.Overall - 6They go with a plot and character which were already used in many other animes. The result is that the anime isnt particularly bad but isnt anything special. As an anime you watch whilst eating your meal or something i can probably recommand it.

You know, the usual shit.Story: 6Usual school setting, with MC being surrounded by girls and ""girls"". MC starts as a transfer student, and works up his position as he conquers one girl after another. Episodic pacing with a new foe appearing on every episode, which ends with one goal, defeating the final boss. At least it has commentaries on martial art and sword-style on every battle scene.Art: 7Heroines design was fine, but MC design a bit derpy, and the ""girls"" too, I suppose it was intentional so the Heroines will look much better. The battle scene and the blade...movement were fluid, so this one may pass as a battle show. The only downer is that MC finishing move animation that keep getting used every single episode. I guess it can\'t be avoided, with this episodic structure something will get used again for several times.Sound: 6Standard bgm during fights and daily live scenes, Op-Ed was ok. Overall, not that noteworthy.Character: 9This is a very common genre, with a lot of characters appear on a single show. Many characters appear in them are so bland and forgetful like overused templates. But in this show at least, they are not. Since it has episodic structure, every heroine only have 1 episode focusing on them save the last boss. But even so, the uniqueness of the character stick to the very end of the show. Something that somehow rare in shows with this kind of genre. And the MC is not that wimpy either. Again, something that somewhat rare.Enjoyment: 7The battle scene alone is something to look forward for every episode. And the character uniqueness won\'t make you get bored with daily life scene.Overall: 7The usual shit genre with some unique Characters and decent fight scenes.

Since it has episodic structure, every heroine only have 1 episode focusing on them save the last boss. But even so, the uniqueness of the character stick to the very end of the show. Something that somehow rare in shows with this kind of genre. And the MC is not that wimpy either. Again, something that somewhat rare.Enjoyment: 7The battle scene alone is something to look forward for every episode. And the character uniqueness won\'t make you get bored with daily life scene.Overall: 7The usual shit genre with some unique Characters and decent fight scenes. Worthy to be watched once at least.', 'TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism (referred to as BSM from here on out) is surprisingly enough not a show about Machiavelli, but of a student named Nomura. Nomura has transferred into a formerly all girls school, but is now what is essentially a correctional facility. Either you be corrected into being a drag queen, or you get stabbed by some girls. Interesting story, right?While BSM is at the end of the day just another one of your action/harem shows, it\'s enjoyable enough. Nomura\'s ""I give zero fucks"" attitude is refreshing compared...to the ""I\'m dumb as hell and can\'t figure out 6 girls like me"" harem MC. From day one at school, he\'s already getting attacked in the form of being corrected by Rin, the first of six harem girls. Of course, Nomura ends up showing his badass-ness and wins the battle... and ends up kissing her due to a sidekick hitting him which forced the kiss situation. *sigh*On the other hand, you have a pure french girl who secretly wants to be dominated, an emotionless but insanely cute girl who while is okay with being nude herself whilst fighting, can\'t focus if the male MC is at the same time. Following up is a girl who owns bears for a living (bonus point for being the ""Kyohohohoho"" of the season), an insanely dangerous loli, and the main antagonist Amou. Amou was made to be this untouchable godlike fighter, but of course falls to Nomura\'s badass tactics in what started as a somewhat interesting fight that inevitably degraded into a match of fisticuffs. Excellent. Did I mention that Amou secretly wanted Nomura[\'s dick] super badly?Hardly worth mentioning, but Silver Link. gave us some nice animation and art, along with some rather okay music. The OP is insanely fun to listen to for the first 15 seconds.TL;DR: BSM is another action/harem show but is surprisingly enjoyable due to the MC\'s ""not giving a fuck"" attitude. The nonsensical way the fights play out are fun to watch, as well as playing ""best girl of the show"" simulator (it\'s Satori, by the way). Overall, a fun watch even if it does get boring from time to time. to the ""I\'m dumb as hell and can\'t figure out 6 girls like me"" harem MC.

Overall, a fun watch even if it does get boring from time to time.', 'Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism (Bloody long ass name, gonna call it Busou for convenient reviewing) is an anime trying to combine and revolutionize the shounen action genre along with harem romance but fails miserably. However, it does manage to do a few stuffs right, even though trivial. The theme may seem catchy and innovative at first, but once dwelling into the show it eventually exposes itself as a self-repetitive formula that grows predictable really quickly.Story (5/10)The story starts off fairly cliche; A male character is thrusted forcibly into an all-girls high school... pretty sure I\'ve seen this plot trope somewhere. (/s) Anyways, instead of starting off...as a beta male indulging in the unrequited, unexplainable and unreasonable love from all the female cast out of nowhere (Basically all the old school harem genres), the MC, Nomura Fudou, is forced to take on the girls in an action-packed swordfight... only that the male MC uses ""guns"". Not sure how is that fair, but whatever. Even though the story did well differentiating from oldschool repetitive harems, viewers will soon realise the fact that it does in fact offer little to no difference to the newer magical school harem genres (Looking at you Rakudai and Akashic records etc), which is basically having the unbelievably badass main character beat the girls into submission. Are all the female cast masochists or something? Not to mention the formula is used several times, first on the mask girl, then the british trope girl, then a bear riding girl, then Satori (Sorry, shes the only girl I remember in this series) then the auto-counter girl. Everything repeats, not to mention the characters seemingly set up to die always ended up not dying in the end. Oh the suspense, but guess character death shouldn\'t be expected or else this anime will probably venture into a different genre altogether.In short, unique setting, trashbag repetitive execution that disappoints and fails to use the setting into its full potential.Characters (3/10)Firstly we have Nomura, the badass main MC. Oh well, at least this is not some Yuuki Rito so at least hes plenty bearable, but the fact that he never even falters a single bit or breaks down shows little to no character development and character depth whatsoever. Then we have the mask girl, which I reckon to be of the generic tsundere trope present in almost every single anime in the recent years. No idea why she wears a mask all day since her actual face looks much better, but I guess its just a lazy effort to make the character more special? Of course we also have the british blonde, almost mistook it for the Cecilia something from Infinite Stratos since they\'re exactly alike and the creators literally made no effort to differentiate anyway. The bear riding girl is slightly more bearable since she does not show obvious feelings against Nomura and is plenty more badass than the first two female cast, but forgettable nonetheless. (Also what the hell is that fashion sense?) Then we have Satori who has at least decent depth as the reasons why she became ""emotionless"" and her past are at least explored and touched upon, not to mention she doesn\'t fit existing anime tropes. After that we have the twintail middle-school girl who is somehow in high-school (Hey its anime, logic doesn\'t apply here) and then we have the auto-counter girl who obsess with Nomura over a reason normal humans should not find as a reason to obsess over with, but guess hyperbole is the only way to go when the writers cannot think of a decent reason for her to go over the male MC.Also, they introduced lots of side characters, but apart from the ugly ladyboy no one is even close to rememberable because they are fucking irrelevant anyway.Art (7/10)The fighting scenes doesn\'t really flop in animation, and the art are generally okay compared to recent animes so not much of an issue there. The detail in the twintail girl\'s eyes are nice to see at least.Sound (5/10)The opening theme is quite catchy, I\'ve always find myself listening to the first part of the OP but right after the dedededededede sound finishes I skip to the main show anyway. ED is forgettable. I\'ve not noticed any outstanding OSTs as well, but nothing unbearable.Enjoyment (6/10)Despite being a repetitive formula, the show still manages to bring me some enjoyment. Once you shut your brain off, ignore the details and the obvious predictions that this and that are going to happen (And it definitely does), at least the fighting scenes are quite enjoyable and the suspense brought to the brink of death of some characters kept me slightly on edge (BUT THEY DIDN\'T DIE IN THE END WHAT A SURPRISE. COME ON.)Overall (5/10)In short, if you are expecting quality or innovative material / plot, look away. However if you are looking for something random and ridiculous to fill your time this can be an okay choice, considering its much more bearable compared to dirty copypasta harems like Hundred and the likes, but generally you shouldn\'t come in bearing expectations for anything spectacular. as a beta male indulging in the unrequited, unexplainable and unreasonable love from all the female cast out of nowhere (Basically all the old school harem genres), the MC, Nomura Fudou, is forced to take on the girls in an action-packed swordfight... only that the male MC uses ""guns"".

Fairly standard combat scenes. Fairly standard characters. Nothing really special about the show to make it stand out.The story is fairly basic.. guy has to fight 5 girls who after winning become thirsty for him then has to fight the big baddie who was thirsty the whole time. so he can get a pass to leave the school for reasons. that may sound a bit over simplistic but it is the throughline for the show.. not an entirely compelling story but not the worst I\'ve seen.The characters of the show are fairly standard they some characters...pretend to be from other cultures but fail.. two i think..I assume the ""french"" girl was supposed to be putting on an act. The MC was fairly solid not as pushover as some but still fell into the normal accident happens wamen walk in and freak out cliche. There was one that was different though she had the feel of Luck from Black clover..The sound in it was fairly good. proper timing and decent picks. The art was solid too no noticeable drops in quality and the fights flowed well.Overall I would recommend watching this show though don\'t expect a masterpiece it is a good time burner though if you have some to spare. pretend to be from other cultures but fail.. two i think..I assume the ""french"" girl was supposed to be putting on an act.

The story does not get too deep as it is purely focused around the fighting and the struggle of the main character.

Loved this title.  Funny and even touching when it wanted.Anyone hating this hasn\'t got a soul.This ""make an uber long review"" stuff is one of the reasons that MAL has such a terrible reputation these days - that and the completely self-indulgent, holier-than-all purveyors of Anime value and quality are why the general consensus is that MAL is a twisted piece of garbage.  I wonder if those elitist dbags understand...that.  Casting their vicious hate far from the genres which they personally hold on high - trying to put down the individual tastes of any who do not kaotao and conform to their bias.  Waging campaigns with mega manipulative voting as evangelists of ""good taste"" in Anime.

Again, a friend recommended it to me. I regret saying ""pass"" today. It\'s a very good anime if you\'re into bad-ass main characters.At first, I didn\'t like the anime because I don\'t like delinquents that much, I\'m into intelligent gentlemen. But I didn\'t hesitate to continue. Continuing to watch this series, it has caught my attention. I realized there was a bit of romance and the anime is action-packed, which is really good.Story - Unique story but it is somehow strange. I don\'t understand why the boys have to cross-dress. Just punishing...them is fine. I think it\'s a stupid idea, don\'t get me wrong. Aside from that, the main character is opposed to cross-dressing, well, he wants freedom. Not gonna post spoilers, but it\'s really good, a bit rushed, but it has a unique, beautiful concept. 7/10.Art - The animation is good, hands down. The animators put a lot of time creating the action scenes. The character designs are pretty nice, but I don\'t understand why the main heroine was told to be ugly, when she is heavenly cute. I\'ve got only a few to say here so I\'ll just rate 8/10.Sound - The voice acting is cute in this one. Again, the voice acting is filled with effort, and I like it. Oh and I don\'t skip the OP\'s of this anime, it\'s beautiful. 8/10Character - Unique characters. A delinquent, a girl who isn\'t self-confident about her own face, a girl who is emotionless, and a whole lot more. The chemistry of the main character to all those girls almost make a harem, it\'s good. The likability of the main character is really high, even those who are opposed to his characteristics will like him. 8/10Enjoyment - I\'d say I enjoyed it. Though in some episodes, I fast forwarded a bit because it bores me. But aside from that, it is really enjoyable. 7/10Overall - 8/10. Surprisingly good. I highly recommend this to those people who like action-romance anime that doesn\'t involve intense amount of magic. them is fine. I think it\'s a stupid idea, don\'t get me wrong.

It\'s just another ""seen one, seen them all"" harem anime.  It\'s the exact same plot as always: Rebellious, highly skilled male enters a world of hostile females and conquers their hearts one by one until the climax comes and is the usual, cop-out finish.   This one however, tended to have more logic holes than most.  For example: (Spoilers):The goal of Nomura was to get all the stamps of all the 5 swords girls.  But, the point of this was never explained and once he got them, he used them for a...reason that he didn\'t even know he would need it for until the final 5 minutes of the episode.  So, what was his actual purpose in attaining them?  Not explained.The relationship between Nomura and Amou is based off of a 10 minute interaction.  You go the whole anime thinking there was something deeper between the two and their history, but it was literally a handshake, a brushed off tour and some little pink haired trap getting punched.And of course, there was the nonsensical ""joke"" the Headmistress decided to play at the end, all to build up tension in an anti-climatic, cliched anime.The plus side of the anime is that Nomura was kind of cool for an MC.  Cocksure, rebellious, not a ""nose-bleeder"" in the face of sexuality, but not pervy, either.  The rest of the cast however, was your cut and dry harem.  The rigid rule-keeper, the western influenced character, the really out there one, the quiet one, and the arrogant one.  About the only mild difference here was Amou the Yandere final boss.  But, the connection was so weak with her and Nomura, it just kind of fell flat.The action was interesting, but not anything particularly amazing.  I hate animes that talk about ""killing"" in a setting where you already know no one is going to actually die. It\'s just stupid.  That took away from some of the action, as I spent more time thinking like: ""Yeah, sure they\'re dead."".It wasn\'t a total borefest, obviously, because I watched it all.  It has some moments of humor in there and watching Nomura is interesting.  But, overall, this was a completely mediocre harem anime and you don\'t really need to waste your time watching it.Story: 5Art: 5Sound: 5Character: 7Enjoyment: 6Overall: 5 reason that he didn\'t even know he would need it for until the final 5 minutes of the episode.

I mainly picked up this show because I saw clips of the English dub\'s handling of the various gap moe laughs present.

As such, with being categorized as a harem type, I was very reluctant to even watch it. IMO, harems are too arrogant, presumptuous, fantasy since they involve several females interested in the one MC.Anyways, I gave it a shot and was pleasantly surprised. There were 5+1 main females so you know the story will somehow progress thru one of them at a time. There personalities and backstories though were quite interesting. As well, it was refreshing, to me, that not all but only 2+1 of them had a romantic angle with...the male MC. Also, I liked the fact that the male MC had a clear preference for one girl (not a bad choice) ..... not the common theme where he likes all of them ""equally"". Finally, it surely has been done before, but the one intense/weird love that the ""+1"" female had for the male MC was also quite an attractive/hot relationship explored in this story. the male MC.

I may be generously giving it a 2, but so far has been repeated, a guy comes to girl school, and all girls hate him, so the girls in charge, with no real teaching authority do as they please even if they want to kill people.    The guy even if he wins of course, holds no malicious feelings, which makes it more retarded.The protagonist goes...for the typical tropey clueless male who has no idea on how to talk to women, or who likes him, as is not a trope we have seen 1000000 times before.   This just seems your usual crappy end harem/ecchi anime where people didn't want to think, and just copy a similar from previous animes.The stupidest part is even if you come to a school and behave, you are still punished for past actions or rumors that the sort of shitty anime we have here.   The fact is, if you're looking for a decent harem, this isn't it.   If you're looking for great ecchi, again this isn't it, especially with the mediocre artwork.

It just sucks and am at the stage where thinking of hitting the button a few times to skim the episode to know the outcome, without the pain of having to watch the show for the typical tropey clueless male who has no idea on how to talk to women, or who likes him, as is not a trope we have seen 1000000 times before.   This just seems your usual crappy end harem/ecchi anime where people didn't want to think, and just copy a similar from previous animes.The stupidest part is even if you come to a school and behave, you are still punished for past actions or rumors that the sort of shitty anime we have here.

And like that was not enough...the show immediately slaps us with the second clishie (all girls school become co-ed) to justify the amount of “plotwearers” per centimeter, but, oh, the harem and echhi tags are nowhere to be seen! Was I misjudging it the whole time? Let’s move on and see.And now we are moving on to the part where I can finally express all the mixed feelings that I got from this show.Story – 3:There is no much meaning chattering about almost nonexistent story in the show, which simply reusing shounen formula (character finds a rival, defeating him and befriending/getting him out of the MC way) to create a minimal sense of progression. And yeah, sure one can argue that closer to the end we will get ideological fight between old rivals, but that does no change the fact that all show might be described with one sentence without loss of information.BUT there is a wide space for discussion it’s structural flaws and where it fails and succeed in it’s tries to achieve the goal of being an entertaining show: And first step in this is actually find out what the show tries to deliver to the audience, as you might’ve seen or guessed the comedy + shounen mix, does not necessarily need a deep and complex storyline to shine, so the trouble is obviously not in the shallowness of the story, but rather in a way it working with a tension and delivering… well trying to deliver atmosphere to the audience: from the very beginning the MC looks like a underdog, but manages to surpass any difficult situations he faces, and while this is a typical for the shounen genre to come with that type of fights this show in particular over exaggerating  the fact that “good” character are underdogs by such a degree that instead of tension it builds us the comic atmosphere, which looks rather depressing from the viewers perspective. Which might be considered a good thing in a situation, when show by itself comes with a playful attitude it’s just enhances it. Unfortunately, when it actually tries to create a dark or tragic atmosphere it fails miserably due to that simple mistake, as a result most of the fight scenes looks dull and boring.Graphics – 2:This is the part is one of the most essential parts in a shounen series, because without a good graphical part it is literally impossible to create satisfying fight scenes. And this is the place where you going to slap yourself into the face a few times, because oh boy it feels like the author does not know anything about fighting or artistic ways of creating a fighting scenes. So what do we have here? The artstyle is pretty simple, the action scenes are quite slow and unartistic, big thanks to our beloved typical anime troubles such as “compulsive technique name showing (yep, not even screaming showing)” and total misrepresentation of the weapon damage, and don’t get me wrong, I’m not asking for ultrarealistic fights with structural damage after just a one sword hit, but this time around the anime represents weapons as something utterly useless, because the ultimate bladed weapon in this show is bare hands… I’ve seen a lot of weird things but in anime before, but this is just too much… And if you ask me why it got into graphics section? The reason is simple the problem is exactly in the way they draw the wounds.Sound – 1:Music is not only essential for almost all genres, but it is pretty much a defining feature of anime as a whole. Shounen genre in particular wants the flashy backgrounds for the fighting scenes, but instead of juicy epic soundtracks this show provides us with literally nothing, but disappointment. The OP an ED songs are the essence of the word generic, the BG is almost not existing.Characters – 5:Despite all characters of this show is suiting the whole theme of 100% clished, they provides enough for he show to fulfil it’s needs. Some of them are even getting some actual background info in the later parts of the show, which does not help the to evolve from onetrope effigies state, but at least gives the viewers some reasoning behind their actions earlier on.Enjoyment – 6:With all that said show still manages to look good due to the unpretentious needs of it’s genre mix and provides an interesting experience, when you are seeing that the show is terrible by the nature, but still continue to watch, because it’s manages to amuse you in a special ways, which is not available for the good shows (such as constant “can it become even worse?” question in a positive way).With all that said I think that you have already got pretty accurate idea of what show will give you, so I feel that forcing my opinion onto you at the very end would be a bad idea. the show immediately slaps us with the second clishie (all girls school become co-ed) to justify the amount of “plotwearers” per centimeter, but, oh, the harem and echhi tags are nowhere to be seen!

Initially, the girls all loathe and distrust men, true. They attack the man protagonist without cause and generally make his life miserable. But, this is representative of society\'s misconception for what feminism is all about. These girls start out as the ""feminazi"" stereotype, violent, hateful and overbearing. The MC is introduced as someone just wanting a fresh start who wants to put his...past behind him and lead a peaceful existence. He\'s not allowed to do that though, due to the ""feminists\'"" distrust and violent tendencies. They immediately begin attacking him and putting him in a position in which he has to defend himself. The man is made the victim.Ultimately, through the awesome power of his male-ness, he defeats each female in turn. After each girl\'s defeat, the former ""feminist\'s"" actions are those of a woman who cannot overcome her adoration of her abusive spouse. Every girl who has fallen into the MC\'s harem only did so after being defeated by him and sexually intimidated by him (even if mistakenly so). Each girl was ""put in her place"" (so to speak) by a male and went from powerful, angry, dominant women to subservient, starry-eyed bubbleheads.At the story\'s end, all of the females have been knocked down a peg by the main villain and need to be rescued by their knight in shining armor, a male. The main villain is, of course, a psychotic woman whose only motivation seems to be that if the male protagonist won\'t be hers, then he must die.This is not feminism.

At least for light novel harems, having it set in a school without magic is actually quite rare, so much so that nothing else comes to mind.But while there are no magic abilities, which in theory should open up a...lot more creativity on the part of the author (which sounds strange now that I think about it, but it says a lot about the current state of anime), the author instead goes for the most traditional, by the book route of creating abilities.The main character has a special item that lets him negate other people's attacks, yawn. It's the same thing that's been done over and over again.My biggest problem with this series is just that, why have no magic even though you're using the same exact ability tropes as any other magical high school anime?Everything from the character abilities, to the relationships, to the arc structure, to the character writing, to the sound design, to the shot composition, EVERYTHING feels extremely standard and boring, almost as if it's one of the many mass produced anime nowadays meant only to sell merchandise.Even with all I've said, if you enjoy stupid battle high school harems either for the mindless fun, the T&A, the blushes, or whatever you fancy these kinds of shows for, it's everything you would enjoy in that type of show, and there's nothing wrong with enjoying some stupid fun.There's certainly a crowd that enjoys these kinds of shows and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

At least I find the pacing good. The art and animation is on par with other animes, nothing new. The characters were meh. Even the main character was boring. There’s a bit of character development on some of the cast, but it didn’t save the anime.I did enjoy watching the all to common anime tropes...happening in the series. I also like the fact that they elaborate and explain every sword technique that was happening on screen. As viewers, we are after all not familiar with those information.

Before we get down to the nitty gritty, it is only fair to tell you that you are about to experience the GroveWarden school, secret technique: ""Shitty review"". You\'ll hopefully get this joke if you unfortunately decide to watch this travesty.The story is fairly crappy. Or at least its told poorly. I am a sucker for bad story and terrible plot development, but this one was just silly. You get the story in batches, however the main plot revolves around a boy who joins what is now a CO-ED school. This school is...populated by woman who are afraid of men and are armed and given the power to run the school. This part of the story goes on for most of the show. Our main character must fight for his freedom in this female ruled school.Certain characters have flashbacks or outright tell you some parts of their story. However these moments are few and far between and by the end they add up to nothing. We know a tad bit more than we did in the first episode, but not enough to warrant them trying to elude to a some story as much as they did. This show also ends on a cliff hangar, which made my already thin tolerance for the show break. I cant imagine something this poorly done getting a second season, and I am not going to go out of my way to see how it ends.The art and soundtrack were decent.The characters were annoying? I have that as a question because though they were undoubtedly annoying, I also found a few moments charming in the cheesy way. Most of the show revolves around our main character who is this cool delinquent type. The other characters are made up of the ""5 swords"" of the academy, who are I guess the strongest girls in the school. At first they all hate the main character and with his few well chosen actions, words, and fists he manages to make most of them fall for him one after another. The girls were pretty standard, the busty European girl, a crazy-esque misunderstood girl, and a super loli. The only character I liked was Onigawara, Rin as her character was a bit new, though flat.I didn\'t really enjoy this anime. It almost felt like it was a parody with how cheesy the dialogue, and pacing was. The anime drags its feet the entire show. Main character and female character are about to fight. Long winded explanations that could have been just shown are instead thrown at you. After that you watch the main character get his ass kicked for a minute to build up the suspense. Maybe this time he will lose or have trouble winning you supposed to think. Then the our MC OneTouchMan ends the fight says something cool and the girl is inexplicably interested in him and switches to his fan club. Rinse and repeat.The last two episodes or so step up in intensity. We are finally introduced to the ""final boss"" the Empress. This is also a cheesy encounter which is unfinished.By the end of this anime we know nothing about this world, its characters, or even why things are happening. I normally don\'t point out that anime is unrealistic, but this show is a bit crazy. For all we know these people are humans with no particular skills or reasons for having things like a trapped dormitory which Indiana Jones would have trouble escaping. Why the girls are allowed to carry weapons and inflict pain or serious injury on people whenever they wish. We also don\'t really know how the hierarchy of the 5 swords works, because the big boss is the first girl we see, yet they seem to get more and more powerful as the show goes on. Honestly I would have dropped it if I wasn\'t curious about the Empress, and of course the pleasure of shitting on it here. There are plenty more examples that I\'m not posting here.

The story can put you off just a bit, but that doesn\'t mean you should give up watching the series (which I almost did... twice).

Rin Onigawara as a character is that of the typical tsundere...more tsun than dere but her dere is passionately dere and ""worth it"" however Rin is essentially your Yukina to your Kojou from Strike the Blood and this sticks. Mary however is what happens if Sayaka and Yukina were actually proper rivals and hate each other to Kojou and that\'s really her scthick along with her spouting French words here and there.

While that assessment was not entirely false, i cannot deny that i got a lot of genuine enjoyment out of Busou.If you\'ve seen Tenjou Tenge, this is basically a soft parody of that.  It\'s unclear to me whether that is its intention, or if they were actually trying to be cool.  But i suppose intent is irrelevant, and i will only consider the things i felt while watching.  Structurally, the show alternates between two...modes, the serious battles and the tropy, goofy slice of life.  In that sense it is reminiscent of Full Metal Panic, though the ""serious"" is much less serious.   During the fights you\'ll have freeze-frames with ""epic"" calligraphic move names being printed on the screen.  It\'s impossible to take seriously, and the silliness of some of these brought on many a laughter.   The SOL elements are usually cliche after cliche, but every now and then they\'ll drop a genuine-hilarity-bomb on you, so you have to stay on your toes.But what really makes this show enjoyable is the protagonist.  For once we are not forced to witness ""pure"" maidens all mysteriously falling for the most boring hetare piece of shit.  No, here, you get to self-insert as the alpha who literally beats the girls into submission, while not really giving a fuck.  I find it a very satisfying way to bring the ""dere"" out of these heroines.  I can also just imagine some fat feminist dyke watching this and getting upset over how problematic it is, and it only makes my metaphorical patriarchal boner harder.  The girls themselves are usually pretty lovable, though not very original.  One of them is a bear, by the way, and yes, the bear gets lewd.In a way, i would have loved to see a 25 episode series out of this, so i can enjoy more of these characters, and so the plot could evolve beyond ""conquer each girl one by one and tack on some faux-drama for the finale"".  Alas, the rational in me can see that there is nothing there.  The ""backstories"" are stupid as hell, the context doesn\'t exist, there is no adult character, no reason for anything to happen.  It\'s just an empty shell of a show designed to deliver some quick and effective entertainment; it does not have the depth or coolness of Tenjou Tenge.

Repeating the same position and the animation of his technique makes it actually suck more....Although, his technique is Overpowered, it would be better if the angle and animation of his technique would change every time he uses it, doesn\'t it?Anyways, aside his technique, the animation of the series is good, the ecchi level is good (minimization to the point wherein they censor parts using a ray of light of that alien woman naked in the bath with Nomura also being naked).Martial arts is good, but it would be better if they added supernatural or super powers in the series, not just martial arts.

Suffice it to say, this is an instance of ignorance of what feminism is. For one thing, it is not the idea that women should hold unilateral or martial power over men. It is a lens to look at a piece of media or history that seeks to explain things that happen based on the relationship between gender and power. That is about it. The reason it is called feminism is because it was the suffrage movement in America that spawned the academic foundations...of that critical theory and at the time it was the particular institution of the patriarchy that was the subject of criticism. But that does not limit the theory to only discussing the abuses of men, nor is that how it is typically used in academia. How does gender affect power in a society or piece of media and vice versa? That is the question it asks.So what would be a feminists\' critique of Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism? Well, the premise is indeed a matriarchal and martial microcosm society in which men have been perceived as sexual predators by default who are coerced into adopting the cultural norms of women in order to be acceptable at the point of a blade. What is important to keep in mind is that the show does not posit this as a ""good thing."" And the premise of the show is that men and women are both hurt by divisions of power based on stereotypes about the sexes. That is not to say the show is a feminist masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. But I think that getting this basic point wrong has led many reviewers far astray.In the end, the protagonist does not choose to rebel against the sexist distribution of power as such, but merely to defy it in favor of his own personal liberty. And far from being victims in need of rescue, the men of the academy give sometimes begrudging and sometimes tacit support of the sexist hierarchy. As, indeed, it is in real life when a boy is scolded for wearing make up or a girl for not doing so. So in the end what the show has to say about sexism is not a lot, actually. It is a thing that happens, it hurts everyone in that system including those who wield power, and the individual usually interacts with the system only concerned about the axis of their own personal liberties without the intention to make systemic changes. It suggests the solution to such problems is the power of friendship. It is neither profound nor, importantly, provocative.So is the show any good? It\'s fine. The show is amusing and the egotistical protagonist running around puffing his chest out is in keeping with your typical power fantasies. I would say if you have exhausted a well of similar anime give it a watch. 6/10. of that critical theory and at the time it was the particular institution of the patriarchy that was the subject of criticism. But that does not limit the theory to only discussing the abuses of men, nor is that how it is typically used in academia. How does gender affect power in a society or piece of media and vice versa? That is the question it asks.So what would be a feminists\' critique of Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism? Well, the premise is indeed a matriarchal and martial microcosm society in which men have been perceived as sexual predators by default who are coerced into adopting the cultural norms of women in order to be acceptable at the point of a blade. What is important to keep in mind is that the show does not posit this as a ""good thing."" And the premise of the show is that men and women are both hurt by divisions of power based on stereotypes about the sexes. That is not to say the show is a feminist masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. But I think that getting this basic point wrong has led many reviewers far astray.In the end, the protagonist does not choose to rebel against the sexist distribution of power as such, but merely to defy it in favor of his own personal liberty. And far from being victims in need of rescue, the men of the academy give sometimes begrudging and sometimes tacit support of the sexist hierarchy. As, indeed, it is in real life when a boy is scolded for wearing make up or a girl for not doing so. So in the end what the show has to say about sexism is not a lot, actually. It is a thing that happens, it hurts everyone in that system including those who wield power, and the individual usually interacts with the system only concerned about the axis of their own personal liberties without the intention to make systemic changes. It suggests the solution to such problems is the power of friendship. It is neither profound nor, importantly, provocative.So is the show any good? It\'s fine. The show is amusing and the egotistical protagonist running around puffing his chest out is in keeping with your typical power fantasies. I would say if you have exhausted a well of similar anime give it a watch. 6/10.', ""WARNING: There may be spoilers.***This show is insane, but not necessarily in the best way.At face value, the idea of a teenage boy fighting against cute sword-wielding girls with his bare hands for the sake of his freedom sounds very exciting if not completely original to the anime harem scope. In practice, there are some problems I would like to address--especially with the world building and character relationships.First of, with the way Private Aichi Symbiosis Academy conducts itself I can't help but wonder how it's able to stay open because its actions are way more messed up than how the show's characters described it....The school is literally run by a bunch of misandrist women who thinks that oppressing the male student population is ethical for the sake of womanhood. Case in point, they are bullies.Then there's that stamp system where the male students aren't allowed to leave without the stamps of the student council. And the fact that no one outside seem to know this messed up school culture further implies that the school is putting these unethical, discriminating cases under the rug. At best, they should sued and closed down for their lack of consideration towards the students' wellbeing, not to mention their human rights.What's worst is that the ending implies that this system never changed. It's as if the show thinks that Private Aichi Symbiosis Academy's toxic school culture is a good thing.And then there's the story and characters, which are just bad. The female leads are unrealistically misandrist and incredibly irrational. The male lead is just there to become a woman's magnet. Their relationships are annoying at best, and at times abusive. For instance, the girls thought it was a good idea to physically abuse the MC with whips due to jumping to conclusions. Then the climax and ending seems rushed as they introduced another member of the student council last minute. Even if I turned my brain off, I still couldn't see the chemistry between the MC and his harem. Everything about it is just messed up.The art and animation are okay, especially during the fight scenes. The OST is fine.I wouldn't recommend Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism. It's really out of touch with reality and it's insane in a bad way.

It is definitely better than average. However, there are points to take into consideration if you want to know what how this anime might interest you or not.I might as well not summarize as usual and review this in a different way. If we are to determine how this anime could be interpreted without any spoiler, then I would say that this anime captures the concept of ‘the more you hate, the more you love’ in almost every character you would find here interacting with the...main character. Maybe everyone is a tsundere? Not necessarily since that would be repetitive and annoying.Fortunately, we got a lot of interesting characters who may appeal to some. In my case, it is the twin-tail middle schooler because she is cool, and she simply looked cute for me. I had mixed feelings about the protagonist because he is a bit apathetic and selfish so he personality and appearance somewhat annoy me. However, he is still cool for being the protagonist nonetheless, and he also had a rough past so that could be where is strength came from.Speaking of cool, animation is decent even if there were scenes with stiff-like fights and too much talking while fighting which might be unnecessary and unappealing for some, especially me. The sound department is average with good choice of music tracks and sound effects which I really appreciate since there are serious actions to expect. Opening theme is ok and induces hype if you are hooked in the anime. However, I couldn’t say the same for the ending because I often skipped it simply because there is an extra narration in the end that seemed like a waste of time for me.At first, I thought this anime had some chunibyuu in it, and to be specific, the Rika-style especially the masked girl. They just had a similar vibe, but unfortunately, they aren’t. If that is also what you are expecting after seeing the girl, well I’m here to tell you that it is actually far from what you would expect. She has a serious personality, and her voice acting is far from Rika’s.Overall, the anime is good. It lacks in some aspect, but I can still recommend the anime, nonetheless. If you want some hype fighting anime with a protagonist that is hated at first, then popular and loved later, then this anime is good on your list. Unless you think the anime being cliché, boring character, or boring few episodes/world-building, then the anime might just not be for you. main character. Maybe everyone is a tsundere?

Because of the plot and the approaches, I will probably assume his very absurd action-comedy.And yes, it\'s by far the probably best 3/10 Anime I ever watched, compared to any other I would rate with 3/10. But in the end, it had nothing for a higher score....The story revolves around a school that switched from an all-girls school to a mixed school. And to protect the girls, they were allowed to use self-defense against boys. But the girls used their power and subjugated the boys at school, they would be withdrawn from them and henceforth let them live on as women in disguise.Then the Protagonist appeared and everything changed. My cliche counter cant almost follow it.Anyway, the anime goes like this. The protagonist fights one of the girls after the other, changes their minds, and finishes defeating the final boss. Except for the final boss, everything was actually quite boring, monotonous and the humor was also very limited. Maybe one laugh per episode and this is a bad statistic. And this actually only worked as long you turned your brain offline.Story:Basically, none exist. The protagonist has to fight his way through rows of bad schoolgirls to change her mind.The only story relevant is the queen of the school. But it\'s not enough to really talk about it.Animation / Pictures:Episode 1 probably used up the whole budget. The title started with a very solid fight that could at least grab the attention of the audience. Apart from that, the animations were in the basement.  They should have saved this for the last fight.Characters:The girls were mostly the collection of all Stereo Type personalities as you know them.The only two interesting characters are the protagonist and the antagonist.The protagonist is a very chilled character who hardly shows anything and has enormous self-control and a good poker face. It is not profound, but it is simply not off-putting. Does not come close to this 0815 Prota level.Main antagonist didn\'t have too much screen time, but enough to rise above all other characters. He was a book-name sociopath with multiple personality disorders. His perspective of things and the world wasn\'t that wrong either. Compared to the whole work, she had at least some ambition.Music:The intro is almost below average like the outro. The Osts in the anime are still solid and average. Was probably the strongest area in the title.ConclusionWell, as a bizarre and questionable low mediocre comedy, it can definitely be recommended if you want to watch a ""Wtf"" title.

Friends: Mononoke Shima no Naki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10115/Friends__Mononoke_Shima_no_Naki,"[""Allow me to inform you of a seemingly overlooked gem in the anime community. Time and time again I have watched children movies from Japan, and time and time again they astound me with how well-done they are. While some are talked about (Magic Tree House, One Stormy Night) and others are rarely brought to the West (Oblivion Island) this is the first one I have watched where I couldn't find anyone talking about it. Barely any information on MAL and not a single comment to be seen on tumblr or other similar sites. I find this sad.Friends: Mononoke Shima no Naki (Naki of Monster...Island) is a fun, emotional, and heart-warming movie. I can loosely compare the plot to Monsters Inc., where a young child is left with a couple of monsters who try to send it home and in the process develop caring feelings for it.200 years ago, monsters and humans were at war, and the monsters were driven to a different island where there numbers have diminished significantly. Humans are more afraid of them than ever and never dare go to the island, where monsters never dare go to the human island in fear that what little is left of their population would be massacred. However, one day, a young boy goes to pick mushrooms from the trove of them the monster island has. After a couple of monsters chase him down, he desperately escapes, leaving his younger brother, Kotake.We are then introduced to the two main characters, Naki and Gunjo, who lost their parents in the Human Vs. Monster war and consider humans to be terrible beasts. They handle the child in exchange for sole rights to the mushrooms for a year. The story simply takes off from there, and becomes an enjoyable and emotional ride.The animation can be a little stiff, especially more obscure background characters. However, overall, the animation is very good quality. The scenery of the islands, and the stark contrast between them, really shows in a beautiful display of colors and atmosphere. Facial expressions are also done very well.The soundtrack is quite amazing. I would definitely have every track from the movie on my computer if it weren't for a lack of places to find it. The music really sets the mood of any given scene. Sounds effects are executed nicely, and the voice acting is superb.The characters are where the movie shines the most. Seeing Naki's character development over the course of the movie is touching, as well as his relationship with Gunjo. Gunjo is a fun character and by the end of the movie will tug at your heartstrings. These two alone make the movie worthwhile, but their development and interactions with Kotake and the other monsters on the island, as well as humans later on, is really well-done and written excellently.Overall, this movie is a shining gem, as are most movies from Japan aimed at children in my personal opinion. I urge everyone to give this movie a try and spread the word. Maybe even if you don't like it someone you know will. Island) is a fun, emotional, and heart-warming movie.

Futsuu no Joshikousei ga [Locodol] Yattemita.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/22189/Futsuu_no_Joshikousei_ga_Locodol_Yattemita,"[""One time, my friend who also watches this anime told me that it isn't an idol anime, thus I can't compare it to Love Live, etc. But hey, the idol theme still sticks, so you can't judge me.When I first heard about this anime, I thought of myself 'hey, is this going to be another 'great' idol anime'? Well, let's see how it goes, shall we?Locodol revolves a group of fellow girls: two of them, Nanako and Yukari, as 'locodols' or local idols, under the name of 'Nagarekawa Girls', and two manning a mascot character, Yui and Mirai.This basic story starts with Nanako given a...'locodol' job by her uncle, who works in the city council. She met Yukari before they were to perform for the first time together. Afterwards, it continues with the lives of the pair, meeting more new characters and experiencing some wacky moments. The story isn't very special at all, since it is a typical story device to have someone or a group to have progress along the story. Hence, the English title 'Ordinary High-School Girls Tried Being Locodols'.The story doesn't show any idol industry shenanigans, which is good, because I love a relaxed story that doesn't involve any butchering of idols.Now, I never heard of a locodol before, which is something unique about the story. Apparently, there are also other locodols around too, from different cities. They help to promote their own cities and also to bring the spirit to the residents. I think that the idea is interesting, although I like to see more of locodol action.The story ends with a very sweet conclusion that leaves no gaping holes behind.The characters have different personalities which I find quite similar to other characters. Nanako is quite a pessimist, with a lot of worrying that burdens her down. Yukari seems like a perfect person, but she can be clumsy sometimes. Yui is a typical small character yet so strong she can do interesting acts in her heavy mascot costume. Mirai is a shy person but is still sociable.Throughout the story, both Nanako and Yukari learn more about themselves and they have nice development. They meet more new people who then support them in their own future events. Eventually, the whole town adores these locodols.Nevertheless, all the characters are very cute, especially Nanako's 'nanyako' stuttering.The art is pretty nice. The scenery looks gorgeous and I love the colour choice. It felt a bit like it was painted in many scenes, which give a nice touch. The character designs are cute and the facial expressions can exaggerate for comic relief, hence very cute too. There are some chibi designs which I think are cute too.Most of the time, the atmosphere where the locodols perform are quite lively. It may not be a very big concert but more of a small-scale concert for the residents. The costumes they wear are great and the dancing animations are smooth and cool.Despite not having a lot of songs, the quality is good. The opening and ending songs, both sang by the Nagarekawa Girls, have a certain relation to the anime and they have a good singing voice. They may not be as famous as other awesome anisongs, but it has its own standards. The background music is nice and cheery. The voice acting is great too, as they express their emotions well. There are some recognisable voice actors, especially from Yukari and Mirai, and a few supporting characters and other locodols.I admit it that I enjoy this anime despite a simple story. It may not be a famous anime, but it still is a great one to enjoy.A quick look at MyAnimeList's anime recommendations from this anime, I see other idol anime like Love Live, Wake Up Girls and Idolmaster. Honestly, this anime stands differently from others. These other anime have a group, while this anime has a pair. There may be following a similar route towards progress, but they encounter different experiences. So, if you are one of those guys who can't remember all the group members in a particular group, I think this anime shall be your first.If there's a second season, dig me in!

Yui is a typical small character yet so strong she can do interesting acts in her heavy mascot costume. Mirai is a shy person but is still sociable.Throughout the story, both Nanako and Yukari learn more about themselves and they have nice development. They meet more new people who then support them in their own future events. Eventually, the whole town adores these locodols.Nevertheless, all the characters are very cute, especially Nanako's 'nanyako' stuttering.The art is pretty nice. The scenery looks gorgeous and I love the colour choice. It felt a bit like it was painted in many scenes, which give a nice touch. The character designs are cute and the facial expressions can exaggerate for comic relief, hence very cute too. There are some chibi designs which I think are cute too.Most of the time, the atmosphere where the locodols perform are quite lively. It may not be a very big concert but more of a small-scale concert for the residents. The costumes they wear are great and the dancing animations are smooth and cool.Despite not having a lot of songs, the quality is good. The opening and ending songs, both sang by the Nagarekawa Girls, have a certain relation to the anime and they have a good singing voice. They may not be as famous as other awesome anisongs, but it has its own standards. The background music is nice and cheery. The voice acting is great too, as they express their emotions well. There are some recognisable voice actors, especially from Yukari and Mirai, and a few supporting characters and other locodols.I admit it that I enjoy this anime despite a simple story. It may not be a famous anime, but it still is a great one to enjoy.A quick look at MyAnimeList's anime recommendations from this anime, I see other idol anime like Love Live, Wake Up Girls and Idolmaster. Honestly, this anime stands differently from others. These other anime have a group, while this anime has a pair. There may be following a similar route towards progress, but they encounter different experiences. So, if you are one of those guys who can't remember all the group members in a particular group, I think this anime shall be your first.If there's a second season, dig me in!"", ""First review on MAL (although I have several anime review blog entries).Note: The score is adjusted to MAL scales by adding 1pt to the original score.First of all, this is not the usual idol anime you watch. It's not like shows like Love Live, the The iDOLM@STER etc. Instead surprisingly, the 'Futsuu'(Plain) in the title is what makes this show avoid your stereotypical idol anime.But on the other hand, it also means that this anime is more close to your usual slice-of-life anime.The most important feature of this anime is that in many ways, it is not 'idealized'. It depicts the plain-looking work of Locodols...and how they slowly turn into someone suitable for the job, instead of *cough* turning into a lead guitarist from scratch in one year *cough*.So let's take a look at the 'not idealized' and 'idealized' aspects:-NOT IDEALIZED->The life as a Locodol, i.e. the main plot. It is more close to real life, but it often becomes too plain and without comedic gags to support. You can't just simply take everyday life onto the screen and make that into an anime.>Nanako doesn't look as if she can become a Locodol from the start. (Regardless of how it turns out)>The mascot: it is just a normal mascot which reminds me of the Blue Badger from the Ace Attorney games. Surprisingly, the mascot turns out very good.>Most songs. Well yeah, usual idol songs are too stereotypical, but here in Locodol, besides the last song they performs(sadly, it sounds like your usual idol track), all we have are some school anthem like songs and the ... mascot-promotion song. This show suffers from a lack of good songs. Explainable since their songs are about promoting things about the town, but poor in sound department nonetheless.>The town's budget. Kind of realistic, but. In some cases it is rather the producer of the anime who is low on budget.-IDEALIZED->The recognition the Locodols get. Especially: I'm not going to spoil the anime, but in one specific scene, what the Locodols did would be considered 'lame tactics' in real life.>In one case the Locodols took a job not suitable for usual high school students yet they completed the quest. Common in other anime, though.-OTHER ASPECTS->Fanservice: Usually, when there is fanservice, it's not done very well. For example, Ep01 is rather misleading as it would probably make viewers believe that this show is totally about swimsuit fanservice.>The comedy: ...Not that good. The stalker thing was meh: what did I say just now... 'lame tactics'?>The infamous cliche 'I have been happy because you guys/girls are by my side': Still a bit cliched in this show, but overall natural and heartwarming. You would probably not feel that it's cliched.>The yuri vibe: The problem with the yuri vibe is that it's one of the highlights of the show, so if you don't like yuri you'll find the show less enjoyable.So how to sum it up?This show tries to stand out from your usual idol anime, but to avoid bordering on a normal slice of life it tries to support itself with massive yuri vibes.Overall the show is heartwarming, but still a bit cliched among 'cute girls engaging in activities' slice of life anime. Plus, especially in the earlier episodes, it fails to give us some entertainment value, and it still can't avoid several problems normal slice of life anime usually have.Recommended for:>People who are tired of usual idol anime(I'm not a huge fan but far from being sick of the genre)>People who like some heartwarming story about girls engaging in activities>People who like light-hearted yuri.Story: 6Art: 6Sound: 4Character: 7Enjoyment: 7Overall: 6(Stats: Suspicious Ups=0, Downs=0 as of 22 Apr 2015.

By the way, i find idol anime kinda interesting, i mean i admire their over-the-top passion for the business right ? I think if you love your job, that's good always.But Locodol is not a typical idol anime. Its more like a lovely, fun slice of life series when two girls meet by fate (lol), they then decide to be the featuring faces to promote their province. And then the everyday working life begins.The characters are cute, the op, ed and the soundtrack are amazing. Definitely worth the watch. I think...this is one of the most underrated anime of the season for sure. this is one of the most underrated anime of the season for sure."", 'Idol is a war. Oh wait, it\'s a wrong series, lol. But, it\'s still a same theme as that series as this one is an idol series. Futsuu no Joshikousei ga [Locodol] Yatte Mita, abbreviated Locodol is a series which tells us how the normal school girls can become an idol. Though idol, they re just a local one, so how shine are they in their own locals and their own self?A story which tells us a normal school girls who somehow become an idol is one of the cliche story of most series we have today, so it\'s not really a promising premise. But,...as the series went, it has proved its existence as it\'s not your everyday normal idol series. Unlike WUG or iM@S who are using the talent agency as their promotor, Locodol used the local government as their only supporter. As its own purpose is to promote their own local specialties, they shouldn\'t have many fanbase as the one from talent agency as their work itself not promoting the idol. But, once again it has proved their own strong point as the local idol. The pace they show to us isn\'t that fast, but sometimes a little slow and made their story a little boring sometimes. But, it has a good pace in last half though.The character in this series is focused on a pair of our idol and a pair of our clown (or mascot wearer, or whatever terms you like. I\'ll use this one).  There are also another character, such as manager, rival idol, etc. The character itself isn\'t that variance. Almost all of them start with a timid character, then developed into a great idol (and clown), which is a little monotone. Though, in some later episode, they show their own character. Overall, it\'s a so-so.The art itself is quite bold, but good at the first episodes. Though its quality is dropped at mids, then show a quite good quality again.  The one I should appreciate is the scenery background. Though it\'s not the best, it\'s quite nice to see a good scenery in a village. For the character design, I like it. It\'s your everyday design, but nicely done.As an idol, it\'s a let down to see their songs can be qualified as few. Without OP and ED, the songs total is three, ""Ah~ Nagarekawa!"", ""Uogokoro-kun Song"", and ""Nagarekawa Girls Song"".  The first two song can be considered as a lame song for idol, but it\'s quite matched with the local theme which make it good. The song is really easy to remember and maybe after you watch several time they""re singing it (yup, ""Uogokoro-kun song"" is the most played song in this series after OP and ED) you\'ll sing along with them as I was. ""Nagarekawa Girls Song"" is quite an idol song, it\'s quite attractive and have a same charm as OP and ED songs. It\'s well made, though it\'s still a few for idol series.I really enjoyed this series. Though I didn\'t particularly wait for this series in each week, I really enjoyed this series as I watched them. But sometimes, I found it quite a boring to hear the same song after a while.The local idol series has come to the end. As its enjoyment surpassed my expectation, it\'s a good idol series.

That's the best way to describe Locodol.The series has a major appeal of focusing on slowly rising local idols that other idol series such as Love Live cant replicate. The setting of Nagarekawa Girls just wanting to help out their local town is so wholesome and its nice that there isn't any major stakes like in Love Live such as their group being shut down. Since there's no stakes its a great anime to watch if you just want to sit back and enjoy some wholesome anime.The series also goes at a nice steady pace introducing characters throughout the series as to not...bombard you with information right off the bat.The interactions between the Locodols and the local town people is sooo wholesome and good it makes every episode super enjoyable to watch always leaving a smile on my face. The series main focus is showing these girls interacting with the locals and just generally getting along with everyone. Its less conventional than other idol anime in the fact that it doesn't focus on the music and most of the music is kind of like town folk songs but that just further adds to the local feel and appeal of the series.To sum it up Locodol is cute girls doing wholesome things. Its more along the lines of Skip Beat than Love Live as the girls do odd jobs like reporting as well as their idol work which really adds to the theme of local idols instead of being away from the audience it focuses on them.The characters are absolutely lovable with Nanako being my personal favourite as her reactions to situations and news she receives is absolutely hilarious as she doesn't act like stereotypically as in most anime which gives the series further uniqueness. The interactions between the characters is also very enjoyable to watch alongside the yuri undertone that Yukari brings with her passes at Nanako.The music for the most part as said previously is basically town folks songs unlike other idol anime however towards the end of the series it brings in some of the best and wholesome music I've heard to date further adding to the wholesomeness of the fact that they just want to support their local town.Overall Locodol is a wholesome series that really deserves more attention and I highly recommend it to anyone who either wants a nice anime to enjoy or is a yuri fan as there is a fair bit of yuri subtext throughout.9/10 will definitely re-watch In the near future. bombard you with information right off the bat.The interactions between the Locodols and the local town people is sooo wholesome and good it makes every episode super enjoyable to watch always leaving a smile on my face.

Nothing big goes on in the show. Small surprises and conflicts pop up but they are neither unexpected nor good, and they get resolved literally in minutes. (Nervous main character solved by a hug. Conflicting concert schedules solved by just... the characters going ""But we want to do both the concerts!"" and everything goes well, etc.)ARTFor me the art style was one of the main reasons why the show...felt so comfortable and relaxing. Characters look normal and somewhat attractive. Some might call it generic, but that\'s not necessarily a bad thing. The art really fit the characters\' personality and the peaceful mood of the show.SOUNDSince this is technically an idol anime I was looking forward to all the music they put in it. Don\'t expect entire albums of different-styled songs like the case with Love Live or Idolmaster, but the few tracks that do play are worth listening to. Background music was nothing too special or impressive, but at least it doesn\'t disrupt the show. I\'m not an expert at listening out for voice acting quality but I felt it was pretty good.CHARACTERNanako\'s such a humble and honest character who is designed such that the viewer would naturally root for her, when she\'s nervous or lost, and it doesn\'t feel forced. That in itself is more than enough for this simple show. In 12 episodes they managed to squeeze in some very simple character development for each of the characters that honestly can\'t be called very deep or meticulous. Really simple stuff, like getting over nervousness. (I\'m not saying overcoming nervousness in real life is simple stuff. I\'m saying overcoming nervousness was portrayed as a very simple process in this anime.) No over-sexualization either, which contributes to the special comfortable feeling of this show. (Unless you are only at peace when you watch fanservice and anime tiddies...)ENJOYMENTThis show was one of those shows which you can watch when you\'re tired of serious stuff (either in real life or in other shows) and try to get rid of a bit of that stress. A lot of encouraging dialogue and interactions. Finally, no more cliche rainy rooftop arguments or crying characters that are the result of forced conflict and drama that I\'d rather not have unless it\'s a really important part of the story. A show doesn\'t need seriousness, and seriousness doesn\'t necessitate fighting and crying. This anime also has its dose of seriousness that is more relatable and honest, like that other group of really popular locodols who were afraid that they were neglecting their hometown in search of mass media popularity. Like Nanako\'s real yet comedic fear that the lyrics that she came up with might suck ass.

The day to day activities of what it means to be a Locodol, as well as the effect it has on family and school life, are portrayed incredibly well in the series. The story avoids unrealistic outcomes or tasks for a brand new idol duo, and very successfully makes events and themes work for both a slice of life of ordinary girls as well as an idol anime.The art of the show is a little lacking, though that is not to say it is bad. The art...style is fairly standard; the only real exception being the wide shots of scenery.The sound is another area that was disappointing, though only for a specific reason. The actual songs that we hear the girls sing in the show are lackluster. The final song of the series is definitely the exception, but in general we hear the same songs through the entirety of the show and the songs aren't particularly catchy or memorable.The characters in the show are definitely a highlight. Nanako is incredibly believable as a real person who could really exist, and the same goes to Yukari to a limited extent. Nanako isn't exceptional, but also doesn't feel inept to the point of it being annoying. She is a very relate-able every-man. Yukari is similar: she is shown to come from a wealthy upbringing and is very well mannered, but still comes across as someone who could have gone to the viewers school.Overall this anime was very enjoyable, and will definitely be one that I plan on watching again.

It feels like a breeze of morning air and just like actual morning breeze itself, it passes too easily.The premise is a bit refreshing compared to most Idol girls out there. Nakaregawa Girls is an idol unit commissioned by the local government of Nakaregawa for the purpose of which to promote the best offerings of the locals. Simply put, these girls must attract the masses without the glitz and the sparkles nationwide idols usually have. The twist here, however, is that what ultimately drives Nakaregawa Girls is not the love for singing or chasing girlhood dreams, but simply showing the...whole world what Nakaregawa is made of. With such setting, it truly is a delight watching a heroine that is clumsy by nature but never losing her wit once the situation demands it (after all, local idols require mastering the skills of hustling instead of singing and dancing). Moreover, the audience can actually envision such scenario to occur in real life. When Nakaregawa Girls is tasked to report termite extermination, you bet that it is a realistically embarrassing yet hilarious gig, indeed.That being said, there is always this lingering feeling that something is missing from this anime. Locodol is funny but not hilarious, cute but not adorable, admirable but not inspiring. Lack of commitment in the execution makes Locodol barely pass the passing grade. Last but not least, by the end of the series, the audience does not necessarily feel the urge to look up 'Nakaregawa' on the net-- an urge that had proven to be no issue for local-oriented anime such as Sakura Quest or (if we can point out the most obvious example) Kimi No Na Wa.Just like Nakaragewa Girls, at least this anime does its job.

Fate/Grand Order: Shinsei Entaku Ryouiki Camelot 1 - Wandering; Agateram,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38085/Fate_Grand_Order__Shinsei_Entaku_Ryouiki_Camelot_1_-_Wandering__Agateram,"['What a potential waste...i played the singularity and camelot is my fav singularity so i was so hyped when i heard camelot was getting an anime adaption. I watched it and if i need to summarize  it  into a one sentence that would be ""its absolute trash""I will start with the plot. But the problem is theres no plot to talk about, in game version the ""plot"" continued like go there do that go there do that until we defeat our enemy it wasnt great to begin. The movie makes it much worse and turns it into something like ""teleport here...do nothing teleport here"" instead of traveling non stop.Most of the fight scenes were cut off and two major characters named Touta and Hassan of the Hundred Faces were cut off. Yet the studio made a freaking mash and nitocris bath scene. Yeah two hotties can have a bath scene but major characters cant get a debut. About the fights scenes they cut too much. I expected to fight scenes like where we fight ghosts and sphinxes etc were to be cut but oh boy... i was wrong they cut all of the hassans vs chaldea and ozymandias vs chaldea fights scenes which is a total bullshits cuz its IMPORTANT. And the dialogues werent that great. Camelot is the most depressing and philosophic singularity among the first 7. But we didnt even catch a glimpse of it in the movie.I would have said art was pretty good if the MALE SERVANTS WERENT ON STEROIDS. Whats the deal with the gawain and cursed arm what am i watching jojo or fate.And Bedivere\'s noble phantasm... Its terrifying but not for the enemies for our eyes. Every frame of it was bad. Except the male servants da vinci\'s mash\'s and gudao\'s character design was too much off the source. Mash literally didnt have a genuine human neck. Except the character design the art syle is pretty good. I loved how they animated the noble phantasms and the place designs. Temples were gorgeous. I think place designs did a good job reflecting the people there. The last think i will say about art is Arash\'s noble phantasm. I didnt expect much from the scene but its stunning. I can say the movies best part is that specific scene easily.Sound is the only thing thats great in the moviesi guess the ost\'s were great and the timings were great too. They are not on a masterpiece level but they are not bad.Conclusion: If u are a ozymandias/sanzang/rhongomyniad/mordred/arash fan watch this. If not its a total waste of time. Just play the game. The movie was 1.5 hours and only 4 minutes of it (which is the stella scene sanzang vs agravain scene and the speech of ozymandias) enjoyable. do nothing teleport here"" instead of traveling non stop.Most of the fight scenes were cut off and two major characters named Touta and Hassan of the Hundred Faces were cut off.

However, the story is its weak point, because as expected of an adaptation of a mobile game, the plot is basically just a series of events herding the main characters from Point A to Point B to Point C.Overall score: 7/10Note: I am not a FGO player and so will not be comparing the movie to the in-game story. I heard some people complain about things being cut out, but since I do not know...the game's story, it did not bother me at all.---Having been a fan of the Fate franchise since the original Fate/Stay Night anime from Deen, it's been amazing to watch the series expand with so many spinoffs and timelines. FGO brought the franchise to the mainstream mobile gaming community, and has been credited with an above-average story (for a mobile game, or so I heard). So how does this movie, which adapts the 6th arc, hold up? In terms of everything outside of the story, pretty darn well. The story itself, not so much.Like the Babylon anime, the story follows around Ritsuka and Mash trying to recover the Holy Grail of this particular Singularity and save humanity. Along the way the meet a number of servants, including the Knights of the Round Table who serve Artoria (an alternate version of F/SN Saber), except this time, Artoria serves as an antagonist to the heroes.I went in not expecting much, but was really blown away by the visuals. The scenery is stunning, and I loved the change in art style when Bedivere reminisces about his memories of Artoria. The fight scenes were much better than expected too, with decent choreography and camera angles showing the cool swordplay from Bedivere. I absolutely recommend this movie on the animation and art element alone.However, the story is undoubtedly the weak point of the movie. Aside from being a little curious about why the Artoria of this world has become a villain, I was not too engaged with the movie's plot, which basically involved going from place to place to meet another new hero. Go to X to meet Artoria, go to Y to meet Ozymandias, go to C to meet Hassan, etc. etc. It honestly felt kind of tedious, and I was just waiting for the next scene where Bedivere did something cool.In terms of music, it was a bit generic, but did its job. Sakamoto Maaya's ending song was pretty great too, with a good buildup with the quiet intro into a cool rock song.All in all, if you loved the FGO Babylon anime, you will definitely love this movie too. If you are hoping for a Fate story closer to Fate/Zero, UBW, or HF, then you will be sorely disappointed. If you can enjoy an anime just for its visuals and action scenes without much attention to story, then this should be well worth watching.Story: 5/10Art; 9/10Sound; 7/10Character: 7/10Enjoyment: 8/10Overall: 7/10 the game's story, it did not bother me at all.---Having been a fan of the Fate franchise since the original Fate/Stay Night anime from Deen, it's been amazing to watch the series expand with so many spinoffs and timelines.

Now, you'd expect that since it's split into two, the story should be slow paced... right?WRONG! It's very, very fast paced and I felt it was more rushed than any anime I have ever watched. Having played the game and read the story before hand, I could still manage to catch up with it. My poor friend, on the other hand...I would put the story at 10/10 for FGO players, 7/10 for Fate lovers and maybe 4/10 for people who have no experience....This is because they do not even explain a bit of the premise of the story. If you go and watch this without at least watching First Order, you won't understand anything.As to why I give it a 10 for FGO players, it's because it's the first time in any of the animation that the perspective is shown from an entity (no spoilers) that is not from Chaldea.Art and Sound: 10/10It doesn't feel like an anime at all. If I were to draw a comparison, this is very much like Heaven's Feel 1-3. The music, sound effects, and composition just feels very pleasing to the ears and makes your heart beat fast. The IMPACT is overwhelming. Also, there's many famous/popular VAs who have roles in the movie, so it really felt like an AAA film. From the battle scenes to the paintings of food etc, everything is meticulously drawn and animated that it's impossible to find any faults in it. You have to watch it at the theatres to get this experience.Character: 10/10 for FGO lovers, 7/10 for normal peopleIt's hard to explain the feeling when you finally get to see your favorite characters animated. Arash for one, was very cool in the movie. He's really like the big brother. I got goosebumps from watching the different characters (yes, the same ones from the game - they didn't cut anyone out).Enjoyment:I really enjoyed it overall. For those who are still waiting for the NA release, I suggest watching every other Fate anime while waiting and make sure you catch it in the theatres because the experience is just surreal. Overall, I would recommend this movie to any Fate lovers. This is because they do not even explain a bit of the premise of the story.

Overall, I would recommend this movie to any Fate lovers."", 'Fate/Grand Order: Camelot only recently got released in the cinemas for me hence the late review.-You do not need to play the game to watch the movie, pretty much every chapter of Fate/Grand Order is a standalone comprised of self-contained stories. However, I recommend you do at least watch the prologue Fate/Grand Order: First Order or read it via the game.-Camelot was animated after Babylonia because of a fan polling that took place 3 years ago, Babylonia was ranked first in terms of what the fans wanted to be animated followed by Camelot.-If you\'re wondering why they still couldn\'t just have Camelot animated first, I...have no clue. Ask Type-moon.-I just want to put it out there that if you are hoping for the epic battles that made up most of Babylonia, try not to get your hopes up too high, for this movie lacked the intensity of fights and simply tries to encapsulate the main storyline which they did a mediocre job thus far.-The general premise of this movie is an adaptation from the Fate/Grand Order game, the two main protagonists arrive in a Singularity era where the Knights of the Round Table terrorize the Holy City of Camelot. As they try to figure out who are friends and foes, the crisis grows worse, and failing to resolve it could spell disaster for all of humanity. This is definitely a film for fans because there is so much explanation required just to understand the premise of Fate/Grand Order that the movie completely does away with it. Here\'s a short explainer.“FGO is set in a world where humanity is threatened by disruptions to history, known as Singularities. The players are sent to resolve said Singularities by summoning historical figures, known as Servants, to fight (your gacha). Along the way, they learn that there are other agencies that are determined to interfere with the history of humanity. The game\'s storyline is divided into chapters, which each center around a particular time period that has been disrupted by a Singularity.”Story - 3/10Now, contrary to the opinions of others, I felt the movie was extremely fast-paced. If you are a completely new viewer, with the story unbeknownst to you, you may have felt it was slow-paced because the movie was drowned in a series of uneventful dialogues. Do not get me wrong though, personally, the dialogues were the only things keeping me watching this poor adaptation since it at least tried to stick as close as possible to the compelling narrative that was Fate/Grand Order: Camelot.-Simply put, the movie on one hand can be rather languid in how it progresses. While on the other hand, it rushes through events just to get you to the final battle in the climax of the movie. It doesn\'t provide enough exposition while having too many long-drawn-out conversations which don\'t get anywhere. You might see your favorite character, but you won\'t really feel you\'ve met him or her, simply because it\'s so awkwardly put together.-Understandably, the director was trying to cram the events of an entire game\'s chapter into a pair of 90-minute movies. Nevertheless, there\'s a distinct lack of elegance or even subtlety in the storytelling. It feels like it\'s just plodding along with a formulaic plot (which it is, given that it\'s based on the game), rather than organically pushing the characters forward in a good story.-The reason I gave the story a 3/10 was because the movie skipped some chapters and made significant changes to the initial introduction and progression of the story. I felt that if they hadn\'t changed those subtleties, the story would have had a better pace and possibly even made amends to the enigmatic story told in the movie.-The majority of the scenes tend to bring that ephemeral atmosphere, yet, I couldn\'t help but notice that the dramatic scenes where we were supposed to feel something had zero repercussions from the audience. That speaks volumes on how poorly executed the scenes were.-Not to mention, the battles and supposedly epic monologues, despite how few and momentary, felt extremely anticlimactic. The ending especially, one can only be left to question...-""Was that it?""-However, let\'s be rational. I do not blame the studio or director for the poor execution, they were thrown a chapter from a big book and expected to animate it as a standalone with only approximately 3 hours worth of time to provide context, story, action while sticking to the written chapter which has all the context it needs from the previous chapters in the book.Imagine a studio asked to produce Harry Potter: Deathly Hallows as a standalone with there being zero other Harry Potter movies out at the time.-Granted, the movie was targeted towards fans of the franchise with a compromise to accommodate the losers sleeping on FGO. If anyone is to blame, it\'s not the studio.-Apart from the anticlimactic scenes and ending which actually had the whole cinema laughing as the sad OST was playing, there were many odd and untimely segues.-Mild Spoiler-Regarding the poorly executed segues and scenes which were actually so bad, I can\'t help but laugh at the thought.We had Lancelot coming in with his army and just swinging Arondight trying to look all cool.Xuanzang coming in at Ozy\'s temple with zero explanation on why she was even there (She left the Knights of the Round Table and joined Ozy, that is information left out)Ozy’s anticlimactic introduction (please compare this to Gilgamesh in Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia)Lancelot slashing Arash and afterward completely vanishing when Tristan appeared out of nowhere, this one was weird as hell, where the hell did he goMordred yelling about the past while fighting Bedi and even using Clarent Blood Arthur but the noble phantasm wasn’t even properly animated (where was the red beam)Arash using Stella which sums up the only good scene only to be ruined with the wrong type of music and setting.Also, why the hell was Bedivere so sad, he barely even knew him in the movieI would also like to reiterate that the whole cinema was laughing when Arash was dying and the sad music was playing whilst Stella was flying into the sky to destroy Rhongomyniad… What the hell kind of music cue was that? That scene was so poorly executed despite how beautiful it was it\'s actually giving me cancer.You can argue that Arash is a meme that justifies the laughter BUT, you cannot deny the fact that they can make Arash end with epic music and a huge fucking bang to make the cinema go fucking wild with his death instead of that anticlimactic bullshit that will cement itself as another sad disappointing meme moment which had the potential to be brilliant.Last but not least... Where the fuck was Hundred Faces and Touta?!? You seriously telling me you replaced those 2 with a fucking bath scene even though Nito is fucking hot and Rie Takahashi being all cute with Mashu’s voice and all BUT WTF? You’re that time constricted huh?There was bad execution, skipping of many parts of the story, the omission of characters, horrible timing, and wrong type of settings which just goes to show how the studio and production lacked the knowledge about its audience and how the scene/setting should be built. Also, the context wasn’t provided very progressively although you can tell they tried.Basically, context was just being hurled here and there to give you at least some information about what was going on which just felt weird for me as someone that already knew what was going on and would go on to feel messy for others that were watching the movie with little prior knowledge of the story.-It should be duly noted that according to the storyline if they continue to progress as is, there should be cooler and way more epic fights in the upcoming second movie to this 2-Part Camelot.-On a side note, the movie was directed by Kei Suezawa who is notable for being an animation director but not a storyboard director which might explain the poor execution of the entire movie apart from the time constraints.-The second movie, Fate/Grand Order: Shinsei Entaku Ryouiki Camelot 2 - Paladin; Agateram will be directed by another director, Kazuto Arai who is also notable for being an animation director which makes the decisions to give the directing roles to these two directors a tad questionable. One can only hope that Arai can live up to expectations and deliver with the second movie.Sound - 7/10I’m not going to lie and say the OSTs were anything short of absolute brilliance. However, due to the poor timing of musical cues, the beautiful instrumentals weren’t able to shine. The score in itself had the potential to provide a raw delicate depiction of emotions and inflict that sentimental affliction if it were used in the right scenes at the right time. The movie however used these scores so wrongly it honestly felt like a waste of good music, I felt that if the studio had understood the audience better, it could have made much better use of the music, maybe save it for the next part.I’m no musical connoisseur nor am I a musician but you can tell when something is wrong when the music playing is the complete opposite of what you and everyone else is feeling and expecting.-Imagine Attack on Titan when Erwin and the soldiers charge towards Beast Titan but instead of epic battle music, sad music plays in the background while they so epicly sound off their warrior cries. Imagine that… That was one of the many analogies I had in my head while trying to embrace the musical score for what it truly is and not how it was used…Art - 8/10The animation was great, I enjoyed it however, I couldn’t help but notice that the art style isn’t your typical Production I.G. style. I also couldn’t help but notice that some of the characters look a little different or ‘off’ like Ozymandius.-Turns out, after a little research, Movie 1 will be animated by Signal.MD which is an offshoot of Production I.G. That explains the different art styles. The second movie is said to be animated by Production I.G. itself however I don’t expect a change in the animation staff.-The movie was directed by Suezawa Kei which can explain the competent animation since he is, after all, an animation director to date.-I really enjoyed the stunning visuals of specific parts of the movie like the beautiful sky made by Solomon’s noble phantasm, you can’t help but want to be there and look at it yourself, in-person.-The intensity of the fight scenes was mediocre at best but nevertheless still well-animated except some things simply didn’t make sense to me (Why Tristan was standing still for example)-Also please, go watch the TVCM of the Chapter and understand why I’m disappointed by the lack of action, this is also the reason why I said to expect the action to be in the second part and to keep the hype train up.Character 3/10If I was being dead honest, you are essentially thrown into a story where you should at least know who the characters are otherwise, you will be lost.-If you’re a fan and you already know the premise of the movie, the reason why you’re watching is probably because you’re keen to just dive in and see how the movie manages to realize the game world on the set and see how the characters ‘come to life on screen. The movie did a decent job at trying to include as many characters as possible from the game but all at the expense of character development and the screen time of various characters. You will probably get to see your favorite characters unless your favorites are T***a or H***n of the H***d F***s. However, it probably won’t be as satisfying as you would expect.-Like I mentioned previously, all of the character introductions are way too anticlimactic especially if you were expecting a Babylonia level of build-up and hype.Overall - 4/10I love Fate/Grand Order so it’s honestly disappointing to see such a lackluster depiction of the amazing story in the game.-If you’re an FGO fan though, I’d still recommend you watch it and decide for yourself if it’s actually good or not because I hear many mixed opinions from fans and casual viewers but personally, I felt it didn’t live up to my expectations at all.This review was written on 03-14-21 and may be outdated. I may have changed my rating due to various reasons. have no clue.

If anyone is to blame, it\'s not the studio.-Apart from the anticlimactic scenes and ending which actually had the whole cinema laughing as the sad OST was playing, there were many odd and untimely segues.-Mild Spoiler-Regarding the poorly executed segues and scenes which were actually so bad, I can\'t help but laugh at the thought.We had Lancelot coming in with his army and just swinging Arondight trying to look all cool.Xuanzang coming in at Ozy\'s temple with zero explanation on why she was even there (She left the Knights of the Round Table and joined Ozy, that is information left out)Ozy’s anticlimactic introduction (please compare this to Gilgamesh in Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia)Lancelot slashing Arash and afterward completely vanishing when Tristan appeared out of nowhere, this one was weird as hell, where the hell did he goMordred yelling about the past while fighting Bedi and even using Clarent Blood Arthur but the noble phantasm wasn’t even properly animated (where was the red beam)Arash using Stella which sums up the only good scene only to be ruined with the wrong type of music and setting.Also, why the hell was Bedivere so sad, he barely even knew him in the movieI would also like to reiterate that the whole cinema was laughing when Arash was dying and the sad music was playing whilst Stella was flying into the sky to destroy Rhongomyniad… What the hell kind of music cue was that? That scene was so poorly executed despite how beautiful it was it\'s actually giving me cancer.You can argue that Arash is a meme that justifies the laughter BUT, you cannot deny the fact that they can make Arash end with epic music and a huge fucking bang to make the cinema go fucking wild with his death instead of that anticlimactic bullshit that will cement itself as another sad disappointing meme moment which had the potential to be brilliant.Last but not least... Where the fuck was Hundred Faces and Touta?!? You seriously telling me you replaced those 2 with a fucking bath scene even though Nito is fucking hot and Rie Takahashi being all cute with Mashu’s voice and all BUT WTF? You’re that time constricted huh?There was bad execution, skipping of many parts of the story, the omission of characters, horrible timing, and wrong type of settings which just goes to show how the studio and production lacked the knowledge about its audience and how the scene/setting should be built. Also, the context wasn’t provided very progressively although you can tell they tried.Basically, context was just being hurled here and there to give you at least some information about what was going on which just felt weird for me as someone that already knew what was going on and would go on to feel messy for others that were watching the movie with little prior knowledge of the story.-It should be duly noted that according to the storyline if they continue to progress as is, there should be cooler and way more epic fights in the upcoming second movie to this 2-Part Camelot.-On a side note, the movie was directed by Kei Suezawa who is notable for being an animation director but not a storyboard director which might explain the poor execution of the entire movie apart from the time constraints.-The second movie, Fate/Grand Order: Shinsei Entaku Ryouiki Camelot 2 - Paladin; Agateram will be directed by another director, Kazuto Arai who is also notable for being an animation director which makes the decisions to give the directing roles to these two directors a tad questionable. One can only hope that Arai can live up to expectations and deliver with the second movie.Sound - 7/10I’m not going to lie and say the OSTs were anything short of absolute brilliance. However, due to the poor timing of musical cues, the beautiful instrumentals weren’t able to shine. The score in itself had the potential to provide a raw delicate depiction of emotions and inflict that sentimental affliction if it were used in the right scenes at the right time. The movie however used these scores so wrongly it honestly felt like a waste of good music, I felt that if the studio had understood the audience better, it could have made much better use of the music, maybe save it for the next part.I’m no musical connoisseur nor am I a musician but you can tell when something is wrong when the music playing is the complete opposite of what you and everyone else is feeling and expecting.-Imagine Attack on Titan when Erwin and the soldiers charge towards Beast Titan but instead of epic battle music, sad music plays in the background while they so epicly sound off their warrior cries. Imagine that… That was one of the many analogies I had in my head while trying to embrace the musical score for what it truly is and not how it was used…Art - 8/10The animation was great, I enjoyed it however, I couldn’t help but notice that the art style isn’t your typical Production I.G. style. I also couldn’t help but notice that some of the characters look a little different or ‘off’ like Ozymandius.-Turns out, after a little research, Movie 1 will be animated by Signal.MD which is an offshoot of Production I.G. That explains the different art styles. The second movie is said to be animated by Production I.G. itself however I don’t expect a change in the animation staff.-The movie was directed by Suezawa Kei which can explain the competent animation since he is, after all, an animation director to date.-I really enjoyed the stunning visuals of specific parts of the movie like the beautiful sky made by Solomon’s noble phantasm, you can’t help but want to be there and look at it yourself, in-person.-The intensity of the fight scenes was mediocre at best but nevertheless still well-animated except some things simply didn’t make sense to me (Why Tristan was standing still for example)-Also please, go watch the TVCM of the Chapter and understand why I’m disappointed by the lack of action, this is also the reason why I said to expect the action to be in the second part and to keep the hype train up.Character 3/10If I was being dead honest, you are essentially thrown into a story where you should at least know who the characters are otherwise, you will be lost.-If you’re a fan and you already know the premise of the movie, the reason why you’re watching is probably because you’re keen to just dive in and see how the movie manages to realize the game world on the set and see how the characters ‘come to life on screen. The movie did a decent job at trying to include as many characters as possible from the game but all at the expense of character development and the screen time of various characters. You will probably get to see your favorite characters unless your favorites are T***a or H***n of the H***d F***s. However, it probably won’t be as satisfying as you would expect.-Like I mentioned previously, all of the character introductions are way too anticlimactic especially if you were expecting a Babylonia level of build-up and hype.Overall - 4/10I love Fate/Grand Order so it’s honestly disappointing to see such a lackluster depiction of the amazing story in the game.-If you’re an FGO fan though, I’d still recommend you watch it and decide for yourself if it’s actually good or not because I hear many mixed opinions from fans and casual viewers but personally, I felt it didn’t live up to my expectations at all.This review was written on 03-14-21 and may be outdated. I may have changed my rating due to various reasons.', ""I don't know what to say. It is a very disappointing film.It's both bad as a movie and as an adaptation.The story is very rush yet slow at the same time. The dialogues of the characters aren't fleshed out and they talk as if they've already have years of friendship when they all just met for awhile.In the game, the character interactions is one of the best things and easily one of the game's highlights. Here, they butchered it with superficial dialogues that doesn't contribute to sh*t.With the slow parts, I'm talking about the dead spaces in the movie where it can be easily removed...and get replaced by more fleshed out conversations.The plot itself is great, just the execution and the way the adaptation handles it makes it pretty bad.The characters for me is pretty hard to rate, because as a FGO player, I am biased to them. I love all of the cast, but do I think they were handled well in this film? Absolutely not. Hence the low score.The animation is good. It isn't exceptional by any means. There are times where the animation doesn't portray what the game is supposed to be. Like Mordred for example. To give you an insight on what is she supposed to be based on the game, she's supposed to be like Saber Alter from Heaven's Feel who spams laser beams every strike she makes.Also, the art isn't really consistent enough. It's unfortunate since this is one of the best-looking NON-UFOTABLE movies that I've seen.The music is pretty good. The OST and the ED theme is surprisingly decent, just the way they are implemented in each scenes that makes them not stand out imo.Overall, it's a mix-bag of a movie. If you're a diehard fan of Fate like me, then you'd be disappointed. Or even if you're just an anime-only Fate fan, you wouldn't be satisfied by this movie. and get replaced by more fleshed out conversations.The plot itself is great, just the execution and the way the adaptation handles it makes it pretty bad.The characters for me is pretty hard to rate, because as a FGO player, I am biased to them.

This time I’m actually reviewing something FGO related, so I’m gonna get this out of the way at the very start. Fate/Grand Order is a really deep and riveting story of journey to find and take back the future of humanity. I find the game’s narrative as a whole to be rather moving, so I genuinely believe that you are doing yourself and this franchise a huge disservice if you have watched or plan to watch this movie or the Babylonia anime without having at least played the game up to that point in the story. People wouldn’t suggest to others to watch the...Half Blood Prince movie as an introduction to the entirety of Harry Potter, or to watch the Force Awakens as one’s first Star Wars movie, or to start watching The Office from season 7. It’s no different for Fate/Grand Order. Camelot is the 6th singularity of the first arc of FGO, and Babylonia is the 7th. There is no good reason to watch these adaptations without having played the game up to that point. If you haven’t played Fate/Grand Order, then leave; and if you don’t ever intend to, then don’t come back.This is the final warning for those who haven’t played FGO. I will be assuming from this point forward that you’ve completed the first arc of FGO, because as I already previously stated, there is no point in watching these adaptations without having played the game in full. Thus, there is no reason to continue reading this review if you have no intention of playing FGO; so, either get lost, or go install the game and get grinding.Alright, now it’s just us cultured Masters. At first, I didn’t know what to think of this movie after finishing it for the first time. Honestly, I was just a little confused because a lot of events that happened in the movie didn’t line up with what I remembered from Camelot. So, I went over to My Room and delved into the Materials section and reread the entirety of Camelot up to the point the movie ended. And then I rewatched the whole movie again. This is the reason for the whole rant in the first paragraph, because simply put, if an FGO player like me needed to revisit the original Camelot story to digest the movie, how lost would someone be if they had no idea what FGO was in the first place?On a side note, if you wanna add me, I have Skadi and Waver available as supports and I’ve grailed Nero, caster Nero, Ereshkigal, Illya, Kuro, and Miyu to lvl 100 for those that want to use them. You can add me (and feed me friend points): 917580838Okay that’s enough account shilling, time to get to the review. After rereading the Camelot story and rewatching the movie, I conclude that this first Camelot movie was underwhelming because it deviated too much from the original story, and because it was far less entertaining and less impressive than the Babylonia anime. This doesn’t mean it was an awful or bad movie, but it simply didn’t live up to my expectations as an avid fan of FGO who witnessed the raw production value put into the Babylonia anime and who wanted the same type of passion to be put into the other contender the for the most interesting singularity of the first arc, Camelot.I’ll first talk about how the movie differed from the in-game story and why I feel those differences are problematic. During the in-game story, we rayshift into the desert where we very quickly run into Hundred Face Hassan and her group of mountain people abducting Nitocris. After saving Nitocris, she misinterprets the situation thinking that we are the kidnappers and she attacks us with a sphinx. Bedivere happens to be in the area and saves us, before going off into the desert again. After working through the misunderstandings with Nitocris, we are led to Ramesseum Tentyris and have an audience with Ozymandias. Ozy really isn’t pleased with how little awareness we have of this singularity and essentially exiles us from his domain, telling us to go see the Holy City for ourselves. Using the resources Ozy gave us, Da Vinci creates the desert vehicle and we go off to the Holy City where the “haha funny buster gorilla man at the wailing wall” happens and we flee to the mountain villages. During the movie story, we are already riding the desert vehicle. Then, we suddenly cut to this shot in a village where Arash and Bedivere are chatting and Da Vinci joins in to learn about the Holy City. Bedivere quickly leaves after being told what he wants to know and runs into the Master with Mash when he has an altercation with Rushd’s mom. This is where we go off to the Holy City for the “haha funny buster gorilla man at the wailing wall” and instead flee back towards the desert into Ozy’s domain. We’re intercepted by Nitocris and escorted to Ramesseum Tentyris (why would she escort us when we have two people dressed like Knights of the Round Table with us and we have done nothing to gain her trust?) to have an audience with Ozymandias. Ozy once again banishes us from his Egypt, but orders Sanzang (who for some reason is serving him when that doesn’t happen at all in the game?) to go with us. By some random stroke of luck we find a map etched in the gem from the pendant Rushd gives us and somehow understand that we should go into the mountains. After this part, not much differs between the game’s story and the movie’s story other than that the movie’s story omits a bunch of other (important) stuff. So the main difference at this point between the game’s story and the movie’s story is that the movie has us go to Camelot before Egypt. This really skews a lot of the interactions we’re supposed to have with some characters and really makes the narrative proceed unnaturally. By going to Egypt first, our correspondence with Ozy makes more sense because we just arrived at the singularity and don’t have much of an idea of what is going on. But since we are guests to his temple because we saved his subordinate Nitocris from the bandits, we are able to interact with him more boldly and coax him to share information about the singularity. With the movie, the interaction with Ozy is placed under a different light. We’re refugees hunted by the knights of the Holy City, forced to grovel and plead for shelter in his domain. It also just doesn’t make sense why Nitocris escorted us to Ozy’s temple in the first place, because we didn’t save her like we did in the game, and we have Bedivere with us in the movie who unmistakably is dressed as a Knight of the Round Table. At that point we already understand that the Lion King is the source of the singularity, yet for some reason Ritsuka tells Ozy that “he doesn’t know what to do.” This ignorance is excusable in the game’s version of events because we just arrived in the singularity and don’t understand the situation yet, but in the movie’s version of events this just makes Ritsuka look really cowardly and dumb. There is a similar discrepancy when it comes to Bedivere, since we first meet him in the desert when he saves us from the sphinx according to the game. But with the movie we’re somehow already zooming through the desert in Da Vinci’s vehicle (that we didn’t procure any resources to make), so don’t have a chance to encounter Bedivere in the desert. The thing is, though, we must meet Bedivere at least once before the encounter with Gawain because the narrative needs to establish that he recognizes Mash’s armor. So the movie kinda puts in this really distasteful scene where Bedivere shoves aside Rushd’s mother after she begs to him for food, and we catch her before she is slammed into the ground. Bedivere is probably lore-wise the most loyal, benevolent, and kind-hearted knight of any of King Arthur’s subordinates, so the movie storywriter forcing this scene in to cover their asses for reversing the Egypt/Camelot order really gets on my nerves. Of all the ways to introduce Bedivere to the Master and Mash, they chose something like this. It doesn’t even make sense either because as the movie goes on everyone is talking about how Bedivere is so kindhearted and loyal, not even batting an eye about how he shoved aside a homeless widow when we first meet him. And then there’s Sanzang, where they don’t even cover how she used to serve the Round Table and parted ways, but in the movie they still keep in that scene about Agravain inviting her to return to them even though they never discussed how she left in the first place. For whatever reason Sanzang ends up serving Ozy which absolutely doesn’t happen in the game and since Ozy has her accompany you, she joins way earlier than in the game. This usually shouldn’t be a problem, except Sanzang is really out of character because, since she’s not supposed to be with you yet, there’s really nothing for her to do. Instead of improvising new scenarios to ease her into the group as a companion and have her contribute, the storywriter for the movie just had her kinda stand there like a scarecrow. Sanzang pretty much does absolutely nothing until we reach the prison to rescue Serenity which, go figure, is ACTUALLY when she’s supposed to join the party. If this is the case, it really bewilders me why the movie writer went out of their way to change the script from the game if they’re just gonna have Sanzang tag along so unnaturally by having her join super early. Going to Camelot before Egypt also means that Da Vinci ""dies"" way earlier in the narrative. She’s supposed to accompany us when we meet Ozy, and this opens up the amusing interaction where Ozy declares that he desires her as his concubine but the movie’s scenario doesn’t allow for that. Da Vinci only ever accompanies us in person for the Camelot singularity, so I really don’t understand the thought process behind changing the story in a way that makes her die earlier and gives her even less spotlight. We’ve talked about Ozymandias, Bedivere, Sanzang, and Da Vinci so far, so now let’s address the two elephants in the room. The two characters most affected by the movie’s changes from the game are Hundred Face and Touta, because THEY’RE NOT IN THE MOVIE. We missed out on Hundred Face at the beginning of the narrative because the movie reversed the order in which we went to Egypt and Camelot, but when the west mountain village is attacked, it’s too late to go help them and Serenity is the leader of that village instead of Hundred Face. This means the movie skips out on the legendary scene where Arash shoots us from his bow to go save west village and Hundred Face is just cut out entirely. The movie also skips Touta, which is an absolute travesty, because his master-pupil interactions with Sanzang and archer-bro-moments with Arash are some of the best scenes in the entire singularity. Touta’s absence honestly caused both Sanzang and Arash’s characters to fall apart because their relationship to Touta was just so essential to the role they played during the singularity. I was so excited to see Sanzang blast through the walls of Camelot with her buddha palm, but now that I know that Touta won’t be there, I’m already aware that I’ll be disappointed by that part before it even airs. Let’s not forget to mention that all of the mountain villages are impoverished and would’ve otherwise starved without Touta’s Noble Phantasm. There is one final difference this whole “going to Camelot before Egypt” scenario creates that really gets on my nerves, and that’s how we end up going to the mountain village. In the game, we go to Egypt first and get exiled by Ozy, then go to Camelot and get chased away by Gawain, and then we flee to the mountains at the suggestion of some of the refugees we saved. Since the movie has us go to Camelot first, we end up fleeing to Egypt next where we are denied refuge by Ozymandias, and we end up in the desert with no place to go. This point in the movie is really awkward, because with how the narrative proceeded in the movie, the group really has no leads on where to go and what to do. So the movie director pulls some scenario out of his ass where Rushd HAPPENS to give you some pendant and the sun HAPPENS to shine in just the right way such that it reveals a pattern engraved in the pendant and it HAPPENS to be a readable map with directions to the mountain villages. Instead of, you know, contacting Chaldea which has Romani to consult with, the Trismegistus Spiritron Calculation Engine, and the Near-Future Observation Lens Sheba, it makes soooooooooo much more sense to rely on this kid and some random pendant. If it wasn’t already blatantly obvious, I think the writing in this movie is awful, and it is made even worse considering there was already a parent story to simply copy into movie format. Instead, they took the liberty of making changes to the game’s story and miraculously only made the narrative worse with every change they made.That section took a whole lot longer than I thought it would, but that simply shows how much worse the movie’s narrative was than the original game’s. This section will discuss the Camelot movie’s differences with the Babylonia anime, comparing them both as adaptations of FGO’s two most exciting singularities. If the previous section was mostly about the poor writing in the Camelot movie, this section will address the subpar animation quality of the movie. The entire reason that we, as fans of Fate/Grand Order, want to see anime adaptations of the game’s story chapters is mainly to see the majesty of the game’s story come to life on screen. For example, the first thing I thought about back when the Babylonia anime was announced was that I wanted to see Merlin get attacked by Fou. It’s a completely silly scene with no narrative significance, but that’s the kind of thing that we look forward to in these anime adaptations. We want see our favorite interactions and Noble Phantasms fully played out, as grand as it was in our imaginations. I don’t think the Camelot movie delivered on that. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think the animation was bad. But this is the Fate franchise we’re talking about here. Every single anime adaptation from this series is filled to the brim with stunning scenes and dynamic shots... until now. It’s a shame to say this, but the Camelot movie had BY FAR the worst animation of anything Fate related, period. I’ve read some other reviews here saying that the animation was gorgeous or whatever, and all I can say is, do you have eyes? Did you watch the Babylonia anime, or even anything Fate related ever? I don’t know how anyone can watch the likes of Unlimited Blade Works, any of the Heaven’s Feel movies, and the Babylonia anime, and still say that Camelot with its CGI villagers looks good. Within the first 10 minutes of the movie we see this horrendous rendering of CGI townspeople that looked like they came straight out of the 2016 Berserk anime adaptation to burn holes into my eyes at 5 frames per second. Just simply comparing Uruk in the Babylonia anime to the desert city in the Camelot movie is enough to demonstrate the raw difference in animation quality. The low quality, robotic CGI in Camelot made me feel like the city was overrun by zombies that consistently moved at 5 frames per second. Let me remind everyone that this is a movie, which typically means the animation quality should be more impressive than an anime that airs on television. “Should” being the key word here, because it’s not just the horrendous CG during the initial segment at the desert city that stands out. The combat scenes in the Camelot movie were really lackluster, which is an absolute shame considering the notoriety of Camelot’s difficulty spike for FGO’s gameplay. The problem with nearly every fight in the movie was that it felt like it was all staged, as if the characters were only pretending to fight with each other. This is because the studio doing the animation abused screen cuts, which means they’d animate the start of a certain action, and then cut to the result of said action, having our brains fill in the gap. For example, the majority of the time a sword is swung in this movie, we’d see the swordsman wind up for the swing and then cut straight to where the sword made impact at the end of the swing. We barely ever see an entire sword swing animated from start to finish, which is really dishonest of the studio because the very reason why we want chapters of the game animated is to see these things in full motion. This kind of cheap technique is frequently used when the animators are either untalented, underfunded, or both. Although even the best works of animation use screen cuts occasionally, abusing it for every single fight scene is a clear sign of lazy animation. Screen cuts make attacks feel like they have less weight behind them, and constantly changing perspective in the middle of a fight scene takes away a lot of the tension. Plus, a lot of the fights are shot from super zoomed in perspectives so we don’t get a good view of what’s going on. This is yet another effort by the studio to cut animation expenditure because if the screen is more zoomed in, then there’s less to animate (conversely there’s also less for us to see). I’ve just simply never seen any other Fate animation make this many obvious efforts to try and skimp on animation quality, and it really makes the Camelot movie stand out as subpar compared to every other Fate animation. The best animated fight scene in this movie was probably Mordred vs Bedivere, but even then the fight was full of screen cuts and any fight involving Mordred in the Apocrypha animation was still better animated than Camelot. It’s just really such a letdown with all the wasted potential, because the boss fights in Camelot were so difficult and the game’s narrative made them look so powerful. The Fate franchise is so good at hyping up the power of their characters by animating a beautiful Noble Phantasm or orchestrating a battle scene that’ll make your hair stand on end, but instead we get stuff like Tristan standing in place plucking at his bow as Mash slowly marches toward him and Mordred letting Bedivere jog towards her and hit her point blank with Airgetlam. The animation as a whole in this Camelot movie just lacked so much impact compared to when Ushiwakamaru used her Noble Phantasm against Gorgon, or when Ishtar used her’s against Tiamat. Even outside of the battle scenes, a lot of the Camelot movie were just panning still shots of backgrounds. These shots felt out of place the entire movie because the backgrounds they showed weren’t even that pretty, and it’s not like they used the downtime for any narrating exposition explaining what was going on. Exposition would be so easy to do in this context because a lot of the game is simply Romani explaining something through the comms for the player, but they simply let these still shots play out with music in the background. Sometimes these still shots are really oddly framed, like there’s a shot when we’re climbing up to Ozy’s throne room where most of the background is blocked by the walls on either side of the stairs and there’s another shot that oddly lingers on a mountainside with no music or movement whatsoever. It took me 3 rewatches to finally notice three heads (Ritsuka, Mash, and Bedivere) bobbing up over part of the mountain as the party reaches the top, but the shot lasts for so long and nothing happens for the majority of it that it feels just so awkward.Most of the Camelot movie is exactly like this, where there’s just something off about the story, or the animation, or the characters in every single scene that it felt like the complete opposite of why I wanted a Camelot adaptation in the first place. The movie wasn’t necessarily bad, but there was absolutely nothing about it that was super enjoyable or impressive. It felt like less of a celebration of the fandom like the Babylonia anime was, and more like a scheme to produce something that can pass as the Camelot adaptation in the quickest, cheapest way possible in order to sell the movie tickets. One thing that I have not addressed is the time constraints, given that the entirety of the Camelot singularity needed to fit into two 1.5 hour movies which is equivalent to roughly 9 anime episodes. For reference, the Babylonia anime was 21 episodes long. While this is a valid defense for the movie, this doesn’t excuse the weird things like switching the order of the events and having lazy animation. Plus, as I mentioned before, the Camelot movie had plenty of these panning background shots with music playing over it that really served no purpose whatsoever other than filling up time. Cutting all of these scenes out would create up to 10-20 minutes of screen time that could then be used to include more important things, maybe like ACTUALLY putting all the Camelot servants in the movie. Ultimately, it doesn’t even come down to the time they had to work with, or how much money they had to throw at a pretty fight scene. It comes down to the passion put into producing the anime, which the movie obviously lacked. The single best example I can provide for this is the 40 second cameo of the Camelot singularity that was featured in episode 0 of the Babylonia anime. Sanzang’s short narration during that clip was more in line with her character than anything she did during the entire Camelot movie, and additionally that clip managed to show off ALL of the characters from the singularity (including Hundred Face and Touta) in the infamous village feast scene that the movie ever so kindly left out. Those 40 seconds were more genuine of an adaptation of Camelot than this entire movie was, which perfectly tops off how I feel about Fate/Grand Order: Shinsei Entaku Ryouiki Camelot 1 - Wandering; Agateram. Half Blood Prince movie as an introduction to the entirety of Harry Potter, or to watch the Force Awakens as one’s first Star Wars movie, or to start watching The Office from season 7. It’s no different for Fate/Grand Order. Camelot is the 6th singularity of the first arc of FGO, and Babylonia is the 7th. There is no good reason to watch these adaptations without having played the game up to that point. If you haven’t played Fate/Grand Order, then leave; and if you don’t ever intend to, then don’t come back.This is the final warning for those who haven’t played FGO. I will be assuming from this point forward that you’ve completed the first arc of FGO, because as I already previously stated, there is no point in watching these adaptations without having played the game in full.

You can add me (and feed me friend points): 917580838Okay that’s enough account shilling, time to get to the review.

During the in-game story, we rayshift into the desert where we very quickly run into Hundred Face Hassan and her group of mountain people abducting Nitocris. After saving Nitocris, she misinterprets the situation thinking that we are the kidnappers and she attacks us with a sphinx. Bedivere happens to be in the area and saves us, before going off into the desert again. After working through the misunderstandings with Nitocris, we are led to Ramesseum Tentyris and have an audience with Ozymandias. Ozy really isn’t pleased with how little awareness we have of this singularity and essentially exiles us from his domain, telling us to go see the Holy City for ourselves. Using the resources Ozy gave us, Da Vinci creates the desert vehicle and we go off to the Holy City where the “haha funny buster gorilla man at the wailing wall” happens and we flee to the mountain villages. During the movie story, we are already riding the desert vehicle. Then, we suddenly cut to this shot in a village where Arash and Bedivere are chatting and Da Vinci joins in to learn about the Holy City. Bedivere quickly leaves after being told what he wants to know and runs into the Master with Mash when he has an altercation with Rushd’s mom. This is where we go off to the Holy City for the “haha funny buster gorilla man at the wailing wall” and instead flee back towards the desert into Ozy’s domain. We’re intercepted by Nitocris and escorted to Ramesseum Tentyris (why would she escort us when we have two people dressed like Knights of the Round Table with us and we have done nothing to gain her trust?) to have an audience with Ozymandias. Ozy once again banishes us from his Egypt, but orders Sanzang (who for some reason is serving him when that doesn’t happen at all in the game?) to go with us. By some random stroke of luck we find a map etched in the gem from the pendant Rushd gives us and somehow understand that we should go into the mountains. After this part, not much differs between the game’s story and the movie’s story other than that the movie’s story omits a bunch of other (important) stuff. So the main difference at this point between the game’s story and the movie’s story is that the movie has us go to Camelot before Egypt. This really skews a lot of the interactions we’re supposed to have with some characters and really makes the narrative proceed unnaturally. By going to Egypt first, our correspondence with Ozy makes more sense because we just arrived at the singularity and don’t have much of an idea of what is going on. But since we are guests to his temple because we saved his subordinate Nitocris from the bandits, we are able to interact with him more boldly and coax him to share information about the singularity. With the movie, the interaction with Ozy is placed under a different light. We’re refugees hunted by the knights of the Holy City, forced to grovel and plead for shelter in his domain. It also just doesn’t make sense why Nitocris escorted us to Ozy’s temple in the first place, because we didn’t save her like we did in the game, and we have Bedivere with us in the movie who unmistakably is dressed as a Knight of the Round Table. At that point we already understand that the Lion King is the source of the singularity, yet for some reason Ritsuka tells Ozy that “he doesn’t know what to do.” This ignorance is excusable in the game’s version of events because we just arrived in the singularity and don’t understand the situation yet, but in the movie’s version of events this just makes Ritsuka look really cowardly and dumb. There is a similar discrepancy when it comes to Bedivere, since we first meet him in the desert when he saves us from the sphinx according to the game. But with the movie we’re somehow already zooming through the desert in Da Vinci’s vehicle (that we didn’t procure any resources to make), so don’t have a chance to encounter Bedivere in the desert. The thing is, though, we must meet Bedivere at least once before the encounter with Gawain because the narrative needs to establish that he recognizes Mash’s armor. So the movie kinda puts in this really distasteful scene where Bedivere shoves aside Rushd’s mother after she begs to him for food, and we catch her before she is slammed into the ground. Bedivere is probably lore-wise the most loyal, benevolent, and kind-hearted knight of any of King Arthur’s subordinates, so the movie storywriter forcing this scene in to cover their asses for reversing the Egypt/Camelot order really gets on my nerves. Of all the ways to introduce Bedivere to the Master and Mash, they chose something like this. It doesn’t even make sense either because as the movie goes on everyone is talking about how Bedivere is so kindhearted and loyal, not even batting an eye about how he shoved aside a homeless widow when we first meet him. And then there’s Sanzang, where they don’t even cover how she used to serve the Round Table and parted ways, but in the movie they still keep in that scene about Agravain inviting her to return to them even though they never discussed how she left in the first place. For whatever reason Sanzang ends up serving Ozy which absolutely doesn’t happen in the game and since Ozy has her accompany you, she joins way earlier than in the game. This usually shouldn’t be a problem, except Sanzang is really out of character because, since she’s not supposed to be with you yet, there’s really nothing for her to do. Instead of improvising new scenarios to ease her into the group as a companion and have her contribute, the storywriter for the movie just had her kinda stand there like a scarecrow. Sanzang pretty much does absolutely nothing until we reach the prison to rescue Serenity which, go figure, is ACTUALLY when she’s supposed to join the party. If this is the case, it really bewilders me why the movie writer went out of their way to change the script from the game if they’re just gonna have Sanzang tag along so unnaturally by having her join super early. Going to Camelot before Egypt also means that Da Vinci ""dies"" way earlier in the narrative. She’s supposed to accompany us when we meet Ozy, and this opens up the amusing interaction where Ozy declares that he desires her as his concubine but the movie’s scenario doesn’t allow for that. Da Vinci only ever accompanies us in person for the Camelot singularity, so I really don’t understand the thought process behind changing the story in a way that makes her die earlier and gives her even less spotlight. We’ve talked about Ozymandias, Bedivere, Sanzang, and Da Vinci so far, so now let’s address the two elephants in the room. The two characters most affected by the movie’s changes from the game are Hundred Face and Touta, because THEY’RE NOT IN THE MOVIE. We missed out on Hundred Face at the beginning of the narrative because the movie reversed the order in which we went to Egypt and Camelot, but when the west mountain village is attacked, it’s too late to go help them and Serenity is the leader of that village instead of Hundred Face. This means the movie skips out on the legendary scene where Arash shoots us from his bow to go save west village and Hundred Face is just cut out entirely. The movie also skips Touta, which is an absolute travesty, because his master-pupil interactions with Sanzang and archer-bro-moments with Arash are some of the best scenes in the entire singularity. Touta’s absence honestly caused both Sanzang and Arash’s characters to fall apart because their relationship to Touta was just so essential to the role they played during the singularity. I was so excited to see Sanzang blast through the walls of Camelot with her buddha palm, but now that I know that Touta won’t be there, I’m already aware that I’ll be disappointed by that part before it even airs. Let’s not forget to mention that all of the mountain villages are impoverished and would’ve otherwise starved without Touta’s Noble Phantasm. There is one final difference this whole “going to Camelot before Egypt” scenario creates that really gets on my nerves, and that’s how we end up going to the mountain village. In the game, we go to Egypt first and get exiled by Ozy, then go to Camelot and get chased away by Gawain, and then we flee to the mountains at the suggestion of some of the refugees we saved. Since the movie has us go to Camelot first, we end up fleeing to Egypt next where we are denied refuge by Ozymandias, and we end up in the desert with no place to go. This point in the movie is really awkward, because with how the narrative proceeded in the movie, the group really has no leads on where to go and what to do. So the movie director pulls some scenario out of his ass where Rushd HAPPENS to give you some pendant and the sun HAPPENS to shine in just the right way such that it reveals a pattern engraved in the pendant and it HAPPENS to be a readable map with directions to the mountain villages. Instead of, you know, contacting Chaldea which has Romani to consult with, the Trismegistus Spiritron Calculation Engine, and the Near-Future Observation Lens Sheba, it makes soooooooooo much more sense to rely on this kid and some random pendant. If it wasn’t already blatantly obvious, I think the writing in this movie is awful, and it is made even worse considering there was already a parent story to simply copy into movie format. Instead, they took the liberty of making changes to the game’s story and miraculously only made the narrative worse with every change they made.That section took a whole lot longer than I thought it would, but that simply shows how much worse the movie’s narrative was than the original game’s. This section will discuss the Camelot movie’s differences with the Babylonia anime, comparing them both as adaptations of FGO’s two most exciting singularities. If the previous section was mostly about the poor writing in the Camelot movie, this section will address the subpar animation quality of the movie. The entire reason that we, as fans of Fate/Grand Order, want to see anime adaptations of the game’s story chapters is mainly to see the majesty of the game’s story come to life on screen. For example, the first thing I thought about back when the Babylonia anime was announced was that I wanted to see Merlin get attacked by Fou. It’s a completely silly scene with no narrative significance, but that’s the kind of thing that we look forward to in these anime adaptations. We want see our favorite interactions and Noble Phantasms fully played out, as grand as it was in our imaginations. I don’t think the Camelot movie delivered on that. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think the animation was bad. But this is the Fate franchise we’re talking about here. Every single anime adaptation from this series is filled to the brim with stunning scenes and dynamic shots... until now. It’s a shame to say this, but the Camelot movie had BY FAR the worst animation of anything Fate related, period. I’ve read some other reviews here saying that the animation was gorgeous or whatever, and all I can say is, do you have eyes? Did you watch the Babylonia anime, or even anything Fate related ever? I don’t know how anyone can watch the likes of Unlimited Blade Works, any of the Heaven’s Feel movies, and the Babylonia anime, and still say that Camelot with its CGI villagers looks good. Within the first 10 minutes of the movie we see this horrendous rendering of CGI townspeople that looked like they came straight out of the 2016 Berserk anime adaptation to burn holes into my eyes at 5 frames per second. Just simply comparing Uruk in the Babylonia anime to the desert city in the Camelot movie is enough to demonstrate the raw difference in animation quality. The low quality, robotic CGI in Camelot made me feel like the city was overrun by zombies that consistently moved at 5 frames per second. Let me remind everyone that this is a movie, which typically means the animation quality should be more impressive than an anime that airs on television. “Should” being the key word here, because it’s not just the horrendous CG during the initial segment at the desert city that stands out. The combat scenes in the Camelot movie were really lackluster, which is an absolute shame considering the notoriety of Camelot’s difficulty spike for FGO’s gameplay. The problem with nearly every fight in the movie was that it felt like it was all staged, as if the characters were only pretending to fight with each other. This is because the studio doing the animation abused screen cuts, which means they’d animate the start of a certain action, and then cut to the result of said action, having our brains fill in the gap. For example, the majority of the time a sword is swung in this movie, we’d see the swordsman wind up for the swing and then cut straight to where the sword made impact at the end of the swing. We barely ever see an entire sword swing animated from start to finish, which is really dishonest of the studio because the very reason why we want chapters of the game animated is to see these things in full motion. This kind of cheap technique is frequently used when the animators are either untalented, underfunded, or both. Although even the best works of animation use screen cuts occasionally, abusing it for every single fight scene is a clear sign of lazy animation. Screen cuts make attacks feel like they have less weight behind them, and constantly changing perspective in the middle of a fight scene takes away a lot of the tension. Plus, a lot of the fights are shot from super zoomed in perspectives so we don’t get a good view of what’s going on. This is yet another effort by the studio to cut animation expenditure because if the screen is more zoomed in, then there’s less to animate (conversely there’s also less for us to see). I’ve just simply never seen any other Fate animation make this many obvious efforts to try and skimp on animation quality, and it really makes the Camelot movie stand out as subpar compared to every other Fate animation. The best animated fight scene in this movie was probably Mordred vs Bedivere, but even then the fight was full of screen cuts and any fight involving Mordred in the Apocrypha animation was still better animated than Camelot. It’s just really such a letdown with all the wasted potential, because the boss fights in Camelot were so difficult and the game’s narrative made them look so powerful. The Fate franchise is so good at hyping up the power of their characters by animating a beautiful Noble Phantasm or orchestrating a battle scene that’ll make your hair stand on end, but instead we get stuff like Tristan standing in place plucking at his bow as Mash slowly marches toward him and Mordred letting Bedivere jog towards her and hit her point blank with Airgetlam. The animation as a whole in this Camelot movie just lacked so much impact compared to when Ushiwakamaru used her Noble Phantasm against Gorgon, or when Ishtar used her’s against Tiamat. Even outside of the battle scenes, a lot of the Camelot movie were just panning still shots of backgrounds. These shots felt out of place the entire movie because the backgrounds they showed weren’t even that pretty, and it’s not like they used the downtime for any narrating exposition explaining what was going on. Exposition would be so easy to do in this context because a lot of the game is simply Romani explaining something through the comms for the player, but they simply let these still shots play out with music in the background. Sometimes these still shots are really oddly framed, like there’s a shot when we’re climbing up to Ozy’s throne room where most of the background is blocked by the walls on either side of the stairs and there’s another shot that oddly lingers on a mountainside with no music or movement whatsoever. It took me 3 rewatches to finally notice three heads (Ritsuka, Mash, and Bedivere) bobbing up over part of the mountain as the party reaches the top, but the shot lasts for so long and nothing happens for the majority of it that it feels just so awkward.Most of the Camelot movie is exactly like this, where there’s just something off about the story, or the animation, or the characters in every single scene that it felt like the complete opposite of why I wanted a Camelot adaptation in the first place. The movie wasn’t necessarily bad, but there was absolutely nothing about it that was super enjoyable or impressive. It felt like less of a celebration of the fandom like the Babylonia anime was, and more like a scheme to produce something that can pass as the Camelot adaptation in the quickest, cheapest way possible in order to sell the movie tickets. One thing that I have not addressed is the time constraints, given that the entirety of the Camelot singularity needed to fit into two 1.5 hour movies which is equivalent to roughly 9 anime episodes. For reference, the Babylonia anime was 21 episodes long. While this is a valid defense for the movie, this doesn’t excuse the weird things like switching the order of the events and having lazy animation. Plus, as I mentioned before, the Camelot movie had plenty of these panning background shots with music playing over it that really served no purpose whatsoever other than filling up time. Cutting all of these scenes out would create up to 10-20 minutes of screen time that could then be used to include more important things, maybe like ACTUALLY putting all the Camelot servants in the movie. Ultimately, it doesn’t even come down to the time they had to work with, or how much money they had to throw at a pretty fight scene. It comes down to the passion put into producing the anime, which the movie obviously lacked. The single best example I can provide for this is the 40 second cameo of the Camelot singularity that was featured in episode 0 of the Babylonia anime. Sanzang’s short narration during that clip was more in line with her character than anything she did during the entire Camelot movie, and additionally that clip managed to show off ALL of the characters from the singularity (including Hundred Face and Touta) in the infamous village feast scene that the movie ever so kindly left out. Those 40 seconds were more genuine of an adaptation of Camelot than this entire movie was, which perfectly tops off how I feel about Fate/Grand Order: Shinsei Entaku Ryouiki Camelot 1 - Wandering; Agateram.', 'So this is a 90minutes movie that covers up the first half of 6th Singularity (Camelot), If you are a Non-FGO Player or haven\'t watched any other fate works, probably shouldn\'t watch this because this movie straight up skipped explanation and a lot of things.I recommend you to watch FGO first order and FGO Initium iter first before watching this movieI write this review as a perspective from an FGO playerCharacter 10/10:Considering how the previous fate adaptation(Extra, Apocrypha, Babylonia) This is the first time THEY ADDED A PERSONALITY TO THEIR PROTAGONIST.

The only thing I knew before is that this singularity happens before Babylonia, which had received a wonderful anime adaptation that I love and adore so much. My knowledge on Type moon comes from watching previous Fate installments, and Kara no Kyoukai and interacting with some fgo and fsn vn players.Aside from Ufotable aesthetic which has been synonymous to Fate, other studios such as Aniplex owned A-1 pictures and Cloverworks also has done some fate works. Various studio gave different output, not to say the plot had many differences ; but...one thing remain unchanged, marvelous character design and excellent fight animation. Be it Zero or UBW or recent Babylonia, Fate franchise never ceased to amaze me with shiny, cool-looking and sexy characters fighting with their all while providing meaningful (or less) dialogue which never stops being exciting.This movie however is the exact opposite of what I think Fate is, or at least I used to think.This 90 minutes long movie took place in Arabian desert featuring 3 key locations, the holy city near Jerusalem, sun king\'s palace and the secret village. All of where fights between servants happened, and I regret to say, all of them sucked. From fight choreography to animation, both hand drawn or digital effect, looked so generic and dull that it might lose to any generic LN adaptation\'s sword fight. How they made a whole movie from one of the most popular mobile game and struggles in comparison with any typical TV anime?A simple sword fight between Mordred and Bedivere had minimal dynamism, lack of weight balance, no perspective and basically ""swords clash and they flash"" type things. All of the new servants had less attractive design due to a lack of details, such as Caster priest. Some focused shots on her cleavage didn’t help the fact that they looked more like a bunch of lines than a proper design. Background art looked dull, sun-king\'s castle is as gloomy looking as his kingdom, CG debris felt like a slice of cake rather than made of stone, and the subpar effect animation only made me sigh thinking about HF 3rd movie.I\'m not a huge fan of Ufotable\'s overabundant use of digital effects, but I\'ll happily take that over this dull looking mess .Above all, this movie doesn’t look or sound fancy, might be the most disappointing thing about this movie, but hold on the plot\'s there.I\'ve heard praise of Camelot\'s storyline, of how it\'s the most philosophically rich singularity. This movie put a question mark on this statement. Aside from the fact that Fate servants always required you to know who they are, this movie went beyond and failed to provide whatever they were trying to do. Not only they failed to bring out the best of the emotions servants are facing, specially Bedivere since he\'s a main character, it also caused me to feel nothing for his job. Like why he\'s so sad, acting like a heartbroken prince who just lost his kingdom. I can get behind his sadness but not throughly, it\'s like mourning for a random person\'s death. Like every death brings sadness but it becomes something special due to the person involved sharing something meaningful, a deep bond. This movie failed to provide me enough emotional context to his state of mind. It\'s not only limited to him,all the other characters faced same consequence, as if it lacked any heart.Poor character introduction, then being stubborn to provide at least some context of why the characters are doing something or what. The movie did a poor job in handling the buildup to the climax, to the point that every supposed big moment felt very underwhelming. Dialogue wasn’t adding much, it\'s clear that they were skipping huge bulk of contents within this chapter. There should have been at least one exposition scene for a non player like me. Though it\'s clear they weren’t intending to attract new audience so I guess I was already doomed to begin withMusic wasn’t anything standalone, rather they were disappointing in a sense that they failed to bring out proper emotion to the scene. Like the ending scene where something heroic was happening, but the music they played had a sad tone and I was wondering if I should feel proud for this heroic deed or mourn for his spoiled death? I was confused hence just like rest of the movie played out I was being stoical, something I didn’t expect myself to be from a fate installment.When this movie came out and every fgo fans were losing their temper I thought like every other movie adaptation they left out a lot of contents. What I didn’t expect that it actually had left out everything good about possibly every fate installments. This doesn’t even look like Fate. Coming from the exciting TV anime adaptation of Babylonia I was expecting at least some decent fight animation, cool looking characters and a whole load of waifu. I can certainly live with all the contents left behind but I can\'t accept an uncool fate. This first Camelot movie didn’t have one single good character or their moments I could cheer for, it\'s just like a bunch of unrelated stuff conjoined together having no logic no reason and no thoughts behind. From every angle I can\'t imagine a single good thing I liked about this.I\'m utterly disappointed and heartbroken, want to erase this from my memory.Though I have a faint hope the next camelot movie will at least be better than this. one thing remain unchanged, marvelous character design and excellent fight animation.

In which, they find themselves...in the \'Holy Land\' located around Jerusalem as their sixth mission to save humanity.Art – 8/10It was actually quite nice, way better than what I had originally expected after looking at the trailers and overall score of Camelot which was at the time ""6.80"", so it gave me quite a positive surprise when watching the film. An example of this would be during reminiscence scenes, the art style changes to a more ""Painting-esque"" style. Almost like looking at a series of historical art depicting actual history played in a smooth and seamless manner. I personally thought that those scenes were quite cool.Animation – 7.3/10For the most part the animation was pretty nice, nothing overtly worth mentioning, so nothing amazing and nothing eye rotting. However, one of the reasons being that a lot of scenes of conflict were cut out, like the battles with Cursed arm, the infamous sphinx fight, the fight with Ozymandias etc. So a little bit of cop out, but I can kind of understand since time restraint and all but can\'t help feeling a bit of disappointment. However, there are certain time where the animation is pretty ""hmmm"" which I will go into more detail in the spoiler part of the review.Sound and Music – 9.4/10The sound effects and background music of this film are actually very good, capable of making the viewer quite immersed in the film. If the situation called for a more dramatic track it does so and if a more melodramatic track is needed, it does so again appropriately. One particular thing I would like to especially point out, from my experience, during a \'rain scene\'. For a moment, I actually thought that it was raining outside, but then the thought of ""Wait, I\'m in a cinema inside a big mall, how can I hear rain?"" Then it hit me. That was a pleasant realisation. Next, we have another amazing song from DAVINCI CHAN. 独白 or ""Dokuhaku/Monologue"" by Sakamoto Maaya which arguably can be said to be the best part of the film not going to lie, in my opinion that is.Characters – 7/10As I am an active FGO player, I love the seeing the characters from the game finally being animated seeing them moving, living and breathing is a great feeling. That being said however, because they are in a movie, they\'re not being used to their fullest potential I feel, with either some characters being outright cut out, like Tawara Touta and Hundred Personas. Some characters are just in and out, showing themselves for brief moments at a time and then focus on them is lost, which was quite a bit of a disappointment once again.Story – 4.7/10To be perfectly honest, the story is the Achilles heel of this movie, a lot of scenes were pretty rushed and quite a bit was removed, so any build up and all that good stuff is just kind of eh. Instead of a journey, it just feels like a linear path instead. The order of events was also shuffled around for kind of no reason, guess they wanted their own personal touches, but to me it was just a bit confusing since I completed Camelot in the game a year ago. It also ends in a very weird and anticlimactic way that leaves the audience with a thought of ""Eh? That\'s it?"", so that\'s quite a big negative point there.Overall – 6/10Honestly, because my country wasn\'t the first to receive this film, I had an insight on how the overall film would be from seeing the reactions of people who watched it before me, of which were pretty negative, so I went in with like a 5/10 mindset, but because of that, I actually quite enjoyed myself to a certain extent as it wasn\'t as bad as I had originally thought it would be, so that was nice. Can\'t say the same for the other two people I was with tho xD.THE FOLLOWING WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR THE GAME UP TO SOLOMON AND THE MOVIEstill here? Aight, here we go.Firstly, the scene with Gawain was actually pretty cool, seeing him using his blessing of the sun and overpowering absolutely everyone, especially when he turns that part of the world sunny even though it\'s in the middle of the night but the murder of the boy\'s mother could have done with a bit more impact, it was like partly forgotten almost, mash\'s ""Lord Chaldeas"" was pretty cool tho as well as Davinci fisting the door down and the burning corpses of the people not chosen.Secondly, they could\'ve shown Davinci more, seeing that it\'s her first time out in a Singularity she just kind of upped and left to ""Die"" which was again kind of a disappointment.Thirdly, they didn\'t fight Nitocris, the sphinx or Oxymandias, here I was waiting for a ""Dajaku! Dajaku!"" but Nito and Mash bath scene ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) very nais. But I\'m still salty lol.Fourth, considering that Cursed arm was supposed to protect this settlement he was very trusting of the ""Outsiders"" extremely quickly contrary to him in the game which made more sense, considering his heavy responsibility.Fifth, the fight with Tristan was very anticlimactic, with Tristan being like a stationary aim-bot, not moving a single step and being taken down with a single strike that he could\'ve most likely avoided. That was a bit kind of a turn off for me.Sixth, ""STELLAAAAAA!!!!"" Was extremely disappointing, probably my most anticipated part of this film, was seeing Arash\'s NP. I was expecting an epic shot of an archer\'s last desperation, but what we got was a melodramatic normal shot that blew up…. a bit… yep a small bit. That was f****** anticlimactic as f***. I get that they were probably trying to make it seem like a sad moment but god damn, they didn\'t even accomplish that, that arrow was the embodiment of disappointment. It was akin to ""I fart in your general direction"". This was a massive disappointment especially since after the animation update, it looks so good in the game. It didn\'t even show him die, he just got forgotten and Rhongominiad went ""Welp guess I\'ll go home."" And then the movie ends.Lastly, a lot of interaction between the characters were cut out which is a bit understandable but damn. It really made the characters kind of mediocre which is sad, since I love Fate servants. in the \'Holy Land\' located around Jerusalem as their sixth mission to save humanity.Art – 8/10It was actually quite nice, way better than what I had originally expected after looking at the trailers and overall score of Camelot which was at the time ""6.80"", so it gave me quite a positive surprise when watching the film. An example of this would be during reminiscence scenes, the art style changes to a more ""Painting-esque"" style. Almost like looking at a series of historical art depicting actual history played in a smooth and seamless manner.

An example would be Tristan's fight, I have been very looking forward to it since in the game he attacks by strumming actual notes short melodies on the harp bow and arrows flies in from all directions. The casting of noble phantasms besides Stela also lacks the build up that is normally present in other shows. Small details like when Ozymandias' head slightly falls off due to reasons that would be spoilers (will be revealed in the second part hopefully) is also not included.I have no huge complaints about the sound, it uses the source materials sound track and ost so it is nice. The song by Maaya Sakamoto is also awesome love it.Like i have said in the beginning due to it being rushed character development is slightly overlooked, and some are completely removed, for new viewers that aren't loyal fans, they might be confused about the characters way of thinking and actions.Overall i enjoyed it very much simply due to the fact that they adapted a story arc from fgo, the adaptation is still very good in general and would highly recommend for people that are already familirar with the fate franchise but for new viewers this may not be your thing. unfortunately due to the high standards set by the Babylon anime and the Ufotable made ones, this is in my opinion, disappointing for a fate show.

I’ve read/experienced the larger part of the source material, and Camelot in particular is one of my favorite chapters in FGO (beaten out by Salem, and neck-and-neck with Anastasia), so for one, I have a history with the series, and two, I’ll probably be drawing comparisons to other Fate adaptations throughout this review (most specifically the FGO ones).To start, just to inform anyone, it cut two characters – Tawara Touta, a friendly Archer Class servant who tags along as “Caster’s” disciple, a decision that will have severe plot ramifications for the next movie in...particular, and Hassan of the Hundred Personas, best known for her involvement in another Fate work. Normally in this chapter, she actually would get some characterization (unlike in that other work).~~ Story:If we’re going off of pure story coverage, while I’m not sure if it’s comprehensive enough for someone who doesn’t know the source material, as someone who does, I think it does a decent job with at the very least scratching that itch. It’s kinda cool to see some of these characters that have either never been animated before, or seeing them in something else by a different studio or in a different form. That being said, the pacing of this movie is exceedingly fast. I wouldn’t say the movie itself feels rushed, but with the team only having an hour and a half of time to fill, for one of FGO’s longer chapters no less, it feels less like an adaptation, and more like a highlight reel/reinterpretation. Part of this is caused by the two lacking characters of course, but it also doesn’t start at the BEGINNING of the story. It starts close to it, but it’s more in the middle. You don’t get to see the mission set up, you only really get a taste of the original’s opening monologue, etc. etc. It expects you to know what you’re getting into. It also doesn’t really try to introduce you to the characters, which leads me to say that this isn’t really done with the uninitiated in mind – this is intended for people who are already experienced with the story in FGO. I can’t… 100% say that’s a complete issue, seeing as FGO is a mobile game that is free to play and anyone that has the capability of watching this movie probably also has the capability of playing the game, but it is still a bit of an issue.When stacked up against the Babylonia anime adaptation though… the quality of this adaptation starts to sour more in my eyes. For the most part, that series is full of fantastic action, and is relatively faithful, but here, Camelot feels like it barely hangs on. With the exception of really one character, the true main one of this movie, no one else really gets development. They speak, and you can gauge their general personality, but the movie only has so much time, so it needs to focus on the poster boy – Bedivere. He is a great character, both here and especially in FGO, but everyone else just kind of exists. Some have their moments, one moment in particular is definitely the highlight of the movie – if you’ve read Camelot, you can probably take a good guess as to which one I’m referring to – but past that, this is mostly the Bedivere show. At the very least, whenever he’s on screen, generally it’s for emotional moments, the decent action, or furthering the plot. When you see him, you can assume something interesting is going to happen - which does happen a lot. I wouldn't say it's boring - hard to be with the speed of a freight train - but it causes me to wish this was an anime, not a movie.~~ Action:On that note – the action. This isn’t Ufotable, A-1, or Cloverworks. Generally, the movie is more focused on dialogue or emotional scenes (which only really hit hard when you know the source material), but there is some action. A lot of the fight scenes are pretty short, and I feel they ranged from hard to follow to just not that interesting. Not necessarily a bad thing, as I can get down with some of these scenes, but it’s far from something I really cared about here.~~ SoundtrackAs a minor aside, the soundtrack was alright. When it made these really nice sounding orchestral renditions of FGO tracks, or the main theme of the movie, it's some good stuff, but it generally goes for this grandiose orchestra feel - I do think some of the tracks kinda melt together.~~ ConclusionOh man do I wish this was an anime and not a movie... not just for the missing characters, but for all the things skipped, missed, or just plain out wiped out of existence. Maybe my disappointment is largely caused by this being one of my favorite chapters in FGO, but despite that, I don't think it's bad - just decent. In some eyes, maybe that would be even worse than being laughably bad.Camelot was the story chapter that signified the turning point of FGO's story quality, and what brought to what the game is specifically known for today - its fantastic story. The team did what they could with the time they had, but it's a shame that it's nothing more than something that can only offer me, a Fate fan and more specifically a fan of the Camelot chapter, mild enjoyment. particular, and Hassan of the Hundred Personas, best known for her involvement in another Fate work.

Visuals aren't great for being a movie, (Aside from literally the last few scenes of it.) but the VA cast is amazing.I haven't read/played FGO and with that in mind, the story and characters were meh.If you want to know a summary of what happens in this arc of the FGO story, then it's an alright watch; otherwise just play the game or a playthrough if you're really that interested.Story: 6/10Very interesting and seems cool... BUT the movie felt very rushed and it shows with how fast the story was progressing.You've barely seen/experienced an area or event and before you know it, the...movie's already in the next. Other than that, it's cool, as is par with Fate/ in general, so if you like Fate/ it's casually good enough.Art: 6/10Just alright, like, it's okay. Not as good as I hoped it would be.If I could compare it to something, it's like the Deen movie adaptation of UBW but more modern.Definitely missing that 'movie quality' feel EXCEPT the last few scenes; that actually caught my eye and deserves some praise. It was beautiful.Sound: 5/10Let's start with the best of the sound side which is the VA cast and their work execution. The movie is filled with a good number of VAs you know and love which did all their work exceptionally. I can personally say they're the best part of the movie in general.Now, on everything else; tbh, I don't even remember most of the soundtrack. Sfx were fine, worked as intended, nothing wrong but that's it. Nothing to write home about.Character: 4/10The worst part of the movie. You see most of the cast for 3 minutes and that's all the development they get. Basically nothing. Benivere's the main focus and even he didn't get nearly enough development for me to care much. In the end, it's just enough to for me to see their character designs at least and know in general what they're about.Enjoyment: 6/10As an avid Fate fan, it was fine. There was nothing spectacular about it but it's... something. At the very least I enjoyed it enough to not just dismiss it.Overall: 6/10Seriously, all I can say is it's good enough to scratch that Fate/ itch.If I would rank it vs all the Fate/ Anime, it'd definitely be ranked on the lower half. Not visual enough vs Apocrypha or even Kaleid but not as mediocre as Deen F/SN. movie's already in the next.

Even knowing that this its one of the two part of the movies that conform this story , the total of both of them combined its just 3 hours which in most of the cases its not enought deliver and decent and emotive story well narrated, this should have been released (like most of the movies adaptation that i watched ) in an format of tv series, so in that way they could have more time to actually expand on the characters and their ambitions  as well as the story, because this actually its standout from the begginig with how actually unfold the events and the actions of the characters like with bedivere in a way really erratic and hurried.The animation look really good and the scenaries are beautiful, the settings are freaking awesome and have an good ost with one or two track that to me at least were exceling from the rest, really well despicted the backgrounds overall.The problem here is there are two or three events in the movie as we move forward were our protagonist with bedivere face the knights of the round table and these moments felt really rushed and take us out of context with dont even showing us all the battle as well as actually taking us from a second to another to another setting or objective without actually being closing the previous one that was taking place just a couple of second before, there is this kind of lack of conexion and cohesion with the differents events and also an really dissapointing waste of many characters that would be insteresting to deeph in that were dischardged too fast just for the sake to actually fit in those hour an half of the movie.Leaving maybe the protagonist and the girl (which to me at least dont seem nothign outstading and are just the cclasic architype that we haves seen many times) there were many interesting characters that with how actually begings  the movie it get us excited us wanting to know more about them, bedivere,gawaiin,ozymandias,etc but the movie didn make justice to what could end up being really good and interesting characters.It had one or two moments that were pretty good but this format its not good to adapt this kind of stories, it bassicly impossible to fit everything in just mere hour an half, it did make some things good from my perspective in how realated some past of bedivere for example or how actually started, or how well depicted the settings were, but many things wasted.RESUMEThe movie follows an structure a little to convenient for the sake of being an movie which actually its gonna make us in early stages of the movie realize that were  many things bad executed or wasted , i mean not everything was bad, but i keep insisting that if this could turned up being an series could be in the level of something really close to fate/zero and possibly at the same lv of fate unlimited blade works. If you can forget many of the things that sins and enjoy the overall the few things that had its could reccomend it to you, this its just my review for the part 1 , for what i could see the second part looks more promising so althought this might not be really good, you could give this one the go pass so it might redeem in the second part possibly giving us an decent ending. this in another series.In this case i dont gonna to separate the good and bad things that under my opinion were of this movie just because its gonna be really an really short explanation of it.Now one of the firts problems with not being the case only of this movie but in general of anime movies its that duration itselft its too short to actually give us an compelling and well narrated story, this format on most of the cases that i can think (with some exceptions) are one of the main problems of poor adaptations and really rushed and fast paced development with many plot holes in it and ending with characters that we cannot symphatize or even undertand the intentions or ambitoins of them because of how bad are portrayed.

If you compare them to ""regular"" shows, you\'ll notice this movie had superior animation but other Fate films have way better looking fights.Sound:1) the soundtrack is very Fate-like so if you have enjoyed it so far, you\'ll have no complaints2) I don\'t think the new characters fit their seiyuus. I\'m not saying the voice actors are bad (in fact I like them and their work), I\'m saying that different voices would fit them better3) sometimes the soundtrack and sound effects are too loud compared to dialogStory and characters:1) This movie doesn\'t offer many chances for Ritsuka and Mash to develop their bond. In fact, this film is all about the plot and nothing else except the plot2) I find the new characters incredibly generic and not very engaging. The story itself didn\'t grab me either.In conclusion, it\'s one of those movies where as a Fate fan, you will tell yourself to watch it but then again it\'s also something to watch when you\'re bored because if you go into this expecting something with the quality of Unlimited Blade Works, you\'re going to be extremely disappointed.It\'s a 6/10 from me. 2) I like the character design3) comparing the action/fight scenes of previous fate series, I feel this movie didn\'t have the same treatment.

I was waaaaay disappointed more than what I thought I would be.- No Touta or Hassan, who are one of the big characters inside the story.- Who tf suggested Mash and Nitocris bath scene?- Even I as an FGO player, I was not able to grasp the whole movie because it was messed up. From plot A to Plot B. Jumping plots everywhere. Since the key characters were removed, it felt more empty.- Ozy and Mordred looked weird. And where's the sliding Ozy head?...I even looked forward to that.It felt rushed. No, it IS rushed. I wish they made this as a series instead, so that only a few of parts should be cut. So many inaccuracy inside the movie that I decided to just quit watching. Babylonia hits the right spot, but this one just dropped. I even looked forward to that.It felt rushed. No, it IS rushed. I wish they made this as a series instead, so that only a few of parts should be cut. So many inaccuracy inside the movie that I decided to just quit watching. Babylonia hits the right spot, but this one just dropped."", 'As I sit down to write a review of this movie, the first thought that popped into my head is that the weirdly off-kilter and extreme reaction of what I would presume to be the Fate community is perhaps more fascinating and noteworthy than the movie itself. I could offer a tl;dr version of a review by just saying, eh, it\'s fine, but a notable step down from Babylonia. However, a lot of what I\'ve seen out there prompted me to write something more substantial.Outside of Carnival Phantasm and Zero, Babylonia was interestingly enough one of my favorite Fate anime entries in spite of not...being as familiar with the gacha\'s story as many when I first saw it. So I went into this movie with higher expectations than I probably should have for a movie based off a gacha story. Babylonia perhaps benefited from being in a longer television format and thus being able to drop more action sequences early on to break up long stretches of plot development. But with that said, I don\'t necessarily find that to be Camelot\'s problem.Rather, Camelot feels like it suffers from its incredibly brief 90 minute runtime. The movie drops a lot of plot on the viewer in a pretty rapid fashion, and while it\'s not impossible for a newcomer to follow, it\'s certainly not the easiest. That said, again I don\'t feel it\'s any worse than just about any other Fate entry in this regard, but it certainly needed at least another 15 minutes worth of runtime to better pace itself and to let certain sequences breath. In addition, it was always going to suffer with viewers coming to it from outside the gacha since sequentially it comes before Babylonia, which in turn tried to summarize 5 Singularities worth of story in under ten minutes. I would definitely recommend starting with Babylonia before seeing this for those unfamiliar with the gacha\'s story.One can particularly observe this effect on the movie\'s incredibly brief action sequences. For a series many look to for creative big-budget action sequences, there really isn\'t much of note in this movie that will scratch that particular itch.  In addition, while I won\'t say the animation looks cheap, it definitely lacks a certain fluidity, especially while in motion, compared to Babylonia. I think in part they wanted the action to feel weightier than Babylonia due to the more serious tone of the story, but there are ways to do this without making it feel so slow and lifeless.Perhaps the general complaint that can be placed on the movie is it feels like the first half of a longer movie rather than having a natural break-point. The overall story will largely require the second movie to judge, but with that being said, this movie doesn\'t stand the best on its own like many movies would in a 2-3 part series. The climax suffers in particular, though it ends on a good story beat. But with that said, I think the rather mediocre fight sequences leading into this moment are what drag down the finale.The highlight of the movie by far was two what I would call ""dream sequences,"" produced in part by a particularly noteworthy animator if one is familiar with the Monogotari series. Flat out, these two sequences are the two single best works of animation in the entire Fate franchise, and I would go whale the gacha to get a full movie made in this style.The cast of the movie was a mixed bag, though that in part feels like a by-product of the rushed pace. My two favorites ended up being Bedivere and Da Vinci. The movie does a good job of starting to convey to the audience just how much Bedivere has suffered throughout his journey, and I appreciate they didn\'t just make him a one-note ""good guy"" even though I have seen complaints about a certain moment in particular. Meanwhile, Da Vinci just brings a life to every scene that she\'s focused on. Fujimaru and Mash remain kind of nondescript gacha MCs, although there is some promise of Mash finally getting some character development in this storyline compared to Babylonia. I truly am intrigued by the Lion King and look forward to her development in the next film.Now to address a few things I had heard going into the movie that I simply didn\'t agree with after seeing it. First off, I\'ve seen many complain the movie has pacing issues/fails to explain elements of the plot properly. Here\'s the thing: that\'s pretty much every Fate anime. I question if these same people saw the dozens of Reddit threads on the FSN subreddit of viewers unable to understand the ending of the third Heaven\'s Feel movie. Did they also agree that movie has equally as many pacing problems/lore explanation problems before rushing to award it a 9 or a 10, or is it just an issue now all of a sudden? If there\'s one expectation I have of every Fate anime, it\'s issues relating to how obtuse and needlessly complex the series\' lore is and how they always struggle converting their stories from other mediums. I didn\'t particularly find Camelot movie 1 more egregious than say the first half of Zero or the HF movies. You will naturally have an easier time understanding it if you\'ve played FGO before of course. This is just par for the course with the Fate franchise at this point.Second, look, not every Fate anime is going to be produced by Ufotable. With that said, I would like to think anyone who saw Babylonia can\'t possibly say other studios can\'t produce Fate anime that looks as good or roughly as good as Ufotable\'s work (I\'ll go so far as to say Babylonia has the best directed fight sequences in the franchise IMO). Rather, I would endorse others to differentiate complaints about the animation/direction related to specific scenes or sequences from those simply unhappy Ufotable didn\'t produce this movie.And finally, and perhaps more noteworthy, this whole ""two characters were replaced by a bath scene"" controversy is the silliest damn mountain of salt I\'ve seen in some time. It\'s pure malarkey. For starters, it is a scene in a bath where you will see less cheek from Mash than her normal armor presents. It lasts a whopping 40 seconds, and is there to quickly establish a singular plot point. If anyone seriously believes that two characters could be established in said 40 seconds of screen time, they weren\'t noteworthy enough characters to worry about to begin with. Cuts happen when you move between formats. I\'m sorry two characters who were favorites of some in the original story were removed, but relating it to this scene is disingenuous at best.All together, this movie is functional, though unremarkable. I don\'t think it will wow anyone, but it serviceable enough to set up the next film, which looks more promising. I would highly endorse seeing this one with an open-mind and lowered expectations while ignoring the zeitgeist surrounding it. being as familiar with the gacha\'s story as many when I first saw it.

Feel free to agree or disagree with the points I will make.Take note that I am an avid FGO player and have played through every chapter in the global server of the game.Story: 5Okay so first off, let me tell you that FGO is a very long story. Camelot alone has 6-10 hours of read time inside the game depending on your individual reading speed. As this is a movie, 2 movies each with 1.5-2 hours of runtime, it will never be able to show every aspect of the story. The fact...that this is one of the later story chapters also caused some issues. Anime only peeps will have a ton of exposition just smacked into their faces that they might not understand properly. The overall pacing was just a mess since content was cut out here and there, like the initial meeting of Nitocris with Chaldea before they go to the Holy City and fight Gawain and when Ozymadias' head slided off a bit for spoiler-ish reasons.This next one might purely be biased because I like Gawain but the movie did not portray him well. He was seen as this knight without match if he was under the sun. In the game, Bedi was barely able to match him by himself which allowed Mash and Da Vinci to break the circling formation of the guards to make an escape route in which the survivors retreated. Bedi clearly showed signs of pain stemming from the use of his arm. In the movie, Gawain was apparently knocked out by Bedi and then they make their escape.They also removed two charancters, Hassan of the hundred personas and Tawara Touta, but this was understandable because the role they took are far less important the the ones who remained. I was still pretty sad tho because I liked Hundred Personas.Art and Sound: 6It was nothing of note about the art and sounds except the cg crowds used. I was constantly noticing it because of how out of place they look but the cg knights was actually better than what I imagined it to be.Character: 8This is one of the best story writing the game has to offer since Nasu, the writer of the original Fate/Stay Night, is the one who wrote it. This is the best part of the movie and what made me fall in love with the game. Some parts didn't make it to the movie very well though so I put an 8 in the character.Enjoyment: 10Okay, I'll be real here. I enjoyed the movie the most because of the portrayal of Arash's sacrifice in the last scene of the movie. It was shown as a last sacrifice where a hero stopped this all powerful goddess' verdict to destroy them in the game version of this scene. In the movie, it was shown as a sacrifice to save everyone in the village. I think the movie making it so that Arash shows up in front of everyone who is now falling to despair made is just as great as the game. Seeing one of my favorite stories in game which I have stuck with for a long period of time animated has also upped my enjoyability.Overall: 7This movie is really catered around fans of the game in my opinion. FGO players will easily find this more enjoyable than others. As I am one of them, my score might be higher than a standard person's score. If you want a better experience, play through the game yourself or you can read the story online on youtube. I can guarantee you that the game version of Camelot will be worth your time. that this is one of the later story chapters also caused some issues.

I recognised some characters and concepts, but outside of that, I was mostly bored..It starts off interestingly enough. The hero travels back in time to find the irregularity and solve it. In this case, it looks like the knights of the round table have gone mad. So we got a mystery on our hands, yay! It starts off promising, but then--Then, it becomes painfully game-y. Walking from point A to point B, then to C, back to...A, back to C again, the end.

I should be very biased when it comes to this, but even I cannot and will not defend this adaptation at all.TL;DR : They changed the story, the story is so fast paced, and the story is incoherent. Because of those reasons, 2 Characters were cut, there are alot of  plot holes and alot of quirky moments in the game that could be in such as ARASH EXPRESS was changed into a BATH SCENE!? Yeah no.Story 1/10 :Alright let me preface this from the beginning. As...someone who played the Camelot Singularity and experiencing the true difficulty bump in the game with my Dantes and dragging myself through the bloody deserts of Camelot, this singularity has become one of my favorite all time story that came out of Fate Grand Order, so this singularity holds dear to me. So when I heard that they are going to make this into a 2 parter movie, I can already imagine, how this can be made into an awesome movie. However what I did not anticipate was the exclusion of multitudes of scene which ruins the flow of the story. In other words, this feels rushed... Rushd... heh. I just have to make the joke sorry.Let me make a list here that diverts the story.==Spoiler Alert==-There is a scene  before we arrive to the singularity (in the game) where it presents why Xuanzang Sanzang left the Holy City of Camelot, hence why it explains why she knows of Agravain and his powers.-The story immediately directs itself towards the holy city, there is no fight in the desert against Hundred Faces Hassan and saving Nitocris from her kidnapper. This is not only will affect later scenes with Nitocris but they effectively remove Hundred Faces Hassan Entirely.-Tawara Touta was nowhere in sight. This will heavily impact the 2nd movie if there are. Tawara plays a VERY important in making Xuanzang Sanzang's character.-After escaping the Royal Selection, How do they know where the sun king is? Was there even sun king in the first place? What happened here?-Due to no Hundred Faces Hassan, there is no Arash express... Come on, this was important and hell I'll take this over the Bath Scene.So in other words, they removed alot of scenes which ruins the flow of the movie. I feel like they could have changed with the exclusion of Tawara and Hundred Faces but they have to change it into something, otherwise Nitocris being friendly does not make sense upon arriving to the pyramid.==End of Spoiler==I honestly would be lost if I were not to have played the game yet. No... if anything I am more confused on the flow because I played the game. What the hell happened to the flow of the story? What is going on? I was questioning what the hell happened in the last sequence. Why is the village in flames? Since when and what happened?Art and Sound : 7I don't have qualms. Soundwork and Artstyle is gorgeous. So if you just want to watch cute girls and buffed boys do some action sure.Character: 3Again, characterization is important, dialogues I believe is important. We barely get to know the character. This is coming from a Fate GO player. I feel like we don't have the connection between the characters. It's like they're there to feed the action scenes and nothing more.Enjoyment: 2Because of my subverted expectations... for the wrong reasons. I can't say I enjoyed it. It was terrible experience. Honestly I would not even consider this an adaptation, more like a fan re-write. The fight scenes, was flashy and cool but I believe they're just there to fill in the movie. I only enjoyed... 10 minutes of the movie. And that is quite generous if I may say so.Overall 3:Rushed, Too fast paced, incoherent. These are the words that I want to describe camelot. Due to the cut characters and scenes, the action scenes and the sequence becomes disrupted. The story becomes all over the place which causes plot holes. What the hell happened there at the end, how did it end up in flames?Yeah this movie is in flames. Only a miracle can save the second movie. someone who played the Camelot Singularity and experiencing the true difficulty bump in the game with my Dantes and dragging myself through the bloody deserts of Camelot, this singularity has become one of my favorite all time story that came out of Fate Grand Order, so this singularity holds dear to me. So when I heard that they are going to make this into a 2 parter movie, I can already imagine, how this can be made into an awesome movie. However what I did not anticipate was the exclusion of multitudes of scene which ruins the flow of the story. In other words, this feels rushed... Rushd... heh. I just have to make the joke sorry.Let me make a list here that diverts the story.==Spoiler Alert==-There is a scene  before we arrive to the singularity (in the game) where it presents why Xuanzang Sanzang left the Holy City of Camelot, hence why it explains why she knows of Agravain and his powers.-The story immediately directs itself towards the holy city, there is no fight in the desert against Hundred Faces Hassan and saving Nitocris from her kidnapper. This is not only will affect later scenes with Nitocris but they effectively remove Hundred Faces Hassan Entirely.-Tawara Touta was nowhere in sight. This will heavily impact the 2nd movie if there are. Tawara plays a VERY important in making Xuanzang Sanzang's character.-After escaping the Royal Selection, How do they know where the sun king is? Was there even sun king in the first place? What happened here?-Due to no Hundred Faces Hassan, there is no Arash express... Come on, this was important and hell I'll take this over the Bath Scene.So in other words, they removed alot of scenes which ruins the flow of the movie. I feel like they could have changed with the exclusion of Tawara and Hundred Faces but they have to change it into something, otherwise Nitocris being friendly does not make sense upon arriving to the pyramid.==End of Spoiler==I honestly would be lost if I were not to have played the game yet. No... if anything I am more confused on the flow because I played the game. What the hell happened to the flow of the story? What is going on? I was questioning what the hell happened in the last sequence. Why is the village in flames? Since when and what happened?Art and Sound : 7I don't have qualms. Soundwork and Artstyle is gorgeous. So if you just want to watch cute girls and buffed boys do some action sure.Character: 3Again, characterization is important, dialogues I believe is important. We barely get to know the character. This is coming from a Fate GO player. I feel like we don't have the connection between the characters. It's like they're there to feed the action scenes and nothing more.Enjoyment: 2Because of my subverted expectations... for the wrong reasons. I can't say I enjoyed it. It was terrible experience. Honestly I would not even consider this an adaptation, more like a fan re-write. The fight scenes, was flashy and cool but I believe they're just there to fill in the movie. I only enjoyed... 10 minutes of the movie. And that is quite generous if I may say so.Overall 3:Rushed, Too fast paced, incoherent. These are the words that I want to describe camelot.

I don\'t really want to waste your time so I\'ll make this review as short as possible.Art/Animation: 7Coming from a subsidiary of Production IG, the anime doesn\'t look bad with rather consistent and downright beautiful art from time to time. While Artoria looks different in this adaptation, it looks alright since she is supposed to be an older version compared to...the FS/N series. However, the animation is another...story. There are very few fights in the anime and the animation, in general, is a bit lacking, filled with mostly dialogue-heavy scenes. Whenever there are fight scenes, it looks decent but unlike something out of Ufotable, the camera itself is very stiff and static throughout with some weird scenes that just look..off. While it won\'t blow your socks off, the animation is ""decent"" paired with stellar art. As you\'ll read in a bit, the animation and art is not even the Achilles\' heel of this movie.Music/Sound: 7The actual soundtracks have lots of potential which isn\'t really anything surprising. They sound good, amazing, and quite bombastic at times. So why is it only a 7? A few of the soundtracks are often...misused, conveying a different emotion when what you\'re seeing would tell you otherwise. Imagine an epic scene with sad music playing in the background. Same with the art/animation, this isn\'t really what I call a negative, just criticisms I have for the film. It\'s not unbearable, just perhaps a missed opportunity if the soundtracks were used in a better way.Story: 4This is where everything falls apart for me. I had re-watched the film another 2-3 times to get a better idea of what it was all about and even then, I was still lost. Simply put, the story is terrible. You are only given snippets of information through short ""flashback"" sequences and out of context dialogue.The result was that the audience was pretty confused throughout the movie. While there\'s nothing wrong with dropping small hints regarding the narrative, there is something wrong when you don\'t drop ENOUGH of them. Characters are also sort of introduced on the fly and you barely feel any attachment to them so if/when they die, the whole thing becomes a joke. The movie tries to make you care for characters but because of the lack of development and/or screentime, it fails terribly at that. While the story might feel slow-paced for some people, the lack of development, context, and abrupt scene changes make this movie feel rushed but at least we got that Nictoris bath scene 👀.CONCLUSION: 5The end result is a confusing, rushed, and barely developed story that fails to entertain and hook the audience. Most characters introduced end up being really one-dimensional and since you barely know who they are or what they are like, you end up not giving a shit so whenever there are emotional scenes, it\'s a damn joke that feels comical. With stellar art and decent but sparse animation, it really isn\'t enough to carry the clusterfuck of a story that this movie is. This isn\'t a Ufotable film and the lack of dynamic and fluid camera movement really shows. It\'s decent animation but not good or great like what Ufotable would usually do and because of the garbage plot, the movie overall is mediocre, not something that I would recommend. the FS/N series.

You\'re dropped straight into the story without any introduction or anything. It\'s incredibly fast going from one story-beat to the next without really developing anything. You barely get to take in the severity of what\'s happening. You hardly get a chance to get to know characters at all. ""Here\'s this character, you\'ll barely see anything of them until an important moment you\'re supposed to care about, but because...we didn\'t build their character, you probably won\'t care about it"".Animation is very subpar (sometimes bad even) for what I expect from a movie and imo below the FGO Babylonia anime.Now pulling in the adaption part: fuck me, they skipped a lot. Big moments cut short and character moments cut out. This was an overblown highlight reel, where they even highlighted the less important parts.Sometimes I lost track, despite having played Camelot.The game\'s music is heavily underutilised, often trying to be a Yuki Kajiura rip-off while not realising there\'s a goldmine of music ready to be adapted into actual recorded orchestral form from the game itself. They did use it sometimes (and those were pretty good), but not that much. The music doesn\'t feel that coherent as a result.It\'s not that the music in the movie was bad, just not well done either.The only thing it had going for it was that I knew the source material.Just an all-round disappointment.The Babylonia TV anime was better in almost every regard, even taking the end and earrape into account.I guess this FGO adaptation didn\'t have earrape, so I guess that\'s nice. Not sure it\'s worth the trade-off. we didn\'t build their character, you probably won\'t care about it"".Animation is very subpar (sometimes bad even) for what I expect from a movie and imo below the FGO Babylonia anime.Now pulling in the adaption part: fuck me, they skipped a lot.

This movie was rather boring, and hard to get through at 3am.  That is probably a combination of me being tired and this movie just being bland.  Unfortunately, my expectations were high considering this singularity involved the ethos of King Arthur, but this first half of this story just didn't do it justice.  We do get to meet some okay characters, and we do have a story here, but it all just isn't on par with Babylonia.  I'm getting...the feeling that after part 2, i might feel that these 2 movies are irrelevant, much like First Order.  We'll see, but in general, just a meh feeling after watching this.Animation 7/10-  Better than First Order, worse than Babylonia, not as flashy as I was expecting.Sound 7/10-  SE are not as bad as First Order, they are pretty decent overall.  Everything else is standard voice acting n such for Fate Grand Order.Story 5/10-  The story is half done, so can't really give it high scores if its half-baked.  It's okay, but it's boring imo.Characters 5/10-  For me, the characters were bland, boring, not typical of the Fate I've seen before.  The servants are not interesting whatsoever.  Seeing Da Vinci was okay.Enjoyment 6/10-  I couldn't wait to go to bed while watching it.  It's just very average.I get the feeling that this, much like First Order, is simply not needed.  Watch Babylonia for sure.  I can't recommend this to anyone but completionists. the feeling that after part 2, i might feel that these 2 movies are irrelevant, much like First Order.

Genjitsu no Yohane: Sunshine in the Mirror,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52214/Genjitsu_no_Yohane__Sunshine_in_the_Mirror,"['Very rarely does a meme turn into something as good as the Yohane spin-off. Originally created as an April Fool’s Day joke, Sunrise saw the reception and decided to make it a real anime. I’m glad they did. Yohane has been my favourite Aquors member and 2nd favourite Love Live girl for a long time and the story in this one really did her justice.Allowing her to shine in a way she just couldn’t get in the main anime due to sharing the spotlight with the other girls. The show manages to keep the feeling of the original Sunshine series, while mixing in a modern...fantasy element. The fantasy aspect is a little underwhelming. It does feel like the story is very self-contained to the small town in which it takes place, however, as with all Love Live titles, the show really shines with the character interactions.Yohane and her faithful companion Lailaps have a very nice, almost sibling relationship. Over the course of the show we see the two of them bond and come to understand each other. Despite being an original creation for this anime, I quickly got attached and fell in love with Lailaps. The struggles that she and Yohane go through over the course of the show, how she comforts Yohane in her times of need.. Just really resonated with me. It’s a simple yet poignant relationship. While the other girls do feature in the show heavily, it’s very much a Lailaps and Yohane story at its core. Yohane growing into her own person is a very sweet story and I loved every moment of it.As I said, the rest of the Aquors cast are in the show as side characters. Some more than others. They basically act as a plot device for Yohane to become more independent and leave her childhood behind. There’s some cute moments with the cast as they try to help Yohane through some emotional trauma she’s had, but this is very much her story. So don’t expect too much in terms of substance and development from the other girls.The fantasy elements like I said are kind of weak. The whole overarching plot of the calamity ended up being somewhat underwhelming, but the characters are the main selling point in this one. I think if you are at all interested in Yohane from the Sunshine anime this is a must watch as it really shows who she is at her core. A lot of times she was used as comic relief during the main anime, and while she is definitely funny, there is a lot more to her than memes. So this was a welcome development.Of course, you can’t talk about Love Live without the musical performances. As expected based on the series’ recent form, the songs in GNY are all great. There’s a couple group performances and some solos and they’re all bangers. I swear the songwriters are just getting better and better with these. They’re going from more anime-y songs to legit bops.The CGI continues to improve to a point where it’s almost indistinguishable from 2D animation in these performances. The future is certainly bright for idol shows.I thoroughly enjoyed Genjitsu no Yohane and thought it was one of the most underrated shows of the season. It went from an April Fool’s meme to a genuinely heartwarming and moving experience for one of my favourite characters  that had me in tears for a couple episodes. If you’re a Love Live fan it goes without saying this is a much watch, but it’s also an enjoyable slice of life fantasy watch for casual fans. It’s cute, simple, but effective.Genjitsu no Yohane gets 9, out of 10. fantasy element. The fantasy aspect is a little underwhelming.

I need a second season bro.Genjitsu no Yohane started out as an April's Joke from the sunrise staff surprisingly became an actual anime with deep messages and gripping character development. They could've made this anime as a joke, but they didn't. The staff went above and beyond with this anime, and I praise them for that. This is a spin-off with a lot of heart put into it.The story - I'm gonna keep this review spoiler-free so do not worry. The story of this anime is more of a character-driven story focused on Yohane,...rather than LL Sunshine where the focus is on everybody. Every episode focuses entirely on Yohane, tackling each and every one of her flaws., and by the end of this season, she grew so much to the point that I could honestly say that she's a better written and developed character compared to her LL Sunshine counterpart.The characters - as you can expect from a spin-off, the characters here are the same characters that we know and love from LL Sunshine. Not entirely the same because it's a spin-off, and they need to at least alter one or two traits of the characters in order to fit in to a new setting. They are all well-written and competent characters that amplifies the enjoyment I watch from the show. Yohane, of course, is the best written character here as expected of the main character, but the other characters also gets better and get development. I won't say who they are to keep this spoiler-free. I'd say though, my favorite character in this show is Chika, because she heightens up Yohane's character, she felt like a mentor-figure, like once a main character before, so she teaches the knowledge that she has to Yohane, which in turn makes Yohane develop.The animation - even as a spin-off, the main selling point of Love Live is still the songs and the dance that comes with them. And let me tell you, the dance animation here is on another level. Sunrise really is the Best in the industry when it comes to human CGI. I've praised them a lot before, but I really feel like they reached another Peak here. The action scenes are also amazing as well. It's not ufotable level of course, but it's not lacking for an anime made in 2023.The art of course is beautiful. The art of Love Live has always been top-notch since Sunshine, and I'm happy to say that they've continued to be Peak here as well.The music - It's originally a music anime. So do you really expect me to give this category any less than 10?Overall, I'm really happy with my conclusion with this review. It's unbiased and really tells you the actual quality of the show. rather than LL Sunshine where the focus is on everybody.

Granted the advertising may have played a part in it but still I feel like some people just set such high expectations (it is love live after all) that they just ignore the good things about the anime. I can understand people wanting more of the Calamity but the whole plot isn’t about it. it’s about Yohane and her arc of growing up and finding a place in...the world like that’s literally been her goal since the beginning people saying it never moves the plot along isn’t accurate it is moving the plot just not the plot people want, and in terms of that arc I think it succeeds in it. I also don't mind the more slice of life it goes for, as it gives plenty of opportunities for character focused episodes and more interesting character dynamics something that imo the original Sunshine really struggled with. It's actually nice seeing characters like You, Kanan and Maru get an actual episode instead of being kinda neglected through out the show, and its great seeing characters actually interact with characters outside of just general year groups hell id say they feel more like a group of friends then they do in Sunshine. I do have some issues with it however, I think they couldve done more with the magic as most of the fantasy elements (calamity, yohanes staff, ruby's whole fairy thing) just kinda have no explanations for how they work and it feels kinda jarring. I also think in terms of songs compared to other Love Live shows is pretty weak which is a shame because I think if the show didnt have to insert singing and the usual love live tropes they couldve done more with the fantasy setting and done more with the magic elements. However, despite that I still really enjoyed it, if you judge the show on it's own and not just what you want it to be I think its a really good anime it is not better then sip or niji, but Yohane's character arc, the cast, and the honestly great animation has really kept me enjoying this show the whole way through looking forward to see how it ends. the world like that’s literally been her goal since the beginning people saying it never moves the plot along isn’t accurate it is moving the plot just not the plot people want, and in terms of that arc I think it succeeds in it.

On one side is a iyashikei-style slice-of-life series about a girl returning to her charming village hometown and reconnecting with its fantastical inhabitants in an increasingly rare instance of a fantasy world in anime that actually feels unique among a sea of carbon-copy generic isekai JRPG-inspired...worlds. On the other is the series' agonizing insistence on trying to be something Bigger than that despite not needing to be anything else.This show is an audiovisual treat, not just in the musical segments one would expect from the franchise, but in its entirety. The original soundtrack is beautiful and something I see myself listening to in the future when it is released, and I found the art style here much more enjoyable than the standard Love Live style. This is definitely the kind of show whose idyllic setting endears itself to the viewer and leaves them wishing it were real.The cast of characters are mostly charming -- when the show actually gives them focus. Overall, I think the cast is slightly too large which leaves several characters feeling rather pointless and undeveloped. This problem is exacerbated by the show's core issue: its desire to give its story bigger stakes than it needs leads to time that could be spent further exploring the girls' lives being interrupted repeatedly by a nebulous apocalyptic Bad Magic Thing that is seemingly trying to destroy the town. The first time it happens, it sets up an interesting plot hook, but it quickly grows tiresome as it becomes evident that the series is not particularly interested in fleshing out the exact nature of this so-called Calamity, where it came from, or even what exactly it represents as a metaphor. It seems as if it was intended to represent Yohane distancing herself from the people of Numazu, as it strikes most intensely when she decides to leave town again and is only solved by her coming together with her friends to stand together in song and settle down in Numazu, but it wasn't particularly troublesome when she left for the city before the start of the story so it's hard to understand why Yohane in particular is so essential to the happiness of Numazu.As if its main character arc's weren't muddled enough, YOHANE makes it even worse with its clumsy handling of the character of Lailaps. Lailaps is a giant talking dog who starts the series acting as something of a sister-figure for Yohane who encourages her to open up to the people of Numazu and start to reintegrate herself as part of the local community. It is later revealed that Lailaps was once a normal dog, but was granted her personality and the ability to speak by Yohane's magic. Lailaps is thus a fragment of Yohane's own psyche created as a companion that harbors bitter feelings toward her creator's desire to leave Numazu and pursue a career in music, leaving her behind. This is expressed through a desire to make Yohane reliant on her to keep her from leaving. The climax of Yohane's character arc is a confrontation between the two in which they realize they are two parts of a whole and that the parts of Lailaps that Yohane have been inside her the whole time and that what Lailaps truly wants is for her to become the best possible version of herself.This... somehow leads to Yohane deciding to stay in Numazu instead of following her dream of becoming a famous singer because she has an inexplicable sudden realization that what she really wanted was to inspire people through song and she's been doing that already in Numazu? Yohane's character arc is abruptly brought to a conclusion without a strong reason. This being where she ends up makes sense and is the conclusion the show had been obviously telegraphing for a while, but it seems like the writers forgot that simply creating a character arc with a logical conclusion doesn't mean they don't need to explain how it reaches that point. This clumsy storytelling takes what should've been an extremely straightforward story and derails it with dull melodrama.I really did like this show at the start, despite its flaws, but by the end it becomes too messy to ignore and lost me. worlds.

Then comes the middle of the show where each episode just felt like time filler for the next song that will be performed and the main antagonistic force at play is completely forgotten about so much so that the show felt like it was dragging. Fantasy setting? Very underutilized. World building? Not much of it. What danger is there? Just a few deer in 2 eps... While the final episodes finally turned the gears for something to happen in the show, the emotional parts fall...flat due to the dragging of those middle episodes but at least the ending is a bit middle of the road. The anime could've been better if it didn't introduce an antagonistic force and focused on being a pure slice of life but they chose to try to do both and somehow sacrificed the plot and made a muddy sol. In conclusion, if you're an Aqours fan you can find some moments that can make you excited Aqours is back animated if you ignore everything else...while for others new to this franchise looking for something not idoly I'd say it's safe to skip. flat due to the dragging of those middle episodes but at least the ending is a bit middle of the road.

From showing Yohane as a powerful and interesting magician (as her version of sunshine suggests) or just showing the Aqours girls in a different, perhaps more fantasy setting, could be fun.Hell, even a Slice of life of Aqours in the real world would have been funnier than this.From the first moment, where I saw that the worldbuilding of this series is loose and...inconsistent, being literally the real world but with more medieval aesthetics (or futuristic in tokyo for some reason) I feared that this is not a too well thought out series.It\'s interesting to see how some characters, like Mari, Hanamaru and Kanan, were treated, drastically improving their performance in the series and slightly changing to a more interesting (or at least different and entertaining) personality. I enjoyed seeing many characters with their new personalities, even those that the script mistreated by giving them very little screen time (like You Watanabe) and Ruby because that\'s where you can tell they based the personalities on the ones the girls had at the end of Love Live Sunshine (since they grew up a year).However, this does not apply to Yohane. Having too much screen time hurt her too much. When you take away Yoshiko\'s ""chuuni"" joke she\'s not as funny anymore, let alone if you turn her into a victimizing character.It shows a lot in the enjoyment and energy of the series when another character takes the lead, especially when Chika, who used to be the main character in the original series, does it.The result: I keep feeling that Yohane is putting the stick in the bicycle wheel. Repeatedly I\'ve come across entire scenes of Yohane complaining. Because there\'s something she doesn\'t want to do, because there\'s something she can\'t do, or because Lailaps got lost for the fourth time.Yohane from the Sunshine in the Mirror universe makes Yoshiko from Love Live Sunshine look like a multifaceted character, and this is problematic, because it ends up making all the other characters in the series look more mature and capable than the protagonist.It\'s left intuited that Yohane is special because she is, and I kept feeling that most of her friends are friends with her for no good reason. I understand that this show only has 13 episodes to lay all the groundwork, but maybe a little less screen time of Yohane complaining, looking for Lailaps or searching for her wand would have helped.And this is where I open up a point. The story concerning the calamity felt both confusing, rushed and convenient. Always the calamity appeared when a cliffhanger should be made, and the next episode it turns out to be the simplest thing to fix. Even in moments like episode 3, when they spend it fighting off some deer. Chika and her sisters can fight two of them with no problem, but for some reason they need a whole transformation sequence and special weapons along with Dia and Ruby to fight the third one.But this situation repeats itself often. The calamity doesn\'t seem to have (or at least not clearly) a cause, and it ends up being solved at the end, from one moment to the next, with a song and a convenient legend that is revealed by a narrator in the final chapter.If they wanted to play with mysticism and epicness, they could have had the challenge be in getting to climb above the clouds to sing the song (as they magically did) but no, it was all just confusing and rushed.And equally rushed I felt like it was when all the girls get to sing along with Yohane. And yes, I know. I know this is supposed to be an idol anime- but why on earth would the town baker, the postman, the prime minister, and a zoologist from another city want to sing in a group? It doesn\'t make much sense, but I guess you have to apply the suspension of disbelief that has characterized Love Live these past few years.In conclusion, and returning to the main point.I haven\'t stopped feeling like this anime doesn\'t know what it wants to be.At times it wants to show tension, bringing up the theme of calamity, but timidly resolving everything in the next episodeSometimes it seems like it wants to be a slice of life, but it keeps interrupting itself with uncomfortable situations of Yohane feeling depressed or complaining.Even a more episodic approach like Nijigasaki\'s would have been much more interesting in this anime. Putting groups of 3 together only meant that there were many characters that couldn\'t fully shine in the end.Despite everything, it has its good things. In my opinion, the character design and art style is the most enjoyable of all the Love Live series to date. The animation was also good enough to be notable, and I really liked the more medieval musical arrangements for this anime.However, Genjitsu no Yohane: Sunshine in the Mirror is not a series I can recommend. In its laziness to find a fixed thing to do, it feels like the show is just drifting, and when something important happens, it just feels rushed.Even if you want to see the Aqours girls one more time, you won\'t see them long enough, or they will be completely different characters (like Yohane\'s case)The show is downright boring, and it ended up becoming ironic consumption and, for some reason, towards the end of the series I started laughing at Lailaps\' poker faces.But if you want to watch it because it\'s Love Live, hey, there it is- Just don\'t expect much or anything different. inconsistent, being literally the real world but with more medieval aesthetics (or futuristic in tokyo for some reason) I feared that this is not a too well thought out series.It\'s interesting to see how some characters, like Mari, Hanamaru and Kanan, were treated, drastically improving their performance in the series and slightly changing to a more interesting (or at least different and entertaining) personality.

It feels like 9 or 10 girls put their craziest ideas, mixed them up and took, whatever came out of this mixing process. This show is a mash-up of great fantastic ideas glued together by a story-telling without a störy.But no for more details:1.) Sunshine in the mirror as Love Live showThis show was first announced as april of the ""Love Live"" franchise. Therefore, it is part of this franchise. But this show doesn\'t feel like a Love Live show at all. The mirror-counterparts of...the Aqours members share some traits of the originals and the mirror Numazu reminds partly of the original Numazu as shown in ""Love Live Sunshine"", but that are nearly all similarities.There is no school to save, no song contest, the characters are some kind of adult and there is nearly no singing. You will not like the show, just you like ""Love Live"". You can possibly like ""Sunshine in the mirror"", but for another reasons than its franchise.2.) The crazy settingThe most impressive part of this show is the setting. This is a kaleidoscope of ideas. Sunshine in the mirror excels most fantasy shows by cool and crazy elements. We have magic elements, steampunk elements, modern and postmodern elements.For example: While Dia rides a bike with some trandformation elements ans Ruby (as a fairy) speaking out of screen of this bike, we see You as a postgirl shot out of a cannon and then gliding to her target. We can see Lailaps again, but this time as a speaking wolf-like sister-like partner of Yohane.3.)The storyThere is a Numazu-wide threat of randomly popping up aberrations with dark purple fog, strange lightnings and strange behaving animals (mostly deers) with glowing red eyes, but this doesn\'t prevent this show to focus on completely unrelated things like organising a girls night out or organizing a community festival with the once group singing (at least until episode 11). To be fair, we the other story-driving element of Yohane searching something like a purpose (Something, that only she can do), but this doesn\'t change the impression, that this show doesn\'t look like as it knows, what it wants. Even if there is a story in the backgound, the episodes doesn\'t mostly feel connected by this story.The episodes itself can be fun. But you should have no problem to enjoy purely CGDCT stuf in some episodes and some dark mysterious stuff in some other episodes. If you want a great story, which holds all together, you should probably ignore this show. the Aqours members share some traits of the originals and the mirror Numazu reminds partly of the original Numazu as shown in ""Love Live Sunshine"", but that are nearly all similarities.There is no school to save, no song contest, the characters are some kind of adult and there is nearly no singing.

Aqours is my favorite group out of all the Love Live franchise, and its a real pleasure to see them got animated again after all this time. This anime is what I expected it to be if Love Live become a fantasy magical girl anime. Focusing on the same genre as the main series. Such as friendship, trust, relationship, hardwork. And how can we forget the most important one, songs. They slip the idol genre a little in here. Not as heavy as the main series but I'm glad they keep it.Story is very great,...neatly packed. If the story is some kind of painting, it would be very beautiful to look at. Heartwarming feeling every episode makes the viewer comfy watching it. Don't expect a lot of fighting animation. They do have some action scene, but its not really the focus. The story is slow paced so they give us the time to immerse inside the world they build. It feels like you are there yourself inside the small village of Numazu. I always like countryside without all the busyness of a city. People help each other, people know each other, and that's what this anime portray perfectly. Small fantasy village with a wholesome vibe around it.Every villager personality is very nice. There are no villain, or maybe there is. The villain in this anime isn't clear. They can't see what the villain is, but they can feel it existence. For me tho, I just call it a problem. Because in the end they manage to solve the problem in a very Love Live way. A lot of Love Live reference is here of course. But that doesn't mean this anime is only for Love Live fans. You can enjoy watching as long as you like this kind of thing. I said that because I personally feel this anime is not for everyone. Magical girl thingy, fight with love, not fist.Animation is unbelievably great. Definitely looks disctinctly different from the original Love Live series. Everyone get a slightly different color pallete design and I love it. I always welcome subtle changes like this. Isn't really obvious but I can feel something is different. The bright lighting also a match with the themes this show bring. Sadly there are no serafuku which I dearly love from LLS. There's barely any action scene. When there is one, they did not let it flop, eyes just glued to the screen because how awesome it is. I swear the studio is just flexing their Gundam animation skills.All the main characters VA is a top tier of course. Sometimes I even think about how they all can consistently make their anime counterpart voice after all this time. I have already listen to Aqours music and they can't stop to produce catchy songs. I love the OP, the ED, and insert song inside this anime, never skip them. BGM also enhance the mood of the scenes. Not much on I can comment about because I'm speechless its all perfect.So should you watch this? Well like I said above its not for everyone. Its too girly, yeah I can safely say that. But again, anime like this always reach outside of their target audience. Especially since it have such a big name plus fantasy genre. Little fun fact this anime is originally an April Fools back in 2021. Love Live always give it their all on every April Fools. And this anime is one of them. Everyone wishing it was real and here we are. There's also 2 games plan to be released in the same universe as this anime. Again, these 2 games is a very different genre compared to the usual rhythm games. I think its a good thing that Love Live franchise will grow out of the box with experiment like this.

Thank you for reading my review."", 'Genjitsu no Yohane is a visually appealing spin-off, that boasts some of the best songs in the franchise, but at the same time fails to tell an interesting story and does a huge disservice to the original cast.Being a Love Live fan, the announcement of this spin-off came as a pleasant surprise. An alternative setting with our favorite LL girls, which could be filled with fantasy and adventure. Each girl had her own shtick, with Kanan being an engineer or Mari being a demon queen, and these things had a lot of potential to tell an interesting story.But unfortunately, none of these came to be....The story revolves around a certain mystery that happens in Numazu which makes animals go berserk once in a while, and is therefore limited pretty much only to that place. The idea in itself isn\'t so bad, but it was never executed properly. Half of the episodes in the anime are purely SoL episodes with no relevance to the story, which later on, when the story actually progresses, it fails to actually  be interesting.The characters themselves also lose most of their personality and are reduced to a one-off shtick (as mentioned above), while all previous relationships established in Sunshine! are entirely gone. Kanan/Mari for example, or Chika/You/Riko feel like practically strangers in this show. Everyone focuses just on one single character - Yohane. Every sentence they utter is about her and regarding her. Yohane makes the world there go round.Unfortunately, Yohane\'s character was another disappointment, as she never convinced me why she deserves to be a main character. For most of the anime\'s time, Yohane is spent moping, crying, being depressed or making drama. She can\'t do that, she doesn\'t deserve to do that, etc. are regular motifs in here. Every time, without fail, she\'ll be pushed up and supported by Lailaps, or the other girls from Aqours.Not long after, Yohane becomes a celebrity in town and everyone focuses on her and supporting her, despite the fact that she has never shown us she\'s done anything exceptional. From an outsider\'s perspective, she\'s basically just a random teenager who does random errands for people and likes to sing. She cannot fight, and she cannot support anyone else. Because of that, it\'s bizarre seeing how everyone revolves around her.Meanwhile, Yohane\'s development is a very mixed bag. At the end of the day, she did develop quite a lot, but the process was extremely tiring with one step forward one step back for a long time. Yohane tries to do something, fails or succeeds, then for whatever reason she goes back to moping in her bed. Lailaps comes to cheer her up, they argue a little, and then another chance comes to repeat this process.Luckily for the anime, I think that the songs are definitely the stronger ones in the franchise (coming second after the series of bangers NijiGaku has released), and with the songs themselves and CGI lives being so great, it elevates the show by a lot. The quick succession of songs in the first half of the anime lulls the viewers into a false sense of security, forgetting completely that there\'s a story to be told (that is being skipped).The anime also looks great. The new character designs feel really ""soft"" and nice, and the anime is very colorful and vibrant.Ultimately, Genjitsu no Yohane is an eye candy and a treat with its songs for Love Live fans, but as a standalone anime, it\'s a huge disappointment, failing to have a proper story, and butchering the personalities of the characters we love. The story revolves around a certain mystery that happens in Numazu which makes animals go berserk once in a while, and is therefore limited pretty much only to that place. The idea in itself isn\'t so bad, but it was never executed properly.

Every time, without fail, she\'ll be pushed up and supported by Lailaps, or the other girls from Aqours.Not long after, Yohane becomes a celebrity in town and everyone focuses on her and supporting her, despite the fact that she has never shown us she\'s done anything exceptional. From an outsider\'s perspective, she\'s basically just a random teenager who does random errands for people and likes to sing. She cannot fight, and she cannot support anyone else. Because of that, it\'s bizarre seeing how everyone revolves around her.Meanwhile, Yohane\'s development is a very mixed bag. At the end of the day, she did develop quite a lot, but the process was extremely tiring with one step forward one step back for a long time. Yohane tries to do something, fails or succeeds, then for whatever reason she goes back to moping in her bed. Lailaps comes to cheer her up, they argue a little, and then another chance comes to repeat this process.Luckily for the anime, I think that the songs are definitely the stronger ones in the franchise (coming second after the series of bangers NijiGaku has released), and with the songs themselves and CGI lives being so great, it elevates the show by a lot. The quick succession of songs in the first half of the anime lulls the viewers into a false sense of security, forgetting completely that there\'s a story to be told (that is being skipped).The anime also looks great. The new character designs feel really ""soft"" and nice, and the anime is very colorful and vibrant.Ultimately, Genjitsu no Yohane is an eye candy and a treat with its songs for Love Live fans, but as a standalone anime, it\'s a huge disappointment, failing to have a proper story, and butchering the personalities of the characters we love.', 'Before I even start, I need to get something out of the way here: I am not a Love Live: Sunshine! fan or a fan of any other typical idol shows. I don\'t *dislike* them either, just isn\'t my usual thing.That said, Genjitsu no Yohane caught my interest this season. Ultimately, it really impressed me, and I hope to offer a different perspective on this show as an outsider to the fanbase. I\'ve done a small amount of digging into the parent show (Love Live: Sunshine!) for more context, but I haven\'t watched it as of writing this review. I can\'t promise the most comprehensive...and knowledgeable review, but I hope someone finds my perspective valuable! There will be some mild spoilers (up to around Ep. 8) but I won\'t talk in too much detail about the last few episodes.I did what I\'m sure many non-Love Live fans did, which was see this cool looking fantasy show, go ""Oh neat!"" and then realized it was a Love Live spin off. While many probably decided against watching it for that reason, I decided to give it a shot. Sure, I know nothing about these characters, but who knows? Maybe I\'ll dig it.As fate would have it, GNY was a blast. Namely because I had no idea what the fuck was going on at any given time. Starting from Yohane auditioning and getting rejected again, then going home to her mom fucking DIPPING and leaving Yohane with her talking dog, and then we\'ve got a lady mayor with an Iron Man suit and a Tron motorcycle??? And a SWORD??? Fighting off some weird nameless miasma??? At that point I had no words besides ""I have no idea what\'s happening or why, but fuck it, I\'m down."" It became a very relaxing and mindless show because it was throwing every possible thing into the pot and letting it boil. Idols, slice of life, modern fantasy, mech suits, magic, and genuine bangers (the songs are really fun - I\'ll get to it later).Lots of the reasons for why stuff is happening is left unexplained, but that\'s fine. There\'s no time to discuss WHY three of Yohane\'s friends are vigilante superheroes or why the mayor has a mech suit. Going into it would take away the whimsy of it in my opinion, and it makes many of these moments land really well.Now the pacing - it\'s all over the place. I watched the first episode and then didn\'t watch for about 4 weeks as it didn\'t really pull me in that much. I planned to come back to it though, and I\'m glad I did. It picks up significantly following Episode 3 (I think that\'s when Dia debuts her Super-Suit?) and keeps that pace until around Ep. 7-8. It slows down quite a bit here, but I\'m a slice of life guy and enjoyed the reprieve from the action and what-the-fuck-is-the-robot-frog-doing-here. The girls night was adorable too, and allowed a little time for the girls to build their friendships out a little more (because let\'s be honest, Yohane became friends with everyone without much preamble, considering she hated this town initially). The pace then ramps right back up until the end of the show, and I found myself eager to watch the last 4 episodes as they released. Despite this uneven pacing, I found the show worth coming back to due to how much else it has to offer.Let\'s talk about the songs - they\'re really quite fun. I won\'t get too into it, but I\'m a musician and love casually analyzing/digging songs, especially those I hear in media. Having gotten into a ton of Japanese artists over the past few months, I really appreciate the precision and the craft that goes into these songs. I\'m less familiar with idol groups and how they typically sound, but a lot of these songs are really hip (especially the opening - never skipped it once). I don\'t watch any idol shows currently, but honestly, I would give a main series Love Live show a shot just to compare it to the songs in GNY.I\'m still glad they didn\'t put in *too* many dance numbers and full songs - while they were good, I think anything more would\'ve been distracting. Yohane\'s singing is a key plot device, so overusing it might\'ve made the high points in the last few episodes feel out of place.50% of the reason I stuck with this show though was how *sick* the character designs are. Maybe some would disagree, and I don\'t know how it compares to the parent show, but this show is visually stunning to me. Each girls\' outfit summarizes who they are (in a good way) the moment you see them. Yohane? Definitely wants to be an idol, but definitely isn\'t. Dia? That uniform is sick and she\'s totally The Government. Riko? Out-of-towner and academic. I could go on, but you get the idea: I really enjoy the character designs and think they do a good job of depicting each character\'s role in this show (and in the town).It\'s at this point that I realize I haven\'t talked about Lailaps - while at times Lailaps was a bit much and made some strange decisions (the type that feel made specifically to cause another conflict or drive the plot forward a bit artificially), I can\'t really be mad at the talking dog, ya know? The relationship between Yohane and Lailaps is really sweet too - they clearly care about each other, and it comes across very clearly throughout the show, even when they\'re in conflict.~ ~ ~Overall, I really enjoyed Genjitsu no Yohane. Despite not being a Love-Live Sunshine  fan, the character designs and premise were captivating enough for me to give it a shot, and I got a show that put as many different enjoyable things in the pot as it could - idols, modern fantasy, a bit of action, and some cozy slice of life to top it off. The pacing reflected this, being a bit all over the place, but GNY remained captivating and was a wild and fun ride. I keep hopping between 7 and 8, because while I wouldn\'t put this next to some of my most favorite shows, I have to give GNY credit for hooking me in despite totally not being targeted towards me at all.I would recommend non-Love Live fans give GNY a shot, just to see what you think, and I hope any Love Live: Sunshine! fans can appreciate my perspective as an outsider to the fanbase.

Cheers!', 'Sunshine In The Mirror had so much potential and it somehow managed to reach its potential and not reach its potential at the same time. It is the story of 3 parts. Episodes 1-4, 5-9 and 10-13.Episodes 1-4 are great. The fantasy aspects are implemented really well and you feel just as curious and confused as the characters are when Yohane and friends are discovering more and more about the threat that Numazu is facing. It helps keep you engaged and wanting to watch more. Problems do arise if you think too hard about how technology works in a pioneer style town but it\'s a...really small nitpick that can be overlooked. The slow buildup may seem like a problem on paper but it was executed in a way where it wasn\'t a hindrance on the story. It just helped the viewer ease in to this new environment and get accustomed to how it works instead of rushing things just to get to the action scenes and dance numbers.Episodes 5-9 are disappointing. The fantasy elements disappear and it\'s suddenly a regular Love Live series. There is nothing inherently bad about it and it\'s the same things that long time fans enjoy about this franchise but it doesn\'t fit the world it\'s in or the story that\'s being told at all. You could argue that this time is used to develop the group\'s friendship and bond with each other but A) that doesn\'t make the tone switch any less jarring, B) people that have watched Sunshine have already seen that happen so this process just feels needlessly repetitive and C) it most likely kills the interest for any newcomer that was invested in the fantasy stuff only for it to be tossed aside for a third of the series. It\'s bad for both sides and it ruins what could have been a great series.Episodes 10-13 are a mixed bag. While it\'s great to have the fantasy themes back, the sudden switch back is jarring and comes out of nowhere. It also feels weird because the calamity was supposed to be defeated at the end of episode 8 and there is never an explanation for how it either survived or wasn\'t affected by the song sung during the festival. It is also more powerful for no reason and the audience just has to deal with it. With that being said, there are some good aspects about these episodes. You can feel the tension of the situation once the calamity starts spreading and even though you know everything will be fine in the end, that doesn\'t stop the voice in the back of your head going ""but what if Sunrise has the guts to have actual stakes?"" Even though it ended up being a fake out, Lialaps passed out besides the river at the end of episode 11 and episode 12 being titled ""Goodbye Lialaps"" made me think Lialaps was going to die for the entire week in between episode 11 and 12 and credit is due for fooling me and so many other viewers. The ending was a little goofy but it was enjoyable enough to be a nice conclusion despite the roller coaster of tone this series went through.It feels like Sunrise originally planned to make a movie only to turn it into a series at the last minute, forcing them to add extra plot last minute even though I highly doubt that\'s what happened.Despite the roller coaster of tone, there are three consistently great things about this series: the characters, the music and the animation.Every single returning character has retained their charm from Sunshine and in the case of Yohane, their character improved by leaps and bounds. In Sunshine, Yoshiko was nothing but a repetition of the same joke. It was boring at best and annoying at worst. She had some moments where she could actually be a character but more times then not it went back to Sunrise going ""get it? She\'s believe she\'s a fallen angel"" or ""get it? She gets mad when people call her Yoshiko."" That changed in this series. Those moments in Sunshine where she could be an actual character got properly realised across all 13 episodes and became enjoyable to watch. She still has her bratty side but now it\'s used to be something she grows out of and become a better person. She is actually called Yohane now so that joke can be dead and buried in the ground and be replaced with proper character development. The new member of the cast, Lialaps, is great too. She has a mysterious side to her that gets to be explored as the series goes on. Not only that, but her dynamic with Yohane is great. You can tell that they care about each other (even if Yohane doesn\'t like to admit it at times) and that makes their sibling dynamic more engaging and believable.This series continues what Superstar did and made the environments more beautiful and vibrant than ever and that is shown off amazingly in this series. Even when there is no dialogue, the stellar animation alone can captivate you into any scene and is the one reason to not skip the middle third of the series. The animation during the song/dance numbers are just as good as ever and is the best CGI animation in the medium for a reason.As expected for a Love Live series, the music is the big standout yet again. Even if j-pop isn\'t your thing, it can still be enjoyed on an objective level for the pure spectacle alone when mixed in with the incredible animation. The songs on their own are nothing new but they are great from a production level and are another batch of enjoyable tunes for those that enjoy j-pop. There are even a few standouts like Genjitsu Mysterium that might catch the ears of people that don\'t normally enjoy this type of music.At the end of the day, Sunshine In The Mirror IS a good anime for Love Live fans. It has everything fans of this franchise love along with the new fantasy aspect making things fresh at times. It is an easy recommendation for those people, especially if you love Sunshine. However, it\'s a struggle to recommend it to newcomers. Not only is the ""singing can solve all of our problems"" aspect not for everyone but the middle is a slog if you don\'t enjoy the usual Love Live formula. No amount of great production values can save that.This series has the pieces to be an 8 or even a 9 but the inconsistent tone and themes ruins any chance of the score getting that high. Still, give it a chance and see if you can have fun with it. really small nitpick that can be overlooked.

Sunshine!!, but I am at least familiar with the original Love Live series and the concept of idol shows as a whole. At least from its advertising, Genjitsu no Yohane didn’t seem to require any prior knowledge of said series, so I will be predominantly reviewing it as such.☆ Story: 4/10Genjitsu no Yohane is- definitely interesting. While it had a good premise at the beginning, the show does fall short on fully explaining its lore and narrative as a whole. For the most part, the storyline was either disjointed or rushed, the whole...“calamity” aspect feeling clunky at best and downright confusing at worst.I am providing a little leeway here, given that this is clearly the work of those who have never had to write high fantasy (or likely anything with supernatural twists) before, but it is still important to note that this series isn’t exactly competent in the way it handles its fantastical elements.The Lailaps subplot was essentially the only aspect which felt properly constructed in my opinion, with the twist in episode 12 being the sole reason this ‘story’ section of my review was bumped from a 2/10 to a more tolerable 4/10.☆ Characters: 4/10The problem with having a show like this and being expected to include nine main characters (plus Lailaps, to make ten) is that there simply isn’t enough to time really flesh any of them out in a single cour (~11-13 eps) anime. Yohane is pretty much the only one to see anything even resembling character development, with the others pretty much just shoved in for the sake of retaining the original LLS cast.In short, I believe it boils down to the fact that a school-based idol anime has a greater advantage in terms of having its protagonists interact with each other in a believable manner - After all, they’re all around the same age, and likely in many of the same classes, so getting them to naturally form an idol group together isn’t a huge stretch. Compare this to the fantasy world of GnY, wherein the nine main girls + Lailaps all have separate jobs, subsequently having little (if any) reason to interact with each other aside from “because the plot demands it” or “ because we’re all friends with Yohane”.☆ Music: 8/10This is by far the show’s strongest aspect, with each of the songs and their accompanying music videos being beautifully written, performed, and overall just fun to listen to.☆ Animation: 8/10For the most part, this show’s animation is pretty average, although I am bumping the overall score up due to how fluid and dynamic the music videos were. Additionally, I have to give praise for their decision to do this mostly in 2D, with the LL franchise otherwise seeming to love their (somewhat uncanny, in my opinion) 3D animations even for non-music video scenes.☆ Enjoyment: 6/10Not much to say here, really. I’m sure I would have liked this more had I already been a LLS fan, but as things stand now, I found myself either bored or confused for the majority of my watching.☆ Overall: 6/10Again, I am being generous here in assuming some jokes or references went over my head as a new viewer, but I cannot fully ignore the fact that, at least in a vacuum, Genjitsu no Yohane simply didn’t have enough time to accomplish what it originates set out to do.Perhaps if it had been double or even triple the length, this show could have proved an engaging and unique standalone fantasy+idol series, but as is, I believe the only people who will enjoy this are those who have already seen the original Love Live! Sunshine!! saga. “calamity” aspect feeling clunky at best and downright confusing at worst.I am providing a little leeway here, given that this is clearly the work of those who have never had to write high fantasy (or likely anything with supernatural twists) before, but it is still important to note that this series isn’t exactly competent in the way it handles its fantastical elements.The Lailaps subplot was essentially the only aspect which felt properly constructed in my opinion, with the twist in episode 12 being the sole reason this ‘story’ section of my review was bumped from a 2/10 to a more tolerable 4/10.☆ Characters: 4/10The problem with having a show like this and being expected to include nine main characters (plus Lailaps, to make ten) is that there simply isn’t enough to time really flesh any of them out in a single cour (~11-13 eps) anime.

Sunshine!! saga.', ""I don't want to be harsh on this, cause I'm very happy to have a Love Live Sunshine spinoff at all, but I feel like Sunshine in the Mirror could've been a lot better than it was. Specifically it seems pretty halfhearted in a lot of what people want from something like this. It doesn't get rid of singing and performances, but there's less singing than one would expect from Love Live. It's set in a fantasy world, but with plenty of modern amenities (and some tokusatsu elements?) and it never leaves the single town of Numazu. It has everyone from Aqours, but other than...the eponymous Yohane, Lailaps gets more focus than all of them combined. And as far as I remember from Love Live Sunshine, Lailaps is a completely new character for this, and one I don't find all that likeable. As for the Aqours members themselves, their personalities only vaguely resemble how we know them, if at all. Mari's case is especially egregious, with the loveable, bubbly troublemaker becoming a secluded, depressed demon lord.All that said, while the lack of adventure and relation to Love Live proper I expected is disappointing, I still think Sunshine in the Mirror is a good anime and a good addition to the Love Live series. Visually, it's beautiful, with intricate lighting, beautiful colors, and great attention to detail. All the Aqours girls, despite their differences, are still loveable, especially Yohane. What songs the girls do sing are very good. I would very much appreciate more content like this from studio Sunrise. the eponymous Yohane, Lailaps gets more focus than all of them combined.

They are job doing or searching teenagers or in there world early adulthood stage but you have given the elementary school kids type or personality like should we leave elementary kids to do the jobs.=> CONCLUSION:- its the part where mostly i get strike but still in my opinion its wholly upto you if you want you can watch and if the production wants to fix they can still fix the show and get it on the track it was one of the awaited anime of this season for me and feels bad that it turned out like this. go like how she will find her dream and all the anime till now revolves around playing friend friend and some kind of mystery that affects only kids and animals and there comes a plot twist there are different people playing superhero like wow worst scripting.You have good base of the story, you have good characters so instead of utilising the potential they are wasting it.•Animation:- In this department i have no complaint whatsoever as the animation team have done a great job with the details, colour selection character attributes etc•Music:- 6 out of 10 as it is okay okay but the ED deserves a 9 it was a nice ending song.•Character Design :- I didn't wanted to go with this but seriously.

A weird spin-off of Love Live Sunshine, which is considered to be the best Love Live by the fandom, which is wrong because the best Love Live is Love Live Superstar. The story takes the girls of Love Live Sunshine and plops them in a fantasy setting… sort of.I say “sort of” because I don’t know if it is set in a fantasy setting, considering we’re introduced to the main protagonist Yohane, the alter-ego...of the chunibyou Yoshino from the main Sunshine, as she’s performing for an audition in not fantasy-looking Tokyo. After getting grilled by her mum for being a total failure she's forced to return to her port town home via the fantastical Japanese Bullet Train. There she is greeted by a giant telepathic dog and mocked for being a silly boo-boo head. Here is when actual fantasy things start to happen. It’s pretty jarring and hard to explain anything about this show. If you have no prior knowledge of Love Live Sunshine and its cast of moe blobs, you will probably be confused most of the time.Of course, as a Sunrise production, the art and animation are pretty fantastic. With wonderfully expressive characters and beautiful backdrops, I can see the appeal that would attract Love Live Sunshine fans. My main issue lies in its general premise or lack of commitment to it.From the four episodes I’ve watched Sunshine in the Mirror feels like it’s trying to be a moe blob idol anime combined with a lacklustre fantasy setting with magic and stuff but it doesn’t excel at either. It can't choose which side of those genres it wants to lean into and the result is an inoffensively mediocre story which feels safe yet is hard to follow unless you're a Live Love Funshine connoisseur.Then again those Wuv Wive Wunshine girls are very fun. Yohane is very charming in her silly way and the rest of the crew all have their perks. I don’t know. I have never been so confused about my feelings towards a Long Dive before. Would a say it’s bad? No. Would I say it’s good? That is a tricky question. Your average Dove Five Bumshine fan will enjoy it and has been considering its MAL score, which is great, but for the rest of us, it’s inoffensive. Would I recommend it to someone? Probably not.

It begins with Maya, the girl who is not good at anything... aside from her fascination with all that is movies and dramas. Even her own mother believes her a useless girl. If a tv is on, she won't hear a word you say, if you send her out to deliver Ramen she may come back hours later, she can't remember a single formula for school... but she can recite any play she's watched once by heart. As a habit, she acts out her favorite...dramas in the park to some kids where she is spotted by an mysterious old woman.

However, this little OVA here is easily missable despite it actually being TMS\' first adaptation of the series before they made the aforementioned one in 2005. Personally, it genuinely surprised me because I was expecting a very forgettable experience initially but was proved wrong just a few minutes in the first episode. So, let me make this clear right in the beginning; Whether you watched any of the TV shows or are looking for a way to...try out this series - This will make a perfect watch in any case.As the synopsis already states the OVA covers the earlier events of the series but I\'ll assure you it completely excels at it in most aspects. The very first minutes of the first episode greet you with the heartbreaking past of Tsukikage-sensei only to cheer you up again and pull you right into the story with one of the loveliest openings in any anime I\'ve seen. The song itself starts with a shoegaze-esque intro and complements the gorgeous sceneries and shots of Maya Kitajima as she rides her bike or shots of individual objects like some pair of Chucks lying in an empty practice hall. Each shot is beautifully composed that I couldn\'t help but take screencaps at every opportunity. Storywise there isn\'t anything to write home about as it only covers the very start of the manga but visually it\'s very clear Tsuneo Kobayashi, a name which I also only discovered after watching this, went overboard with his creativity.Now, Glass Mask is a Shoujo series that is relatively rich in drama, which as a sidenote happens to be a common thing among Shoujo series in the 70s. Evoking and creating tension as well as maintaining it throughout in certain scenes is not only crucial but not the easiest thing to do either. Tsuneo Kobayashi however, makes full use of his Cinematography knowledge and achieves crafting said scenes exceptionally well. For instance, when Maya first encounters Tsukikage she first reacts sceptically and finally runs away crying after seeing her scarred face. As suggested before Kobayashi makes heavy use of efficient Cinematography so you\'ll see particularly well-utilized dutch angles and close-up shots very very often, which are of course present in this scene and thankfully in other scenes like this one. The animation quality typical for an OVA only adds to the visual eye candy. This way the tension never fades away and keeps you engaged with the anime throughout its entire runtime. It also results in this adaptation being perhaps the most dramatic one among the series. And it\'s rather unfortunate to see this not even going beyond the first few stage plays of Maya. However, the amount of adapted material or the character development ""lacking"" compared to the TV shows shouldn\'t be a dealbreaker since all of the characters are unique and fleshed out from the get-go. Ayumi is the polar opposite of Maya yet complements her in a way - both ambitioussly strive to become the flawless actress, Masumi takes a liking to Maya quite early on but has to restrict himself to not act stupidly or out of character, Sakurakouji sides with Maya whenever she is being treated unfairly, etc etc and all of that is very well conveyed in this OVA despite its short length.The VAs also quite deliver and voice their characters pretty well. However, the most exciting part is probably hearing Megumi Ogata as the little and fragile but fierce Chibi-chan I mean Maya Kitajima. Her woMANLY voice doesn\'t shine through one bit. On the contrary, it fits Maya surprisingly well - be it scenes of Maya raising her voice out of anger, sobbing like a child or simply leisurely conversing with her classmate.TL;DR unexpectedly well storyboarding and directing nails almost every scene and reinforces the characters\' unique traits and personalities which makes this OVA the most worthwile experience for (the beginning of) the series. VAs fit their roles and don\'t disappoint either. try out this series - This will make a perfect watch in any case.As the synopsis already states the OVA covers the earlier events of the series but I\'ll assure you it completely excels at it in most aspects.

Although on the other side there are many missed scenes that I like in 80\'s.Sometimes I felt like watching moving manga frames and it doesn\'t mean well (some scences look good only on paper, you know).One of the worst thing here is The-Purple-Roses-Man line.

The original version from 1984 is visually very faithful to the manga but these OVA characters look nothing like what they should look likeSound:...1) I didn't find the soundtrack memorable2) perfect english on 3rd episode3) I'm not a fan of recasting unless in scenarios of death, illness or retirement. Having said that, Maya's seiyuu sounds more childish than the OG but it also gave the character a lot more vocal range, which I thought would be a smart choice considering that Maya could use that for the roles she lands throughout the story. Unfortunately these OVAs cover so little of the story that this vocal range never came into play. Ayumi's voice actress also changed but the tone of voice and vibe have remained the same, despite being a noticeable change. Rei's OG voice actress has returned but she voices Tsukikage, which makes her sound so much more warm and lovable than the OG character.

Guilty Crown: Lost Christmas - An Episode of Port Town,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13411/Guilty_Crown__Lost_Christmas_-_An_Episode_of_Port_Town,"['Merry Christmas! or not. It\'s far too early for Christmas but Guilty Crown once again attempts to bring forth a piece of work involving action, science fiction, drama, and super power all at once.But I do have to say, this OVA that consists of only about 15 minutes is worth the watch compared to the entire 22 episodes of the original Guilty Crown. No, I am not guilty here. I am actually serious as this OVA contains a piece of work that despite being roughly 15 minutes just makes me want to stare at my screen and watch it through all the way.Guilty Crown: Lost...Christmas is the special episode included in a DVD with an animated short bundled with the limited edition of the PC game Guilty Crown Lost Christmas. As a special episode, one would expect little to no story. And of course, you\'re right to those who\'ve watched this. It has virtually no story. However, what it does have is the badass Scrooge. That\'s not actually his real name but it\'s what he goes by. Unfortunately, there\'s not much we find out about him. After all, this special episode contains only 15 minutes of animation footage and really can\'t expect much of a character development from that.Speaking of characters, there\'s Scoorge\'s mysterious sidekick, Carol. With silver hair white as the snow of  Christmas, she presents what we see as the fixation of this special episode. Both of them seemed to have escaped some sort of facility that made them as experiments in the beginning. Of course, Scoorage does not allow anyone to push him around and handles his pursers like a boss.We don\'t know who, when, or how he was kept at the facility. We do know that he has the Power of the King and like his previous predecessor in the original GC as he extracts the void from his sidekick that we all take guilty pleasure of seeing.As for the artwork, this special episode feels a bit blend. It\'s nothing special to pay attention to or make out of. It\'s not exactly the best way to promote a piece of work with standard art but who am I kidding, this is Guilty Crown, one of the most controversial series created last year.Like it, hate it, or just deal with it...Guilty Crown: Lost Christmas has a great soundtrack like the original series. Even though brief, it brings back some nostologia from the original GC when the OST song ""Bios"" was played. Admit it (even for those who hates Guilty Crown with a passion)..the soundtrack is epic. For all other reasons beyond the story, characters, or animation, the soundtrack of this special episode is not bad at all in the soundtrack department.Overall, the relationship between Scoorge and Carol seems to better than Shu and Inori. For one thing, Scoorge isn\'t a coward or a weak lead. He makes his decisions from the very beginning. In fact, I\'m guessing that escaping from the facility was also his decision, one that is rightful and thought out void of surprises. Furthermore, Carol seems to be independent. She doesn\'t look like a sex toy and in fact, has more of a fixed personality rather than Inori who shows up every episode nearly a different person from the original series.As for the other characters, they just seem to be there behind the background making their own speeches like another day at the park. Perhaps they\'re there to enjoy Christmas. Perhaps, they\'re there to enjoy the special episode. At any rate, they are there but surely has some roles. Unfortunately in this special episode, it\'s just too short to tell.Well, overall his special episode is somewhat special. The kickass OST is there. It gives the ears guilty pleasures especially at the climax scene. The characters are presented better than its original predecessor. In fact, in less than 15 minutes, the two main characters are more likeable than Shu and Inori of all twenty two episodes combined. Despite short, this OVA was entertaining to watch. There does seems to be many questions that needs answers but it does presents a piece of work that while not Christmas gift present worthy, is still a fun watch.Santa is not here yet but this special episode is. So what are you waiting for? Go watch this special episode now.

This is definitely not a prequel, but more rather a side-story spin-off type. Viewers who haven\'t watched Guilty Crown and for those who have,(I have) will be just as confused.The purpose of a prequel is usually to explain what was unexplained in the sequel or tie up loose ends and such. However this OVA did not accomplish that, the only thing it does is leave the viewers in more confusion. WAIT! let me rephrase that, the ONE thing it DID explain was how Makoto Walkt Segai...( http://myanimelist.net/character/50709/Makoto_Waltz_Segai) got his left eye ****ed up. THAT is the ONLY thing that was explained, and the ONE tiny thread that connects it to Guilty Crown. There is pretty much no correlation between THIS and Guilty Crown. NONE of the events of the ""Lost Christmas"" that happened 10 years prior is Guilty Crown are explained. Shu isn\'t there, Gai (or Triton =_=) isn\'t there AND MANA is NOT there. You could call this OVA contradictory to Guilty Crown because some girl called Carol is masquerading as Mana.When watching your thrown right into a weird atmosphere with characters you don\'t know and have no clue what their names are. The short MAL summary explains more than the anime BY FAR.Mmm to get down more to the tiny details. The art, I felt was actually worse than guilty crown. Sound, yeah jeez they used the same soundtrack with egoist. Story, confusing the most dramatic thing that probably happened for me was the dog dying.

You could call this OVA contradictory to Guilty Crown because some girl called Carol is masquerading as Mana.When watching your thrown right into a weird atmosphere with characters you don\'t know and have no clue what their names are. The short MAL summary explains more than the anime BY FAR.Mmm to get down more to the tiny details. The art, I felt was actually worse than guilty crown. Sound, yeah jeez they used the same soundtrack with egoist. Story, confusing the most dramatic thing that probably happened for me was the dog dying. T_T', 'Here\'s my 30 second review and immediate afterthoughts, limited to the 50 word limit in the ""tags"" box in my anime list. This is NOT a full review.""Too short. Its stoic but caring hero and his bubbly companion make up a likeable cast, and its plot has potential. ""8"" may be overrating it, but the desire for more than just the taste you\'ve been given makes this a possible redeemer for GC\'s disappointment.""Notes on the art, sound, and characters:+ Redjuice\'s art doesn\'t disappoint. The same budget obviously wasn\'t poured into this 11 minute OVA, hence the CGI\'d mechs. Otherwise, the slightly downgraded animation in Lost...Christmas reminds us of one of Guilty Crown\'s best features - jaw dropping visuals.+ A fantastic ending theme, courtesy of the fictional band, Egoist. Beautifully composed piano ballad accompanied by great vocals. Hats off to supercell and Ryo!+ Recurring characters. I\'ve always wondered how our uber-creepy Major Segai started on his plight to insanity.+ A fantastic new cast. We all know that the audience loved to hate the ultra-whiny, indecisive blubberfest Shu. Lost Christmas\'s protagonist ""Scrooge"" is much more no-nonsense, without coming across as overly stoic. More importantly, the female lead ""Carol"" had personality! Sure she and Inori shared the resemblance in that their odd outfits were overly sexualized, but the fact that her role involved more than being eye-candy to be used by the protagonist makes the MCs in Lost Christmas much more likeable.- Too. Damn. Short. However, even if you\'re not a fan of being teased with content that might never be produced, Lost Christmas is worth a look. Hell, even if you didn\'t like Guilty Crown (or became disenchanted with it like I did), I recommend watching this prequel. It definitely lights up the imagination to what Guilty Crown could have or should have been.All in all, a great teaser. It\'s a shame that there\'s no news of a follow-up (considering those cocky producers had promised two seasons before airing). Guilty Crown may have been a huge let down, but I would absolutely love to see more of the visual novel content presented in Lost Christmas animated.

This is maybe one of those anime where you might consider as the best 12 min of ones life and you\'ll be GUILTY if you don\'t watch it. So enough of the GUILTY BS, what we have here is a prequel of the previous anime Guilty Crown, it overrides as to how the Apocalypse Virus came about, in the previous anime there is no mentioned of the ""Chasers,"" what this 12min special specifies is how the experimental...subjects called ""Scrooge""  and ""Carol"" came to be so in a sense the ""Lost Christmas"" thing is a mistitle and it refers more on the main character than to an incident from one of the episodes of ""Guilty Crown.""

A male lead with a spine who has much greater potential of being the anti-hero/hero of guilty crown and a female lead who has emotions while still having the same beautiful characteristics of Inori. "", 'I watched this OVA this past Monday. Since then, I have seen and heard a lot of people have commenting on this tremendously short OVA as being better than the full 22 episode series. To them, I say they are nuts.The story is confusing, but from what I can gather, Scrooge and Carol are running away from wherever it is they came from. In doing so, they are confronted by Segai and Scrooge uses the king\'s power to take the void of both Carol and the Corgie she was holding. That\'s pretty much it. What I did like about this little short was that they...went into a little bit of Segai\'s back-story. He was an interesting character in the main series and to see why he is so infatuated with the void power is intriguing. Overall, after 12 minutes of show time, I left not knowing anything. It was a clip, nothing more. It added nothing to the plot of the series.The art is on par with the series, which means its top-notch. That\'s really all I can say about that. Due to its short length, there really is not much to comment on. The animation is superb. It is what I would expect from the makers of Guilty Crown.Where I get bothered is the characters. I understand the name ""Lost Christmas"" played a part in the characters, but the names Scrooge and Carol are a bit too cute and gimmicky. A lot of people have been comparing Scrooge to Shu, saying that he is the stoic, cold-blooded killer that should have wielded the king\'s power. In 12 minutes, nothing is left to character development. What you see is what you get, but it doesn\'t necessarily mean that\'s what he\'d be like for 22 episodes. The best part of the full-length series was watching Shu develop and learn from his mistakes. I found Shu to be intolerable at the beginning of Guilty Crown, but learned to respect him at the end. In addition, Carol is often discussed as an upgrade over Inori. While I admit Inori was very bland and emotionless she too evolved, but she was also a complete badass. I personally found Carol to be annoying. I also didn\'t see anything Carol did of value besides offering herself to Scrooge. Carol playing the part that Inori did in the series makes no sense, and to think you could\'ve plugged her into Inori\'s role is asinine.Being a fan of Guilty Crown, I enjoyed it, but I by no means loved it.

My only problem with this is that its too short. Overall it was great with amazing art characters and story line ', 'I mean…I don’t know what to really say about this because it’s so short theirs not much too it. It seems like an interesting story I suppose. I liked the way it was presented as a sort of prison break and I actually found it much more compelling than the actual show. Mostly due to the main characters Scrooge and Carol(Get it? ‘Cause Christmas) having a much more interesting backstory and better personalities in a 10 minute short than Shu and Inori had in the whole series. I guess I just don’t know why this was made. I know it was to promote the game...of the same name(which worked effectively because I want to play it now), but it seems like an awful lot of effort went into a game promo. The arts great, the action scenes are cool to look at and the story, as short as it is draws you in. It seems to me that more effort for a good story went into this game than it did for the whole anime and I find it odd. I suppose one should watch it if they liked the original anime with Shu and Co. Or if they want to learn a bit about the game before getting it, but other than that, you won’t be missing out much if you skip it. of the same name(which worked effectively because I want to play it now), but it seems like an awful lot of effort went into a game promo.

I also failed my critique class in arts college awhile back, so that was not good; but I digress.The Lost Christmas is in a sense the precursor to the Guilty Crown series in name more so than story. It takes place in a ""near"" future where humans have begun genetically altering each other, providing pest control, etc. I wonder where else we\'ve seen this? This time around, they essentially borrow...the souls of other compatible humans so they can use their genetic mutations to battle, which at times can seem discomforting both in the execution and, in general, artistic representation does it little to seem less grotesque. It was not explained how the hero found the government base, nor how everyone else fell into place at that spot in time, with an enigmatic onlooker cliche to boot. Story is a 4/10, but the series might be better understood than this - probably my next review.Artistic representation you say? Well, here it is. The animation is okay. I am guessing this is an early sketch of the show, so it would be less polished and spearheaded as the series is, but it still works. The motions seem realistic in terms of how science-fiction it\'s portrayed to be. The action sequences - specifically explosions, smoke, fire, etc. - seem more natural and less hyped than Hollywood would agree to. The crystals are a little much, and shading was a little off, but I see work was put into costume design and well... how cute is Doluudo? Art is a 7/10 for me.Ambience is what defines a setting for a piece of art. Whether it be the cicadas in the afternoon rays, the trail of a projectile, the shattering of crystals, it delivers a crisp and familiar chime to the ear. The voice actors for the most part live up to their intentions, especially Doluudo (sorry, but he is my favorite doggo in anime). In conclusion to it all, the Departures ending track by egoist was phenomenal, and this is coming from someone who is not really a fan of the Alter Ego recording... or is it the same one? I have no clue. If it is, then I guess I will have another listen. Sound is 8/10, and I want villain guy\'s phonograph.Character development is hindered in a 14-minute short. You get introduced to a girl with a dog, walking up to some guy on a bus bench. The dog (Doluudo) takes a liking to bus bench, but girl scolds him for not giving doggy-doo affection (this is not immediately obvious, but he crystalizes everything his hand touches because of genetic misfires). They get chased by a rocket and escape by some fluke; I am not quite sure how though. Some crazy dude walks into a twister of crystals (on purpose) and doesn\'t regret a thing, laughing maniacally at the aftermath of it all. Up until then, the girl and Mr. Genetics Experiment show no sense of familiarity in each other, only to turn a 180 as she takes a pleasure cruise off him plucking her soul away. Then he crystalizes her dog, which she gives no care about whatsoever, the only one of them with enough screen time to make you sympathize with, and he just dies there and then. I never watched the whole series, so I am thinking these two never show up again (at least not looking exactly like that - could be because it was a sketch of the new protagonists), and thus, this is less a story, and more a demonstration/summary of what is to come, using throwaway characters no less. Character is 4/10, but Doluudo wins the Academy Award in my heart. <3I must say, it felt too short for me. I was expecting an hour and a half, but it was only 14 minutes in length, so it was barely enough time to squeeze anything of importance into this. I also seemed to be too focused on analysis to actually sit back on my piano stool and watch as an anime fan. I feel like I would understand this less if I had not seen the first few episodes of Guilty Crown beforehand, which was in part because of my love of the Psycho-Pass series and the works of Ryo and Chelly (egoist). Watching it wasn\'t too boring, but if you were looking for substance, you came to the wrong place. Maybe watch it a few times to fully absorb it? I feel it would be a better fit for when your morning routine wraps up early and you can sit down with a bowl of cereal or something, because it is not going to take too much of your time if you were in a rush. Anyway, I feel I should give enjoyment a 5/10, but I would have given it a 7 if Doluudo lived. Haha...Overall, there are better things to watch. I am unsure how closely this fits with the lore in it\'s namesake series, but it seems moderately similar. A precursory summary of this world, but not enough time to delve into it. The world is alive, but the people grow more corrupt, like the monologue tells. Doluudo will live on in my heart, but turquoise-hair and bus bench will fade away in time. I wish I could give this better, but I made my decision. Guilty Crown: Lost Christmas - An Episode of Port Town was a 6/10 for me.P.S.

Hana no Ko Lunlun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2230/Hana_no_Ko_Lunlun,"[""This anime is one of my all time favorites. I have recently downloaded and watched the episodes all over again; and it made me very nostalgic. What young girl wouldn't like the story of a young girl's adventure of searching for magical objects? The story is also good for teaching children the difference between good and evil. I believe this anime will remain a classic. However, there was one point that surprised me. I remember one particular episode in Hana no Ko Run Run, which was about a stage actress always playing the role of a damsel in distress, but Run Run had changed that...actress' destiny and she was able to diversify her roles. I was really disappointed when I couldn't find that particular episode, as it was my most favorite. Other than that the whole series is quite enjoyable. actress' destiny and she was able to diversify her roles. I was really disappointed when I couldn't find that particular episode, as it was my most favorite. Other than that the whole series is quite enjoyable."", 'Another day, another anime that i decided to review after finishing it. And this time, it\'s TOEI Animation\'s old anime that has become a classic both in Japan and in other countries like France and Italy.Hana no Ko Lunlun is an original anime series that aired between 1979 to 1980 by, yours truly, TOEI Animation. The studio that has been famous for many magical girl anime series. Whether it\'s the early days of Maho Shojo like Himitsu no Akko-chan and Mahou Tsukai Sally or the beloved 90s anime Sailor Moon or the ever-so-popular Precure series. This one is yet another example of an iconic Magical...Girl anime series that has become a classic after so many years after it\'s run thanks to many countries that aired and dubbed this anime like France, Italy, Brazil, etc.It was also known for being the first ever Maho Shojo anime to receive an english dub long before DIC Entertainment got to dub Sailor Moon. But unfortunately, only a few episodes were dubbed and never again was made more after that.Unfortunately, nothing has been heard about this anime again until TOEI Animation and Tencent announced that the remake is in production, but as of 2022, nothing has been announced any further than that.It\'s a shame really, because this anime is considered an classic by many 80s kids and fans of the show for years now. But the question remains, is it as good as many people make it out to be? That where i\'ll have to find out:Now before i start reviewing the anime, i\'d like to inform you that i watched the anime with brazilian portuguese fansubs by Mastercorpfansubs, which has completed the entire anime in portuguese sub. so i went with that instead of finding the japanese RAW or the english subs. While the brazilian portuguese fansub isn\'t perfect, it\'s decent enough to understand the entire anime\'s story and characters as a whole.Anyway, with that said, let\'s get into the story:The story starts with two talking creatures by the name of Cateau and Nouveau, who are looking around the village for a girl who would accept the offer to go on a journey with them to find the flower of seven colors. In France, they found a girl by the name of ""Lunlun Flower"", an orphan girl who lives with her paternal grandparents at a flower shop. In there, they went ahead and explain everything that she needs to know before going on a journey. While Lunlun and her grandparents are surprised to see two animals talking like humans, they didn\'t mind it too much and took a listen to what they had to say. Anyway, Cateau and Nouveau explained that they wanted Lunlun to help them find the flower of seven colors and give it to her as an award for finding it. So, on Lunlun\'s 15th birthday, she decided to go with them and start their journey to find the flower of seven colors, where they encounter many people through out their journey. Whether to be begged for help or as an obstacle that keeps them away from getting it. And of course there are two evil people who will become Lunlun\'s one of those obstacles to her journey. And that is Togenishia and Yaboki. Who rather they try to stop her from getting the flower of seven colors, they want to follow her and keep her finding it. And once she finds it, they will do anything they can to capture it just so Togenishia would become the queen. Which of course they fail at making attempts either due to Yaboki\'s imcompetence or people like Serge (Lunlun\'s crush) or any other people preventing them from making such attempts. Also, just in case Lunlun stays protected, she\'s given the magical pin that can allow Lunlun to transfer the flowers\' powers into her pin and give her each transformation to get past through many obstacles. So yeah, it\'s an long story of nothing but adventures, hardships, tribulations and battle to find this one flower of seven colors.The show is very episodic. Each episode, Lunlun and friends is met with many people who always either need help or they are there to get into trouble and it\'s up to Lunlun and her friends to try to resolve the problems they have. Some that have to do with the loss of their parents, others that has to do with finding a long lost friend/family member, one that was about stopping people from destroying a place they loved as kids, one that was about a teenager wanting to go on a journey to go back home to live on his own and so much more. Almost each and every story is very heartbreaking, yet wholesome to see Lunlun helping them out when needed. But of course they have to be cautious with Yaboki and Togenishia\'s antics that will ruin their goals and dreams. But each time they start an antic, Lunlun or another person in the episode finds a way to resolve the problems with no issues or stop both Togenishia and Yaboki from causing anymore troubles. And at the end of the episode, Serge comes in to give the person in each episode the seeds for the flowers as a thanks for helping out and understand Lunlun better. Each episode also ends with how the name of the flowers mean. Whether it\'s about love, care, effort, sadness, betrayal, happiness, etc.Now that we got how the story and the format of the episode works, let\'s give a look at some the characters.First we have Lunlun Flower, who is the main character of the show. While she can be a pretty tomboyish and outspoken girl who loves to have fun, she can be a nice person and does anything she can to help those in need. But she also can get pretty frustrated and even sad when a person that she\'s helping does something that she does not like. Whether they are lying to her about their past or trying to cause her more trouble than giving her a hand. Then you have Lunlun\'s friends, Cateau and Nouveau. both Cateau and Nouveau serves as Lunlun\'s friends to help out to find the flower of seven colors and of course as the body guards to prevent her from something terrible happening to her. They also make sure that they can sense any danger that comes around them just in case Togenishia or Yaboki don\'t get in their way. Speaking of Togenishia and Yaboki, they are the main villains of this anime. With Togenishia being the selfish and whiny girl who only cares about getting the flower of seven colors just to become the queen, while Yaboki serves as her servant who always plans and makes desperate attempts to get to ruin people\'s lives, but not once has ever worked. Their only goal is to follow Lunlun in every step she\'s in to find the flower of seven colors just so once she finds it, they would capture it and get Togenishia to become the queen. And then there\'s Serge Flowa. Who usually comes at the end of the episode to give flower seeds to the people that helped and did everything for Lunlun to find the flower of seven colors as a thanks. He also at times comes in to rescure Lunlun whenever she\'s in a serious danger, as well. He\'s also the guy that Lunlun whose she has a crush on. Each episode introduces an character that would either be troubled with issues or they are there the cause troubles. Whether they are childrens, teenagers or adults. Not gonna spoil the whole anime just to ruin the characters\' arc. But i will say that my personal favorite character arc so far is the one with Darif going to africa to visit his hometown and live there forever. It\'s a very serious but a nice arc to see how much he wants to go there to see his hometown.Now what about the animation? Well, it did aged well to a certain degree. Sometimes it\'s colorful, other times it\'s depressing, but for the most part, it\'s very beautifully crafted to the point that i\'m amazed with how much detail they put to the background animation just as much as the character designs thanks to Shingo Araki\'s design on the characters, even for 1979 standards. Sure there are moments where the animation can look a bit weird at times, but hey, it\'s an old anime, we can\'t expect too much from the 70s to have the same high standards as today\'s animes. Just accept that it\'s an product of it\'s time. And a good one at that.And now for the audio. I think the audio is nice, too. It\'s much clearer to listen to the characters\' voices even with a few bits that could\'ve been better. The music can also be said the same. I loved the opening theme song sang by none other than Mitsuko Horie. Who was famous for the Voltes V theme song, Candy Candy, 80s Himitsu no Akko-chan, Sailor Moon and the ending theme song of the first Jewelpet anime. Same thing with the background music. It\'s relaxing, it\'s calming and it\'s very well orchestrated in each and every parts of the scenes.And as far as the voice acting goes, it\'s definitely nice to listen, too. Probably better in Japanese than listening in any different language. Mari Okamoto did a great job as Lunlun. Giving an really adorable and lovely voice while she was 24-5 years old at the time. She\'s the voice of Ai Kaminari from Yatterman and Professor Lukic from Little Witch Academia. You also have Fuyumi Shiraishi as Cateau, who is known for voicing Mirai Yashima from Mobile Suit Gundam series and Bokko from Wonder 3. Then there\'s Takuzo Kamiyama who did the voice of Nouveau. Not much is known about him in anime other than being the voices of Shalulu from Laputa: Castle in the Sky and the second voice of Dayon from Osomatsu-kun in 1988. Sanji Hase as Yaboki, is also the voice of Suneo\'s father in the lost 1973 Doraemon anime and Chang ""006"" Changku from the 1979 Cyborg 009 anime series. Interesting about Michie Kita is that not only she was the voice of Togenishia in this anime, but also the narrator of this anime as well. So good on her, too. Unfortunately she hasn\'t had much roles in a long time. The last time she ever had a role was as Hana from Natsume Yuujinchou. But she was the voice of Nello Daas from The Dog of Flandres by Nippon Animation. So there\'s that going with. And then there\'s Yuu Mizushima as the voice of Serge Flowa. Who was quite a popular choice for a seiyuu to voice in as he was the voice of other characters in other animes. Like Toshio Ootomo in Creamy Mami, Luigi in the Super Mario anime OVAs and 1986 anime movie, Takeru Myojin from Rokushin Gattai Godmars, Ryo Asuka from the Devilman 80s OVAs, Clow Reed from Tsubasa Chronicles and oddly enough, Chang Changku in Cyborg 009 VS Devilman. Strange, huh? We have to same actors who would voice both the same character in Cyborg 009 at some point in time, right? Anyway, i could go on name many voice actors that i\'ve heard in this anime, but  i\'m not going that far for that. The point is, everyone did a great job at giving and lending their voices to the characters they voice in and all of them did a wonderful job.So. What do i have to conclude here? Well, it\'s a great anime! I loved everything about how it focus on flowers as the core theme of the show and how the story goes. The production of the anime is pretty good for it\'s time, even if it aged differently. Personally, it\'s definitely an very underrated show. One of the most underrated and unique Maho Shojo shows that i\'ve seen in a while. A breath of fresh air after watching that atrocity that was Tokyo Mew Mew New and that disappointing Delicious Party Precure.I would love to recommend people to check out the anime if you\'re a fan of retro anime or retro Maho Shojo anime, but the problem is that only a few japanese raw episodes has been subbed into english and the rest is all in french. So i think it\'s best to learn japanese and go for the RAW version just to experience this cultural classic that is Hana no Ko Lunlun.Fortunately, like i said, i saw this anime in brazilian portuguese fansub, so i\'m glad that i got to see what was i missing all this time. It\'s something that i\'ve never seen before. The only retro Maho Shojo anime that i was more familiar with was Creamy Mami and Sailor Moon.But whatever the case may be, no matter what country you\'re from, please watch Hana no Ko Lunlun. It\'s one of the most beautiful and gorgeous anime that you\'ll ever see in your life no matter how old it is.As for my rating, i decided to give this anime an 9 out of 10. It\'s not exactly always perfect, but it\'s nearly close to being one.Anyway, that\'s my review of Hana no Ko Lunlun. My name is José Diogo. And i\'ll see you guys next time! ;) Girl anime series that has become a classic after so many years after it\'s run thanks to many countries that aired and dubbed this anime like France, Italy, Brazil, etc.It was also known for being the first ever Maho Shojo anime to receive an english dub long before DIC Entertainment got to dub Sailor Moon. But unfortunately, only a few episodes were dubbed and never again was made more after that.Unfortunately, nothing has been heard about this anime again until TOEI Animation and Tencent announced that the remake is in production, but as of 2022, nothing has been announced any further than that.It\'s a shame really, because this anime is considered an classic by many 80s kids and fans of the show for years now. But the question remains, is it as good as many people make it out to be? That where i\'ll have to find out:Now before i start reviewing the anime, i\'d like to inform you that i watched the anime with brazilian portuguese fansubs by Mastercorpfansubs, which has completed the entire anime in portuguese sub. so i went with that instead of finding the japanese RAW or the english subs. While the brazilian portuguese fansub isn\'t perfect, it\'s decent enough to understand the entire anime\'s story and characters as a whole.Anyway, with that said, let\'s get into the story:The story starts with two talking creatures by the name of Cateau and Nouveau, who are looking around the village for a girl who would accept the offer to go on a journey with them to find the flower of seven colors. In France, they found a girl by the name of ""Lunlun Flower"", an orphan girl who lives with her paternal grandparents at a flower shop. In there, they went ahead and explain everything that she needs to know before going on a journey. While Lunlun and her grandparents are surprised to see two animals talking like humans, they didn\'t mind it too much and took a listen to what they had to say. Anyway, Cateau and Nouveau explained that they wanted Lunlun to help them find the flower of seven colors and give it to her as an award for finding it. So, on Lunlun\'s 15th birthday, she decided to go with them and start their journey to find the flower of seven colors, where they encounter many people through out their journey. Whether to be begged for help or as an obstacle that keeps them away from getting it. And of course there are two evil people who will become Lunlun\'s one of those obstacles to her journey. And that is Togenishia and Yaboki. Who rather they try to stop her from getting the flower of seven colors, they want to follow her and keep her finding it. And once she finds it, they will do anything they can to capture it just so Togenishia would become the queen. Which of course they fail at making attempts either due to Yaboki\'s imcompetence or people like Serge (Lunlun\'s crush) or any other people preventing them from making such attempts. Also, just in case Lunlun stays protected, she\'s given the magical pin that can allow Lunlun to transfer the flowers\' powers into her pin and give her each transformation to get past through many obstacles. So yeah, it\'s an long story of nothing but adventures, hardships, tribulations and battle to find this one flower of seven colors.The show is very episodic. Each episode, Lunlun and friends is met with many people who always either need help or they are there to get into trouble and it\'s up to Lunlun and her friends to try to resolve the problems they have. Some that have to do with the loss of their parents, others that has to do with finding a long lost friend/family member, one that was about stopping people from destroying a place they loved as kids, one that was about a teenager wanting to go on a journey to go back home to live on his own and so much more. Almost each and every story is very heartbreaking, yet wholesome to see Lunlun helping them out when needed. But of course they have to be cautious with Yaboki and Togenishia\'s antics that will ruin their goals and dreams. But each time they start an antic, Lunlun or another person in the episode finds a way to resolve the problems with no issues or stop both Togenishia and Yaboki from causing anymore troubles. And at the end of the episode, Serge comes in to give the person in each episode the seeds for the flowers as a thanks for helping out and understand Lunlun better. Each episode also ends with how the name of the flowers mean. Whether it\'s about love, care, effort, sadness, betrayal, happiness, etc.Now that we got how the story and the format of the episode works, let\'s give a look at some the characters.First we have Lunlun Flower, who is the main character of the show. While she can be a pretty tomboyish and outspoken girl who loves to have fun, she can be a nice person and does anything she can to help those in need. But she also can get pretty frustrated and even sad when a person that she\'s helping does something that she does not like. Whether they are lying to her about their past or trying to cause her more trouble than giving her a hand. Then you have Lunlun\'s friends, Cateau and Nouveau. both Cateau and Nouveau serves as Lunlun\'s friends to help out to find the flower of seven colors and of course as the body guards to prevent her from something terrible happening to her. They also make sure that they can sense any danger that comes around them just in case Togenishia or Yaboki don\'t get in their way. Speaking of Togenishia and Yaboki, they are the main villains of this anime. With Togenishia being the selfish and whiny girl who only cares about getting the flower of seven colors just to become the queen, while Yaboki serves as her servant who always plans and makes desperate attempts to get to ruin people\'s lives, but not once has ever worked. Their only goal is to follow Lunlun in every step she\'s in to find the flower of seven colors just so once she finds it, they would capture it and get Togenishia to become the queen. And then there\'s Serge Flowa. Who usually comes at the end of the episode to give flower seeds to the people that helped and did everything for Lunlun to find the flower of seven colors as a thanks. He also at times comes in to rescure Lunlun whenever she\'s in a serious danger, as well. He\'s also the guy that Lunlun whose she has a crush on. Each episode introduces an character that would either be troubled with issues or they are there the cause troubles. Whether they are childrens, teenagers or adults. Not gonna spoil the whole anime just to ruin the characters\' arc. But i will say that my personal favorite character arc so far is the one with Darif going to africa to visit his hometown and live there forever. It\'s a very serious but a nice arc to see how much he wants to go there to see his hometown.Now what about the animation? Well, it did aged well to a certain degree. Sometimes it\'s colorful, other times it\'s depressing, but for the most part, it\'s very beautifully crafted to the point that i\'m amazed with how much detail they put to the background animation just as much as the character designs thanks to Shingo Araki\'s design on the characters, even for 1979 standards. Sure there are moments where the animation can look a bit weird at times, but hey, it\'s an old anime, we can\'t expect too much from the 70s to have the same high standards as today\'s animes. Just accept that it\'s an product of it\'s time. And a good one at that.And now for the audio. I think the audio is nice, too. It\'s much clearer to listen to the characters\' voices even with a few bits that could\'ve been better. The music can also be said the same. I loved the opening theme song sang by none other than Mitsuko Horie.

Hi no Tori: Uchuu-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2998/Hi_no_Tori__Uchuu-hen,"[""From the mind of Osamu Tezuka (of Astroboy fame), the story is about four space explorers who drift in space after an accident wrecks their ship. They then spend their time trying to figure out what happened to their mysterious 5th crewmate.It's 48 minutes of the most baffling decisions I've ever seen an anime make. For that reason alone, it's worth watching. As a serious product, it's dreadful. Its redeeming qualities are few, and mainly only centered around the great visuals. As an unintentional comedy, however, it's a perfect 10.As soon as I saw that one guy's nose, I knew the cheese factor was going...to be off the charts with this one. So if you love cheese and jank as much as I do, I think it's worth investing 5 minutes to see if this one is for you. to be off the charts with this one.

Hinata no Aoshigure,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20673/Hinata_no_Aoshigure,"[""Hinata no Aoshigure is a wonderful little short film from the director of the award winning Fumiko no Kokuhaku that is worth your time.StoryThe short has us following Hinata as he literally fumbles with his feelings for his classmate, Shigure who is fond of birds. Hinata uses his experiences in real life to fuel his imagination, turning mundane tasks and places into locations and scenes of wonder and childlike excitement. A great example of this is the school pet bird's cage turning into a large greenhouse bird sanctuary in his mind. The surface story of loving someone and having trouble directly revealing this to the...person in question is nothing new, Hinata's imagination however turns such a dull topic into something fantastical, making it more pleasant to follow.ArtThis is where the short really shines. Studio Colorido follows up on the Hinata's visions of the story unfolding with bright crayon-like colors and an art-style to match. The images evoked during the imagination scenes are simply beautiful and the most memorable part of the short for sure. The uses of CG, while obvious, did not feel out of place and managed to blend in enough without becoming too distracting. When the story hits its more somber points, Studio Colorido was not afraid to darken things to set the tone, and the contrast of these scenes compared to the blissful ones does its job well. The art is what makes this short truly worth a watch.SoundThe soundtrack does an excellent job of setting the mood and really helps raise up the last segment of the film. While it is nothing I would think about revisiting again without context of the scenes to back it up, it is playful and uplifting and definitely had me reacting to it.CharacterWith so few lines, they manage to characterize Hinata very well throughout the film. This clumsy dork is hard not to like, and the use of facial expressions honestly trumps any dialogue spoken in the film. Shigure talks more than Hinata and yet it felt like she lacked more substance than Hinata. I didn't grow to care for her nearly as much as I did Hinata, and her ending lines really fell flat on evoking emotion.EnjoymentOverall I enjoyed Hinata no Aoshigure, and am I glad I was recommended to watch it. It hit all the right notes when it comes to music and art to make a fantastic viewing experience. While the story wasn't very inspired, audio and visuals are such a key component to animation, I can't really complain if it didn't detract from my enjoyment much.With such a short running time, I would suggest giving it a shot, especially if you enjoyed the director's previous work. I look forward to his future endeavors within the industry. person in question is nothing new, Hinata's imagination however turns such a dull topic into something fantastical, making it more pleasant to follow.ArtThis is where the short really shines.

I look forward to his future endeavors within the industry."", 'I had never even expected to watch this, but I sure am glad that I did. I remember watching a short trailer for this a number of years ago but ended up forgetting about it until just yesterday. This little gem is from Hiroyasu Ishida, the same creator of ""Fumiko no Kokuhaku,"" and given his impressive list of works ""Hinata no Aoshigure"" is sure to live up to the fantastical, magical worlds he transports viewers to.The story is quite simple. Our young protagonist Hinata is an elementary school student with quite the overactive imagination, is very skilled in drawing, and is incredibly socially awkward....He befriends his classmate Shigure, and they slowly open up to each other in their fondness for birds. But of course, Shigure has to move away soon due to her father\'s work, and our bumbling hero Hinata goes on an epic quest to the train station to tell her how he feels before she leaves.Pretty standard romantic fare right? It would be, if it wasn\'t for the vibrant world ""Hinata no Aoshigure"" shows off. Playing on Hinata\'s vivid imagination and skill in drawing, the movie constantly switches from boring everyday life to the same scene re-imagined in Hinata\'s wondrous painted worlds. Hinata enjoys placing himself in fantastical situations with Shigure, such as turning their short exchanges into adventures in a wildlife sanctuary for birds. The most incredible imagery comes from Hinata\'s attempts to chase after the taxi Shigure is in, his bicycle turned into a flying bird and the taxi chase replaced with him soaring through the skies.One of the biggest highlights of this movie is the gorgeous visuals. The whole movie looks like it came straight out of a children\'s picture book. Lines are very crisp and there\'s a watercolor-like quality to the animation and colors used. Speaking of which, the use of color in this movie is stunning. Color contrast is bold and noticeable, bright greens when Hinata is happy to deep shades of blue when the crushing realization that Shigure would be moving away is just one of the many examples found. The taxi chase scene is particularly noteworthy, and all sorts of color just seem to burst from Hinata\'s imagination.The overall movie gave me a very Disney or Pixar sort of feel. It\'s hard to describe, but this movie could easily have been one of those short animation projects shown before the main feature, something to wet your appetite beforehand. Oddly enough, this movie also reminded me a lot of ""5 Centimeters per Second,"" anime\'s quintessential romance movie. Both share in the protagonists\'s earnest journey to confess their feelings, and both movies have made me afraid of trains. They even share a similar message right at the train station, but while the future in ""5 Centimeters per Second"" was a lot less cheery, I\'d like to think Hinata and Shigure would meet again happily in the future.""Hinata no Aoshigure"" is whimsical, clever and definitely packs into it a lot of love. It\'s a magical, colorful journey and it\'s easy to see a lot of care went into crafting this story. Clocking in at a little under 18 minutes, it\'s definitely worth a try. I feel like watching this made me feel just like an earnest little kid again, and that\'s a feeling that many full length series can\'t capture as well as this charming gem of a movie.And with that, it\'s time to leave. Trains don\'t wait for every little thing. The train doors are closing, and I bid you ""Good luck!""

The train doors are closing, and I bid you ""Good luck!""', '""What happened."" ~ Me at the end this short film.I walked into this with high hopes and with the first act of the movie shaping up to be something amazing that soared even higher. Once the final arc of the short film kicked in I was speechless. I literally had no words to describe what was occurring on my screen. Well let me save this for the ""enjoyment"" section.IT\'S SHOWTIME[PART 1: STORY]We, the viewers, follow Hinata, I think, as he tries to confess his love to his crush, Shigure. It\'s simple but it works. I kind of was confused why the movie was switching...from a grounded style to a metaphorical style like it was something to be proud of. I think it removes the realism the first half of the short film tries to portray. The ending is such a missed opportunity that if given this project I would have done things different from the half way point onwards. If you found this emotionally impacting I am happy that you did, but I for one could not find it this way.SIDE NOTE: The very end makes it seem like their encounter was sort in his head which would make the second half lose all of its problems, but sadly they never directly tell the viewer if this is true or not. If I am wrong about this then this short film would easily be a solid 7 or an 8.[PART 2: ART & ANIMATION]This is easily the strongest part about the whole experience. Unlike the story that is being told the animation and the music stay consistently good for the most part. This short has a Ghibli/Disney feel, just like what most of what Studio Colorido has done in the past. The art and animation are extremely fluid and expressive for the duration of the film. You could say that it was as fluid as riding a canoe down the Colorado River and when you were riding this canoe a tree branch known as the plot knocks you off making you drown. Sure the water known as the presentation was a joy to the eye, but the story it was telling was no where near the quality of the water. One thing of note is that the CG Train didn\'t look bad and I must thank the people at ColorDorito for a pretty train instead of a poop one you would usually get in modern day animation.[PART 3: CHARACTERS]We have a main male character who is very easy to relate with and get behind. We have his crush, Shigure, whose past is shrouded in mystery. This movie is short and skims over their relationship because of the duration of the experience. I guess they were good for what we got.I shall end this by saying that this was easily one of the biggest disappointments I\'ve had the displeasure of viewing in a long while. The movie may look good but the story was so detached from any reality that I thought the main character was going to told to pick a pill at the end of the movie. The one I would have picked was to change the ending of this movie. I detest this for squandering its potential and making it something worthy of my hatred after such a strong start. I wouldn\'t give this movie a recommendation unless you wanted to watch a spectacle in which I could point you to other movies and series that do this much better. For other things to watch besides this that are of the same vain, 5 Centimeters per Second; a love story that acts more closely to the first half of this than the second half, and The Wind Rises, a Ghibli film in which it kind of feels parts of this were cut and pasted from this movie because of how breathtaking some of the shots are.TL;DR A wasted idea with good production to back it up. Pass and go watch something better. from a grounded style to a metaphorical style like it was something to be proud of.

For other things to watch besides this that are of the same vain, 5 Centimeters per Second; a love story that acts more closely to the first half of this than the second half, and The Wind Rises, a Ghibli film in which it kind of feels parts of this were cut and pasted from this movie because of how breathtaking some of the shots are.TL;DR A wasted idea with good production to back it up. Pass and go watch something better.', ""Let's talk about growing up... Well, everybody has that impossible kind of love.Althougt is a short history, can make you nostalgic about your childhood or, at least, take you to another place, were your heart can be open and the love can go in.18 minutes, or less, can make some silly hearts cry, and wish that the destiny conspire against all lovers and childs!The art is really pure e captivating, full of birds (whitch represents freedom) and  rain (witch represents the bad days), in the ending, all the methapors will make sense...I recommend!

And yet, there is so much Hinata no Aoshigure portrays in those 18 minutes.The story is pretty straight - boy loves girl and chases after her. It's nothing special, but taking into account the short amount of time I was flabbergasted by how it was presented and it really distinguished itself from most daily life/harem anime - a 7.Art is impeccable - the style is similar to that of Ghibli but with the colour contrasts of the great Makoto Shinkai.

I found this anime by a gif and I decided to check it out, and boy that was a good decision. This anime is really short, only 17 minutes long, so you can watch it on your free time. This was an enjoyable anime for just being 17 min long.[ART & ANIMATION]The art is really simple but at the same time it looks cute. I think the art design fits perfect with the story, giving a child look to a child story that puts it perfect. Also, the...colors of the background help to transmit the feeling that at the moment the anime wanted to transmit, for example when the part was sad the background had dark colors, and with happy moments the background had lighter colors. The animation was pretty smooth and I enjoy it. It doesn't seem to have lag or look weird at any time. 9/10[SOUND]I really like the acting of the voice actors, they could interpret their characters and emotions pretty well. The music was pretty good, I really like it and it fit with the climax of the story. 7/10[STORY]The story is really simple, but in a cute way. It made me mad about the ending, but i think is a good fit with the emotions the anime tries to give to the audience. Also, the anime had a lot of clichés at the beginning, I really didn't understand why and personally I would prefer not to have them. I like the different meanings that the anime has with the birds and the train and overall, I think it was cute for a short anime. 8/10[CONCLUSION]The anime was pretty cute and it was pretty interesting. It told the story very well for the little time they had. Personally, my favorite thing about this short was the art, which was pretty wonderful. The story is a cute childish story which is pretty nice to see from time to time.

Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi: Kokoro Utsuri no Toukoubi - School Attendance Day,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10934/Itsuka_Tenma_no_Kuro_Usagi__Kokoro_Utsuri_no_Toukoubi_-_School_Attendance_Day,"['Ok, so I\'ve just finish watching this OVA of the original anime ""Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi"" and I must say that it is really funny, as usual the genre of its original anime doesn\'t apply anymore, the only genre that were maintained for this OVA are school, magic and a little bit of romance. The comedy is the main genre of this anime since it is all about Mirai\'s misadventures and the chaos she has sowed via soul transfer co\'z she has mistaken the bottle filled with green stuff which she has  for something good to drink. So for the story I\'ll give...it a ""Good"" number 7, the art, since it is still the same as the ones used from the original anime a ""Mediocre"" number 5 will do- as usual on my part, the sound, hummmmmm, since there is a new ending theme played I\'ll give it a ""Good"" number 7.Characters: Mediocre 5.Since, The characters are still the same with the addition of the 2 guys from the previous original anime  who are now students in the same school where Taito and Himea are attending and also under supervision of Gekkou.Enjoyment and Overall: Good 7.What can I say, it is all good, not bad for a 1 off OVA.  I also like the bit part where Ferris and Ryner from ""Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu"" had a cameo role where the faced Gekkou\'s evil twin, it\'s kinda lame, then again, it still adds to the comedy aspect of this OVA it a ""Good"" number 7, the art, since it is still the same as the ones used from the original anime a ""Mediocre"" number 5 will do- as usual on my part, the sound, hummmmmm, since there is a new ending theme played I\'ll give it a ""Good"" number 7.Characters: Mediocre 5.Since, The characters are still the same with the addition of the 2 guys from the previous original anime  who are now students in the same school where Taito and Himea are attending and also under supervision of Gekkou.Enjoyment and Overall: Good 7.What can I say, it is all good, not bad for a 1 off OVA.

Some good examples would be Toriko and One Piece or Gintama and Sket Dance crossovers, witch were both in my honest opinion very good and gave both starring shows enough room to distinguish themselves. However the Itsu-Ten and DenYuuDen crossover seems a bit, well, lacking in comparison to the previous shows. How ? Let´s see here:Story: 7Well the story of...a one episode OVA isn´t really what most people come looking for, but never the less, it is there, or at least in a way. Most of the OVA concentrates on a familiar concept of body-switching, which ultimately leads to some comedy moments, however the setting of it all is focused purely on the Itsu-Ten world which is kinda disappointing, considering this is (or at least should have been) a crossover between two different anime. And despite the cheap laughs the fans of the first show will definitely get, the same can´t be said about the DenYuuDen part of the crossover (though I guess you´ll get cheap laughs too), since the DenYuuDen part takes up pretty much the last 5 minutes of the whole OVA, which might bring some people (me included) to question, why did they even bother making a crossover when one show gets a whole episode and the other is just filling up time till the credit-roll. Personally I´d ditch the crossover and make 2 separate OVAs for both series which would probably please way more people than what the authors did here, but hey, not my call.Art,Sound,Characters: 8-9Yeah, not going to get deep into any of this, why ? Well, pretty much because both shows kept their respected features and thus criticizing something here won´t really make a point now would it ? (If you want detailed descriptions, go read reviews on the actual shows themselves ;) )Enjoyment: 7Pretty good really. The OVA itself was funny despite the fact that the nature of body switching plots is kinda over used already. However it was portrayed well in the Itsu-Ten part so, pass. As for the DenYuuDen, well, as a fan of DYD I´m disappointed they got only such short screen time but at least they made it worth it and made the OVA go out in a bang, kinda :DOverall: 7Comparing this crossover to those that came before it would be really cruel to it´s final grade since I think it lacked a bit (or a lot) on the whole “crossover” concept. One could easily see the DYD part as one of those short, leftover-time-consuming, mini shows that the old anime used to have at their end, which is not bad, but if you plan to watch it for the DYD part, you´ll just enjoy the last 5 minutes, while those who watch it for Itsu-Ten get the rest. But if you don´t care either way or you like both shows, it´s a win/win.(P.S. NOTE: I know this is considered (and called) a Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi OVA thus the show should logically get priority in screentime BUT they branded this as a crossover thus I treated it that way in the review ;) ) a one episode OVA isn´t really what most people come looking for, but never the less, it is there, or at least in a way.

Story is interesting enough (how everything happened, relationships between characters, etc.)2. Worldbuilding is interesting enough3. Power levels and power scaling is interesting enough...My overall impression and other:1. Anime feels like it is going 2x speed of regular 5-8min episode anime.2. I re-watched whole show in 4K/AI version before writing this, so animation is kinda better then on most places.3. Translation you find on most places is machine translated and for most part it does good job, there is mistakehere and there, mostly confusing part is translation of cultivation realms.4. This anime is mostly for people who watched all ""pretty good stuff"" like BTTH, SS, etc. and now they need something new to watch, but at same time because there is no more ""pretty good stuff"", you watch this type of average anime.

Amatsuki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3359/Amatsuki,"[""I'll start by telling you that the manga this thirteen-episode series is based on, has been running for over three years now. From this alone, you can deduce that it's too short, and doesn't end properly. That's very true, and these thirteen episodes seem like an introduction arc to something much more grand. But despite being too short, it showed so much potential that I'm gonna read the manga. And hope for a second season.Read the sumamry, and you'll have the basic premise of this show. Rikugou Tokidoki gets trapped in an alternate world, where demons and the like isn't an unsual thing. After getting...trapped here, he is suddenly confronted with a lot of things; he has to change the way he thinks about and lives life, and he's the one person in that world who doesn't have a fate, which has resulted in him possessing a special power. Amatsuki also begins to explore the relations between demons and humans: are either good or evil? Is there something else behind it all?As I said, it sets the base for one helluva great show, and then stops. Fortunately, they didn't try to resolve things that much during the course of the thirteen episodes. I say fortunately because this definitely leaves room for a new season to continue the show, something they might not have been able to if they tried to close up the ending.The characters are all okay, with some great supporting characters and a new kind of main character in Tokidoki. He's not the completely laid-back type, and he's definitely not the overly rash type of guy. He's just a kind guy who cares for those around him without having to show it by killing everyone around him.Studio DEEN did a great job on the animation. The coloring is good, shading effects are good too, backgrounds are great, and characters designs are fine, with the exception of their eyes; the pupils are a bit large compared to the size of the eyes. I don't know about you, but I'm not a big fan of it. Nevertheless, the animation's great.The soundtrack is really great, though a bit unvaried; it was the same few background songs that played during the series, and I noticed that one of them was just an instrumental version of the ED theme, which in its original vesion is astounding. The OP theme's good too. The soundtrack did a decent job for this series, but it lacked a few things to become truly awesome.One more thing to note is that things may happen a bit quickly at times; this is most likely a product of its short length. I've noticed other people complaining about this, and true enough, I didn't quite catch what was happening without pausing and/or rewinding a few times to think over things.All in all Amatsuki is a series that may leave you a bit confused, and it'll make you long for a second season, but it's definitely good, and it holds the potential to become truly great. It just needs a second season!To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =) trapped here, he is suddenly confronted with a lot of things; he has to change the way he thinks about and lives life, and he's the one person in that world who doesn't have a fate, which has resulted in him possessing a special power.

It has all the elements that should make it great - interesting show mythology, intriguing moral dilemmas, some interesting and cool characters, an interesting and unique setting, and some supernatural stuff at play. The first couple episodes really draw you in a promise a good story. What the show gives falls somewhat short of that. Throughout the show, all manner of hints are teased out about what the large plot of the story is and where it is going, who the characters are and why they are important and all that manner of thing. However, while the show builds up...all the main plot, it actually focuses on a much smaller plot, a single story piece. While this enjoyable, and does occasionally illuminate the larger scope of the show, it merely only hints at what could be truly great. In the end, the show does resolve its story properly but leaves you wondering about the larger, overarching plot and really feels like the first part of an epic continuous story. While I did appreciate how the smaller plot was handled, over several episodes - so it didn't feel like useless filler, the larger plot elements were not elaborated on enough and the show really left you wanting much more. To that end, a continuation is hopefully in the works because the story just seems to getting started (The Manga itself is still ongoing). I, for one, was very interested in the plot and enjoyed all the supernatural elements. This is definitely a series I'd be watching the second part of. The art is exceptional, very nice to look at and there are some very interesting and skillful artistic effects. Otherwise, it serves its purpose well as it deals with ghostly entities and monsters. The character designs are interesting. Some of them are very unique and interesting to see. The most interesting looking characters are also the most interesting in terms of plot and are actually characters worth watching. Heihachi is one that surprised me in the end. His character, for an ordinary person in such a strange world, plays out very well. The music is also particularly appealing. The opening theme is wonderful but all the internal music is appropriate and compelling as well. Overall, I'd say this is a wonderful show that has much story to deal with yet, hopefully in a sequel series. all the main plot, it actually focuses on a much smaller plot, a single story piece.

In my opinion, the story started very well in the first episodes, but as the anime came close to the end, it started to look a little confusing, with some episodes with almost no advance in the storyline.The last episode was not bad, but could also have been better.The story itself has some interest, also has some action, but there are some flaws like slow progress, confusing aspects,...Interesting, but no more than a 7 here.Art (6.3) - in a short sentence: Not impressive! Design and animations doesnt look that good as they should,...so just a 6 here.Sound (6.0) - Although it isnt bad, i didnt like it very much. The opening is acceptable, the ed i didnt like it, the background music and voices aspect are not fantastic, this aspect is just an average aspect, that&acute;s why i give it a 6.Characther (5.0) - This aspect is not good. During the anime, i cant understand the role of many of the characters. Some vanish after 1 or 2 appearences, others rarely appear, even the main ones almost do nothing during the series except for tokidoki.In my opinion, this aspect was not develloped as it should be, and this makes a big impact in the anime. After watching amatsuki, i dont know a thing about most of the characters, and i can say for sure that all of them are far far away for having chances to be in my favourites.Enjoyment (6.2) - It could be interesting indeed, but it has major flaws. The lack of action in some moments, some confusing aspects in the story, episodes that come out of nowhere and lack of logical sequence is what i can point this show as mistakes. So, the show turned out to be just an mediocre show.overall (6.0) - I could say for sure that this show had potential to be better. The first 2 episodes were interesting, but then it started to miss in some important aspects and turned out to be confusing, boring in some moments and slow.with a better organization could have been much better, as it is i cant give it more than a 6. so just a 6 here.Sound (6.0) - Although it isnt bad, i didnt like it very much.

Episode 7 was the peak of the series where a decent cliffhanger was left and we finally got some action, but that slowly whittled away with episodes 8, 9, and 10 failing to advance the story.  Only in the final episode, 13, do we begin to understand the purpose and direction of this series...a bit late don't you think?  Nevertheless, the final episode shot up the story rating for me since it opens up the possibility of a second season where the story will hopefully...begin to make sense and get interesting (as depicted by episode 13 ending credits).  The ending of the series was clearly better than anything I had anticipated for this train-wreck series.  As for what else that hinders the story rating, it's not &quot;noob&quot; friendly since from what I've seen, manga readers have thoroughly understood the series quite well despite all the chaos and mess whereas non-manga readers clearly do not: 7/10Art:It is most likely the raw quality, but the art didn't really stick out to me.  There were also several shots where the characters looked ridiculously distorted from their original image throughout the series, so the artwork definetely was not top notch in this series nor did it seem like a priority (though this may change once DVDs are out): 3/10Sound:I like the ending theme.  The op theme is also okay (not fantastic though).  The rest of the music and bgms throughout the series was just average: 7/10.Character:With the constant removal/disappearence of several characters like Shinshu, Tsuruume, Ginshu, Kon, Shamon, and eventually Kuchiha (lack of dialogue in final episode), it's rather annoying.  At one point it was dwelling on Kuchiha's character, but it then shifted rather suddenly to Toki's character and then leaving everyone in the dust.  Episode 8 was noteworthy in particular where Kuchiha's past was all explained out of the blue.  So character development was clearly not a strong point in this series: 4/10Enjoyment:As said before, I like the first two episodes, and episode 7 and 13, but for the most part it was rather boring as I had no clue what was going on.  In addition, the story was moving far too slow for a 13 episode series, especially with no announcement of a second season at the moment: 4/10Overall:This series could have been much better in so many different ways: had it made better use of the episodes in between the series, or expanded it to a 26 episode series, or explained some of the terminology or point of story sooner, or organized the chronology of the series better.  There are far too many weaknesses ins this series, so this is really just a mediocre/average series: 5/10 begin to make sense and get interesting (as depicted by episode 13 ending credits).

The rest of the music and bgms throughout the series was just average: 7/10.Character:With the constant removal/disappearence of several characters like Shinshu, Tsuruume, Ginshu, Kon, Shamon, and eventually Kuchiha (lack of dialogue in final episode), it's rather annoying.  At one point it was dwelling on Kuchiha's character, but it then shifted rather suddenly to Toki's character and then leaving everyone in the dust.  Episode 8 was noteworthy in particular where Kuchiha's past was all explained out of the blue.  So character development was clearly not a strong point in this series: 4/10Enjoyment:As said before, I like the first two episodes, and episode 7 and 13, but for the most part it was rather boring as I had no clue what was going on.  In addition, the story was moving far too slow for a 13 episode series, especially with no announcement of a second season at the moment: 4/10Overall:This series could have been much better in so many different ways: had it made better use of the episodes in between the series, or expanded it to a 26 episode series, or explained some of the terminology or point of story sooner, or organized the chronology of the series better.  There are far too many weaknesses ins this series, so this is really just a mediocre/average series: 5/10"", ""Passed during a mysterious parallel thought of Edo period, Amatsuki is a very interesting anime that explores the relationship between the basic religious classes of Shinto: Demons, Humans, Kami and the Heaven.The first thing we have to remember to be able to fully enjoy this is that these &quot;classes&quot; are completely unrelated to anything you may find in the montheist Western religions we're used to. Demons, Humans and Kami (the spirits of things, if I am allowed to simplify) live in unrelated worlds, bounded by thin bridges, while the Heaven is a higher place where everything belongs. It is in Heaven (Ten) that the...destiny is forged and inserted in matter. Everything is ok in Amatsuki, the Edo mirror, until this young man Toki appears. Happens that young Toki also has the ability to forge destiny! Which dwells into the desire to change it.The story is absolutely interesting because of this setting. Some of the characters know what the destiny will be and will want to change it, while the main character is driven through a madness of a world that he does not know, trying to fit himself, please everyone and keep up with the people he loves.The art is not refined, but appropriate, and the portrays of demons are very amusing. It fits well the characters: an assortment of hot guys (for my fangirl pleasure), original designs for the paranormal beings and delicacy of clothes for the girls. The personalities of the characters are also very interesting, from the lazy demon boss to the shy and short tempered possessed girl. However, the main character fails them. A boy that never had any problem, has no reason for being kind, accepts everything just because... Too ideal.A beautiful world surrounded by a beautiful musical score, with the great defect of being too short. The secondary story (heart-taking and inspiring, for what matters) took all the time, while the primary was left open with a declaration of war to the Heavens. This outrageous ending makes Amatsuki deserve its fair score. All we can hope is that a second season is written in our destiny. destiny is forged and inserted in matter.

However, sometimes its hard to see where the plot is exactly heading...especially since there are only 13 episodes and I'm still not sure how everything is going to come together in one episode...but we'll see lol (and hope for a second season).I really like the art style!  There're plenty...of bishies for those who like 'em and monster-types for others :)  The arts  pretty easy on the eyes and flows well ~ I don't really have any complaints, it's just not...overly-amazing, i guess?Sound-wise - the opening/endings weren't my favorite, but they weren't bad either.  I really do like the background music however, it's traditional and sounds really pretty and fits too!Characterization was pretty good, you see some growth in some of the main characters, but not all.

As others have mentioned, it's a 13 episode anime based on a long running manga. After completing the anime I view it as a prequel to the manga (that captures the first volume or so of the manga).Other series have done the prequel thing much better (such as Ga-Rei Zero), where they explain everything properly and don't expect you to have insider knowledge of the story. Unfortunately, this isn't the case in Amatsuki. It starts out slow with plenty of time to get to know the characters, then picks up...in a frenzy of effort to shove story and meaning into only a handful of episodes. Not only that, but many things are dropped in and forgotten about.For example, what the heck is a nue and yakou and what do that have to do with the story? The nue appears a whopping twice and yakou runs around acting important but never really explained. The main character wants to solve a priestess's curse, but never does. In fact, he seems to have forgotten about his mission by the end of the anime. And why is he in Edo anyway? He started out in a virtual Edo, then suddenly is sucked into a real Edo where he finds his friend Kon as well, yet he never returns home nor puts any effort into finding out why he's there.I suspect all the loose ends are tied up in the manga, but without a second season this anime falls seriously flat. in a frenzy of effort to shove story and meaning into only a handful of episodes.

The story was much promising and i kinda liked the characters. However after the first episode the story doesn't really go anywhere and lacks any kind of twists. The ending was also random. I got bored as hell, and was disappointed in the end. 4 story, 8 art (art was quite good actualy), Sound 7 (nothing special), character 7 (nothing special), Enjoyment 3 (there was nothing to enjoy since nothing was special). Overall 4. Don't get swain away because you liked the the first episode. "", ""I tried to watch this, but it just didn't catch my attention. The characters were pretty bland, and the storyline did not seem to go anywhere to me. I dropped it after a couple of episodes. Even if it picks up later I do not think that I will watch it. An show has to give me something to keep me interested; if it is bland the first 10 episodes and picks up the last 15, I won't be there to see it through. "", ""I really enjoyed Amatsuki and was extremely disappointed when I got to episode 13 and it ended. Just to let you all know, this anime was never completed. One of the staff members went to jail for a drug related issue and production was halted. I have no idea when the show will continue... or if it will even continue at all.That said, the manga is still on-going. The anime covers the first 24 chapters of the manga if you want to know where to pick up from if you liked this and want an ending.  I know that I personally will continue this...through the manga and hope for the show to be continued at some point in the near future.The art is fantastic and the story is fairly original (there is only on other anime I can think of that has a similar story and that is .hack//sign)If you've already started watching this, it won't hurt to finish it then pick up the manga at chapter 25.

Unfortunately it's too short, and leaves you with more questions then answers. The characters are generic, but not in a bad way. Personally the characters are why I enjoyed this anime,  (However, since they are still generic I had to give them a 5). I also loved the world it creates, and the way the protag travels to it. I thought it to be a very unique way to do so in a time travel anime.The art is nice, very clean and colourful....Some of the design choices might not be to everyone's taste though.I would seriously suggest reading the manga, 13 episodes is not enough for this story to fully be explained.

I'd only recommend this to you if you intend to read the manga after your done. "", '""Amatsuki""- imPERVious90 Bogusified -I\'ll get down to it, this anime had a premise... A premise that showed such potential unto evolving into possibly something memorable. The end product unfortunately, clearly makes what I said just previously unto something of an absolutely bogasity.The anime starts out rather typical... Yes, it has similar traits to those of the same theme, namely ""Fushigi Yuugi"", and ""Inuyasha"", No, it does not span as lengthy as those two, but what it had was quite a distinct element/s, that not only showed uniqueness, but possibly what would\'ve made this anime memorable as my statement stands. The premise presented could have...only fully reach its potential when of course handled with T.L.C.. This was like two buns and a really good patty, but without that tomatoes, lettuce, and cheese, you\'ll never taste the entirety of the burger... Oh and Tender Loving Care, yeah, that too...

Maybe I just didn\'t try hard enough, I don\'t know... You decide', 'Sit down. Press play. Watch the song and the opening credits. Press pause when it finishes. Congratulations, you just watched the summary of Amatsuki.As weird as it sounds, the plot of this anime is so small you can actually see all of it in the intro song. And I don’t even mean it repeats on every episode either. It really is just what the intro will show you and nothing more in terms of plot. There is of course a lot more story than just that but it will be nothing but talking and talking and talking some more. And it’s not like talking alone...is not enough to make a good series but the nature of the story by default is supposed to include more.Let me be more analytical (as I always am). First of all the premise of the story is cliché as frakk so don’t mind it if you want to have hopes of enjoying the anime. And since it is revealed right away, it is no spoiler to mention that it’s about an indecisive lead magically taken back in a time full of mysticism, ugly monsters, and beautiful warriors. Because he has this broken power in his left eye that can surpass the Gods and thus becomes the epicenter of the story. The premise is indeed overused these days if you look around. People taken to magical lands and having magic eyes or transform to demons is no longer as rare as funky as it used to be.But it still sounds like a great premise for a story despite the cheese, doesn’t it? Sure it does; I mean it has demons and miko priestesses and demon-morphing samurai women and talking dolls. Well I’m afraid in practice it is presented in the dullest way imaginable so don’t get you hoped up. It could work despite its cheese if it was just shown nice. Like, with great action, or great characters, or great animation. Which it didn’t… somewhat. Production values are rather high and the allusions to mythology and mysticism are great but the feeling of excitement lacks completely. If a magician wants to pull a rabbit out of a hat, he doesn’t need to worry on how to do it right but also how to do it in a fancy way. Something that this anime lacks like water in the desert.Here is what happens in each episode more or less in a non-spoiler way. The lead goes somewhere, sees something, talks with someone. Some supernatural thing appears, says some weird mystical words, a few slashes are exchanged and the episode ends. That’s it.As much as I want to give it some credit for the effort given in making the world look nice or the story to appear mysterious, it still feels like having your grandmother reading you a bed time story. It is supposed to make you be interested in what happens but in practice you just fall asleep. There are no WOW moments in it to wake you up either. I mean there is a scene with battling a Nue monster, a scene with a woman turning demon and a scene with a talking doll blasting weird stuff out of its mouth. All the above are done in the simplest and driest way possible, thus losing any impact on you.In a way, the plot of this anime is the opposite of a heavy brainless action anime like Bleach. Where Amatsuki has the method of telling important things in a dull way, Bleach tells you useless things in an exciting one. And unfortunately, anime are supposed to be entertainment and not a school essay on feudal mysticism, thus the second method wins in this case. Thus all the charm of this anime is lost because of wrong implementation.As I said earlier, the production values are rather high as the sceneries have very good variety, the characters nice looks and the visual effects look mystical enough to fit properly in the story’s themes. At the same time, all these are just… dull. There is not much choreography during body movements and the fact most of the duration is talking, feels like they are standing still. The jaws move a bit, which is always a good extra but the way the limbs move is like they are bored to move or stiff from too much sitting idle. And the eyes of the cute characters, well, they look stupid. Like watching Mickey Mouse or something; they don’t fit with the setting. Nor do the bijin characters fit in either. What is this, all the main characters are like top models. Fan pleasing or not, there are still no connection points. And no, not even bijins were enough to make the plot more interesting. Who made this anime anyway? … DAMN, it’s made by piece of poop studio DEEN; no wonder it looks so awful. It is also directed by Furuhashi Kazuhiro, who some years ago directed Rurouni Kenshin and Hunter X Hunter. Strange, with this guy at the helm the battles should have been very exciting. I guess having DEEN’s shitty production values ain’t going to end good no matter how good you are at something,.Now about the characters. Besides the fact they have stupid eyes or are date-sim material, each one has a distinctive role in the story. They are definitely not cardboards and each adds something to the whole. The whole in this case is the lead finding out what is going on with his eye and the power to see monsters. That practically means the universe revolves around one character with all others being just allies or adversaries. And since the main character is a spineless wuss with zero battle experience and no idea what’s going on, you can just imagine how terrible it feels. Powerful mystics swarm him and talk and talk and talk and… don’t do anything else. Where is some action dammit? Why this magical world full of monsters and swords and stuff is like that but nothing happens? Why not just having a normal setting if you don’t plan to use them?So you see, this anime has its way to not only fail to excite you with what is going on but also to disappoint and even enrage you with what never happens. At first it makes you think it will be a mystical journey in far away lands through caves and dungeons, filled with traps and monsters, where in the end the secret to enlightenment awaits. Well forget it, not only there are no traps and monsters but also the only journey you see is walking around in a temple and talking with various people throughout the series. Not only that, but the ending does not even offer anything. Because it doesn’t exist! It just stops in the middle of it in the most dull and uneventful way possible. Such joy.Down to it, the main idea of the anime is good in terms of story and characters but the presentation is damn dull and unfinished. If you happen to have watched a few episodes of 12 Kingdoms, Inu Yasha, or Full metal Alchemist then Amatsuki has no reason for you to even bother with it. Not only that, but even if you are new to the field and give it a try, it will most likely still feel duller than an average Hollywood action film; thus you still won’t enjoy it.Well, I warned you and that’s it. The rest is up to you. Maybe you will see it differently and like it for its other merits.

Tokidoki a character who was very anxious and stressed after failing has to do a project and gets stuck in this museum based on the edo era.  He immediately gets attacked, a girl saves him and from there he figures out that he isn't imagining or wearing those glasses that projected him into the edo era anymore!  I was loving this anime, but it slowly fizzled out with a not so appealing ending with absolutely no resolution.  I wasn't impressed.The story could've been amazing!...It could have brought you into the edo era and gave you gold giving a story like no other!  However that's just not how it went.  The story went well and followed through until finale.  Then it fizzled out with every other anime that had no resolution like Umineko no Naku Koro ni, or deadman's wonderland.So in overall because it built me up to let me down I sadly gave it the rating of a 3.

A childhood favourite, it left a very strong impression on me from the very first moment. An impression the grew with me, instead of fading away.I have always found it interesting how true to life the story is in relation to how relationships might actually work in real life. Stories and fairy tales from this age have this habit of teaching us that \'one day our prince/princess will come and we will live happily ever after"" - in this story, however, this is not what happens,...but instead we are given a dose of another possible outcome. One of heartbreak and loss. And while I do believe is it an exaggerated over reaction, I always found it comforting to know at least one person was telling me a story with a real basis to it and not just some idealistic future where I work for nothing and receive everything for being good.Another thing I loved about this anime was the music. It is very moving and fits very nicely. Also, the sound quality was good for this era. There was attention paid to background noises this world was made real to me as a result.The art style used was popular at the time it was made, but also unique.

Being precociously pretentious, I was irritated at how little the Disney version resembled the Andersen fairy tale I loved and slept through it. Then came this anime. I was enthralled. The characters and backgrounds were beautiful in a graceful, idealized way I\'d never seen before. The ending, especially, was beautiful in a way I\'d never envisioned in all those readings.That school was forced...to close recently and the librarian asked me to take as many things as I could from the library. After wandering around like the oft-mentioned kid in a candy store, I was surprised to find that the VHS I had watched was still in the rack. I figured I had really lucked out and watched it at the first chance I had.Yes, it was indeed childlike innocence that let me be so entranced by this movie when I first saw it. The animation, although better than a lot of others in its time period, is often stiff and flat. The story isn\'t really as accurate to the story as I had thought, and in fact seems closer to the Disney version - which is pretty strange, considering that this was made first. The dub is pretty awful, especially the performance of the main character, who seems to really enjoy filling mouth flaps with bizarrely pornographic ""oh""s.But the art style is still beautiful, and the story is still much more interesting than the Disneyfied version.

I\'m sure she\'ll be entraced. to close recently and the librarian asked me to take as many things as I could from the library. After wandering around like the oft-mentioned kid in a candy store, I was surprised to find that the VHS I had watched was still in the rack. I figured I had really lucked out and watched it at the first chance I had.Yes, it was indeed childlike innocence that let me be so entranced by this movie when I first saw it. The animation, although better than a lot of others in its time period, is often stiff and flat. The story isn\'t really as accurate to the story as I had thought, and in fact seems closer to the Disney version - which is pretty strange, considering that this was made first. The dub is pretty awful, especially the performance of the main character, who seems to really enjoy filling mouth flaps with bizarrely pornographic ""oh""s.But the art style is still beautiful, and the story is still much more interesting than the Disneyfied version. If you have a little girl around, I\'d suggest showing her this old gem instead. I\'m sure she\'ll be entraced.', 'Once upon a time, there was a Danish princess who was only a few blushing years away from coming of age.  She had everything a young princess could possibly want...  A loving family, the respect of the community, and the most beautiful singing voice in the entire kingdom...  A voice that could put even the ancient sirens to shame.  But as is normally the case in stories such as these, the princess was not satisfied with the luxurious life that’s been afforded to her...  She wanted more from life, and only the very boundaries she’d been forbidden from crossing could...grant it to her.  Disobeying her father’s orders, she snuck past them.  After a chance encounter with a dying prince, she made up her mind that the one thing she needed in life above all things was to live happily ever after by his side.  But there was one problem...  The prince was a human boy, like you or I.  And the princess was a mermaid.Now, before you start telling me that you’ve heard this story before, let me assure you that this is NOT the same classic tale that you grew up with...  The one that showed you what it knew you wanted to see.  Nay, this is a much darker version of the story...  A version that’s based on the original Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale.  This is not a story of star crossed lovers overcoming the odds to find that elusive ever after that tempts our oldest heroes.  Even the princess herself is two years younger than the scarlet-haired maiden you remember.  This is a story of infatuation, of sacrifice, and of consequences.  Should the princess fail to marry her prince before he winds up in the arms of another, she will not be shrunken down into a weed, but killed, and turned into the very sea foam that reflects the sunlight off of the waves.  Will Marina obtain the same happy ending as Ariel, or will she find an outcome that’s more tragic and bittersweet?Hans Christian Anderson’s The Little Mermaid...  Which I’ll be referring to by it’s Japanese title “Ningyo Hime” from now on, for the sake of my fingers...  Was produced by legendary animation department of the legendary Japanese production studio, Toei.  While I’m a bit ashamed to admit this, Ningyo Hime is by far the oldest anime of theirs that I’ve seen, since they didn’t put out the original Dragonball until 11 years later.  Because I’m not entirely familiar with the animation of the time, and because dating must be taken into account, the over-all look of this particular anime is going to be very difficult to describe, but I can probably start by saying that in it’s time, compared to it’s contemporaries, Ningyo Hime was probably seen as being exceptionally good looking.I can’t really say whether the animation quality at the time was a result of low budgets or just limited technology.  I’d like to say it was a matter of budget, because of two factors:  First, Ningyo Hime doesn’t look as good as Cyborg 009, which came out seven years prior(Looks a hell of a lot better than Speed Racer, though).  Second, there’s a lot of restraint in the visual direction, as though the people producing it knew they couldn’t let their ambitions supersede their resources.  I understand that the anime spectrum was a very different place back then, in a time when you had maybe twenty to thirty new titles coming out each year, as opposed to the several hundreds we get each year now, and people had to take their animation with a grain of salt, but that doesn’t change the fact that Ningyo Hime has aged very poorly.As I said before, this film showed a lot of restraint in it’s visual direction.  This is probably it’s main saving grace in terms of aesthetic.  On screen movement is kept to a minimum, with most motion relegated to repetitive cycles, and close-ups during any of the rarer scenes that require more fast, precise movement.  That’s not to say these techniques aren’t noticeable, but they do help a great deal.  What helps even more is that a lot of the backgrounds that the characters move across are shockingly beautiful.  When Marina and her dolphin friend Fritz are swimming across the screen, it’s like they’re gliding across a watercolor canvas.  When they breach the surface, the sense of depth and distance is stunning.  The sparkling reflections of the sun and moon off of the waves convey a very lonely, yet serene feeling.The color palette is a bit on the dull side, but if you’re watching any of the the newer releases, everything still looks crisp and clear.  The use of lighting is also very impressive, although you don’t really get the full effect outside of scenes taking place out on the ocean, above the surface.  Of course, water is one of the most notoriously difficult things to animate, and I’ll have to reluctantly admit that the waves here look more like blue-green claymation than anything else.  The character designs are firmly a product of their time, a sort of early shoujo aesthetic, where the only body parts that don’t look anatomically accurate are the character’s anime eyes, which are still only half as big as what most otaku are used to.The music is also dated, but I actually quite enjoy listening to it.  It’s made up of slow, pleasant tunes, played through with harps, pianos, and various wind instruments, and the original singer of the few song tracks has a perfect amount of wonder and whimsy in her voice.  One thing I kind of have to knock it on is the way this music translated through to the dub.  The opening credits song had all of it’s lyrics removed, leaving only the baseline and a few accompanying instruments of what used to be a really pretty song.  They actually managed to rewrite the song from Marina’s graduation into English, but the dub singer just kind of mumbles her way through it, rendering it an incomprehensible mess.And speaking of the dub...  I am at a loss for words, which is exactly what I wish they had been.  The title role of Marina was played by Canadian voice actress Kirsten Bishopric, who was about 20 or 21 when that movie was dubbed and released stateside, and she could not act her way out of an uncut-plastic soda ring.  I know dubbing back in 1987 wasn’t on the same playing field that it is today, but since it was released on VHS in response to the popularity of the Disney version, you’d think they’d hire a main actress who doesn’t sound like a monotone Scarlet O’Hara.  And her little Dolphin friend is played by, no joke, the same actresses little brother, Thor, who sounds like the only directions he was being given were “Speak really loudly into the microphone” and “Sound sad for this scene.”They both did go on to have long acting careers, fortunately, but Kirsten tragically passed in 2014 at the age of 55.  The rest of the cast is more or less okay, considering the lack of screen time they got, but the dude playing the Prince Fjord, Ian Finlay, somehow has less personality than the guy who played Prince Eric, if you can believe it.So, I don’t normally review anime movies.  The last one I looked at was Oblivion Island, but I did that mostly in blow-by-blow format, and in retrospect, that review kinda sucked.  I was able to talk about that movie’s ending without actually spoiling it, I don’t think I’ll be able to do that with Ningyo Hime.  Of course, the movie is 40 years old, and the original story it’s based on is over 100 years old, so spoiling it would be a bit like telling someone how romeo and Juliet ends...  They probably already know, and if you heard about it from someone before reading this review, then they probably already told you way too much...  They probably told you that it features the original tragic ending that Andersen himself conceived so many years ago.  That still doesn’t mean the story’s as well known as everything else in the public domain, so before I go any further, this is my warning:  I am going to address the elephant in the room.Marina dies at the end.  I won’t tell you how it happens, or what circumstances led up to it, but she does not wind up with the prince, and she does not live happily ever after.  Yes, Japan was killing mermaids long before Hayden Panettiere was around to try and save them.  The little mermaid dies, which stands in stark contrast to the ending of the Disney version.  I’ve seen plenty of reviewers talk about this, but both movies star an entitled teenage girl who doesn’t know how good she has it, and wants more out of life.  There are arguments against the Disney version stating that Ariel learns nothing, but still gets exactly what she wants in the end, while the conclusion of the anime is a lot more honest and offers a better life lesson.Ningyo Hime teaches impressionable young children that when you obsess over somebody based on infatuation, which you’ve basically mistaken for love at first sight, and are willing to give up on everything you have just to be with them, you are most likely heading down the road to disappointment.  This is a very good point, and it underlines a very important life lesson that kids need to hear.  I actually have two problems with it, though.  The first is that if you look at the central conflict of both movies through a modern lens, you can draw the metaphor a little further.  Ariel and Marina’s conflict is very similar to the issue of gender identity.Notice, both of these characters were obsessed with the human world before meeting their princes, so it’s not hard to surmise that they both feel, deep down, that they were born in a way that they weren’t meant to be...  Mermaids who were meant to be human, just like men who were meant to be women.  When you shine that light on it, the plight of both girls begins to feel less selfish and more sympathetic.  Sure, their lives may be perfect from an outsider’s perspective, but are they supposed to just bottle up who they truly are and just live a lie for the rest of their lives?  Doesn’t the movie where the heroine gets to be who she was born to be and love who she wants to love feel so much more powerful, now?And my other problem is, of course, going to lead to some bigger issues.  Yes, Marina experienced a tragic end that takes the literal interpretation of Ariel’s conflict to it’s more logical conclusion, but a tragedy doesn’t feel deserved unless it was inevitable.  It doesn’t feel right unless there was one damning flaw the hero possessed that ultimately led to them deserving to lose it all.  And I hate to say it, but Marina’s happy future was brought down by a talking cat.I suppose in some way we’re supposed to believe that the cat is the sea witch in disguise, but that doesn’t make any sense.  First of all, the witch has nothing to gain by sabotaging her client.  She already has her voice, and she doesn’t seem to hate Marina at all.  There is no indication that she stands to gain anything, tangible or otherwise, from the devastation of the royal family.  Secondly, She’s not portrayed as being evil in this version.  She’s shrewd, and she controls storms, but she seems like more of a force of  nature than a villain.  No, the true villain of this story is a talking cat who hates Marina, wants to see her suffer, and is able to talk to Fjord’s parents  without either of them saying “Holy shit, that cat just spoke to us!”And I’m sorry, but that’s just an example of how badly written this movie is.  People complain that the Disney version brought a happy ending into the mix, but they also brought quaint little things like pacing, intricate plot points and actual characterizations.  Much like the cat, most of Ningyo Hime’s meager cast of characters barely get any screen-time, being introduced to perform a role and than disappearing for the rest of the film.  The perfect examples of this would be Fritz’s whale uncle(Not blood related, i’m guessing?  He’s more of an uncle in a ‘family friend’ sort of way?), and the guy with the weird nose that probably died after Fjord’s ship went under.  Even Marina’s Dad and her romantic rival are given bit parts, and the Disney version had much more expansive roles for them!  Marina’s sisters fare a little better, but there’s eight of them, and the perform a role that would have been satisfactory had ONE side character performed it.In a well written story, people and events that occur to further the plot aren’t just thrown away after they’ve served their purpose.  Everything comes back in some way, even if it’s just in reference, or a punch-line that reveals what happened earlier as being a set-up.  You can’t just resolve an issue by creating a character who can solve it and then dropping them afterwards.  Take, for example, School Rumble...  There are several sight gags that you think are just going to be forgotten afterwards, like Harima accidentally confessing his love to the wrong girl or turning into a monk with an entourage of zoo animals, that wound up becoming running gags and important plot points later on.  Ningyo Hime is terrible about this, and it’s just as bad about weaving the characters it does have into an intricate plot.  There are so many things that happened in Ningyo Hime...  The wolf attack scene, in particular...  That, if you didn’t see them, you wouldn’t notice anything was missing.  I’m not going to say it was a bad movie, but the execution was terrible, and it desperately needed to be updated for new audiences.  The Disney version did exactly that, which is why I really don’t mind the very real possibility that it ripped off the anime.  Honestly, stealing from an existing source isn’t such a bad thing if you do something new with it and fix a lot of it’s problems.Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid is available in several different formats.  It was originally released in VHS form, and to address another elephant in the room, yes, the mermaids were all topless in it.  That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but for a stateside release, it did make the G rating a little misleading.  A DVD release was eventually put out by UAV Corporation, but it’s so heavily edited that it can hardly be considered the same movie.  Finally, last year, Discotek Media released the full film, uncut and beautifully restored, with a much more appropriate note of “Not rated” on the back.  A twenty-six episode TV anime was released in the early nineties, but I haven’t seen it, so I have nothing to say.  The Disney version is also available...  Well, pretty much everywhere.In it’s time, Ningyo Hime was deservedly a big deal, and I won’t take that away from it.  It’s a significant entry in the history of the medium, and it’s probably the most accurate portrayal of Andersen’s original story that we’re ever going to see.  It’s worth checking out at least once, but it’s not worth holding up on a pedestal.  Whether you’re looking at its story from a literal or metaphorical perspective will determine whether it’s message is important one about discretion and self-control or a severely outdated one about ignoring your true self for the greater good.  If all you want is to see the original dark ending to a story that inspired the Disney classic, or even if you just want to see a 14 year old anime girl’s bare breasts, then this movie is for you.  As for the rest of us, it’s a significant film that should be experienced, but not celebrated.  I give Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid a 5/10. grant it to her.  Disobeying her father’s orders, she snuck past them.

I give Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid a 5/10.', 'I just wanna say that The Little Mermaid was my favorite Disney movie growing up. But that does not at all effect how I view Ningyohime, and I will not be comparing the two, because I no longer watch American TV.Story: 7/10The overall idea is very sweet and romantic. I thought everything was paced well, and while I haven\'t read it, I\'ve heard that it\'s true to the original source material.Art: 5/10It\'s... okay. The animation, while it\'s not the best, is just all right. Nothing special. I mean, it\'s no Kimi no Na Wa, but it\'s certainly no School Days. I think it\'s especially good...on the dolphin, Fritz. Yes, I\'m literally the only person so far to call him by his name. I can\'t tell if the animation is so mediocre because of the animation restrictions back then, or if they just had a low budget. Probably both.Sound: 5/10There\'s only one song in here, and it\'s not that good. As for the Dub, DO NOT WATCH THE DUB UNLESS YOU HAVE A HIGH TOLERANCE. PLEASE. DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO FIND A SUB VERSION. The Japanese voice cast is fine.Character: 4/10Meh. It\'s okay, I guess. Fritz is just kinda your stereotypical cute sidekick, the Prince is a blank sheet that\'s just there for eye candy, and even fails at that. Marina, the main character well, she was just kinda there. And really, there were several parts where I really didn\'t like her, mainly when she went to trade her voice.She met some random guy whose name she never found out and was like ""Oh! I\'m gonna to the evil witch now without any other build up!"" And then when Fritz, being smart and all, tries to stop her, she\'s like, ""If you dare stop me, then I\'ll no longer see you as a friend! We\'ll be enemies!"" That was when I just lost all sympathy for her.Enjoyment: 6/10Really, the only times I ever really found myself smiling were the moments with Marina and her Hojo-sama. They were really cute and entertaining, I dare even say, adorable. If you\'re gonna watch this movie, just watch them for the few moments they share together. They\'re pretty cute.But the cat... why the evil cat... WHY MUST YOU DO THIS TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!??????Overall, 6/10I think Ningyohime is an average movie. A lot people seem to like it, and it seems to hit them in the feels, it\'s not for me, though. Check it out for yourself, you may or may not like it. on the dolphin, Fritz. Yes, I\'m literally the only person so far to call him by his name. I can\'t tell if the animation is so mediocre because of the animation restrictions back then, or if they just had a low budget. Probably both.Sound: 5/10There\'s only one song in here, and it\'s not that good. As for the Dub, DO NOT WATCH THE DUB UNLESS YOU HAVE A HIGH TOLERANCE. PLEASE. DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO FIND A SUB VERSION. The Japanese voice cast is fine.Character: 4/10Meh. It\'s okay, I guess. Fritz is just kinda your stereotypical cute sidekick, the Prince is a blank sheet that\'s just there for eye candy, and even fails at that. Marina, the main character well, she was just kinda there. And really, there were several parts where I really didn\'t like her, mainly when she went to trade her voice.She met some random guy whose name she never found out and was like ""Oh! I\'m gonna to the evil witch now without any other build up!"" And then when Fritz, being smart and all, tries to stop her, she\'s like, ""If you dare stop me, then I\'ll no longer see you as a friend! We\'ll be enemies!"" That was when I just lost all sympathy for her.Enjoyment: 6/10Really, the only times I ever really found myself smiling were the moments with Marina and her Hojo-sama. They were really cute and entertaining, I dare even say, adorable. If you\'re gonna watch this movie, just watch them for the few moments they share together. They\'re pretty cute.But the cat... why the evil cat... WHY MUST YOU DO THIS TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!??????Overall, 6/10I think Ningyohime is an average movie. A lot people seem to like it, and it seems to hit them in the feels, it\'s not for me, though. Check it out for yourself, you may or may not like it.', ""I watched this movie, because I heard it followed the original story much more than the Disney version. Which is true. Most of the time. But I don't remember anything about an evil cat in the original one. I didn't quite get that part. The story was not bad, but I did not like this strange cat part of it...The art was okay, Normal for the time when the anime was made, I guess, but I definitely did not like it. I think Marina's sisters looked evil, and the grandmother looked extremely stupid. I am not too much into old anime art style, and this...did not rise up higher then anything else, not to mention those weird effects...I would have given the sound a score of one, if not for the fact that I did not hear the original Japanese version, and for the music that I did find kind of fitting sometimes. And which was actually quite pretty. If you ever watch this movie, do NOT watch it in English. Even if you usually do, please find a subbed version for this instead. I may have enjoyed this movie a lot more if the dub was not so horribly bad. It was annoying, emotionless, or wrong emotions were used, and many very very strange sounds left Marina's mouth. And I found it annoying that we could hear her thoughts. Her voicelessness would have been much more real, and would have seemed much more sad if she would truly have been voiceless, even towards the viewer. The other thing wrong with the sound was the music. The music was both good and bad. While it was pretty, and great for some scenes, such as in the last one, in other scenes, it was not fitting at all, and decreased the enjoyment a lot.The characters were okay, nothing special about them. While I would hate poor marina in real life for her extremely kind and innocent nature, and would find her boring, in this specific anime, her personality was of great importance. So here it is not only acceptable, it's kinda good. All the others were forgettable to me, nothing unique in their personalities. The one who could stand out a little maybe, was the dolphin. He was pretty much a typical cute little sidekick, not a special one. He was cute and everything, but very boring too.I did definitely not enjoy this anime. But I did not put 1 as a score for enjoyment, because I did enjoy most parts of the final scene.All in all, this was an okay anime. NOT better than the Disney version. While some aspects of it were better, some were a lot worse. I don't really recommend this anime to you (especially not in English), unless you are okay with mediocre characters, unfitting music and old-anime art. did not rise up higher then anything else, not to mention those weird effects...I would have given the sound a score of one, if not for the fact that I did not hear the original Japanese version, and for the music that I did find kind of fitting sometimes.

You're probably thinking of Disney's 1989 animated movie, which is understandable since that's considered the most well known adaptation of the 1837 Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale. The Little Mermaid is one of the most famous fairy tales in existence, and whether you really know about the story or not, you're very likely to have at least heard of it in some capacity, whether through the Disney movie, reading some illustrated version of the book somebody put out, or other means. But what many don't know is that the Disney movie isn't the...only movie adaptation of the story, as there have been others that have tackled it before and since then, with one of them being an anime movie that Toei made in 1975, referred to as Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid. For the sake of brevity I'm just gonna keep calling it The Little Mermaid. If you're thinking that this version is gonna be anything like the Disney movie, you're out of luck, as one thing this version has over the Disney version is that it remains true to the story's original tragic ending.You won't find Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian in this adaptation of The Little Mermaid. This one stars a blonde mermaid princess named Marina, who along with her dolphin friend Fritz, really wants to see the world beyond the water, as her older sisters are always telling her stories about it. But against her father's wishes, she and Fritz manage to ascend to the surface, where they find a ship in the middle of a bad storm. Marina manages to save one of the passengers, who turns out to be a prince named Fjord, but is made to flee before she can talk to him so she won't get caught by onlookers. Yearning to see him again, Marina decides to visit the Sea Witch and ask her for a way to live as a human. The Sea Witch gives her a potion that can turn her tail into human legs, but at the cost of her voice and can never become a mermaid again. Not only that, if the prince marries another girl, Marina will dissolve into sea foam and die. Marina manages to reunite with Fjord, but things don't exactly work out in Marina's favor.Honestly, there's really no point in not mentioning that Marina dies in the end, as this movie makes no secret of the fact that it's more faithful to Andersen's original story, even down to the tragic ending. Hell, even Discotek's now out-of-print DVD release doesn't attempt to hide it! The fact that the mermaid dies in the end has been referenced in pretty much any media that makes homages to the story, even stuff like Puella Magi Madoka Magica. One other thing that differentiates this version from the Disney film is that the mermaids...don't wear bikinis. Yeah, the mermaids' chests are exposed, complete with uncensored though distant shots of their nipples, though their long hair covers them on occasion. It's not to the level of hentai or anything, but I can easily picture some parents finding this inappropriate to show their kids. Then again, the company that first dubbed this edited some shots, but even that wasn't enough.From an animation standpoint, it's fairly obvious that this adaptation doesn't have anything close to the budget the Disney version had. This was a Toei movie made in 1975 after all, and it was made around the time Toei began making cheaper movies to rake in money easier. The character designs are rougher and more rustic and the actual motion can be a little stilted barring certain scenes. But that doesn't necessarily mean The Little Mermaid's animation is bad, per se, and it does have its own charm that also sets it apart from the Disney version. And that's also not to say that the animation can't be creative in its own right, because the waterlife have great designs and the hand-painted backgrounds are well made and do a masterful job at giving this particular movie a more cutthroat atmosphere to it. Oh, and the Sea Witch's design is great, too. Sure, she's no Ursula, but she doesn't need to be.Speaking of the characters, the closest thing this movie has to a Flounder analogue is the dolphin named Fritz, who is Marina's friend, though Fritz technically came before Flounder's conception. I haven't seen the Disney movie in a while so I have no memories of Flounder or his personality, but I found Fritz to be fairly entertaining and fun, both as comic relief and as Marina's ally. Plus, Fritz is shown to be surprisingly badass for a character of his caliber. He gets to do a lot in this movie, from managing to fight off bad monsters to help Marina when she needs him. The other characters...they're admittedly kind of one-note, but they serve their roles well, even if they're not as active as the characters in Disney's adaptation. The only character I don't get is this cat named Gemmy, who for some reason conspires to kill Marina, and why they want to do so is never explained. Also, for some reason Gemmy is able to talk with humans and again, the movie never bothers to explain why. What even was the point of this character? Plus, Marina spends a good portion of her time as a damsel in distress and not really doing much. Again, I haven't seen Disney's The Little Mermaid in years, so I have very few memories of Ariel as a character, other than that Ariel is more headstrong and rebellious, so other than those qualities, I can't really comment on Marina as a character, as it's kind of pointless to compare her to Ariel.And I will admit, there is one other thing that keeps me from loving the movie as a whole: The extremely rough voice acting. I'm not talking about the English dub which, while definitely a product of its time, is actually pretty good. I'm talking about the original Japanese voice acting. What do I mean? Their overall acting is fine, but several of the characters' voices either sound way too deep or way too shrill. Marina's voice is said to be beautiful and angelic, but Fumie Kashiyama's voice for her makes her sound really deep in a way that doesn't match Marina's design. On the other hand, Fritz's Japanese voice seems to be set to permanent loud, nasally shrill every time he talks. It's not the most annoying voice I've heard (Looking at you Misaki Kuno, Nichika Omori, Takeshi Kusao as Coco, and Eimi Naruse), but if you have sensitive hearing and can't stand certain noises, it'll get real grating real fast. It says a lot that I prefer the English dub voices over the Japanese voices by virtue of the fact that Marina and Fritz have voices that actually match their appearances and personalities and don't grate on my ears. But it's been a while since I've seen the dub, so for all I know, my opinion might change if I watch it again.But I don't want to end this review on a negative note, so I will finish this off with one other thing that I did like about this adaptation: The soundtrack. It has plenty of harps, pianos, and wind instruments giving it all a slow, pleasant atmosphere, and the songs sung by the late great Kumiko Oosugi are given the right amount of wonder and whimsy. Now, this would be the part where I'd mention that The Little Mermaid is now available on DVD, and for a while, it was. Discotek Media put it out in 2015, but unfortunately, that release fell out of print. You can rent or buy the dubbed version off Amazon Prime if you have an account, but that's it as far as accessibility goes. I'm lucky I managed to buy my DVD copy when I did. Overall, Toei's adaptation of The Little Mermaid doesn't entirely hold up well under modern scrutiny, and some baffling narrative decisions and uncensored nudity make it hard to recommend to a casual view, but this is one of the more faithful versions of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, so if you're tired of Ariel, feel free to check this one out. only movie adaptation of the story, as there have been others that have tackled it before and since then, with one of them being an anime movie that Toei made in 1975, referred to as Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid.

It's a Rumic World: 50th Anniversary Weekly★Shonen Sunday,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6566/Its_a_Rumic_World__50th_Anniversary_Weekly★Shonen_Sunday,"['Alright, this thing is only three minutes long, so naturally this review is going to turn up short also.Story: SkippedThis anime was created to promote the OVA releases of Urusei Yatsura, Inuyasha, and Ranma 1/2 respectively. Of course, it\'s all one-hundred-and-ten-percent fanservice, but if that\'s not why you\'re watching it, then what are you expecting? The entire reason ""Rumic World"" exists is so that you can experience the novelty of Ranma misunderstanding Inuyasha\'s species, seeing Inuyasha attack Lum, believing her to be some sort of demon, and, of course, to see Ataru flirt with every female character that showed up for the crossover, including...girl Ranma.Art: 9The animation is great, of course. They\'d have to be pretty lazy to neglect filling something this short with eye-popping moments of art, each of it staying true to Takahashi Rumiko \'s art style (for example, when Ranma punches Amaru in the beginning, you can plainly see Amaru\'s fingers doing the Spider Man pose as he flies away.)Sound: 7I don\'t remember much of the music, but the voice acting was pulled off at the expected level. Everyone sounds great. Nothing else to say here. Moving on.Character: 8The characters act exactly as you would expect them to, and in humorous ways, almost like the crossover is natural to them. They all look as great as they did in their series. Presumably. I admit, though, at only having watched Ranma 1/2 so far, so I\'m not entirely certain.Enjoyment: 9Finally, this really is enjoyable to the point where I was fairly disappointed when it ended. Of course, there isn\'t enough time for the gimmick to wear off, so the ""OMFG INUYASHA VS. ATARU"" stays strong throughout.Overall: 8If you like even one component of Takahashi\'s work, then watch this. If you\'ve never heard of Takahashi Rumiko before (the wealthiest female comic artist in the world) then this would serve as a fantastic introduction. If you hate her beyond all measure, then why not watch it anyway? It\'s less than three minutes long, so it won\'t exactly kill you. I give this my general recommendation. girl Ranma.Art: 9The animation is great, of course.
