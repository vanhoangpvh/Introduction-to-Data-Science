Xi Xing Ji,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38490/Xi_Xing_Ji,"['Xi Xing Ji/ The WestwardStory (8/10) Very GoodProbably most people has already heard about famous Chinese tale called journey to the west. This story is basically what happened after the journey. It begins in a dragon kingdom where wolf demon (protagonist) who is friends with the Dragon princesses. There is a great war between Gods and dragons over stolen sutra (eternal fire) from Journey to the west. Deep secrets are held by boths gods and dragons. Now our protagonist (wolf demon) is on a journey to bring back the crew from Journey to west ( Tang Sanzang, dragon horse, monkey kin, pig and sand demon)...so that they all could take back the sutra where it belongs i.e in the west. There biggest hurdle is the gods and demons who oppose them.I really like mythology story. This series did good use of the Chinese mythologies to well around action packed series. Especially they outdid themselves in the last episode was one of my favorite scene and fight of this series.In terms of storyline, it is comparable to that of wu geng ji (one of the good Chinese anime)Art ( 7/10) GoodIt is CGI, so not for everyone. But still the CGI is almost at the level of Douluo Dalu (one of the best chinese anime). So its good when compared with other chinese series. Artstyle is very good, i like it.Characters (9/10) GreatI love the character. They make the series all the more worthy to watch. Character progression for each of our protagonists (dragon horse and Tang Sanzang) are really awesome. I really loved buddha for obvious reasonsEnjoyment (9/10) OutstandingI really enjoyed it very much. It is one of my top 10 chinese anime ever.Overall (9/10) Very GoodFrom the concept to the action, everything was really great. The only complaint would be CGI ( but well i am used to it by now), I cant wait to see next season so that they all could take back the sutra where it belongs i.e in the west.

I don’t know why this reimagination of Journey to the West donghua series is so underrated. This is an exciting story that takes place 16 years AFTER the sutra has been successfully collected & presented to the heavenly emperor.In this Westward story Tang San Zang is no weakling monk relying purely on his disciples to protect him. This holy monk is kick-ass. He fights, he punches (HARD!), he is witty, funny, fierce, protective & more. Sun Wu Kong is well Sun Wu Kong need I say more. Some new interesting key characters are introduced in this story which changes the team...dynamics of the travelling entourage giving it layers & is refreshing to watch.There are 1) multiple exciting & fantastic fight scenes between demons vs gods vs dragons etc. 2) great character progression, 3) well paced storylines,  4) touching moments (between Tang San Zang & his most famous disciple) that made me shed a tear or two, 5) well timed humour, 6) quality of CGI & artstyle is top notch, 7) the designs of every main character is so spot on & I love every one of them, 8) every season has a nice soundtrack, I can carry on indefinitely with all that is so great about this donghua. However I think anime fans please go watch it yourself then you will understand what I mean. dynamics of the travelling entourage giving it layers & is refreshing to watch.There are 1) multiple exciting & fantastic fight scenes between demons vs gods vs dragons etc. 2) great character progression, 3) well paced storylines,  4) touching moments (between Tang San Zang & his most famous disciple) that made me shed a tear or two, 5) well timed humour, 6) quality of CGI & artstyle is top notch, 7) the designs of every main character is so spot on & I love every one of them, 8) every season has a nice soundtrack, I can carry on indefinitely with all that is so great about this donghua.

Zhan Qiannian,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51517/Zhan_Qiannian,"['This donghua is an adaptation of the manhua ZhanGuo QianNian published by Bilibili.Plot summary: The MC is a gaming streamer, likely a top-player as well, of a wuxia martial arts game. After recieving a bracelet modeled after an ingame item (believing it is for him to promote/advertise) he is sent isekai into the game world. He arrives in an alternate timeline China, where the assassination of the Qin Emperor prevented the unification of China and led to the continued war until the ""modern"" time. The MC uses the bracelet (artifact) and cultivates to live and rise up in this world.The setting can be considered a...mix of Japanese isekai and Chinese cultivation stories. The MC does have a cheat, but not a OP broken cheat right off the bat. Instead he has to work/use his cheat to strengthen himself. Since it is in the historical fantasy genre, you can expect similar setting, presentation, speech and drama of historical dramas. Expect the more gradiose/long-winded political debates, cross class romance, romantic drama, etc. Intermixed is some decent comedy. The plot so far is not too deep, but we can clearly see there are things going on in the background that is being built up.The character models and art is good. The animation quality is also high; it is a bit childish, but that\'s fine. There are quite a few characters who will probably be main contributors to the plot, though most of the focus for now is on the MC as he gets stronger. This Season 1 can be could be considered a prologue to the story.If you like historical fantasy drama or cultivation type works, this is a good watch. I would recommend it.Now as an adaptation, this donghua is probably the closest I have ever seen to a ""perfect"" adaptation. One of the reasons for this is because the original work is a manhua, which has much more manuveurability in it\'s plot than a novel. Novels tend to require prioritization because of how detailed it can be, while manhuas have looser plots and require readers to ""fill in the holes"". That said, there are some noticable changes to the donghua plot. Part of it involves introducing certain characters eariler to build them up as an antagionist, quick recoveries from injuries to spare resources on animation. There does appear to be some details and dialogue left out that suggested the ""awakening"" that happened at the end. All the other changes made the plot develop more smoothly so they were all considered good changes.By the way, the donghua adapts manhua chapters 1-39.Adaptation score (how faithful to source): 8/10 mix of Japanese isekai and Chinese cultivation stories.

Yozakura Quartet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4548/Yozakura_Quartet,"[""Yozakura Quartet is an extremely odd show, and you'll be forgiven for scratching your head and wondering what the hell was going on come the end of the show.The series began life as a manga by Suzuhito Yasuda that was published by Kodansha in Japan, and by Del Rey in the US. Prior to the manga, Suzuhito worked as the character designer on Kuwashima Yoshikazu's series Kamisama Kazoku, and Yozakura Quartet is his first solo work.The anime was directed by Matsuo Kou (Kure-nai, Rozen Maiden, Red Garden, Dead Girls), and shows some of the trademarks of Matsuo's directorial skill.The story is very similar to that...of Rosario + Vampire, in that a human boy is living in a town with Youkai (vampires, oni, etc,), however it differs from R+V in numerous ways, not the least of which is the fact that the human boy, Hizumi Akina, is not helpless, and actually has a position of authority within the town. Akina works on behalf of the town's elders as chief of the &quot;Youkai Life Consulation Office&quot; with Nanami Ao (a satori who has the ability to read minds), and Isone Kotoha (a hanyou, or half human-youkai). Together with Akina's childhood friend Yarisakura Hime, who is the &quot;mayor&quot; of the town and a descendant of a dragon, the four manage the everyday needs of the town, and work to protect it's residents from youkai who have gone out of control.The big problem with this show is that, even though it had quite a lot of potential, the story jumps around far too much and nothing is ever really explained. Now, a show like Aria can get away with not explaining things, but a show like this needs some solid reasons for the actions of it's protagonists. The most the audience is given are hints though, which may lead you to believe that an explanation is forthcoming (prepare to be disappointed though). The main antagonist for example, Enjin, has taken over the body of Akina and Hime's best friend Gin, however there is very little explanation as to who Enjin is, or about why he chose Gin. Little is known about the friendship between Akina, Hime and Gin, even though this plays a direct role in confrontations with Enjin.The animation for Yozakura Quartet is extremely well done. The animation is smooth, even during the fight scenes, and the CG that is in the show is oft times seamless and indistinguishable from the normal animation. The characters in Yozakura Quartet are reflective of the fact that Suzuhito worked on Kamisama Kazoku as the influence from that manga/anime is very clear, especially in the faces.The sound is actually very impressive on the whole. Director Matsuo Kou has very clearly drawn on his experience with Kure-nai, as the VAs had recorded their lines prior to the show being animated. This means that conversations and arguments are often a lot more complex than other anime, and brings a sense of realism to the characters that is often missing. The effects are also of a very high standard, and can sometimes set the tone of a scene without the need for visuals.My one gripe with the sound, and the reason I didn't give this section a higher score, is the fact that although the music was pretty decent on the whole, there was too much of it. There are many scenes in the show where the same track plays, almost to the point where it becomes annoying. This track is played during many dramatic or tense moments, and often ruins the mood of the scene as it doesn't really fit with the characters or actions/events.The characters are fairly average on the whole. There are no original or excellent characters in this show, and many seem to fall into one stereotype or another. The one character who annoyed me the most was Akina, especially where Enjin is concerned. It was disappointing to see that there was little to no growth for almost all the characters, even Akina and Hime, and that Akina was the stereottypical male lead who can't make a decision on his own.That said, the show is enjoyable to a certain degree. I enjoyed watching it for the most part, but not as much as I was hoping. Because of it's inability to stick to the point, and the wishy-washy nature of it's characters, I found this show somewhat disappointing. I have given it a good rating only on the basis of it's animation and sound (which would have been higher if the show hadn't played that damn song all the time).Fans of Rosario + Vampire or Kure-nai may enjoy this show, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants a strong story with great characters.It's truly a shame that a show with such potential should be let down in this way. of Rosario + Vampire, in that a human boy is living in a town with Youkai (vampires, oni, etc,), however it differs from R+V in numerous ways, not the least of which is the fact that the human boy, Hizumi Akina, is not helpless, and actually has a position of authority within the town.

Yozakura Quartet happens to be one such example. Based on a much more highly acclaimed manga, the first episode starts off with all one could expect from a show that could deliver. Interesting, well-drawn characters centered around at least a moderately unique plotline. The music and sound quality are top notch and there are even early introductions to romance possibilities.However, as some stories tend to do, that&rsquo;s when the train leaves the tracks. Yozakura Quartet is about a group of young people (there are...5 of them actually, and originally 6 so the title really makes no sense) who protect a town that harbors both humans and Youkai. An evil Youkai, who has possessed the body of the best friend of two of the members, is out to seek the destruction of the town and bring about an era of all-Youkai rule, essentially snuffing out humans.The first few episodes start slowly and then immediately we&rsquo;re introduced to Enjin, the protagonist, who it turns out is far stronger than they. There&rsquo;s no real room for development or explanation of how they&rsquo;re related and it seemed to me that maybe this should have been a 24 episode series. But for some inexplicable reason, the story decides to stick with random fights throughout the rest of the series, leading to mindless, repetitious dialogue that we could have seen coming using &ldquo;fill-in-the-blanks.&rdquo; The heroes never grow in strength as the finale comes either, so the ending is an extreme example of dues ex machina, which is like a death warrant for any anime anyway. There are too many characters to fill the time slots, the relationships between the characters don&rsquo;t grow an inch and several of the plot lines are never resolved.There were some good things. As said before, the music was excellent and the ladies were very nice to look at &ndash; they were anything but bland or clich&eacute;d. The villain and his sidekick were diabolical and deserved a better defeat. And the art really was stunning in several points of the anime.All in all, though, this was an anime that was a disappointment far greater than a regular bad show, because it had potential and went nowhere. 5 of them actually, and originally 6 so the title really makes no sense) who protect a town that harbors both humans and Youkai.

I felt strongly that the number ratings given do not correspond with what was said, and that they were unnecessarily gentle. This series is 4(Decent) at best.As to the story, it had a lot of potential, but none of that was realized. It ended up jumping around to random battles and poorly scripted conversations that seemed to have something to do with a general movement of plot, but in actuality did not. Lots of things happen in the plot, but the plot parts are so disjointed that no real story emerges, at...least no story that can stand up beyond a vague general description of the overall arc. Very poor, indeed.The art is nothing special, and it is not at all bad. The battles scenes are very average, with fighters swinging around weapons and throwing colored light balls, but the actual feel of legitimate combat is lacking. The character designs are, for the most part, interesting. If there had been actual character development, it would have been nice.The most abysmal part of the show was the opening. From an artistic perspective, it sucked quite badly. It didn't match anything in the show, thematic, stylistically, and was overall incongruous and lacking in substance. Whoever made it definitely has a fetish for strangely colored shapes and Adobe Aftereffects.It's unfortunately that the opening was so bad, as the song chosen for it was not. Furthermore, the sound design for the rest was very good. Nothing ground breaking, but the Foley was well done enough to give the situations occurring some sense of depth, and the background music supported well without intruding on the story. That said, the music did not elevate the viewer/listener at all, as it can sometimes in masterpieces(Gai Rei Zero being an excellent example), but it didn't do anything wrong, which was good enough.As you can probably tell, I hated watching this show. The first three episodes were fine, and offered the possibility of great potential in the future. However, things went downhill from there, until they fell off a bloody cliff into the bottomless chasm (i.e. episode 8) of being a waste of time. By 10, I was watching it on fast foreword, just to finish. I think, however, the most frustrating thing about the show was that the story made no apologies or real consequences for stupid decisions on the part of the protagonists. I mean, literally handing the bad guys the chance at world destruction is a mistake in my book. Hopefully that's not too much of a spoiler, but since this is such a bad show anyway, I doubt it will ruin your lack of enjoyment anymore than just watching can.So yea, there were a few good aspects, but that like pointing out that the figure head is nice on a ship with no rudder and giant gaping holes in the hull. If the car is a rust bucket, you don't rate it average just because the windshield was recently cleaned. So yeah, I agree with a lot of what the other reviewers said, but I disagree strongly with their number ratings. least no story that can stand up beyond a vague general description of the overall arc.

That's not a lot of episodes to go wrong with. A basic plot and story can easily be done in twelve episodes. Characters can be fleshed out in twelves episodes. Yozakura Quartet did not manage to do any of that.Story - 3The first few episodes showed how much potential Yozakura Quartet had. They were interesting and hooked me instantly. The rest of the show continued to mock me as if saying I was a fool for having any hope in the plot.

I really didn't pay much attention to the score, which means at least it didn't bother me. The seiyū's on the other hand were too good for this show. The seiyū's for Chiaki Shinichi (Nodame Cantabile), Shinku (Rozen Maiden), Suigintou (Rozen Maiden), Sebastian Michaelis (Kuroshitsuji), Nagi (Kannagi), Yin (Darker than BLACK), and many more were wasted voicing dull, irritating characters.Character - 5The characters started out okay, but slowly a serious case of bad characterization appeared. By the end of the show, I could only stand to watch around two or three characters. The rest made multiple stupid decisions and contradicted their behaviour from before.Enjoyment - 3Pretty animation and nice sound will go nowhere if the story fails and you want to strangle to the main leads. The story was a giant letdown, but every week I hoped it would get better. But it didn't.Overall - 5So much potential, so little results. Yozakura Quartet was mediocre to core.

Well, Yozakura Quartet, I could say, falls to the so - so level for me.It\'s not very bad, but not very good neither. If you have free time, then try watching it, but if you\'re kinda busy and only goes for the must - type then, it\'s okay to skip it. You could live your life to the fullest even without seeing this.Well, I don\'t mean to bash the anime. I had some little pretty moments actually. hmm..little moments...hehe...I don\'t know. I like its concept of \'youkai\', it always remind me of my Claymore days and Claire -chan..hehe..but anyways, it\'s kinda...cheesy.However, I don\'t think the story has been rushed. It actually has a nice flow for the 12 - episode type. Although I might say, great heroism and character improvement plus coolness factor are lacking in this one. For me, the characters are blah, although they are actually very likable. For example, the main charac, Akina, I am so rooting for him. I want to him to be the sole savior of the Sakurashin Town, and wishing him to be a super ""saiyan"" (read: super powers) later in the series, but apparently, he is just a typical human being who is just gifted with a curse which runs in his family,and can only do one thing...tantananannnnn...cleanse youkai. He was overshadowed by the next not-even-cool-but-I-like-her character.... Hime. She so reminds of Yomi-onee-san from Ga Rei Zero. They are both long hair and beautiful. They are both skilled warriors. The thing that differentiates them is the oozing coolness factor of my greatest onee-san! Yeah boy!!Hime doesn\'t even have the slightest of it, well, I am so horrible bec. I am comparing the two which should not be the case since they are not of same situation..Well, whatever, don\'t mind me... Hime has the greatest role in saving her city but I didn\'t feel much of it that\'s why even though I like her, she won\'t make it to the cut.With the other characters, let\'s say..hmmmm...passing marks for them.With the OP & ED, passing also..but they do not make a recall to my ears..except for that particular BGM,,the one with the english lyrics? Hmm..I\'m not sure..hehe..Overall, I think this anime would only be on my passing level although I do not regret seeing this. I believe, we have different tastes to choose the good and the bad. So it\'s for you, readers, to decide! (Hmmm...I would be so touched if anyone would just read this..hehe...)From someone-who-already-moved on-to-a-new-anime-series,Me^_^ cheesy.However, I don\'t think the story has been rushed. It actually has a nice flow for the 12 - episode type. Although I might say, great heroism and character improvement plus coolness factor are lacking in this one. For me, the characters are blah, although they are actually very likable. For example, the main charac, Akina, I am so rooting for him. I want to him to be the sole savior of the Sakurashin Town, and wishing him to be a super ""saiyan"" (read: super powers) later in the series, but apparently, he is just a typical human being who is just gifted with a curse which runs in his family,and can only do one thing...tantananannnnn...cleanse youkai. He was overshadowed by the next not-even-cool-but-I-like-her character.... Hime. She so reminds of Yomi-onee-san from Ga Rei Zero. They are both long hair and beautiful. They are both skilled warriors. The thing that differentiates them is the oozing coolness factor of my greatest onee-san! Yeah boy!!Hime doesn\'t even have the slightest of it, well, I am so horrible bec. I am comparing the two which should not be the case since they are not of same situation..Well, whatever, don\'t mind me... Hime has the greatest role in saving her city but I didn\'t feel much of it that\'s why even though I like her, she won\'t make it to the cut.With the other characters, let\'s say..hmmmm...passing marks for them.With the OP & ED, passing also..but they do not make a recall to my ears..except for that particular BGM,,the one with the english lyrics? Hmm..I\'m not sure..hehe..Overall, I think this anime would only be on my passing level although I do not regret seeing this. I believe, we have different tastes to choose the good and the bad. So it\'s for you, readers, to decide! (Hmmm...I would be so touched if anyone would just read this..hehe...)From someone-who-already-moved on-to-a-new-anime-series,Me^_^', 'Yozakura Quartet is focused on a consultation office of demons and humans in a consultation office who exist to protect a town where demons and humans coexist against evil demonic threats, this series dealing with evil demon Enjun trying to unleash the evil demons that have been sealed by the group. Many of the episodes in the first half of the series serve to introduce the members of the consultation office, their backgrounds before the start of the series and their regular duties throughout the town. They are fleshed out enough where you could care for them as characters, but these episodes lack much in...the way of intrigue or tension beyond hints of Enjun\'s incoming arrival as they are mostly light-hearted and sort of follow a slice-of-life style plot.The second half of the series is where things pick up in Yozakura\'s storytelling when Enjun makes his presence felt on the town and the effects of his actions effect the populace. An added twist to the developments come from a revelation where Enjun is possessing the body of someone close to several members of the consultation office that add some interesting tension into the series as these characters feel conflicted over how to approach the situation throughout much of the show\'s second half. While the storyline does go for a black-and-white moral approach, Enjun does get enough dimension to his character to show how manipulative his character can be with the body he possesses and the strong belief that he has for his actions in trying to free the demons that were sealed.Even with the solid second half though, Yozakura Quartet does have its issues. I questioned the point of the land gods\' presence in this series as they couldn\'t do anything to assist the consultation group due to ""rules"" they had to follow and they didn\'t get much in the way of depth. Enjun\'s partner in his plans also lacks much in the way of dimension and depth beyond serving as major obstacle in the efforts of the consultation group to halt Enjun\'s plans and the series fails to explain how Enjun was freed from being sealed. Also, the ending for this felt a bit too anti-climatic considering how difficult it was for the group to deal with Enjun throughout of the course of the series beyond overcoming their hesitance at taking him down.The visual presentation to this series is rather average with bright colors and solid, though rough, levels of detail implemented in the designs of characters and scenery, though nowhere as visually impressive as TV titles like Code Geass R2 and Ga-Rei: Zero that aired that year. Action scenes normally make use of reused frames and speed stripes as shortcuts, making them not so impressive despite the unique abilities that several characters in this series have.Overall, Yozakura Quartet is a somewhat solid series that does flesh out the members of the consultation agency enough where you know of their characters and backgrounds and has an engaging second half coming from the group\'s efforts to thwart Enjun\'s plans. However, the series does suffer in that it doesn\'t bother to flesh out some major aspects to its plot and the questionable relevance of some characters even being in the series. It\'s not a masterpiece by any means, but still worth a look if you\'re looking for something that can be quickly breezed through. the way of intrigue or tension beyond hints of Enjun\'s incoming arrival as they are mostly light-hearted and sort of follow a slice-of-life style plot.The second half of the series is where things pick up in Yozakura\'s storytelling when Enjun makes his presence felt on the town and the effects of his actions effect the populace.

Maybe if I had not read the original manga beforehand, I may have reviewed this more favorably, but alas that is not the case. I was mildly excited to find out that there was an anime of this series, but was apprehensive since most anime adaptations are mediocre. I decided to drop this series 75% through the first episode, cringing at the first 10 minutes where they basically spoon feed you plot elements that took several chapters to flesh out in the source material. Throughout the episode, more...and more liberties come to fruition, and the cherry on top was a certain undead youkai's sudden hatred for humans. My suggestion is that if you're new to the series, start off with the anime, then move on to the manga; or just start with the manga and skip the anime altogether. and more liberties come to fruition, and the cherry on top was a certain undead youkai's sudden hatred for humans.

And then there's this anime: Yozakura quartet. A show with so many potential and it all went down the drain. Let me explain why this show was such a waste of time.First, the plot. There are plot holes EVERYWHERE! From the first episode, we are only introduced to the city, not the characters. So from the first episode alone, I was left utterly confused. It just got worse as the episodes go on. There were literally plot holes in every scene, leaving me with nothing to work on. I loved the manga, but this adaptation...just killed me.Don't even get me started on the characters. It wasn't enough that they weren't introduced in the earlier episodes. No, they had to be downright useless! Instead of doing something that should've resolved the conflict, they only made it worse by not resolving it sooner! My hatred for the main characters only made me want to cheer for the bad guy.And worst of all, the BGM. It did not blend well with the atmosphere of the series. For a show which deals with japanese folklore, English songs aren't the best choice. And I'm very specific when it comes to music. This is possibly the worst BGM to be used for this series.To sum it all up, it wasn't enjoyable. Not one bit. To be honest, I only watched it for the sake of finishing it.

I may sound negative but its true. But if your looking for a temporary enjoyment then this show is good for you. This is one of my favorite anime and that is due to complete Bias-ness. Personally I can't find anything special about the anime except that it contains one of my top coolest scenes. I will be biased and reasonable at the same time in this review.My...#1 reason why I like this anime is Akina. Akina at first look can be considered as a generic protagonist. But one thing that most people fail to notice is that Hime is the Main protagonist of the anime/ or atleast share the spot with Akina. You see the story may look like as it revolves with Akina in the anime but what is actually happening here is that everything about Akina also revolves around Hime, or you could almost say that Akina's story revolves around Hime. No not because Hime does the fighting but because Akina's development as a character from his childhood was basically for Hime.My #2 reason for loving the anime so much is Hime ofcourse. Her character may seem annoying at first for some people. Well not for me because I don't judge characters after seeing 3 or four episodes. But Okay looking at Hime she can look irresponsible most of the times but really who is the first one to jump infront of a train when its about to hit the city. Its Hime ofcourse, she really pushes herself for other people and I find that attractive to a character. The other thing I absolutely liked about her is her relationship with Akina and how cute she is around him. Imagine a tomboyish lazy girl that blooms around her crush its too cute.The other characters was really interesting too and how the story plays around them was somewhat enjoyable in my opinion.In short this anime for me falls in my category as an Anime where you pay attention to the characters rather than the story. Its the type of anime where you won't enjoy and Like it if you don't have a favorite character that you wanna see more.(Bit of spoiler) The anime needs season 2 to be complete because it gets more interesting further in the manga and It gives more action than the anime #1 reason why I like this anime is Akina.

However the opening and ending to the episodes didn\'t really match at all just overall was not good.The main characters of this show also show to be naive in the extreme even given their position and how long they have been doing so. Many poor decisions were made with what seems to be very little punishment for the highly stupid decisions of the MCs and in the end leaves a bitter taste in the mouth as you walk away from it knowing that the show should have made an attempt at showing ""remorse"" their stupidity.Overall this show was a waste of time and I forced myself to watch half of it because it was so uninteresting. were not bad.

They live in a world full of you could say demons or monsters. Anyways the 4 members to protect their town from the bad demons and keep the good ones together in a healthy community.A very useful tactic Akina uses is a power where he uses ""tuning"" to rid of the bad youkai that cause chaos in the ir town, which helps some problems with the bad youkai.When You first start watching the anime it seems very interesting and you really want to watch more. Now the thing...is when you watch more it starts to get very boring and leaves the person bored out of their mind.

Also randomly out of know where you learn of this guy that everyone thinks is this guy named Gin, Now a thing I noticed is, why didn\'t they discuss this character earlier? They make it seem like you already know who this guy is and all of sudden its some sort of bad guy?The music is fairly decent in this anime. The opening is quite enjoyable to listen to and sort of catchy. Same for the ending.The characters seem to be quite bland and none of them seem like a character you would want to add to your favorites list. They are so much like typical characters. Either they\'re nice,friendly and cute or they are just the character thats always pissed and thinks they\'re better than everybody and it makes it quite boring.In general this anime lacked interest to me and you may only want to watch this if you absolutley have nothing to watch. is when you watch more it starts to get very boring and leaves the person bored out of their mind.

It s just a continuous never ending vicious cycle of rubbish.Animation: 6/10 its just slightly better than average nothing special.Music: 7/10 Probably the only redeeming quality of this show but then at the same time just making a passable soundtrack doesn\'t make it good or anything special, and this shows soundtrack is nothing special.and before i get to the story no offense to those who worked hard on this show but surely this is money laundering at this point because this show just payed the salaries of those who worked on it and provided absolutely zero value to the viewers who watched...basically robbery in broad daylight.The story:1/10 is the absolute worst part of this show, i saw a clip of it on Instagram where a girl with superpowers tried to save a bunch of children from a car and accidentally crushed them alive with her strength and i thought this has a kind of OPM comedy and from the Instagram post it was tagged as a comedy...but when watching the show there was nothing to laugh about (maybe except how bad it was)or even be happy about and its not the themes or the medium I\'ve gone through manga\'s like berserk, Monster, Capeta and Vagabond and watched anime like steins gate and grave of the fireflies and enjoyed all of them a lot this is just objectively a bad show.Basically if you can watch any anime no matter how bad it is then give this a try you masochist, but if you have any self respect at all for yourself and your time you would give this anime a hard pass i wasted hours of my life so you don\'t have to.

That\'s not inherently bad, but the problem is that the characters are so spineless.Yeah you could argue ""oh they\'re just kids"", well, yeah they are. However, they\'re kids given the responsibility of looking after a town, and they\'re failing. It\'s not the folly of youth,...it\'s that they just can\'t make a decision. They\'re completely crippled when it comes to making decisions.In simpler terms, they have to choose between letting 10 people die or the one person die. The metaphor says you\'d let the one die to save the ten. They\'re so paralyzed by such a decision, that all eleven of the people would be dead, and they would still have not made a decision! Then they\'d have moped around pathetically beating themself up for it.... and still not have grown from that mistake or changed.Not to mention the personality changed from the beginning to the end, it wasn\'t a character growth mind you, it was like the author just forgot the character\'s original personality and inserted a new one. it\'s that they just can\'t make a decision.

One of the characters is mean to the dog, downright abusive, the dog is turned evil by the villian, and then they kill the dog! No real remorse, just felt like it was treated like a ""monster of the week"" but it was their pet, their mascot, I hated it. Tried to start episode 4 after that and couldn\'t. It completely turned me off. If you are an animal lover, you will absolutely dislike this anime. If you like things making sense, you\'ll dislike this anime.

Aishite Knight,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2221/Aishite_Knight,"[""Most of this series is not subbed in english, at elast not when i read them, but it is relatively easy to follow along without the subtitles. The artwork is not the best but the sounds, and music from Go-chan's band is great. The drama is typical of most Shojo anime, triangle with one girl between two best friends and, often, with more than one woman going after the one the heroine really wants.This story will make you alugha dn cry in a series of episode and wrench your heart out in the process. "", ""This was one of the first anime I have ever seen. It has introduced me to anime overall and to Okonomiyaki, therefore I feel obligated to stand up for it and promote it a little! Despite all personal involvement, I think it is heavily underrated on this platform. Yes, it is shojo, yes it has some stereotypical storyline, HOWEVER it is very well done and considering when this show aired (1983) it can be seen as some sort of trailblazer/pioneer in its segment.Story:The overall plot might not be based on the most creative idea: Yaeko, the girl next door, living alone with her...dad Shigemaru (Okonomiyaki restaurant owner) and Go, the rock singer starlet (dyed hair = evil) on the rise, meet coincidentally and eventually happen to fall in love with each other. Of course this relationship has to face several obstacles, as they're pretty different and live in completely different environments but luckily the pair is connected additionally through Go's adorable little brother Hashizo and his sidekick, Juliano the cat (who's the secret star of the show).You'll witness the life, struggles and good times of these main characters, as Go and his band Bee Hive are pursuing their career and try to become famous throughout Japan and later worldwide.Even though we all have heard of this or similar stories before, each individual episode in this anime is well thought through and entertaining. They're hardly any repetitions and I can't remember any fillers.Characters:Typical shojo, we have a heroine and her life and feelings are in focus. Yaeko is a sweet girl, helpful, loving and caring, however she's also opinionated and speaks her mind. In that sense she's not that typical shojo dummy that can't solve a problem by herself or is completely and hopelessly devoted to her man.The same goes for the rest of the characters. You'll find some stereotypical traits in all of them, however they're all very different inside and out, which keeps it interesting. There's also an antagonist and even some character development as people change their ways throughout the show, according to the experiences they make.Art:The art is ok. Nothing too amazing, however it's an old show and keeping that in mind, it's pretty forward and conform with its zeitgeist. Some people can't stand to watch these old shows for various reasons, I however find them endearing.Music:The music is the main topic in this anime and it's very well done. Seen as the whole story evolves around musicians, the creators have put a lot of effort into the fictional group Bee Hive and their songs. They're all pretty catchy and were professionally arranged for the first time and are repeatedly played during the show (paving the way for NANA and so on).Trivia:The show was incredibly popular in Europe, especially in Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Italy hyped it so much that even a live-action soap opera was modeled after its example. The actual Bee Hive group from this show was awarded with gold and platinum discs. The songs were translated in every country's individual language, which might also be a reason for its huge popularity.Overall I found it very enjoyable and worthwhile. I was lucky to be able to watch it on German TV in the early 90ies, and therefore able to watch it translated into my mother tongue. I can see that it's a downside that it doesn't seem to be fully subtitled in English :/ dad Shigemaru (Okonomiyaki restaurant owner) and Go, the rock singer starlet (dyed hair = evil) on the rise, meet coincidentally and eventually happen to fall in love with each other. Of course this relationship has to face several obstacles, as they're pretty different and live in completely different environments but luckily the pair is connected additionally through Go's adorable little brother Hashizo and his sidekick, Juliano the cat (who's the secret star of the show).You'll witness the life, struggles and good times of these main characters, as Go and his band Bee Hive are pursuing their career and try to become famous throughout Japan and later worldwide.Even though we all have heard of this or similar stories before, each individual episode in this anime is well thought through and entertaining. They're hardly any repetitions and I can't remember any fillers.Characters:Typical shojo, we have a heroine and her life and feelings are in focus. Yaeko is a sweet girl, helpful, loving and caring, however she's also opinionated and speaks her mind. In that sense she's not that typical shojo dummy that can't solve a problem by herself or is completely and hopelessly devoted to her man.The same goes for the rest of the characters. You'll find some stereotypical traits in all of them, however they're all very different inside and out, which keeps it interesting. There's also an antagonist and even some character development as people change their ways throughout the show, according to the experiences they make.Art:The art is ok. Nothing too amazing, however it's an old show and keeping that in mind, it's pretty forward and conform with its zeitgeist. Some people can't stand to watch these old shows for various reasons, I however find them endearing.Music:The music is the main topic in this anime and it's very well done. Seen as the whole story evolves around musicians, the creators have put a lot of effort into the fictional group Bee Hive and their songs. They're all pretty catchy and were professionally arranged for the first time and are repeatedly played during the show (paving the way for NANA and so on).Trivia:The show was incredibly popular in Europe, especially in Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Italy hyped it so much that even a live-action soap opera was modeled after its example. The actual Bee Hive group from this show was awarded with gold and platinum discs. The songs were translated in every country's individual language, which might also be a reason for its huge popularity.Overall I found it very enjoyable and worthwhile.

I can see that it's a downside that it doesn't seem to be fully subtitled in English :/"", ""I personally don't mind the old school art but the characters are honestly just annoying af. Everybody is contradicting themselves constantly, nobody is likeable, it's Inuyasha triangle all over again (gender bendered). The character I guess you suppose you should hate it actually the one I like. Maeko stands to her words, is loyal, dedicated and headstrong. She won't back down no matter how many people get in her way and she's the complete opposite of the MC who's weak, caring, motherly, but whimsical and irresponsible for her actions.The child is cute but overall very spoiled and selfish and just wants to couple up his...motherly replacement with his brother without thinking about their feelings even once.The male characters don't really honour the bro-code either, it feels like you're watching a soap version of Yoko Ono and the Beatles, triangle version. motherly replacement with his brother without thinking about their feelings even once.The male characters don't really honour the bro-code either, it feels like you're watching a soap version of Yoko Ono and the Beatles, triangle version.""]"

22/7,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40148/22_7,"['For some reason 22/7 has little to no negative reviews even with this relatively low MAL score so I thought I would take it upon myself to justify why it is the way it is.For one, 22/7 has a ridiculous premise. I will spoil it right here, so here we go: The reason why all 8 girls were summoned to become an idol group was because a giant Wall (yes, WALL) that an entire secret facility was build around on spit out a golden plate that said so.I want to inform anyone that might not know this, but 22/7 is a real idol group....Which decided to make a promo anime. With a magic fantasy wall that spit out the absolute order that these girls are the key to form the ideal idol group. If this isn’t a promo that shows you are a little too full of yourself, I don’t know what is.The wall’s orders are all absolute, truthful and all just work successfully every time. Meaning this series has no stakes. No stakes they might fail or any other emotional stakes because the series doesn’t bother to invest into any other element of a story.The entire show is the characters doing some idol shit, implying they are struggling, instead grotesquely succeeding because the WALL is just the baddest boss ever and giving every single member an artificially emotional and dramatic backstory for the viewers to feel for them. Because this is how we write anime.I don’t actually know if every member of this idol group has these backstories in real life, but I honestly doubt it by how anime and predictable they were.Aspects I liked about the show were the strong production values. Having Yukiko Horiguchi as character designer on your team as well as a director or episode directors that bump out several great layouts is in your favor. Though since this is not Kyoto Animation, most of the effort put into the animation falls relatively flat because this studio isn’t all too well equipped to draw the taxing character designs of Yukiko as well as the script not being tight enough to actually justify any of the creative decisions. I wouldn’t say much is off-model but some scenes look more cleaner and better polished up than others. All the characters are but only pretty character designs of specific-archetype-number X with fake emotional backstories to back them up, that are so artificially crafted most people couldn’t fall for it if they tried. Though the reviews and almost 7.0 average score are telling me that it worked for some folks for sure.I would be lying in denying that I didn’t enjoy the emotional core of episode 7, which not only striked me with its incredible storyboard layouts and fairly good plot, but I cannot say so for everything else in the show. All backstories, even the one I somewhat enjoyed, were just raw templates ripped out of the book “How to create a mediocre anime” and make no actual sense in context of the interal logic of the series. I will tell you a secret: Giving every character in your show a backstory isn’t going to make them get fleshed out or feel more authentic, especially when all the backstories are badly written and dishonest in their emotional core. The show is of one cour length, you could’ve made a competent idol anime out of what talent they already had on board by having a competent script writer just write idols be idols and fleshing them out with having to handle the struggles of the work and in their interactions with their group, but all of these aspects fall short because half of every episode has to be backstory time.And if that wasn’t the worst aspect: I don’t think some members can sing. Some sound completely tone-deaf and to that are terrible voice actors, some are a little more authentic. Overall making the idol group voice act their “character” was not a smart idea, as they mostly sound bad. Especially the performances are underwhelming. The melodies are generic and forgettable and the lyrics are self-important and pretentious. Especially the debute song is a pack off ass. Singing about “Life is so hard” – urgh, just makes me sick.So overall what makes 22/7 not great is the badly written script, artificial and bland characters but having a generally great production even if the team cannot handle it like a KyoAni would. But what made it really bad was the finale. The finale just flat out made the anime say to the viewers that they don’t care in explaining the Wall at all. The last episode was actually hilarious, I recommend watching that one at least.This anime didn’t give a fuck. For sure some of the production team did, because I consider it a good production, but the actual product is an empty husk and creatively bankrupt piece of “art” that serves exactly one point – promo for an idol group.They didn’t care to write an authentic, genuine and emotional script, they just wrote some “anime bullshit” premise and then threw in emotional backstories to sway any uneducated viewer easily.Also let the characters grow to love being an idol seemingly off-screen and make them all emotionally invested in the job right before the last order of the wall is delivered towards the end of the show, then let the plot commence and leave the show end with a “bang” – all to promote an idol group. One of the harshest industries there are. And they glorify this work in this anime as well.22/7 sucked and was among the most banal and shameless promos I have seen, while wasting some great animation talent in the same process.

Usually, we get at least 1-2 idol theme anime per season but 22/7 is also known for being a real life idol group. And make no mistake, becoming a member of the 22/7 idol group is no easy task. Because out of over 10,000 candidates, only a few are selected as being worthy. On a few are born to be an idol. Only a few has what it takes to be a member of 22/7.Idol shows are known for their promotional material and a testament of having characters...as role models. The members have strict life styles and in Japanese culture, they must abide to rules or be eliminated. Because of this, becoming part of an idol group is a celebrated feat, an accomplishment that one should be proud of. 22/7 consists of 8 characters, all with different personalities, backgrounds, and ambitions. However, they are united under the same banner, to be idols and entertain the world through music.The idol culture graces us with facts that in the entertainment world, anything can happen. Being high school students, they’re still learning to grow up and taking steps into adolescence is no easy task. The first few episodes promises to set up a storytelling saga to showcase the reality of idol life. Being managed by “The Wall”, the show is unique in that it’s not managed by a talent agency. From the first episode, we are introduced to Miu Takuigawa, an ordinary high school teenager looking for work. After having trouble earning income for her family, she decides to become a member but interestingly enough, Miu is one of the less qualified members compared to the other cast. More interestingly, Miu is initially chosen as the lead center and with that comes a huge responsibility. It doesn’t take long for her to clash with fellow idol member Nicole in the second episode. And this shouldn’t be a surprise either as the audience should easily be able to see that Nicole qualifies more as a leader than Miu. The first two episodes brings together the melodrama and reality of being in an idol group. Even within the group, they have problems so what’s to say they won’t face even bigger problems?Luckily, differences can be put aside as by the time we reach the third episode, 22/7 is in line to perform their first live concert. It doesn’t go well at first due to equipment failure but as the leader, Miu takes charge for herself and manages to save them from humiliation. In essence, her actions earns the respect of the group and the audience. And because of her committment, it’s safe to say that Miu earned her spot. But this show isn’t just about Miu. Viewers should remember that there are 7 other girls and each of them come from different backgrounds. From episode 4 and onwards, we are given insights about some of their personalities and background stories on a personal level for the remaining cast. This form of storytelling is also important as it showcase the realism of the show. There’s obvious social problems that the idols deal with including social anxiety, loneliness, self-doubt, and even the deaths of a loved one. If we look at the bigger picture, this show seems to aim to be an emotional drama than the lighthearted pop culture such as Idolmaster or Love Live. Some of my favorite episodes in this season exists because it gets you emotionally invested into the cast such as Akane, Toda, and even Ayaka. Other times, the anime aims to collectively tell stories about the group as a whole to the world. In one of the later episodes, it tests the emotional connection of the group as they become attached together like a family. The more you watch 22/7, the more you realize it’s more than just a group of idols existing together to perform on stage. It’s about living a life to fulfill dreams and overcoming life obstacles that didn’t seem possible.From the theatrical performances to the character designs, A-1 Pictures adapted this anime like a play. The characters are the actors, or idols in this case, but always portrayed as realistic as possible. They are humans after all and even transcending into the idol realm doesn’t immortalize them as Gods. But as 22/7 grows more in popularity, you can see how the group improves themselves with better dance coordination, singing tunes, and even their stage outfits. On the technical level, the animated music videos themselves uses CGI with some 3D choreography. Now, before you throw the towel, I do want to say this show managed to animate itself rather well. The dance movements look sharp and chereography has coordination while not being overly reliant on the animation itself. It may take time to get used to but as it stands, 22/7’s CGI works wonders.Now, the big question remains. How should the music be judged? As “idols who cross dimensions”, the seiyu in this show had to undergo through lengthy process of being selected so rest assured that the music you hear is top tier quality. It relies a lot on conveying emotions and communicating the idols’ emotions to the audience. Sony Music Records bought top tier talent together to compose their discography. The most noticeable one is perhaps the OP theme song, “MuzuI” performed by Uta Kawase. Also distinguishable is the fact that almost every episode contains a different ED theme, most often featuring the prominent character related to that episode. Insert songs are also occasionally used in episodes during climatic moments.There’s a good chance people missed out on this show this year. It’s a niche anime targeted to the music demographic but from what’s shown, 22/7 itself went above expectations to be more than just idols performing on stage. The amount of melancholy is above the general consensus and in retrospect, it reinvents itself as a music drama. Spread the word and let it be known that 22/7 is a rewarding experience. as role models. The members have strict life styles and in Japanese culture, they must abide to rules or be eliminated.

That is the title of the anime...sounds like a mathematical thing. However, what is behind this mysterious number? This numerical value certainly seems familiar to one or the other in relation to π (Pi), but mathematics does not play a major role here.22/7 or ""Nanabun no Nijūni"" is an idol group that was formed in late 2016. The group itself consists of eleven members (2 + 2 + 7 = 11), eight of them appear here in the main anime (the other three will appear in the OVA, 13th episode).STORY:With no idea in mind, our eight girls receive a mysterious letter that does not...tell anything beside to meet in a zoo. From that point on, we get to know that they are the chosen ones to start a new idol group. Despite the different starting skills in singing and dancing, which is the most important thing for idols, they work together to improve their skills and knowledge. A deep friendship arises, together they manage to overcome hurdles and support each other.In the 21st century, AI (Artificial intelligence) is already an important part in our daily life. So is it possible to analyze everything and calculate even the perfect idol flow? Since all-important information (center position, performance times, etc.) is given by a mysterious ""wall"" from the headquarter and must be followed absolutely, this could be an indication of such an AI.However, we are humans and not machines, we know sadness, we know what makes us happy, me know the feeling of losing important things. Do we really have to do everything the AI suggests? Our girls also face this hurdle, because the AI demands many things that cannot be understood by humans.CHARACTERS:The first three episodes are focusing on the center member Miu. She is a very shy girl and had little confidence in the whole idol thing at the beginning. She did not want to become an idol even. We get to know her background situation in detail.Nevertheless, all eight members will already be seen in the first episode. After the first three episode, we will learn more and more about each girl. The background stories of them are very touching, some are also very sad. Instead of thinking negatively, they want to transmit new positive energy to people with their songs. All of the girls had a different past, but fate (and AI) brought them together as a unit. Together they spread the happiness among the people and can solve all problems! The harmony between them is definitely there.ART:The animations are a little different from their music videos, which were produced before the anime. It is definitely smoother and better now. The girls are portrayed sweetly, as it is often the case in idol anime.SOUND:One of the most important thing for a good idol anime in my opinion. Although the group has released only four singles yet, it is fun to hear their songs, idol music to brighten up your day. The entire 22/7 group also sing OP and ED. Each character will have their own unique ending song during the anime also. Idol music should spread a good mood and joy among its fans and listeners, their songs certainly succeeded in that way.ENJOYMENT:I was looking forward every Saturday for a new episode of 22/7. I really like the new idea of 22/7 that differs from e.g. Love Live! or Re: Stage Dream Days. The ""AI wall"" is certainly an interesting thing that is not known from other idol anime. It reflects the power of AI nowadays.Besides that new idea, I really enjoyed the characters. We learn a lot about them and as a result they grow close to our hearts. The support of each other in difficult situations is really very touching. You can feel the love between them.For idol fans (like myself), 22/7 is definitely a recommendation. You will have cute girls, good music and an unique story line.(Looking forward for the OVA and hopefully a second season already!) tell anything beside to meet in a zoo.

I find it quite unique that the idols themselves are voicing the characters, it's a really nice touch. I really like Miu's voice overall, while it was strange at first, it felt different than normal anime voices you here. So a plus there.Speaking of Miu, she's quite the character. She reminds me a lot of Megumi from Food Wars. Got talent, just needs confidence brought into her.

It's true that I was skeptical for the first two episodes, but by episode 3 I was hooked.The first episode had me questioning what was actually going on, as there was so much to think about concerning that wall, or as I like to call it, The magic Conch. I couldn't tell you if episode 1 was good at all though, i couldn't rate the series from it's first episode alone, and I still find myself unable to rate the first episode.Around episode 3, the series gives the hook, with strong character writing, directing,...and animation. Episode 7 had found a way to animate someone crying so well that I myself started crying, it was that good.The directing of the series is on point, and feels very impactful, doing things like using a cherry blossom tree dying in tandem with a backstory character dying. The series is kind of predictable, but that's not a bad thing in my opinion, it's how it's executed that matters most, and the execution is amazing.PRAISE THE MAGIC CONCH! and animation.

that this would be a new kind of revolucionary idol anime, but oh i was totally wrong, 22/7 tell us the story of Miu takigawa, a shy and socially awkward girl, one day she receives one mysterious letter from a corporation call G.I Productions; the letter says that they are offering her to be an idol, miu take that letter as a Joke, and she just continue with her life, but eventually some circunstances like she getting fired, and the urgent need of money make her take the decision to actually go to the place where the mysterious letter tell her...to go, there she will meet with other girls and thats basically all.Story 4/10Lets start with the story, its bad, initially the episode 1 was nice it show us that maybe 22/7 will be an interesting idol anime but it wasnt, lets start talking about the Wall, the wall is a Wall that send orders to the corporation that make the girls of the group form 22/7 but that its it just sends orders, and also YOU CANT DISOBEY THE WALL, thats what that the ""mananger"" says to the idols, but what are the consecuences what is the wall, why you cant disobey it, THEY NEVER TELL US THAT , is just bad, its like the creators of the series didnt even try to make a history, they just make the wall to avoid making history, what i mean is that  the plot is ""empty"" the idols dont even have to try because theres a corporation that come out of nowhere to turn them into idols, and they even dont have to take hard decisions because the all mighty wall tell them what to do.Eventually with the past of the episodes i visualize what would happen in the next episodes, they just will show us the sad past of all the idols and the progress in their carreers but without obstacles because the all mighty wall and the corporations is there.Art 3/10Well the art was good, the colors match up well BUT, that CGI hurt my eyes, the CGI was ugly.Sound  8/10I mean its an idol anime, the songs were good i personally think it was the best thing about the anime, the songs arent masterpieces but they are good, also i apreciate the fact that they made or put a different song for each episode ending, i especially enjoy the episode 3 ending song.Character 3/10All the girls except for miu the protagonist have the most cliche personalities, im not a professional in idol animes i have barely seen 5 idol animes but I can compare all of the girls\' personalities (not worth mentioning their names) with any other personality from any other idol anime (that i have seen), maybe I haven\'t seen 100 idol anime but the personalities clearly are not something to stand out from 22 / 7.And talking about other character that arent the idols the mananger is another blank character same as the most part of the characters in this show.Enjoyment 3/10As i say before im pretty dissapointed with this anime, some things were good at the beginning but in the episode 3 the show start going completly shitty, with the plot of the wall and the corporation with the past of the girls the could make a incredible story, just imagine a psychological drama, The girls and their ""sad stories"" and what being an idol means to them, like the fight between Nicole and Miu because the wall want the shy miu in the middle of the dance and Nicole dream to be an idol, the creators could make a better plot for the wall beyond being an excuse for making a better plot.At least the songs were kinda good.Overall 3/1022/7 Start with a good episode one showing more drama than idols and that was actually good but start turning bad until the show end up being a non memorable and cliche idol anime.My final conclusion is that the only thing 22/7 had to do was follow an unexplored plot that has not been seen before in any idol anime.22/7 (at least in my case) failed on doing the most important thing, making me feel the drama and making me feel empathy with the sad past of the group members.And Yes i know that the anime is based on a real idol group.

real idol group.', ""(Contains spoilers in order to contextualize the review)22/7's anime tries to be many things at once and somehow fails at all of them, leaving the viewers with a frustating and pointless experience. For long time 22/7 fans, it almost feels like a joke.I've been following 22/7 since the characters were but designs created by various artists. Next to each design, there were also small descriptions of how each girl was like - Sakura's, for example, mentioned a 'dark past'. Knowing that Akimoto-P was behind the project, any idol fan would keep their eyes open for where 22/7 would go next.As a real life idol group,...they're great. Their songs are catchy and the relationship between the members is enjoyable to read and watch about in their lives, video clips, and their youtube channels. They're in no way industry professionals, however. Comparing their voice acting from the first to the last song, you can see how they've improved. There are documentaries and interviews you can read to take a peek into how the group works. These improvements were fought for by each of the girls, from their hard work as a group.So, we can conclude that 22/7 is a group with plenty of struggles in real life. What did the anime project do with these struggles? Did they show how one seiyuu had difficulty keeping up with the dances, or how one had to turn their life around in a new country? Would they adapt the character descriptions into interesting and relatable storylines?No. No, they didn't. Instead, they made this... bizarre animation that doesn't know what it wants. Is it an anime about the idol industry? Is it about how the group came together? Or is it about each of the members' pasts? I don't think anybody knows.22/7 throws these subjects at you with little rhyme or reason, and expects you to get engaged with it. One moment, we see a baby girl almost dying. Then, SWIMSUIT SCENE! Oops, wait, the girl actually hates the swimsuit and this sexualization is really harmful - haha just kidding, look at how close the members are! The end!Seriously. That's basically how Reika's episode went.None of the plotlines above ever really went anywhere - they get dropped in and out like hot potatoes, then the episode ends. Add that with baffling logic, (WHY WOULD YOU MAKE JUN TAKE CARE OF *EVERYONE'S* SCHEDULES INSTEAD OF RESCHEDULING THEM? WHY? NO REAL LIFE GROUP DOES THIS!) meh animation with many shortcuts taken thanks to a clearly small budget, and a lack of any stakes at all in the plot - that's 22/7. A big blend of many things.The absolute joke - especially for long time 22/7 fans - lies in that last point. The plot has no stakes at all in it. We don't see the girls (other than Miu in her centric episode) struggle with idol stuff. In the second episode, they hold an audition. Wouldn't that be the perfect time to show each member's strengths and weaknesses? Sure, we know Nicole is perfect and Miu has no confidence, but what about Sakura? Does she have trouble with the dancing? What is Akane good at? What were the good and bad points in Reika's audition?None of that matters. Their struggles and hard work don't matter. Everything is decided by the Wall, and it is always right. They don't have any trouble in securing fans and getting a spot in a magazine. Everyone just loves them. Everyone talks about them. All they have to do is follow the Wall. It's bordeline offensive for a group that barely broke 6,000 units sold in their first single. What was the message the writers were trying to sell here?!Even in AKB0048 there were stakes and struggles - the girls had rivals, senpais, they had their weaknesses and strengths - and they had a character that was very similiar to the wall! Love Live had each girl fight their personal issues and come together to save the place they loved, they had rivals and competitions. Heck, even Wake Up Girls had the members struggle with getting recognized and getting fans!22/7 failed to be an interesting idol anime, it failed to be even fanservice to hardcore fans. It didn't know what it wanted to be, and these flaws are so apparent it's hard to take the serious and emotional scenes seriously. It's a shame that a group that I enjoy and support so much ended up with this mashed mess of an animation to its name.Do yourself a favor and skip this one if you don't know the group - go watch the interviews, the lives, and the MVs. Listen to the songs. Don't waste your time with this anime. they're great.

Listen to the songs. Don't waste your time with this anime."", ""Real time: I've never been a fan of idols, both the Western kind or Japan's versions of them. The same goes for idol-based anime, mostly because many of them tend to be formulaic or of poor quality. There have been some good ones, but I've seen very few of them. Honestly, the only idol anime I can say that I really love is Fancy Lala, and even that's stretching it, as Fancy Lala's focus isn't really on being an idol. I haven't seen either The IdolM@ster nor Wake Up Girls (I do plan to see the former later on), AKB0048 was fun and ambitious though...kind of stupid at times, I've heard great things about Skip Beat and ZombieLand Saga, but again, haven't seen them. I like Aikatsu well enough, though it is a show aimed at children and is much more on the silly, idealistic side of things, and anyone who's talked to me at all knows I'm not touching Love Live with a ten foot pole, mostly because of the fact that it plays sexual harassment for comedy, and that absolutely does not sit right with me. I wasn't intending on watching the newest idol anime, 22/7, but reading someone's review of the first episode had me intrigued, because it had a main character who was very cynical and bitter, far from your typical idol anime protagonist, and it had an interesting, if stupid premise. I know nothing of the actual real life idol group 22/7, so the review will solely focus on the anime. To be honest, the first episode did win me over, and I was really hoping this would be good. And it tried. It really tried...but it fell flat on its face. Big time.So what's the story? It begins with a girl named Miu who finds a mysterious letter in her mail. She and seven other girls are made to gather at a zoo, and a man named Gouda takes them down to an underground facility. There, they find out that they've all been recruited to start an idol group called 22/7, and everything they do is going to be dictated by a magical, sentient wall that spits orders on brass plates. In order to be successful, they have to follow the wall's orders to the letter. Understandably, many of the girls don't know what's going on and are opposed to it, Miu especially, as she's not too keen on the idea of being used to fulfill someone else's whims, wall or no. But then she gets fired from her job, and has no source of income. Reluctantly, she and the other girls return to the facility and decide to become the idol group 22/7, though they still have no idea what the wall even is or why they have to do everything it tells them to do.Yeah. The idea of a sentient wall dictating an entire idol group is pretty hilarious in how stupid it sounds, and it's inspired many a joke since the anime's premiere. But if you ignore that, the anime promised to be a more cynical, realistic look at the idol business, not unlike Wake Up Girls. And for the first four or so episodes, the anime seemed to hit the ground running. It has smooth, stunning animation, though not without the occasional glaring CGI, great music, Miu is a great, refreshing protagonist who actually had flaws she needed to overcome, and the anime seemed to actually care about characterization rather than making the girls into one note moe archetypes. In all honesty, 22/7 could have really been something great, and it promised to try and stand out from the sea of bad idol anime. So what went wrong? Why the low rating? Well...a lot of things.First off, for an anime about a group of idol singers, it doesn't really highlight a lot of things that are important to showing the girls becoming idols. We never see them take dance lessons or record songs in a recording booth, other than, like, one single scene and that's it. We rarely, if ever, see them actually putting in effort or learning about the ins and outs of the idol industry, and those things are really important if you want to show these girls growing as both individuals and as a group. Say what you will about Aikatsu, but it at least showed the girls taking the time to practice, train, and go deep into the business practices that make idols what they are. Even Fancy Lala didn't simply gloss over these important details, as it knew they were really important if it wanted to show how the idol industry worked. There's only one scene in episode 3 where the girls are having their first concert and have to deal with bad audio equipment, but it gets resolved right away and leaves no impact whatsoever. For what its worth, the actual soundtrack is good, and the songs are well sung, but I only have one issue with the opening theme: It seems to just cut off at the end, like it didn't have time to really wrap up before the show was set to start.The second main problem is the series' overall structure. Every episode has two parts to it, with one half taking place in the present, showing the girls' activities, and the other half consisting of flashbacks to the girls' backstories, showing how they got to be where they are. But this can be a double edged sword, and without the right balance, this can really make or break a show, and not only does 22/7 suffer from this, its way of inserting flashbacks in their episodes results in a weird tonal whiplash. For example, episode 6 begins with Reika, as a baby, nearly dying of some unknown illness, with her mother doing so later, and the next scene? Bam! Girls at the beach in their swimsuits! Can you see how jarring that type of transition can be? 22/7 can be at its best when it actually puts effort into tying the girls' pasts to current events (Sakura's episode being one such example), but at its worst when it's unable to find that balance (Again, Reika's episode). Because of the way the episodes are made, the show tends to gloss over things that are important while putting too much focus on things that don't really mean much in the big picture. For example, various episodes imply that Sakura returning to America is going to be important, but nothing ever comes out of it, and that plot thread is never resolved.If I could use one word to describe 22/7 in a nutshell, it'd be...contradictory. The writing for this show is really inconsistent and it's like the writers don't really know what they want to do with their characters most of the time, Nicole being an example in that early on, she's established as a haughty, bitchy character, but she's occasionally nice to the girls, and just seems to flip-flop between the two personalities without a real reason for being either one. Not even her focus episode sheds any light on why she's so needlessly mean to the other girls. Some characters are better than others, with Miu being the standout example. In my opinion, I feel she's the best character. Both her backstory and personality are down to earth, and she's such a refreshing change from the happy, optimistic idol series mains who want to be idols, though I will admit, her low pitched voice really isn't going to win her any Oscars. But again, as the show loses steam halfway through its run, Miu's original personality seems to disappear until the very end. Ayaka is pretty much a non-entity as a character and her reasons for being an idol are...really stupid and dumb, and poor Reika really got the shaft, because her episode was not only poorly written and endorsed a bad message (Reika doesn't want to wear a skimpy swimsuit for a photo shoot because she doesn't want to be a teenage sex object, which would normally be valid and understandable? Too bad! Get in the bikini, Reika!), but was really sexist. Jun's episode wasn't much better: What do you do when all your idols save for one get sick from food poisoning? Instead of postponing their jobs and waiting a day for everyone to be back to normal, let's completely overwork a 15-year-old girl by having her do a crap ton of jobs, even the ones her idol friends were supposed to do, over the course of an entire day!Which then leads me to the show's biggest problem: The characters as individuals are fine, though kind of bland, but since we never really get to watch them evolve and grow as a group, any pathos that comes from events such as breaking up doesn't feel earned in spite of the show's attempts to milk as much drama as possible. We never really see them truly come together as a group despite the show's attempts at telling us that they're awesome as a group, because, you know, we never see them doing stuff like dance lessons or recording songs or actually working together. Basically, the show is paying lip service to the idea of developing them as a group. I think the show might have done better had it just focused on Miu and cut down the flashbacks in favor of putting more time into having the girls learn to function as a group, like the show tries to advertise. Finally, we don't learn much about the wall, and even at the end, what the hell it even is is never really resolved, making it yet another plot thread that's been abandoned for the sake of idol flashiness.It's a shame that 22/7 turned out this way, as I really wanted to like this show. The first three episodes were great, but after that, it loses steam quickly and just ends on a whimper, too caught up in its own hubris to really attempt something meaningful. Then again, this is another commerical for a famous idol group, so I guess it turning out the way it did was inevitable. I mean, I'll still watch this over Love Live (Except episode 6. Screw that episode in the eye), but it's an idol show that tried, and failed, to stand out from the oversaturated genre, and just didn't deliver. kind of stupid at times, I've heard great things about Skip Beat and ZombieLand Saga, but again, haven't seen them. I like Aikatsu well enough, though it is a show aimed at children and is much more on the silly, idealistic side of things, and anyone who's talked to me at all knows I'm not touching Love Live with a ten foot pole, mostly because of the fact that it plays sexual harassment for comedy, and that absolutely does not sit right with me.

For what its worth, the actual soundtrack is good, and the songs are well sung, but I only have one issue with the opening theme: It seems to just cut off at the end, like it didn't have time to really wrap up before the show was set to start.The second main problem is the series' overall structure. Every episode has two parts to it, with one half taking place in the present, showing the girls' activities, and the other half consisting of flashbacks to the girls' backstories, showing how they got to be where they are. But this can be a double edged sword, and without the right balance, this can really make or break a show, and not only does 22/7 suffer from this, its way of inserting flashbacks in their episodes results in a weird tonal whiplash. For example, episode 6 begins with Reika, as a baby, nearly dying of some unknown illness, with her mother doing so later, and the next scene? Bam! Girls at the beach in their swimsuits! Can you see how jarring that type of transition can be? 22/7 can be at its best when it actually puts effort into tying the girls' pasts to current events (Sakura's episode being one such example), but at its worst when it's unable to find that balance (Again, Reika's episode). Because of the way the episodes are made, the show tends to gloss over things that are important while putting too much focus on things that don't really mean much in the big picture. For example, various episodes imply that Sakura returning to America is going to be important, but nothing ever comes out of it, and that plot thread is never resolved.If I could use one word to describe 22/7 in a nutshell, it'd be...contradictory. The writing for this show is really inconsistent and it's like the writers don't really know what they want to do with their characters most of the time, Nicole being an example in that early on, she's established as a haughty, bitchy character, but she's occasionally nice to the girls, and just seems to flip-flop between the two personalities without a real reason for being either one. Not even her focus episode sheds any light on why she's so needlessly mean to the other girls. Some characters are better than others, with Miu being the standout example. In my opinion, I feel she's the best character. Both her backstory and personality are down to earth, and she's such a refreshing change from the happy, optimistic idol series mains who want to be idols, though I will admit, her low pitched voice really isn't going to win her any Oscars. But again, as the show loses steam halfway through its run, Miu's original personality seems to disappear until the very end. Ayaka is pretty much a non-entity as a character and her reasons for being an idol are...really stupid and dumb, and poor Reika really got the shaft, because her episode was not only poorly written and endorsed a bad message (Reika doesn't want to wear a skimpy swimsuit for a photo shoot because she doesn't want to be a teenage sex object, which would normally be valid and understandable? Too bad! Get in the bikini, Reika!), but was really sexist. Jun's episode wasn't much better: What do you do when all your idols save for one get sick from food poisoning? Instead of postponing their jobs and waiting a day for everyone to be back to normal, let's completely overwork a 15-year-old girl by having her do a crap ton of jobs, even the ones her idol friends were supposed to do, over the course of an entire day!Which then leads me to the show's biggest problem: The characters as individuals are fine, though kind of bland, but since we never really get to watch them evolve and grow as a group, any pathos that comes from events such as breaking up doesn't feel earned in spite of the show's attempts to milk as much drama as possible. We never really see them truly come together as a group despite the show's attempts at telling us that they're awesome as a group, because, you know, we never see them doing stuff like dance lessons or recording songs or actually working together. Basically, the show is paying lip service to the idea of developing them as a group. I think the show might have done better had it just focused on Miu and cut down the flashbacks in favor of putting more time into having the girls learn to function as a group, like the show tries to advertise. Finally, we don't learn much about the wall, and even at the end, what the hell it even is is never really resolved, making it yet another plot thread that's been abandoned for the sake of idol flashiness.It's a shame that 22/7 turned out this way, as I really wanted to like this show. The first three episodes were great, but after that, it loses steam quickly and just ends on a whimper, too caught up in its own hubris to really attempt something meaningful. Then again, this is another commerical for a famous idol group, so I guess it turning out the way it did was inevitable. I mean, I'll still watch this over Love Live (Except episode 6. Screw that episode in the eye), but it's an idol show that tried, and failed, to stand out from the oversaturated genre, and just didn't deliver."", 'After years of waiting and several OVAs, finally 22/7 fans got what we’d been wanting, a well done anime.22/7 is based on the 22/7 multimedia project which was started about 4 years ago. The anime follows the origins of the group and their first year or so together. Unlike traditional idol shows that I’ve seen, 22/7 takes a grittier and dare I say it, darker approach to the idol genre.From the get go, we see it’s not all rainbows and sunshines in this world. This just feels pretty real. The colour palette even reflects it, opting for more muted shades and tones. This...isn’t edge for the sake of edge, however. The reasons for this are all well explained and the issues each of the girls have are all given their own episodes to be explored.The series is very much character driven as you would expect from an idol anime. Every episode essentially deals with one of the girls’ backstory and gives them necessary characterisation and development. From bullying, to the deaths of family members, every girl has been through some realistic rough periods and holding baggage from that. By the end of each episode, you’ll have come to appreciate a new girl and understand why they’re the way they are.As for the technical aspects of the show, A-1 employed the same character designer from K-on and several other Kyoani series to do the character designs for 22/7. If you’re a fan of that art style, you’ll love the art here. The show features a darker colour palette which I believe serves the tone well. The Voice Acting is absolutely phenomenal and consistently does a great job of making every girl feel alive. As with any idol show, the OST is mainly songs from the group themselves and are all very enjoyable.22/7 is my favourite idol group and the show has gone on to become my fave idol show. It was a blast to see these girls come to life with a cool story, good voice acting and great direction. I certainly believe the low ratings are harsh and unearned. If you’re a fan of idol shows, which many in the west are not, give it a try. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.22/7 gets 8 letters out of 10 from me. isn’t edge for the sake of edge, however.

I liked the story because it\'s very mysterious and different than the other idol animes like ""Love live"" I always keep thinking what will the next order will be. The Wall never seems to let me down with it\'s orders sometimes the orders are hard and sometimes it\'s confusing but the girls always seems to do it...since nothing is impossible right?The title of the anime is 22/7 which is also mysterious It\'s like the AI used PI as it\'s general calculation to evaluate how will the girls be famous cause at the beginning of the anime it looked like the girls were choosen randomly but they were not it\'s amazing how the Wall chosed the girls.Art:I mean ofcourse it\'s coming from A1 pictures the sutdio that produced ""Sword art online, Violet Evergarden, Your lie in april""Sound:idk what to say about sound nothing related tio sound seems to bother me so just give it a 9.Character:The girls are cute and had different personalities from kuuderes to deredere\'s  they had such sad Story from back when they were kids those memories are what builds them after all, each episode will reveal the secret life of the girls one by one so far ""Jun toda"" was the saddest.Enjoyment:Did I enjoy? Yes. Ever felt bored? No. Anything that might make you want to drop the anime? Probably because it\'s an idol but I stayed because of the cute girls and the Wall\'s orders but still because it\'s an idol anime you get to feel the hardships of the girls and how hard it was to become an idol.Overall:I do recommend u to watch it if like a new way to watch an Idol anime. since nothing is impossible right?The title of the anime is 22/7 which is also mysterious It\'s like the AI used PI as it\'s general calculation to evaluate how will the girls be famous cause at the beginning of the anime it looked like the girls were choosen randomly but they were not it\'s amazing how the Wall chosed the girls.Art:I mean ofcourse it\'s coming from A1 pictures the sutdio that produced ""Sword art online, Violet Evergarden, Your lie in april""Sound:idk what to say about sound nothing related tio sound seems to bother me so just give it a 9.Character:The girls are cute and had different personalities from kuuderes to deredere\'s  they had such sad Story from back when they were kids those memories are what builds them after all, each episode will reveal the secret life of the girls one by one so far ""Jun toda"" was the saddest.Enjoyment:Did I enjoy?

Is this another Idol-based Anime?Yes and no... this is one of the titles that's shamelessly going to be overlooked because idol Anime might have a stigma that they are all the same. It's just young girls acting cute in from of the stage, isn't it?Well, the difference between this show and perhaps many, is that this show takes a somber route. We start off the show being introduced to Miyu. Miyu isn't the most social person possible and she doesn't have a positive outlook to the adult world. She gets given an invitation to join in to become an idol with several...girls that have been called in to become the unit known as, 22/7.At first, she wasn't very motivated because she already had the job to support her family but eventually, she gets laid off and decided to join in the group. Her story is very relatable.Throughout the duration of the series, we start to look into the other members' backstories and one is heartbreaking and heart-wrenching than the other. It shows the pain that everyone of the girls have  went through before joining in the idol group. There are so many tear-jerking moments and once they start singing together, you can sense the tears of joy from inside. These girls feel like human and it could happen to anyone around. They all come across extremely likable through what they went through.One thing that I also enjoyed about this Anime is the music. The music does play a bit part of the show from the intro, that is beautifully somber, and every ending, starting from episode 4, has its own song and theme related to that character's backstory that we've been through. That makes every character shine and stick with you in your mind. They make everyone really important and not just the main character and even though, she's still my favorite out of the eight ladies.This show went from a 7 to a solid 9 because the last episode, it brought a shine to everyone and honestly, it almost made me tear up from this journey. I do recommend this title if you enjoy idol shows with a bittersweet/somber mood to it. girls that have been called in to become the unit known as, 22/7.At first, she wasn't very motivated because she already had the job to support her family but eventually, she gets laid off and decided to join in the group.

They are described as “idols who transcend dimensions” meaning that they exist in more than one dimension, yes, they exist in 3-D and in 2-D and in 3-D (animated and motion-captured). But it gets tricky because the series is fictionalized but the idol group isn’t. The voice actors are actual idols from the actual idol-group 22/7, hence the voice acting is horrendous, but the characters they play are utterly and completely fiction. So really what transcends dimensions is the name 22/7.22/7 is an anime about random girls who were chosen randomly for the...purpose of being idols. They met their manager who does everything in his power to make the girls successful by following the commands of the wall; a mysterious entity of nebulous origin that gives orders via a credit card shaped and sized metal card. You might be forgiven if you think that this is perhaps a genre deconstruction or a dark retelling of the idol anime genre. All the signs pointed to it: the ominous wall, a mysterious company that built the wall, the manner in which the group was formed. But the creators had a different idea.What we got instead was a good and enjoyable show. Sure I was disappointed no one died (I was hoping this was like Madoka Magica but with idols) but I was happy with the end result.The show wasn’t concerned about the idol business but was about the characters themselves. The show focused on almost entirely on the idols and their determination or lack thereof to be an idol and how being an idol influenced their lives. How the idol industry was portrayed was interesting. Being a real-life idol group, they had to show us the positives of the idol industry but the negatives weren’t completely avoided. This was refreshing because we know it’s not all cute uniforms and rainbows; even though they didn’t get into it as much as I let on (it was a couple of lines in one of the episodes).What surprised me was how relatable the characters were. They weren’t as ‘larger than life’ as you would expect idols to be, ‘Down to earth’ would be more appropriate. This was the secret spice.Another surprise was the lack of chemistry. Sure the group had their own cheer and whatnot not but they never seemed to mesh. That is due to two things. Bad Voice acting and the character arcs. You can’t expect us to believe they are friends if they don’t sound like it. The character arcs were good don’t get me wrong. They were entertaining, the stories were engaging but the problems the characters had they solved themselves. This isn’t bad in itself but the sense of unity was lost.I see this show as an experiment and maybe a cash grab. Idols were popular and so were anime idols so Yasushi got the idea to create an idol group that transcends dimensions. It wasn’t a bad idea and I would call it a success. The anime was actually good, enjoyable and might send me into a rabbit hole I have been avoiding these last couple of years, I might start watching Idol anime. purpose of being idols.

Still a bit forgettable, but not a waste of time.So this is a 5, but a good 5. Simply put, I'm not too much of a fan of Idol stuff. Even Zombieland Saga barely got a 7 for me, and I'd imagine that's a top tier Idol anime- although I don't know for sure because I haven't watched more than like 3.Tips and guidelines says don't include story summaries, but it is important to point out the key point of this idol anime. It doesn't focus at all on the dancing or singing. Instead it focuses on...the life of someone who is an idol, and that if very interesting. It is interesting seeing the things an idol group me go through on a day to day basis on how to be successful. Being told what to do and to follow directions.The other key point is that almost each episode is catered to a member's pass. Jun having the best episode and story in episode 7, though none of the others really compare to her. Her episode was truly great. It definitely stood out, and I do think it was a turning point to the anime as the story did get somewhat better. The final two episodes were also fine.It just doesn't really stand it. It does feel a bit stale, certainly doesnt make me want to seek out the real idol group. It could have done a better job building the relationship between the members, their hardships, and how they were overcame.I enjoyed this because it gave a perspective to idols I may have never cared for. The background stuff that the public doesn't always see. There's no real drama, but just a certain members difficulty in life and trying to be a better person. Being an idol is not easy, and this anime showcases that.However, like I said before, it doesnt make me want to watch it again.

Despite these issues I really liked how 22/7 focuses more on the characters and their side stories with every episode focusing on one of the group with their background and personality impacting their particular episode which was excellent and was one of the highlights of my experience with 22/7.Art 6/10The actual art here was pretty good for the most part however some of the CG animation looked noticeably janky when the group were performing.Sound 8/10As an idol show the music has to be excellent and I thought that it was with all the songs being the sort of enjoyable J-Pop Idol music that you would expect. The sound and voice acting was also good for the most part.Characters 8/10I did really like the characters here they are all different people with different personalities and the way they come together and help each other through the issues that they face is excellent I also liked the character development through focusing on each of the characters and their back stories on each episode.My personal favorite character was the center of the group Miu Takagawa she is a quiet girl who has a distrust for adults and doesn’t feel comfortable communicating with others this obviously makes it difficult for her to become an Idol something she has never wanted to be but she has also just lost her job and cares deeply for her mother and sister this love for her family leads to her showing her great determination when asked to join 22/7.Enjoyment 8/10I had a lot of fun here it mixes good music which likable characters and is very easy to watch.Overall 7/10 the modern world and idol culture which I can understand but personally I felt this hampered the story in some of the final episodes.

Regardless of art and music by the AKB48 man himself Yasushi Akimoto because its not even that interesting since its the same idol formula, the worst worst absolute worst thing here is the voice acting.You are fortunate to have 6/8 of these idols to have decent voice acting and sound acting,...but the protagonist Miu and her pissy rival who finds Miu's ideology annoying are absolutely appalling. Miu's voice is, I don't even know how to describe it: destroys any mood or joy you feel for her show. Not to mention her depressed teen angst who hates the world is really over-the-top annoying, and she is genuinely the first character from my entire life of watching anime where I've actually felt that whatever I'm listening is not a match with the lip/mouth animations. BECAUSE THE VOICE IS SO UNAPPEALING. Like idc what Miu's gender identity is supposed to be, I've heard deep voiced manly women in my life that sound more women than Miu's non feminine/masculine, lost in grey and emptiness voice. Even when she's talknig about her family she sounds bloody dreadful.The short hair blondie Nicole who finds Miu annoying and is kind of pretentious, thank god she's better but if Miu's voice acting isi a 1/10, this girl is 2/10. SOmething feels SO OFF about it; she's accentuating every other word with an accent sound that doesn't even make sense, which no normal Japanese person speaks like that anyway, its like there's smt lodged in her throat. CHrist her singing voice. SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST OF THE BUNCH but you can hear how fake her voice is and how much throat voice she's using to hit those high notes that are just out of her range.Then of course stock / stereotypical characters that are just- sigh.I'm going to stop watching this anime. but the protagonist Miu and her pissy rival who finds Miu's ideology annoying are absolutely appalling.

Talking about your past can be scary, but without the sad past things couldnt have turned out like this. I Loved having to watch them from 0 - famous, tough there was one thing that stopped me from giving this anime a 10/10, in my opinion everything was going too fast. Every episode there was a new thing they had to do because of ""Mr. Wall"", and because of that reason it made the characters feel like they were always in a rush.

All of the girls backstories follow a similar plotline of ""two or more people existing, existence is abruptly halted for one of them, be sad"" or ""two or more people existing, family crisis, be sad."" Yes, all the scenes in question are extremely human and personify the cast, but it doesn\'t really feel deserved when I\'m watching an episode and it goes from 22/7 is about to preform on-stage, to watching how terrible their lives used to be, it just feels like I breached their privacy, I did not earn this, there\'s no warning or anything, the only character who\'s backstory I felt I actually deserved was Jun\'s, solely because the episode was based around her ALONE and it fit the plot decently well. The flashbacks have caught me off-guard on multiples occasions because they were so random, although rarely it will actually fit the story and bring some meaning to the group, but more often than not it\'s just trying to make me feel for the characters.Moving on, lets talk about the ""Conflict"" of the anime, there\'s little to none, the first episode introduces ""The Wall"", a being that gives orders that the girls have to follow because ""The Walls orders are absolute"", literally no further explanation ..okay, these orders always end up working out, no matter what happens. ""The Wall"" poisons all the girls in one episode, but one of them coincidentally didn\'t like the texture of the food and didn\'t eat it, so she\'s fine and has to continue all the tasks the entire group was supposed to do, which would\'ve made for good conflict, but I knew that she wasn\'t going to fail because ""The Wall"" is never wrong, you can predict the next 2 episodes just by one scene where ""The Wall"" is giving orders, that\'s why when the girls were told to disband, I didn\'t even care anymore, the show was going to end with them somehow not disbanding and it being all ""woo, we defied the wall, the wall meant nothing after all and we did it all on our own!"" junk. The show is sorta good at being an angst show, but not a great idol show to promote a girl group, or a good show in general really, when I watch multiple episodes in a row and the only conflict within those episodes are things that happened in the past, things that do not matter, and things that are completely unrelated to the ""story"", it just makes watching it feel more or less like a drag, a lot of times the present conflict was easily resolved for the cast by just saying ""oh well \'the wall\' said it would happen, so it\'ll happen"" which completely just ruins all tension.TL;DR: anime is purposefully angsty to promote idol group, all conflict can be summed up by saying ""the wall is always right"" like an excuse to make us connect with the cast (and therefore the real life idol group) more, I\'ve honestly connected more to characters I know little to nothing about than most of the idols in this show.

The reason I kept up with is to find out what the answer to the Wall mystery was. And slowly, I found out that the girls themselves were pretty interesting and had some unique backstories. The music was nothing memorable, which I don’t think is great for an idol anime (not that I know anything about idol anime anyway), and I never really got an answer to the Wall.All...in all, decent, but definitely something to watch if you have NOTHING else to watch, and are interested in a bit of the humane element. in all, decent, but definitely something to watch if you have NOTHING else to watch, and are interested in a bit of the humane element.', ""My current impression with 22/7 is that nothing much happened and it's weird in not the best way.The story starts of with how most idol anime start, a group of strangers gathered together in a strange entertainment company to become idols. While that in itself isn't bad, there are some nitpicks I currently have with it. I struggle to suspend my disbelief with how the show portrayed the entertainment industry. The way the girls were invited to the audition was really shady and if it were to happen in real life there's no way anyone would accept G.I. Productions' offer. Speaking of which, even...the way G.I. Productions operates makes no sense and is shady at best and cult-like at worst.Case in point: they obey the decisions of a wall. I'm serious. They have a special room for this magical wall that supposedly makes all the decisions like the events 22/7 has to do. It's very weird and kind of ruins any dramatic stakes. I mean, one of the struggles of being a part of the entertainment industry is strategy. The success of the performer/s (like 22/7) relies on both the idols' performance and the decisions made by the talent agency to increase the chance of said success whether it be marketing, finances, and leadership. Making a wall in charge of the decisions not only takes away the autonomy and responsibility from the humans who're supposed to make those decisions but also heavily pressures the girls to perform well since from the looks of it no one is giving them much guidance. Maybe they could've alleviated that problem by making the wall a character since idol anime tends to add a fantasy element, but it's just a voiceless wall that literally spits out instructions through metal plaques.The characters--the girls of 22/7 specifically didn't give me a strong impression so far. Most of them stick to archetypes and I feel no interest towards them. The main lead seems to have promise though with a distinct voice and personality not much seen in idol anime leads. The character designs are pretty cute. Music hasn't been emphasized much yet. I hope they have good songs in the future.Overall, I'll still watch this series to confirm or disprove my current impression of the show. the way G.I.

And idol work is everything that she hates - it's superficial, feminine, in the spotlight, and fake.From there, each character has their own episode, where their background and reasons for being an idol are explained. Often, the reasons they became an...idol are linked to their current-day problems, like not feeling confident or struggling to express themselves, which is where the 'friendship' part comes in. Each character has a place in the team, and each helps the others out in her own, unique way, so despite few dedicated team-building episodes they still feel like a genuinely close group of girls.The story is also unique in that they are driven by a mysterious entity known as the 'wall' - and just when you think it's all done and solved, it throws yet another spanner in the works.

Ok, they want to keep realistic with motion-capture so It can’t be helped because logic in anime & real life is different since start.

Beatless Final Stage,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38020/Beatless_Final_Stage,"[""Note this review covers both the prequel series of Beatless and its sequel Beatless final stage as I see both as one series as the Final stage is essentially the last four episodes of the base series. While care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned.Based upon a popular novel of the same name that was written by the veteran novelist Satoshi Hase Beatless is an action, sci-fi and romance anime that gives us the opportunity to enter a world where thanks to the creation of an advanced AI mysterious but...highly advanced beings known as HIE’s have appeared within the world that begin to integrate themselves into human society. As the HIE’s and humans get to grips with each other and both learn to exist along with each other differences of opinion, old prejudices and paranoia of HIE’s eventually starts to create tension between those humans that welcome HIE’s and believe that they will be an asset that would complement humanity and those that see them as a threat to the individuality of the human race and see them as beings that desire nothing more than to subvert them. In the midst of all this, a teenage boy has a fateful encounter with a mysterious HIE that saves his life from an early end and ends up becoming not just her owner but also take up custody of one of the keys that could affect how this world would change. While anime’s that make use of robots aren’t anything new considering the popularity of giant robots that are used for military purposes in the form of the mecha genre of anime the use of androids that are resemble humans and the look into the kind of effects that they could have on human society in terms of social effects is a concept that’s unique to Beatless. This unique premise and its usage of themes that are rare within animes was what ultimately drew me to Beatless and I was impressed enough by the first episode that I decided that watch it to the end a decision that I felt was the right choice.Taking place in the near future the world of Beatless is a world that while similar to the modern world is vastly different thanks to the creation of advanced AI and its widespread integration into human society not just in terms of calculations for government and private industries but also by the military for predictive analysis of combat scenarios. As part of this revolution futuristic vehicles and equipment that are considered fantasy in this era such as home automation, self-driving cars and advanced uniforms that regulate heat are now a reality. However, the most obvious form of this change was not the above mentioned three but rather the creation and deployment of advanced androids called HIE’s beings that while looking near human have none of the weaknesses that humans have and as a result have become an integral part of human society where they serve in roles ranging from home-based ones that clean and cook to ones that manage stores on the streets. However while certainly useful HIE’s rather than help take off the burden that humans are bothered with instead have the opposite effect of creating tension and the belief that they were replacing them.The overall story for Beatless follows the life of Arato Endo a teenage schoolboy who after taking a stroll out one night to run an errand is saved from certain death by a mysterious female HIE called Lacia who unexpectedly requests that Arato become her owner. After becoming her owner Arato and his new partner Lacia are soon thrust into a struggle to not just stop the machinations that are enacted by not just her fellow Lacia class HIE’s but also by the many human organizations that stand to gain by influencing public opinion against the HIE’s. However in the midst of all this Arato and Lacia discover that while the people are certainly divided over the issue of whether HIE’s should be trusted or not there are many people that simply act because of the distrust that they have towards HIE’s that cause them to take such rash actions and that if they are able to convince them that such distrust is baseless then perhaps a world where humans and HIE’s can learn to coexist with each other will become a reality. Though the struggle will be a tough one this is one struggle that Arato and Lacia must triumph in as while both are different species they both aspire to change the current world and create a world where mutual distrust between HIE’s and humans are gone and that both are able to live in a world where they can respect and support each other. Joining in this grand undertaking is a host of characters that would both assist him and oppose him which includes the calm and composed Lacia, the arrogant and manipulative Kouka and the elegant and understanding Shiori.In a struggle that would shake the very foundation of society to the core today's allies could be tomorrows enemies but in a struggle to change the world Arato and his allies would fight their hardest in order to realize their dream.LaciaLacia voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Nao Touyama of Kanon and Classroom of the Elite fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Arato’s allies within the series. A mysterious HIE that Arato encounters early within the series Lacia at the start of the series is shown to be someone that is calm, composed and logical while at the same time being polite, kind and utterly gorgeous in Arato’s eyes. Like most HIE’s Lacia is someone that’s not just intelligent and fast thinking but also someone that’s also perceptive and understanding of someone’s feelings a fact that I felt was surprising for her. As a result of her fast thinking nature Lacia is someone that can change her plans relatively quickly and able to provide Arato with new solutions based on new data a feat that become increasingly useful as the series went on and Arato and Lacia encountered the first of their adversaries. Despite her nature as HIE Lacia is not someone that’s too hung up on doing what’s been programmed into her and rather Lacia is someone that’s not just curious but also willing to learn about new experiences something that I felt was interesting and matched well with her development as she learned from Arato. At the same time unlike most HIE’s Lacia was someone that was considerate of others feelings and was one that understood the animosity that she creates on humans. At the same time, she also understands that despite appearing almost human she is not a truly human and is merely replicating the actions of one showing that Lacia despite being an HIE can also feel and understand the feelings that a human should have. While a kind and understanding person by nature Lacia was also shown to be a very capable combatant that while possessing high-level close combat and ranged abilities also showed an impressive talent for hacking and making use of electronic warfare something that I felt contrasted well with her kind and caring personality.As the series goes on however and more of Lacia’s personality is revealed Lacia’s personality gradually starts to change. While still remaining caring and kind towards Arato as the series progresses Lacia gradually tries to maintain a distance between the two despite Arato’s reluctance to do so as she believes that she is merely a tool whose only purpose in life is to allow her owner to expand the knowledge that they have on the world by interacting with her as the medium. While this view itself is a logical one it can be seen that it’s a view that both are not comfortable with despite the former’s insistence on its usage. As a direct result of this path that Lacia willingly took this created within Lacia two distinct personalities that correspond to the personalities that Lacia adapts for Arato’s sake. The first is the one that Arato is most familiar and arguably the one that he’s most comfortable with which is the perceptive, warm and kind Lacia that does her best to help Arato and his friends deal with any problems that they encounter in a civilized manner. The latter and arguably the more drastically different one is one that manifests when Arato begins his quest to create his ideal world. Unlike the standard personality that Lacia possesses this latter personality rather than being warm and kind is one that is not just icy but also logical and focused and is one that sees any threat to her and her owner as ones that must be identified and eliminated without mercy a complete contrast to her default personality which would have simply observed and come up with multiple solutions to deal with the said problem without resorting to violence.This side of Lacia is indicative of the fact that at this point she is very determined to make the dreams of her owner come true even if it meant that she has to do things that would hurt both of them emotionally. The character of Lacia I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with her gradual development of a mysterious but polite and kind HIE to someone that as a result of seeing the kind of dreams and beliefs that her owner had evolved to become an icy, logical and focused person that fought hard to achieve the dreams of her owners despite taking a path that would upset his owner being pretty well done. I felt that her seiyuu Nao Touyama really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Lacia.AratoArato Endou voiced by new voice actor Takuto Yoshinaga is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A teenage schoolboy that had a rather close encounter with death at the beginning of the series while out running errands Arato at the beginning of the series was someone that was shown to be a kind, caring and positive person that had a strong set of morals. While admittedly a somewhat slow person in terms of intelligence Arato was someone that can be said to act with his heart and was someone that always rushed to help those that were in need whether they were human or HIE. In line with this nature Arato was also shown to be someone that was very caring and loyal to his friends and family and was someone that cared deeply about them and would try to do his utmost to protect them from harm even if the situation appears hopeless which shows not just his kindness but also his determination to protect those dear to him. A prominent trait of Arato is that unlike the great majority of the people that’s around him Arato was someone that didn’t bear HIE’s with any degree of distrust and instead treated them with the same amount of respect that he affords to humans which is a view that can be said to be a minority within the society that he lives in. Indeed, it can be seen that in line with his views Arato is someone that believes that the current world where humans treat HIE like objects and tools instead of treating them like lifeforms is wrong as it creates nothing more than a society that’s rife with mistrust and senseless violence. These views while a minority within the series contributed greatly to the fact that Lacia selected him as her ideal owner and made him both an ideal candidate and a determined one that was determined to change the world based on his strong ideas of coexistence between both HIE’s and humans.As the series goes on and Arato gets to see first hand the kind of mistrust that exists within society between humans and HIE’s Arato’s personality gradually starts to change. At the beginning of the series Arato despite his kind and caring nature was someone that was shown to be somewhat indecisive and reluctant with his actions and was someone that can be said to be rule-bound by nature. However, as the series goes on and as Arato see’s the kind of danger that his friends and family are exposed too as the mistrust between humans and HIE’s continue this sense of indecisiveness gradually starts to disappear and is replaced by a strong determination to protect them from harm while at the same time being brave enough to confront those responsible for causing them harm. This can be seen in the fact that Arato after this is willing to break the law if it meant that it can protect his friends which is best shown in his attempts to save Kengo. Initially, Arato despite agreeing to and subsequently becoming her owner was someone that was reluctant to accept Lacia as he believed that Lacia must have an owner of her own and that her contract with him was a mistake on her part. As a result, in the beginning, Arato tried to keep her at a distance. However, as the series progressed, and it became apparent that the contract agreement wasn’t a mistake this gradually changed Arato’s attitude towards Lacia and his attitude gradually softened as he began to warm up to her. This change of view was helped greatly by the fact that Lacia treated both him and his sister with both politeness and kindness that soon won their trust in her and contributed greatly in the fact that Arato by the midpoint of the series began to see her as not just an object but an integral part of his family and someone that was very important to him a view that surprised many within the series. Though Arato in the beginning understandably was reluctant to make use make Lacia’s abilities this view gradually vanishes as Arato realizes that by using her abilities and at the same time imposing his own conditions on her that Arato would be able to not just protect his friends and family from harm but also take the first step in realizing his dream something that Lacia also admires about him.As a result of the trust that was built between them Arato was shown to be someone that had a lot of trust in Lacia something that become crucial near the end of the series when it became apparent that Lacia not only had two distinct personalities but also of the fact that she kept her real identity a secret from him as well. While somewhat dismayed, confused and lost at first as a result of this revelation Arato as a result of both the bonds and the shared goals that both him and Lacia possess gradually came to realize that this rather than a sense of betrayal was instead Lacia’s way of protecting him as she wanted to spare him from the harsh decisions that she has to make in his journey to realize his dream. As a result, rather than being offended by Lacia’s betrayal Arato instead came to realize just how much Lacia wanted his dream to become reality and as a result forged an even stronger bond with Lacia as a result and becoming even more determined to work together with her to realize it. The character of Arato I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed as the series went on with his evolution of someone that was indecisive, and rule-bound to someone that was willing to use all available means to not just change society and their perception of HIE’s but also protect his friends in his quest to achieve equality being especially well done. I felt that his voice actor Takuto Yoshinaga did an excellent job at portraying the character of Arato.KoukaKouka voiced by new seiyuu Misako Tomioka is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Arato and Lacia’s allies within the series. A Lacia type android and thus one of Lacia’s sisters Kouka at the start of the series was shown to be someone that was intelligent, arrogant, cunning and manipulative. Unlike her sister, Lacia Kouka was someone that was shown to be someone that looked down on humans and viewed them with something approaching contempt. Indeed, Kouka despite being an HIE had no qualms about not just making use of humans as her pawns but also use them in a way that they will suffer the bulk of the casualties in her plans without having to even get serious on the field herself. This act of motivating people and raising them to believe that their plans are flawless and then disregarding them by using them as pawns I felt was an attribute that fitted her perfectly. For an HIE that’s supposed to be only near human Kouka’s attitude and personality was one that definitely showed more human emotions that I thought will be possible.After her various schemes were dismantled and forced back Kouka was forced to become something akin to a rogue unit that operated on her own terms. Unlike her past self which was arrogant, overconfident and condescending to all she meets Kouka as a result of being forced to survive on her own in a world that was mistrustful of her was forced to adapt her personality. In this Kouka while remaining confident was also a positive and cheerful person that while remaining cautious still enjoyed wreaking havoc when given the chance. In a way, I felt that this personality of Kouka’s was one that more akin to Kouka’s true self than her old personality. The character of Kouka I felt was an interesting character and one that was both well designed and developed. In particular, I felt that the idea of an HIE puppet master that made use of her intelligence and manipulative nature to exploit the mutual distrust that humans have towards HIE’s and use them to wreak havoc to cover her true goals was something that I thought was done well and matched her personality. Her change that came about as a result of her defeat I felt was an interesting one as it showed that no matter how powerful you are you are not invincible.This change I felt was interesting because it showed an unexpectedly lonely and fragile side of Kouka and explored the possibility that her opposition to Lacia wasn’t only because of hatred but also because of envy as unlike her she had someone that cared for her in the form of Arato. As I result I felt that this side of her was the true face of Kouka that she had been hiding behind her stubborn demeanor. I felt that her seiyuu Misako Tomioka really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Kouka.Shiori KaidaiShiori voiced by Satake Uki is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Arato’s allies within the series. The younger sister of Arato’s friend Ryou Shiori from the onset is shown to be someone that’s elegant, calm and understanding and is someone that while from a famous family is someone that’s quiet, polite and well mannered. While a quiet person Shiori was by no means someone that was bad at interacting with others and in fact she maintains a number of good friendships with a number of people including Arato, his sister Yuka and many others. While a quiet person Shiori was also shown to be someone that was both logical and intelligent which when combined with her innate cautious nature would have made her a valuable member of her family’s business had she been given the opportunity to be part of it. Unlike her brother, Shiori was shown to be someone that was more open-minded that her brother and was willing to negotiate with others calmly and fairly and willing to make compromises as needed as shown in her first interactions with Arato and Lacia. However, this is offset by her fast thinking nature and her overconfidence that comes from the pride that she feels from being a member of a famed family. Traits that were easily exploited by people who seek to use her for their gains which ended almost fatally for her.As the series goes on and more of Shiori’s personality is revealed it can be seen that contrary to the calm and elegant self that she portrays to others Shiori is someone that’s mentally fragile. While seemingly confident and positive on the outside it can be seen that Shiori is someone that has a lot of insecurity within her heart. On one hand, she desires to be able to be of some use to her brother that she respects highly but at the same time she is conflicted over whether she will be of any use to anyone. This contributes to her belief that in the end she is only someone that’s being used by her family’s company as a tool for their power games and will be discarded when her usefulness is gone a belief that stays with her until her meeting with Methode and the events that transpired there. It is until after the dramatic events at the airport that Shiori’s personality began to undergo what was arguably the most significant change in her personality to date.  In the aftermath of the incident as a result of seeing the kind of actions that HIE’s were capable of performing Shiori becomes not just distrustful of HIE’s but also angry at them due to Methode’s manipulation of her.  At the same time due to Ryuo’s partnering with Methode, this also caused the cherished bond that Shiori had with her brother to fracture. However, despite this, it can be seen that this incident tragic as it was also served as a valuable life lesson for her and was something that Shiori took to heart. No longer possessing the arrogance and overconfidence that defined her first phase personality Shiori in the aftermath was shown to have become more humble and understanding of other’s feelings and circumstances and grown to realize just how important bonds between friends and family can be. This causes her to realize that despite being family her brother and her family didn’t really treat them as one and instead treated them as tools that are to be used in the endless struggles that took place within the company.As a result, she came to believe that families should be able to talk to each other freely and make their decisions freely without being pressured into making choices that could have large consequences showing not just her own frustration at her family but also of the role that she was born into. The character of Shiori I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with her evolution from an elegant, polite but also overconfident ojou sama to one that was both humble and understanding of others feelings being especially well done. Her realization that family should be a place where each member is able to express their own views and not be pressured to make decisions that they would later regret I felt was interesting as it showed that not only did she realized that her own family was anything but that but also of the fact that she must learn to forge her path if she wants to be able to forge a life that’s unique to her if she wanted to bring the façade that’s her family down. I felt that her seiyuu Satake Uki did an excellent job at portraying the character of Shiori.AMVAnimation wise I felt that the character designs for the main and support cast were done really well and reflected well on the personalities that they possessed. In particular I felt that the designs of the Lacia class androids that served as not just allies but also enemies within the series was done really well with each member of that class having appearances that matched not just their intended roles but also their personalities well with notable cases being the icy but gorgeous Lacia, the childlike but mischievous Snowdrop and the bold and confident Methode. The various locations that the cast visit as part of the series I felt was done pretty well and reflected well on the fact that the story is taking place in the near future but at the same time a future where humanity is not yet comfortable with leaving it to AI and HIE’s yet. This is shown within the series in the form of the contrasts where while you may have self-driving cars and smart uniforms, not all tasks are left to AI and HIE’s. In terms of combat animations, I felt that the various combat scenes that were shown in the series were both well thought out and designed with each battle being both unpredictable but also savage in intensity which reflected on the fact that each battle is not just a confrontation of force but also one where the conflicting ideologies of the masters of the HIE’s are also colliding. Apart from the many one on one battles that are prevalent within the series, I thought that the series also handled the larger scale battles relatively well which is best shown in the HIE city arc when Arato and co were forced to deal with infected HIE’s on a large scale. That was an arc that was both brutal but at the same time interesting.In terms of music, the series made use of two openings and ending themes respectively which was Error and Truth that was sung by veteran singer Garnidelia and the veteran seiyuu girl group Trysail and PRIMALove and Shapeless which were sung by Claris and Tokyo Performance Doll respectively. Each of these was strong songs with the two Ops’ especially doing an excellent job of creating a sense of anticipation for the episodes. The series OST I felt was a solid one that did a great job of providing some strong music to the various scenes within the anime with the combat ones being my favorite.In terms of voice acting, I felt that the main voice cast did an excellent job of portraying their respective characters whether these were main or supporting characters. In particular, I feel that Nao Touyama, Takuto Yoshinaga, Misako Tomioka, and Uki Satake all did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters which were Lacia, Arato, Kouka and Shiori respectively. Additionally, while I didn’t cover their characters within the review I also felt that Sora Amamiya and Kaito Ishikawa also did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Methode and Ryou respectively.Overall conclusionIn overall Beatless I felt was a strong anime that had among its strong points an interesting premise, story, well designed and developed characters, strong voice acting and an interesting take on how to handle some of today's world’s most complex themes.The premise of Beatless which was the creation and widespread adaptation of AI and the creation of mysterious androids called HIE’s that assist humanity as they advance in tech level I felt was interesting and arguably one of the most interesting parts of the series. One of the key reasons for this was due to its use of complex themes that plague the world of today like mistrust towards technology, discrimination, hate crimes, free will, rights and learning to trust and the ability to choose your own path all of which are choices that are seldom seen within the world of anime. Whether reflected within the series or within the real world to which we exist in it will not be an understatement if I were to say that change is something that’s both welcomed by many and at the same time unwelcome by many as while one side may get many benefits from the change the same cannot be said of the other side. Seeing this take place on a larger scale within the series in form of its effects on society I felt provided a solid foundation for the overall story of the series.The overall story for the series I felt was an interesting one that made great use of the various themes that formed its foundation and using this as a means of showing the various challenges that Arato and Lacia must overcome in order to create and realize the dream that they both aspire to create. While the act of a boy encountering a mysterious girl that saves him is a troupe that we often see within anime in this case I felt that this was used pretty well as it allowed us to see the gradual forming of a relationship between Arato and Lacia who despite being that of an owner and an HIE slowly overcomes the line that divides them as they both overcome the inherent differences that exist between the two races and bond with each other both emotionally and ideologically. Seeing the two’s gradually deepening relationship develop from that of an owner and his HIE to that of a partner and trusted ally and seeing them try to overturn the twisted nature of the society that they live in by not just interacting and treating each other as equals but also actively working to realize their shared dream while defying the world was something that I really enjoyed seeing. However, despite the strong story and interesting premise, there were a number of missteps along the way that I felt kept it from getting a higher score and a better opinion among viewers.The most notable of this is the sheer number of recap episodes that existed within the series. For a full season anime like Beatless having 1 or 2 recap episodes is pretty standard and is something that I can accept due to the complexity of animes that have full seasons. However, I feel that having 4 recap episodes some of them taking place pretty soon after the previous one is a bit much and helped contribute to the loss of immersion within the series. Additionally, I felt that some of the characters within the series were really underused and didn’t have clear roles within the series with the best examples being Saturnus despite who being a Lacia class android didn’t get to do much within the series other than act as a maid.As a final score, I would say that Beatless deserves a final score of 7/10. While the premise, story, characters and voice acting were good I felt that this was let down by its unnecessary amount of recap episodes and the number of characters that were underdeveloped within the series. At the same time while i appreciated the fact that the studio persisted in concluding the series with the unprecedented step of splitting the last four episodes from the base series and showing that separately i felt that this could have been avoided if there weren't that many recap episodes. highly advanced beings known as HIE’s have appeared within the world that begin to integrate themselves into human society. As the HIE’s and humans get to grips with each other and both learn to exist along with each other differences of opinion, old prejudices and paranoia of HIE’s eventually starts to create tension between those humans that welcome HIE’s and believe that they will be an asset that would complement humanity and those that see them as a threat to the individuality of the human race and see them as beings that desire nothing more than to subvert them. In the midst of all this, a teenage boy has a fateful encounter with a mysterious HIE that saves his life from an early end and ends up becoming not just her owner but also take up custody of one of the keys that could affect how this world would change. While anime’s that make use of robots aren’t anything new considering the popularity of giant robots that are used for military purposes in the form of the mecha genre of anime the use of androids that are resemble humans and the look into the kind of effects that they could have on human society in terms of social effects is a concept that’s unique to Beatless. This unique premise and its usage of themes that are rare within animes was what ultimately drew me to Beatless and I was impressed enough by the first episode that I decided that watch it to the end a decision that I felt was the right choice.Taking place in the near future the world of Beatless is a world that while similar to the modern world is vastly different thanks to the creation of advanced AI and its widespread integration into human society not just in terms of calculations for government and private industries but also by the military for predictive analysis of combat scenarios. As part of this revolution futuristic vehicles and equipment that are considered fantasy in this era such as home automation, self-driving cars and advanced uniforms that regulate heat are now a reality. However, the most obvious form of this change was not the above mentioned three but rather the creation and deployment of advanced androids called HIE’s beings that while looking near human have none of the weaknesses that humans have and as a result have become an integral part of human society where they serve in roles ranging from home-based ones that clean and cook to ones that manage stores on the streets. However while certainly useful HIE’s rather than help take off the burden that humans are bothered with instead have the opposite effect of creating tension and the belief that they were replacing them.The overall story for Beatless follows the life of Arato Endo a teenage schoolboy who after taking a stroll out one night to run an errand is saved from certain death by a mysterious female HIE called Lacia who unexpectedly requests that Arato become her owner. After becoming her owner Arato and his new partner Lacia are soon thrust into a struggle to not just stop the machinations that are enacted by not just her fellow Lacia class HIE’s but also by the many human organizations that stand to gain by influencing public opinion against the HIE’s. However in the midst of all this Arato and Lacia discover that while the people are certainly divided over the issue of whether HIE’s should be trusted or not there are many people that simply act because of the distrust that they have towards HIE’s that cause them to take such rash actions and that if they are able to convince them that such distrust is baseless then perhaps a world where humans and HIE’s can learn to coexist with each other will become a reality. Though the struggle will be a tough one this is one struggle that Arato and Lacia must triumph in as while both are different species they both aspire to change the current world and create a world where mutual distrust between HIE’s and humans are gone and that both are able to live in a world where they can respect and support each other. Joining in this grand undertaking is a host of characters that would both assist him and oppose him which includes the calm and composed Lacia, the arrogant and manipulative Kouka and the elegant and understanding Shiori.In a struggle that would shake the very foundation of society to the core today's allies could be tomorrows enemies but in a struggle to change the world Arato and his allies would fight their hardest in order to realize their dream.LaciaLacia voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Nao Touyama of Kanon and Classroom of the Elite fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Arato’s allies within the series.

Though Arato in the beginning understandably was reluctant to make use make Lacia’s abilities this view gradually vanishes as Arato realizes that by using her abilities and at the same time imposing his own conditions on her that Arato would be able to not just protect his friends and family from harm but also take the first step in realizing his dream something that Lacia also admires about him.As a result of the trust that was built between them Arato was shown to be someone that had a lot of trust in Lacia something that become crucial near the end of the series when it became apparent that Lacia not only had two distinct personalities but also of the fact that she kept her real identity a secret from him as well. While somewhat dismayed, confused and lost at first as a result of this revelation Arato as a result of both the bonds and the shared goals that both him and Lacia possess gradually came to realize that this rather than a sense of betrayal was instead Lacia’s way of protecting him as she wanted to spare him from the harsh decisions that she has to make in his journey to realize his dream. As a result, rather than being offended by Lacia’s betrayal Arato instead came to realize just how much Lacia wanted his dream to become reality and as a result forged an even stronger bond with Lacia as a result and becoming even more determined to work together with her to realize it. The character of Arato I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed as the series went on with his evolution of someone that was indecisive, and rule-bound to someone that was willing to use all available means to not just change society and their perception of HIE’s but also protect his friends in his quest to achieve equality being especially well done. I felt that his voice actor Takuto Yoshinaga did an excellent job at portraying the character of Arato.KoukaKouka voiced by new seiyuu Misako Tomioka is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Arato and Lacia’s allies within the series. A Lacia type android and thus one of Lacia’s sisters Kouka at the start of the series was shown to be someone that was intelligent, arrogant, cunning and manipulative. Unlike her sister, Lacia Kouka was someone that was shown to be someone that looked down on humans and viewed them with something approaching contempt. Indeed, Kouka despite being an HIE had no qualms about not just making use of humans as her pawns but also use them in a way that they will suffer the bulk of the casualties in her plans without having to even get serious on the field herself. This act of motivating people and raising them to believe that their plans are flawless and then disregarding them by using them as pawns I felt was an attribute that fitted her perfectly. For an HIE that’s supposed to be only near human Kouka’s attitude and personality was one that definitely showed more human emotions that I thought will be possible.After her various schemes were dismantled and forced back Kouka was forced to become something akin to a rogue unit that operated on her own terms. Unlike her past self which was arrogant, overconfident and condescending to all she meets Kouka as a result of being forced to survive on her own in a world that was mistrustful of her was forced to adapt her personality. In this Kouka while remaining confident was also a positive and cheerful person that while remaining cautious still enjoyed wreaking havoc when given the chance. In a way, I felt that this personality of Kouka’s was one that more akin to Kouka’s true self than her old personality. The character of Kouka I felt was an interesting character and one that was both well designed and developed. In particular, I felt that the idea of an HIE puppet master that made use of her intelligence and manipulative nature to exploit the mutual distrust that humans have towards HIE’s and use them to wreak havoc to cover her true goals was something that I thought was done well and matched her personality. Her change that came about as a result of her defeat I felt was an interesting one as it showed that no matter how powerful you are you are not invincible.This change I felt was interesting because it showed an unexpectedly lonely and fragile side of Kouka and explored the possibility that her opposition to Lacia wasn’t only because of hatred but also because of envy as unlike her she had someone that cared for her in the form of Arato. As I result I felt that this side of her was the true face of Kouka that she had been hiding behind her stubborn demeanor. I felt that her seiyuu Misako Tomioka really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Kouka.Shiori KaidaiShiori voiced by Satake Uki is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Arato’s allies within the series. The younger sister of Arato’s friend Ryou Shiori from the onset is shown to be someone that’s elegant, calm and understanding and is someone that while from a famous family is someone that’s quiet, polite and well mannered. While a quiet person Shiori was by no means someone that was bad at interacting with others and in fact she maintains a number of good friendships with a number of people including Arato, his sister Yuka and many others. While a quiet person Shiori was also shown to be someone that was both logical and intelligent which when combined with her innate cautious nature would have made her a valuable member of her family’s business had she been given the opportunity to be part of it. Unlike her brother, Shiori was shown to be someone that was more open-minded that her brother and was willing to negotiate with others calmly and fairly and willing to make compromises as needed as shown in her first interactions with Arato and Lacia. However, this is offset by her fast thinking nature and her overconfidence that comes from the pride that she feels from being a member of a famed family. Traits that were easily exploited by people who seek to use her for their gains which ended almost fatally for her.As the series goes on and more of Shiori’s personality is revealed it can be seen that contrary to the calm and elegant self that she portrays to others Shiori is someone that’s mentally fragile. While seemingly confident and positive on the outside it can be seen that Shiori is someone that has a lot of insecurity within her heart. On one hand, she desires to be able to be of some use to her brother that she respects highly but at the same time she is conflicted over whether she will be of any use to anyone. This contributes to her belief that in the end she is only someone that’s being used by her family’s company as a tool for their power games and will be discarded when her usefulness is gone a belief that stays with her until her meeting with Methode and the events that transpired there. It is until after the dramatic events at the airport that Shiori’s personality began to undergo what was arguably the most significant change in her personality to date.  In the aftermath of the incident as a result of seeing the kind of actions that HIE’s were capable of performing Shiori becomes not just distrustful of HIE’s but also angry at them due to Methode’s manipulation of her.  At the same time due to Ryuo’s partnering with Methode, this also caused the cherished bond that Shiori had with her brother to fracture. However, despite this, it can be seen that this incident tragic as it was also served as a valuable life lesson for her and was something that Shiori took to heart. No longer possessing the arrogance and overconfidence that defined her first phase personality Shiori in the aftermath was shown to have become more humble and understanding of other’s feelings and circumstances and grown to realize just how important bonds between friends and family can be. This causes her to realize that despite being family her brother and her family didn’t really treat them as one and instead treated them as tools that are to be used in the endless struggles that took place within the company.As a result, she came to believe that families should be able to talk to each other freely and make their decisions freely without being pressured into making choices that could have large consequences showing not just her own frustration at her family but also of the role that she was born into. The character of Shiori I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with her evolution from an elegant, polite but also overconfident ojou sama to one that was both humble and understanding of others feelings being especially well done. Her realization that family should be a place where each member is able to express their own views and not be pressured to make decisions that they would later regret I felt was interesting as it showed that not only did she realized that her own family was anything but that but also of the fact that she must learn to forge her path if she wants to be able to forge a life that’s unique to her if she wanted to bring the façade that’s her family down. I felt that her seiyuu Satake Uki did an excellent job at portraying the character of Shiori.AMVAnimation wise I felt that the character designs for the main and support cast were done really well and reflected well on the personalities that they possessed. In particular I felt that the designs of the Lacia class androids that served as not just allies but also enemies within the series was done really well with each member of that class having appearances that matched not just their intended roles but also their personalities well with notable cases being the icy but gorgeous Lacia, the childlike but mischievous Snowdrop and the bold and confident Methode. The various locations that the cast visit as part of the series I felt was done pretty well and reflected well on the fact that the story is taking place in the near future but at the same time a future where humanity is not yet comfortable with leaving it to AI and HIE’s yet. This is shown within the series in the form of the contrasts where while you may have self-driving cars and smart uniforms, not all tasks are left to AI and HIE’s. In terms of combat animations, I felt that the various combat scenes that were shown in the series were both well thought out and designed with each battle being both unpredictable but also savage in intensity which reflected on the fact that each battle is not just a confrontation of force but also one where the conflicting ideologies of the masters of the HIE’s are also colliding. Apart from the many one on one battles that are prevalent within the series, I thought that the series also handled the larger scale battles relatively well which is best shown in the HIE city arc when Arato and co were forced to deal with infected HIE’s on a large scale. That was an arc that was both brutal but at the same time interesting.In terms of music, the series made use of two openings and ending themes respectively which was Error and Truth that was sung by veteran singer Garnidelia and the veteran seiyuu girl group Trysail and PRIMALove and Shapeless which were sung by Claris and Tokyo Performance Doll respectively. Each of these was strong songs with the two Ops’ especially doing an excellent job of creating a sense of anticipation for the episodes. The series OST I felt was a solid one that did a great job of providing some strong music to the various scenes within the anime with the combat ones being my favorite.In terms of voice acting, I felt that the main voice cast did an excellent job of portraying their respective characters whether these were main or supporting characters. In particular, I feel that Nao Touyama, Takuto Yoshinaga, Misako Tomioka, and Uki Satake all did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters which were Lacia, Arato, Kouka and Shiori respectively. Additionally, while I didn’t cover their characters within the review I also felt that Sora Amamiya and Kaito Ishikawa also did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Methode and Ryou respectively.Overall conclusionIn overall Beatless I felt was a strong anime that had among its strong points an interesting premise, story, well designed and developed characters, strong voice acting and an interesting take on how to handle some of today's world’s most complex themes.The premise of Beatless which was the creation and widespread adaptation of AI and the creation of mysterious androids called HIE’s that assist humanity as they advance in tech level I felt was interesting and arguably one of the most interesting parts of the series. One of the key reasons for this was due to its use of complex themes that plague the world of today like mistrust towards technology, discrimination, hate crimes, free will, rights and learning to trust and the ability to choose your own path all of which are choices that are seldom seen within the world of anime. Whether reflected within the series or within the real world to which we exist in it will not be an understatement if I were to say that change is something that’s both welcomed by many and at the same time unwelcome by many as while one side may get many benefits from the change the same cannot be said of the other side. Seeing this take place on a larger scale within the series in form of its effects on society I felt provided a solid foundation for the overall story of the series.The overall story for the series I felt was an interesting one that made great use of the various themes that formed its foundation and using this as a means of showing the various challenges that Arato and Lacia must overcome in order to create and realize the dream that they both aspire to create. While the act of a boy encountering a mysterious girl that saves him is a troupe that we often see within anime in this case I felt that this was used pretty well as it allowed us to see the gradual forming of a relationship between Arato and Lacia who despite being that of an owner and an HIE slowly overcomes the line that divides them as they both overcome the inherent differences that exist between the two races and bond with each other both emotionally and ideologically. Seeing the two’s gradually deepening relationship develop from that of an owner and his HIE to that of a partner and trusted ally and seeing them try to overturn the twisted nature of the society that they live in by not just interacting and treating each other as equals but also actively working to realize their shared dream while defying the world was something that I really enjoyed seeing. However, despite the strong story and interesting premise, there were a number of missteps along the way that I felt kept it from getting a higher score and a better opinion among viewers.The most notable of this is the sheer number of recap episodes that existed within the series. For a full season anime like Beatless having 1 or 2 recap episodes is pretty standard and is something that I can accept due to the complexity of animes that have full seasons. However, I feel that having 4 recap episodes some of them taking place pretty soon after the previous one is a bit much and helped contribute to the loss of immersion within the series. Additionally, I felt that some of the characters within the series were really underused and didn’t have clear roles within the series with the best examples being Saturnus despite who being a Lacia class android didn’t get to do much within the series other than act as a maid.As a final score, I would say that Beatless deserves a final score of 7/10. While the premise, story, characters and voice acting were good I felt that this was let down by its unnecessary amount of recap episodes and the number of characters that were underdeveloped within the series. At the same time while i appreciated the fact that the studio persisted in concluding the series with the unprecedented step of splitting the last four episodes from the base series and showing that separately i felt that this could have been avoided if there weren't that many recap episodes."", 'This review includes the final stage of this series. First of all i\'m reluctant to watch this Anime due to its low scores and some bad reviews however because i\'m a fan of AI/Machine i still give it a shot because of its synopsis.Story: The story was all about artificial intelligent, which is great since we all know that the world is moving towards the directions of AI/Machine Learning/Cloud Computing and etc. Now for the story. The story was really unique in my own opinion; while this might not be the first anime to cover about AI, it\'s the only Anime i personally see...which was able to tell its purpose to its viewers, of how corrupt humans can be in order to gained power in society. The Anime was also able to sent its message that sooner or later manual labor will cease to exist as machines are now capable of doing the same work as humans and to be more precise machines can finish all its task with given time as long as there\'s power running on it, not to mention its accuracy at its job. its also raises my awareness to question myself what makes humans differs from machines who doesn\'t have soul and heart? story is 10/10 for me.Art: Nothing to say here Lacia  is beautiful <3 i totally get why she become so popular in the society. 10/10Sound: The sound were fantastic...nope its actually amazing. the lyrics of the song were really for this anime specially the opening 2 (truth) where one lyrics is ""Humans are just a visible shape"". 10/10Enjoyment: As a person interested in AI/Machine learning i can pretty say that i enjoy this a lot, to the point i feel not contented of how short the episodes this Anime had.Overall: Beatless was my cup of tea. so nothing to say here anymore 10/10 which was able to tell its purpose to its viewers, of how corrupt humans can be in order to gained power in society.

The premise was really interesting, but the execution and the characters were so underwhelming that I\'m left here disappointed. I always felt attracted to the idea of a future where humanoid robots are available to humans so they can do with them as they please. And whether is risky or not it would be an interesting future to witness. Movies like ""I, Robot"" and ""Ex Machina"" where interesting examples of diving into the point of view of an Artificial Intelligence. Beatless tries...to settle a world where Humans and Robots can co-exist and live like a family. For some people this might sound stupid and dangerous, but for others this is a dream come true. So where exactly did Beatless fail at? Almost everything.Going straight to the point, Characters where the main problem on this anime. The very generic and dull cast of characters were really forgettable, we have the very dense main character that will be the ""bridge"" between HiE\'s and Humans. We have the main character\'s ""best friends"" that are against every sort of love towards machines and will do the posible to maintain humans relationship with humans, even if they require HiE\'s for that matter. Then we have the Trio of useless girls that serves no purpose whatsoever but to remind us of how stupid Arato can be. Then we have the HiE\'s cast, which are a bunch of self insert killing machine waifus of each kind: we have a manipulative loli, the explosive one, the dominant bitch and we have Lacia who is the most prominent and ""mysterious"" of them all. I would like to try and add more details on how they are, but that\'s as how forgettable they are, so that\'s it.The art department is also forgettable, the animation is mediocre as best, the character designs are generic and terrible (what the fuck did snowdrop became in the end? ""she"" looked like some sort of castlevania monster) There\'s absolutely nothing worth in the art department. As a bonus, there was a scene where the transitions were so terrible that in one frame you see the car moving and in the other everything looks static as if they were never moving in the first place. Sound department were also forgettable, Voice acting were really off and the ost... wait where there an ost?Enjoyment 6/10: Yes I indeed managed to enjoy this somehow, the constant stupidity of the MC was fun enough to stay and I kind of wanted to know where Lacia and Arato\'s relationship were heading, stupidly enough, they bring up a plot hole off their asses right after telling us that it was not possible at the very end xD.Overall 4/10 to settle a world where Humans and Robots can co-exist and live like a family.

Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism is no different, as this OVA, came bundled with the original manga, is your standard ""school trip to the Onsen episode"".  In other words, a fanservice episode.  And if it wasn\'t obvious enough, then looking at the thumbnail should provide some additional insight.STORY:This OVA is a direct sequel to the main series.As far as fanservice episodes goes, this one was boring and not very entertaining. The first half of this episode featured boring dialogue and a study event where...Fudou Nomura must pass his exams in order to go on the Onsen trip, but, as usually, he passes the exam. And, then the second half involved a ""typical"" legend about the Onsen, i.e., the first person to enter the Onsen gets their wish granted, and brief fight scene over which girl will enter the Onsen first. Overall, a boring fanservice episode.ANIMATION:The art, background settings, and character designs were all pretty mediocre.  There was a short fight scene, but it wasn’t very impressive compared to the main series’ fight scenes.SOUND:There was nothing impressive or noteworthy that stood out to me.  We have the same voice actors and actress reprising their roles.  And, we have the same opening and ending song from the main series.CHARACTERS:Don’t expect any character development or additional backstory.  If you have seen the main series, then you will know who these characters are, their personalities, and how they will behave.  Furthermore, you can expect the same cheesy dialogue and bad jokes.ENJOYMENT:It was boring and not very entertaining.  Generic fanservice for an overall generic show.

If you don't like fanservice, don't watch it, if you do like fanservice, then do.The story continues where the main anime left off. The pacing is quite bad to transition from being in the school to going to a hot spring but the anime does address all steps however briefly. There is no real story apart from going to the hot spring though.The characters, voice acting and animation are all the exact same as in the main anime.Overall it's an alright fanservice episode with bad pacing. "", ""When in doubt, hot springs episode. You know the drill, it's a bonus OVA for if you bought the home media release so it's going to be fan-service and pandering the whole way through. Not bad if you liked these characters and you're into that, but nothing really of substance here. It's the kind of episode where after I was done watching it it had already pretty much left my brain, like it was never there at all. I had to go watch parts of it again for this review just to make sure there wasn't anything special about it I might have missed because...I genuinely couldn't remember what had happened.Basically you can boil the plot besides the fact that they go to a hot spring down to a pissing match between the 5 swords girls over who can be the most tsundere. Honestly situations like these get so tiresome that's it's refreshing to see one of them just say what everyone is thinking. The girl at the end who actually gets protagonist did so by just admitting how she was feeling and taking what she wanted instead of hmming and hawing about it indefinitely. 7/10 hot springs I genuinely couldn't remember what had happened.Basically you can boil the plot besides the fact that they go to a hot spring down to a pissing match between the 5 swords girls over who can be the most tsundere.

Without any memory of the series that spawned this ""special"", it felt neither special nor a bonus. The harem cast was pretty much as generic as they come so to pair it up with a bog-standard cliche episode just underlines the typical problem with these type of standalone episodes. Any dialogue or story narrative is secondary, if even that with the emphasis solely to throw as much fanservice as possible on the screen but even that...does not stretch beyond mildly titillating.

Cardfight!! Vanguard: Asia Circuit-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13145/Cardfight_Vanguard__Asia_Circuit-hen,"['I happened to look around and realised that out of all the seasons of Vanguard, somehow this has no reviews at all. And I have somewhat of an opinion on this season, so I figured why not?…Ok, ok. I know the score looks bad for a series which got a 7, but hear me out a little.Warning: Light spoilers ahead but it won’t ruin your experience. Maybe. I assumed you’ve watched the first season, because there’s no reason for you to be watching the second season if you haven’t.I’m not someone with extremely high standards like some ‘professional anime critique’ out there...who likes picking apart themes and abstract stuff like that. When I watch a show, I just want to enjoy the process, and boy did I enjoy the first season of Cardfight Vanguard.For someone who does not play the card game, I strangely enjoyed the first season as a teenager when it was clearly a show targeted at kids. It was cheesy to the extremes, but at the very least, there was some sort of development for Aichi. He went from a shy weak boy to a confident one with the card game, something that is pretty commonplace in this kind of show and happens to be a troupe I like, so I was fine with it. Specifically, what I liked from the last season was how Aichi actually went down the wrong path for a while in his pursuit of getting stronger. It was a common storyline, but at least Aichi went through some hardship and reflection before finally emerging stronger and victorious. Aichi changed over the course of the series, and noticeably became a lot more mature. The ability Psyqualia was also hinted to be much more than being able to see or control what was on Cray, which the first season left off on a cliffhanger.So here I was, all hyped up for the second season, especially when it included ‘visiting’ some Asian countries which included my own, which was an interesting concept. I was curious as to how they would portray my country in an anime, I mean, who else wouldn’t want to see anime characters getting all excited at a tourist attraction and the great food in your country? Plus my country isn’t featured prominently and reused over and over again in any medium whenever characters ‘go overseas’ (Ahem Paris, ahem USA. As if they were the only places in the world to go.). And admittedly, that part where they were just being tourists hanging around was the only part of this second season I enjoyed, because the story continued spiralling downwards into a cheesier mess, so much so that when I reached the end of the season, I was really mad at myself for getting excited in the first place.So maybe now you think it’s a problem of being biased against the series, that it was a problem of having too high expectations. I admit, yes. I don’t deny that I was waiting for ‘evil Aichi’ to appear again because I loved that him in the last season and guess what happened.Instead, Aichi turns into this goody-goody justice wielding preacher guy who goes about the whole season apparently teaching people what was right and wrong, and stays basically the same throughout the whole season with no development other than random references to the first season. It makes for a very boring character, and the way his lessons are done is by forcing his ideals onto others. Fine, maybe it’s because pushing morals in the face of its viewers is inherently part of a kids’ show. Fine, maybe they were trying to show the ‘now he’s guiding others onto the path of success when they stray off it because he experienced it before’ kind of moral. The absence of evil Aichi pissed me off, but there was something else pissing me even more altogether. The way things progressed.See, I get that it’s a card game anime, and everything needs to be done through card fights. And yes, the main character is the main character, so he needs to win his way through the fights so that the plot can progress. But at least make it seem natural! The way Aichi played last season was through specific combination of cards that drew out his ace, Blaster Blade, and built on from there. It was rather interesting to watch, because it seemed more like the tactical game it should be. This was shown especially through Misaki, where the way she played was intriguing because all her moves were aimed at getting a killer combo out of the deck through soul charge, and also relied heavily on her observation of the opponent’s cards when he drew them as triggers. It’s a game of tactics, and the last season sold that idea pretty well. The way the games were played from this season and the following seem to imply Aichi has exponentially ten times the luck anyone else has, because almost every fight when he reached the climax of his lessons he would simply need to draw a card and it would be that particular trump card that somehow overpowers everything else. Wow. No tactics, no combinations, just draw a card for the next turn and, of course, he wins in that same turn. It was like he was winning because the plot demanded him to, where the entire universe revolves around getting him to win through a literal asspull so that the plot can progress.And anyone can tell those asspulls were meant to be commercials for those cards because they have never been seen before in the show, and Aichi had never been shown in between fights buying new cards to improve on his own deck. Way to ruin a decent character, man.And yeah, on the technical side, the animation of the show is pretty bad, as with basically all other cardfight vanguard seasons. Stiff animations, awkward angles, etc. At least the characters were varied enough so that they were really distinguishable from each other, but that’s about it.Music-wise, it’s just really generic BGM that fades off into the background and stuff. The opening was nice because JAM PROJECT, and I guess it does work as hyping up anyone who likes watching the show. The endings were rather nice too.As you can tell, I really did not enjoy this season, and this was what killed any vague interest I ever had in the franchise. If I were to be someone actually playing the game, I would feel really discouraged because the new season basically renders all the cards I had on hand useless. Limit break broke the game. The real surprise to me is how the game still managed to sell well enough to make another three seasons. I guess the kids were frantic enough to buy up all the new cards, and I don’t blame them for that. But all in all, from a storyline perspective this season screwed up so badly that it’s laughable. If you still want to watch this, by all means go ahead, but don’t expect too much. To give the creators some credit, it was a good idea to focus on what Psyqualia was, but the story ultimately turned out to be lacklustre and the plot backfired on itself into a splatter of melted Swiss cheese.Thanks for maintaining your attention span up until this point, and feel free to inform me on how I can improve =) who likes picking apart themes and abstract stuff like that.

Everything that season 1 did amazingly, season 2 just didn't do. There's so many plot holes and no direction to the plot 20 episodes in (51% of the way in). All he wants to do is meet a boy that did something weird to him and Kai. Then nothing really happens halfway through. After I'd finished season 1, I was excited to continue the series only to be met with disappointment.Apparently the primary antagonist of season...1 completely forgot why he was the primary antagonist, and apparently so did Kai. He forgot why he hated Ren, but that doesn't even matter, he just goes against what he said in season 1 which leaves you feeling like 'okay then', apparently season 1 never happened. Everyone just happened to forget about psyqualia even though it was the big major plot point for season 1.Originally I was going to give this a 6, only because I can still enjoy it, even though the story sucks for the first half of the season. But after watching it a bit more it gets a lot better, good enough to give a 7. Season 1 was just, wow, amazing. I loved it. Season 2, Kai, one of the best characters that built up the story and character development for him, Aichi and the rest of Team Q4 (and the supporting characters Miwa and Morikawa), is just not there. But all that is just knocked down and irrelevant as he is missing for half of the season without any references and everything he did in season 1 just didn't matter and the very few fights we see him in last about 30 seconds. The foundation of the story just didn't matter. However, Misaki actually has a good part in Asia Circuit-hen. Which is nice, I've been waiting to see more of her and see her have more impact in the series, other than winning 1 fight against Team Asteroid.Still, I won't knock the season entirely in this review. Aichi isn't the typical OP protagonist, even though the opportunities are there for him to be OP. The cardfights aren't clichéd, but if you've watched season 1 you can still kind of guess the outcome. I was sad to see the first opening go after the new arc, but the new one isn't all that bad. That being said, I still prefer the first one. The sound tracks, however, are more memorable. I'm not sure if I've become more aware of them considering my last review on the first season wasn't too long ago.The characters are still great. Ren is a lot more likeable, although his personality is a lot more different compared to season 1. It is to be expected since he's not completely obsessed with the power of psyqualia. Well, kinda. People don't hate each other which is nice to see, but there is still some competitive spirit and clashing/competitive BSing between characters (like Asaka and Misaki, but you can see the get along later on anyway).To summarise, you won't be watching season 2 for the plot for the first half of the season. But if you don't plan on playing the game, you won't be watching vanguard for the cardfighting game anyway. So, for those plot/character-only people, try to stay patient until around episode 18/19, it gets better and there's some kind of direction and motive for the characters.~~Now that I've actually finished it, I can safely bump the story up to 6, but overall it remains at a 7. I think it could have definitely done better and had a strong, proper direction in the beginning.The ending was indeed thrilling and the last 5 episodes were pretty solid. It was worth the wait. 1 completely forgot why he was the primary antagonist, and apparently so did Kai. He forgot why he hated Ren, but that doesn't even matter, he just goes against what he said in season 1 which leaves you feeling like 'okay then', apparently season 1 never happened.

Buzzer Beater 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2684/Buzzer_Beater_2nd_Season,"[""Now don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE basketball fan, but people have their limits as to whats acceptable and whats not in a basketball anime. I don't mind that this show is set in the distant future and how the sport is shared between aliens and humans. Thats fine but i can't stand is EVERYTHING else about the show. It's painfully obvious its aimed toward kids under the age of 10 instead of choosing to be a decently accurate anime.Story (Dreadful)It's utterly ridiculous even for normal anime standards. Like I said, the intergalactic basketball idea isn't what bothers me, but it's how they organized...every episode and how unrealistic the character choices were made for the ONLY human team in the universe (crazy point #1). On top of that, the &quot;villains&quot; all look normal except every team has one &quot;boss villain&quot; that looks ridiculously different (crazy point #2). I also found it funny how there was alot of racism towards the human race. (crazy point #3). If this was a kids show i guess its important to show them how bad it is to be different or something :PSound (Dreadful)The sound was pretty over the top. Alot of crowd sounds throughout the show. And the background music consisted of a lot of fantastic fanfare type songs like trumpets and snares and the likes. I can't say the seiyu's were that great considering how horrible the character choices were and how there was a considerable amount of screaming (as expected in a sports anime).

If anything sounded decent in the show it would have to be the closing song ...thats about it.Characters (Pathetic)The cast of characters are so utterly ridiculous that only tweens and under can appreciate such a lackluster cast. They're jokes aren't funny, they're constantly either screaming or surprised, and to top it off they all look ridiculous (humans and aliens alike). They're all drawn pretty stereotypical and on top of that how would three Japanese people, one Russian, and one TRAP be part of the &quot;best basketball team on earth&quot; then it loses any credibility of being a basketball anime. Even without the race card. ALL of their abilities are pretty weak regardless. Aren't all the players supposed to be good for the best team in the world? Not just two players?Art (Poor)If I had to find something decent about the show it would have to be the art. some points in the first few episodes they managed to put over 30fps on a few shots which were pretty cool. It's obvious that they started to lose money toward the end of the show because you only see the cool effect for the first few episodes and then you never see it again. With that, there was many more flaws. Why did they decide to give each character 4 shades of gray for shadows? you'll see a lot of shadows on shadows to accentuate their faces and muscles and such but too much shadowing is just too much. The shadows are also conflicting to the overall color theme of the show, super bright colors. It was pretty awkward to look at throughout the show. But overall even the art style was a pain to look at, from the characters to all the aliens it was pretty rough.Overall (1.8)I wouldn't wish this anime on my worst enemy. Its that bad and inaccurate....purely for kids every episode and how unrealistic the character choices were made for the ONLY human team in the universe (crazy point #1). On top of that, the &quot;villains&quot; all look normal except every team has one &quot;boss villain&quot; that looks ridiculously different (crazy point #2). I also found it funny how there was alot of racism towards the human race. (crazy point #3). If this was a kids show i guess its important to show them how bad it is to be different or something :PSound (Dreadful)The sound was pretty over the top. Alot of crowd sounds throughout the show. And the background music consisted of a lot of fantastic fanfare type songs like trumpets and snares and the likes. I can't say the seiyu's were that great considering how horrible the character choices were and how there was a considerable amount of screaming (as expected in a sports anime).

Cue!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/43735/Cue,"[""From the start, CUE! could have gone only one of two ways. It could have been either a realistic, grounded look at the joys and pains of being an entry-level voice actor in Japan, or simply cute girls doing cute things in a voice acting company. Unfortunately, it decides to steer towards the latter.This is a shame because the opening scene of our heroine Haruna doing a voiceover for a Nadia - The Secret of Blue Water-esque anime is rather fantastic. While the 80s-inspired visuals are fun in their own right, it really is the voice acting that kills it—though not in the way you'd...expect. What makes the voice acting in this scene so great is the fact that, well, it's not actually very good. Haruna's voice doesn't match the character design and she doesn't have the emotional range and expression required for a leading role—which is exactly what you'd expect from a rookie voice actor still finding her footing. It takes an incredible amount of skill to give a performance that is noticeably lacking—even to the average anime fan's ear—yet is not so bad that we think she is hopeless.Depressingly, it's almost all downhill from there. With its staggeringly large cast of sixteen rookies plus their managers and trainers, this feels like an idol anime more than anything else. Each girl in the cast is tailored to represent a different trope. We have the edgy girl, the dunce, the fashionista, the tomboy, the bookworm, and all manners of stereotypes in between, rather than anything resembling a real person you might actually find in the voice acting profession.Between having to have Hamlet explained to me and many of the girls' inability to do their job on even the most basic level, I found very little to enjoy in the back half of the episode. The exception to this, however, is getting to see the Hamlet and Ophelia scene twice. With different actors and different visuals based on those actors' performances, it really drives home the point that a difference in voice can completely alter both your perception of a character and of the entire scene itself. expect.

What an absolute gem of an anime.""Cue!"" pulls one of the greatest bait and switches of all time. It was immediately made known that the anime was going to run for two seasons, and while following Haruna and her unit was enough to hold my attention for the first few episodes, it made me wonder how quickly it would become repetitive with about 18 episodes left to go.Then without warning, the show starts branching out into the lives of the other characters. 16 total characters, to be exact.And 16 characters means 16 stories.""Cue!""...is a series without side characters.

Cue is an interesting show that is not only cute, but a simple concept, that really is a relaxing watch. It reminds me of an anime I recently watched in idolmaster, along with Shirobako. Which will impact of how I review this show, not in a bad sense, but more you'll understand as I go on. But let's go over the show!Story and characters: 7The story is about the characters themselves. But unlike certain shows, there is a dozen characters. A dozen of them. A wide enough cast, with a bunch of personalities on full display. That all want...to be one thing. That is a voice actor! Combine the two of these, and you're in for an entertaining and relaxing watch.

It\'s such an irony that it\'s almost as if there are execs knowing that the anime adaptations of their IPs would help boost their brand, so they purposely rushed their mobage games to be the less stellar versions even before the anime medium was even considered, only suddenly to realize that they too serve a very niche audience that people aren\'t buying into their mobile games, and then announcing...that the games would officially be discontinued.A3! had some decent success that ranged from mediums like stage plays to the 2020 Studio 3Hz × P.A. Works collab anime that ultimately resulted in the closing down of the global versions of the mobage just recently and the Japanese game still going as good. i★Chu, while being the very first game in the company\'s line-up, was horribly bad and overstretched, and never got any attention in the West, not like Lay-duce\'s Winter 2021 produced anime could ever hope to win over new fans to the mobage in an oversaturated Idol Otome Game franchise market to inevitably shut the doors to its game after the anime ended.The reason why I am saying of A3! and i★Chu, is because that this show, titled Cue!, is Liber Entertainment\'s latest mobile game that\'s released in 2019, and simultaneously the company\'s 3rd attempt into the anime market, only this time being all about the female CV (Seiyuu a.k.a voice-acting) training stimulation game. And you wanna know why this is significant? Because once again, the mobage company decided to ""temporarily end service"" on April 30, 2021 so that the staff can ""put forth every effort to improve the game"" and cannot state when it will be active again! Yeah right, more like pre-empting to stop and then deciding either to restart or fully stop game service because of the anime adaptation this year! If you know the adage phrase of ""a leopard never changes its spots"", it\'s a sign that a wishy-washy and stagnating company like Liber Entertainment is ""trying hard"" to segment the now BOTH oversaturated male and female idol mobage scene, and IMO, it has failed once again with Cue!. Also, I\'m just gonna say this first: the Yumeta Company × Graphinica collab produced anime stands in-between A3! and i★Chu, because it\'s between the good and bad to be average at best.So, as I was saying, Cue! is Liber Entertainment\'s 3rd cash-cow that is a simulation game where players can train up-and-coming voice actors, and this is a change in the target market towards the Seinen a.k.a young adult men audience compared to the usual fangirls of A3! and i★Chu. And the characters are based off of the various teams that they are in, doing their own thing that is still within the confines of voice-acting in general:Team Flower: Focusing on primarily anime VOs (voiceovers)...maybe TOO MUCH of this aspect- Haruna Mutsuishi (team leader), voiced by Yurina Uchiyama (member of girl group DIALOGUE+, newbie Seiyuu)- Maika Takatori, voiced by Nene Hieda (member of girl group DIALOGUE+, this season\'s Gaikotsu Kishi-sama\'s Ponta)- Shiho Kano, voiced by Kyoka Moriya (member of girl group DIALOGUE+, Ochikobore Fruit Tart\'s Hemo Midori)- Honoka Tsukii, voiced by Yuna Ogata (member of girl group DIALOGUE+, newbie Seiyuu)Team Bird: Focusing on primarily idol group events- Yuki Tendo (team leader), voiced by Ayaka Takamura (member of girl group DIALOGUE+, newbie Seiyuu)- Chisa Akagawa, voiced by: Satsuki Miyahara (member of girl group DIALOGUE+, newbie Seiyuu)- Airi Eniwa, voiced by Mayu Iizuka (member of girl group DIALOGUE+, Tamayura\'s Suzune Maekawa)- Yuzuha Kujo, voiced by Manatsu Murakami (member of girl group DIALOGUE+, Akebi-chan no Sailor-fuku\'s Akebi Komichi, Odd Taxi\'s Sakura Wadagaki)Team Wind: Focusing on primarily radio shows, and a big break in doing in-game VOs- Miharu Yomine (team leader), voiced by Yukari Anzai (Release the Spyce\'s Momo Minamoto, Lapis Re:LiGHTs\'s Tiara)- Aya Kamuro, voiced by Saki Matsuda (newbie Seiyuu)- Mahoro Miyaji, voiced by Megumi Yamaguchi (New Game!\'s Hifumi Takimoto)- Riko Hinakura, voiced by Arisa Tsuruno (newbie Seiyuu)Team Moon: Mostly a floating group carved out of necessity choosing to perform things of desire (i.e. small stage plays)- Rie Maruyama (team leader), voiced by Hina Tachibana (Oshi ga Budoukan Ittekuretara Shinu\'s Maina Ichii)- Satori Utsugi, voiced by Ami Komine (newbie Seiyuu)- Rinne Myojin, voiced by Mai Sato (newbie Seiyuu)- Mei Tomi, voiced by Rio Tsuchiya (newbie Seiyuu)Together with president Masaki Ootori and manager Rio Isuzu (both VAs Youko Hikasa and Aya Suzaki are very well-known and have a lot of experience under their belt), these 4 teams × 4 girls form the basis for the newly formed voice-acting agency AiRBLUE, which manages all 16 girls in regards to honing their techniques from scratch, making something out from the nothingness with their inexperience. Notice how just like the real world, most of the VAs here are already in the popular girl group band DIALOGUE+, or have either acted main/support roles in anime, as opposed to those whom are entirely new and raw to the anime scene, so it\'s a fair game chance for everyone to improve their skills using this anime as a stepping stone. And I see no problem with that as everyone must start somewhere.But sadly, a premise like this I can already foreshadow that it\'s not gonna work the same to have the recorded impact, much less being a 2-cour, 24 episode series to flesh out each and everyone of the characters. Which again, I have no nitpicks since there\'s more than enough time and space to allot for all characters to have their own character development. Some of them are decent-to-good, but others can come off as quite shallow and bland, like it\'s all just for motivational purposes that serve little to nothing to the entirety of the show in general (and this is even with or without the music kind). I understand that everyone needs baby steps to get to the position of their dreams, but this is literally slogging through a total combined near-10 hours series that in all honestly, it\'s just money spent that went down the drain (if given by the lackluster reputation here shown in MAL). And coming off un-fresh from the more-deserved Summer 2019\'s Re:Stage! Dream Days♪, director Shin Katagai would try this formula once again in Cue!, only this time to see it almost completely bomb. Even with capable series composer Tatsuhiko Urahata\'s work on this, nothing could ever salvage work like a director\'s orders, and Cue! ended up being a haphazard of his directorial by-product.Yumeta Company and Graphinica\'s collab production just looks average, I don\'t have anything else than to say that it just gets the job done. But if there is one thing that Cue! does right, it\'s literally the music promotion thanks in part to major music label Pony Canyon to promote new songs, and AiRBLUE\'s songs are well...decent to say the least. The 1st Cour\'s OP/ED set with ""Start Line"" and  ""Hajimari no Kanenone ga Narihibiku Sora"" is a relatively great start to the series that sets the mood for the anime to follow thereafter, and this is a set that I\'m glad to say that I\'ve enjoyed both songs (I\'d prefer the ED more). The 2nd Cour\'s OP/ED set with ""Tomorrow\'s Diary"" and ""Yume Dayori"" certainly was a lot more mellow, forgiving, and also decent at the same time. I guess when you have music composer Ryousuke Nakanishi who\'s churned out famous works like the High School DxD series, you expect Cue! to have a better-than-average OST, and it delivered as expected from someone of a great caliber.Music is the only plus point I can give to this show, everything else...can take it or leave it. Either way, I\'d hope that this is the VERY LAST time we\'ll be seeing of Liber Entertainment and the company\'s scrubby record of using other mediums to their advantage to bring in new fans, because Cue! very clearly has nothing that really stands out, and this is a tough one to recommend unless the company gets its act together to re-release the mobage. As for the anime, it\'s not necessarily idol-like, but it\'s quirks and features would allow your assumption to be. Either way, you\'re not missing out much. that the games would officially be discontinued.A3! had some decent success that ranged from mediums like stage plays to the 2020 Studio 3Hz × P.A.

But if there is one thing that Cue! does right, it\'s literally the music promotion thanks in part to major music label Pony Canyon to promote new songs, and AiRBLUE\'s songs are well...decent to say the least. The 1st Cour\'s OP/ED set with ""Start Line"" and  ""Hajimari no Kanenone ga Narihibiku Sora"" is a relatively great start to the series that sets the mood for the anime to follow thereafter, and this is a set that I\'m glad to say that I\'ve enjoyed both songs (I\'d prefer the ED more). The 2nd Cour\'s OP/ED set with ""Tomorrow\'s Diary"" and ""Yume Dayori"" certainly was a lot more mellow, forgiving, and also decent at the same time. I guess when you have music composer Ryousuke Nakanishi who\'s churned out famous works like the High School DxD series, you expect Cue! to have a better-than-average OST, and it delivered as expected from someone of a great caliber.Music is the only plus point I can give to this show, everything else...can take it or leave it. Either way, I\'d hope that this is the VERY LAST time we\'ll be seeing of Liber Entertainment and the company\'s scrubby record of using other mediums to their advantage to bring in new fans, because Cue! very clearly has nothing that really stands out, and this is a tough one to recommend unless the company gets its act together to re-release the mobage. As for the anime, it\'s not necessarily idol-like, but it\'s quirks and features would allow your assumption to be. Either way, you\'re not missing out much.', 'Cue! in my opinion suffers from too many ingredients in the soup.I really don\'t think they needed to cram 16 voice actors into the story. As a result, it necessarily has the more interesting plot lines rising to the top in season one/part one, that being the Bloom Ball anime group arc, and the singing idol group arc. The show could\'ve easily just focused on those eight characters, maybe having some other girls just in passing, much like we see in some episodes with other voice actors for the anime, for example.It seems they wanted to get as many types of girls as they...could on screen, and the storyline took a hit because of it. Maybe they focus on the other groups in part two and those arcs become more satisfying, but even so, it\'s just a lot going on. I\'d have rather they really developed a handful of characters versus splitting the time between 16 of them (plus the managers and side characters). I basically only feel anything for like three or four of them.All that said, it\'s a pretty enjoyable show overall, with the main premise being an interesting one. The interactions between the groups is wholesome and has enough intrigue to not completely fall flat. I think the show is at its best when we see the characters ""become"" their roles; when it cuts to a character transforming into their anime counterpart, or the singing group becoming their idols. That\'s about as powerful as this show gets.I also like Rio, and I\'m glad they include her working alongside the girls throughout. She gives a consistency and continuity to scenes where it can sometimes feel like we\'re bouncing between storylines. She\'s the glue that holds AiRBLUE together.I lean rating this a 6.5 in reality. Worth watching, don\'t feel like I\'m wasting my time.

The anime shows the girls\' insecurity in this life of voice actors and how they decide to move on while trying their best and having fun in the process. This anime is amazing, but underrated.

The overarching story isn't what's interesting, but rather character moments and development. I encourage...you, if you're a few episodes in and are bored by the very little progress t what I'll call 'the overall story', know that there are character-centric episodes that add up to make the majority (but not *every* girl as of Ep 19) feel more fleshed out.The art's good, the character designs feel a little same-y at the beginning just because there are so many girls in this one. But that feeling goes away, at least it does for me. There's only so many combinations of hair style, hair color, eye color, body shape and size, etc. to make 16 teenage girl anime characters feel unique.

Idolish7, Wake Up Girls, Bang Dream, Idoly Pride are just some examples in my anime watching history to name a few. Along this year in 2022, Cue! popped up on my radar and I had some expectations. However, over the course of these twenty-four episodes my expectations were not overall in the slightest. When it felt like the anime would drive a point, it would divert somewhere else and it did not help the matters. We are introduced to...sixteen newbies in the anime industry who are all aiming to be voice actresses. Now, this is where the problem starts off having to invest into sixteen main characters divided up into four groups overall. I will give the anime props for dividing the characters off into their own small sub groups to help spread things out. More times than not, it felt like two groups got more attention, screen time, and the other two were placed on the back burner. Towards the end, you are getting character backstories, struggles, and a lot of the main point  of the show taking a huge step back.I will start with this, if the goal of the anime is to introduce newbies to the voice acting industry. It needs to have a precedent of having a set age range for the characters to be put in. I understand you have elder women being seen as either the Nee-san/senpai dynamic to some of the younger women nii-san/kohai dynamic. That worked in Wake Up Girls to an extent, but Cue! failed in certain areas where you have expectations of setbacks and failures. A majority of our main characters are between fifteen to early twenties, and in my opinion this was overall mistake number one. I must stress that I did no research or dive into the mobile game rabbit hole of Cue!. In a scenario like this caliber. I would have made this show feature the main characters in the age range of eighteen to roughly about twenty-five to twenty-six years old. This is not me being ageist, but it is to add to a dynamic for the characters to help them get to point A to point B. What would have set this anime apart in a good way, is to have a dynamic of doing the senpai kohai relationships being forged in an appropriate manner. You could for all intense and purposes have a handful of characters who have been in the entertainment industry for a handful of years who have faced setbacks, failure, and constantly not getting their opportunities be a focal point. A new startup company for them that is AirBlue(the agency's name) can seem like a fresh start. You have let's say four characters in the beginning of episode one, and then they learn that there are more girls coming into the company as newbies. These four can be the respective Nee-sans/senpais for the newbies overall. The four are tasked with helping teach, train, and even overcome their inner problems while getting to be leaders of their respective sub groups. That way, they can help those under them show them the challenges of the entertainment industry and show growth. Still on the side the four nee-sans are doing their thing of being a unit of finding their own footing.I get it that this was 24 episodes, but each group should have been four focused episodes per group to show off their start points, give some hint of backstory, and find their groove. I get it that it's the entertainment industry and as a voice actress you can have a bevy of roles in your job. I found that too many of the characters were getting their feet wet far too soon than they should have and having things come their way. We do see struggles with delivering lines, dancing to name a handful of ideas. When it came to shows like Idolish7 and Wake Up Girls, we saw the main characters have to overcome their early beginnings to make it big. We see those shows have characters with setbacks, problems, being turned down, and performing in front of small audiences to start off. Cue! forces the narrative of the characters either getting main character roles in an anime as newcomers and not small parts, joining music projects to name a few things. I would have felt better as a viewer, if there were major obstacles to overcome. I know it's a tired trope to some, but would you rather have the force of getting everything already or the hurdle of climbing the walls. I felt towards the latter part of this show really dipped, and nothing was overall gained to begin with. It felt like too many cooks in the kitchen, and the pot burned badly in the end. Cue! is a show that looks like it has promise overall, but it wavers with too much getting too many chances at the beginning and then getting to the root of character backstories. Which is not a lot to begin with, and it makes the show suffer as a whole. With sixteen characters and twenty-four episodes.

DearS: Kin no Tama desu no?,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1817/DearS__Kin_no_Tama_desu_no,"[""This was originally supposed to be aired as episode 10 in the DearS TV series, but wasn't aired mostly due to excessive nudity.

Cossette no Shouzou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/514/Cossette_no_Shouzou,"[""Le Portrait de Petit Cossette is, first of all, a work that tries to be visual art, about visual art. It tries to tell what is in essence a very simple story in the first place by means of short scenes using specific visual style, and only in the second place by actual conversation and plot development that is spelled out. Thus, if, after watching the first episode you decide you really don't like the visual style used, don't bother watching the other two episodes: this series is not for you.With regard to the plot, it would be no exaggeration to state that the same...story could have been told within five minutes, nor would it be too much to say that any review of the plot would also most likely divulge what little twist there is. In essence, the story revolves around two artists and a piece of art, the portrait of a young girl, and the two differing outlooks on art these two artists have: one in the end prefers the piece of art, unchanging and everlastingly beautiful, unwilling even to acknowledge the existence of the living, changing 'original' girl, while the other prefers his art to be alive in some fashion, even if this means that change and loss exist. It is a story about the love of the artist for his art, a love that is profound enough to accept the necessity of loss, even, if necessary, of the self.Nowhere is the story explained in as much words as I've used above, or are there pieces of dialogue directly concerning this difference in outlooks on art. In fact, there is not that much dialogue at all, nor does the show try to explore the main characters: there is little in the way of actual plot or character development.This is because Le Portrait de Petit Cossette is a Romantic piece, or, more accurately, a piece of Romantic horror. The plot is a gathering of tropes from the genre, and focuses to a large extent on the passionate love of the main characters without giving much in the way of an explanation for their feelings and behaviour, wholly following the example of the greater pieces of Sturm und Drang literature, where round characters were considered less important than the strength of what little they tried to convey. Even the fact that the plot seems confusing, and that not everything is explained or neatly given a purpose within the story can be fully explained as Romantic horror: from Poe to Lovecraft the actual lack of a full explanation served to enhance the story.When all is said and done, the story might not be all that original, or contain a lot of development. It is, however, very true to form.The art is simply gorgeous. A lot of different styles are used, from simple nature backgrounds to what has been described as &quot;bargain-basement Salvador Dali&quot;, with an emphasis on portraying scenes in twilight or with light that is filtered, seemingly in order to make the few bright points stand out more. Even though not all styles work out equally fine - especially the more surrealistic scenes tend to be a bit over the top - they do usually perfectly portray the mood of a certain scene.To this is added a soundtrack consisting largely of semi-classical music that does a wonderful job in strengthening the different moods, ranging from simple, uplifting tunes to a ballad that is beautiful and haunting, even though it is sung in Japanese, which does not really fit the mood.It is true that this show is pretentious, as is, it should be said, all art, and visual arts have a tendency to be even more pretentious than music or literature: the use of a French title (containing errors in grammar, spelling, and syntax, to boot, as it should have been titled &quot;Le portrait de la Petite Cosette&quot;) is in itself proof of this, as is the bundling of a whole bunch of different musical and visual styles. On the other hand, it is quite honest about its being pretentious, and it must be said that, in the end, what matters in visual art is the art, not story, and not character. Anime is visual art, and no matter how good a series is, it will never be better than a solid book in portraying story or characters. What it adds are visuals, and these enhance the story in a way words alone can never do. To me, it is not too pretentious to try and make the story revolve around the art, and not the other way round: in a way, that seems to be what anime should in the end be about.I won't lie. I consider Le Portrait de Petit Cossette to be the best piece of film I have ever seen, without a single doubt. As implied above, it is very difficult to make an objective statement on story and art, as you either like the style, or you don't. To me the different scenes do connect, and portray a story about longing, love, and sacrifice that portray thoughts that can be felt, but not put into words - though they can be shown.In a way, I am in love with these three episodes like the protagonist is in love with the painting, and, thus, am unable to see anything that could detract from this impression. Perhaps that simple fact is the greatest compliment a show can receive. story could have been told within five minutes, nor would it be too much to say that any review of the plot would also most likely divulge what little twist there is.

Even though not all styles work out equally fine - especially the more surrealistic scenes tend to be a bit over the top - they do usually perfectly portray the mood of a certain scene.To this is added a soundtrack consisting largely of semi-classical music that does a wonderful job in strengthening the different moods, ranging from simple, uplifting tunes to a ballad that is beautiful and haunting, even though it is sung in Japanese, which does not really fit the mood.It is true that this show is pretentious, as is, it should be said, all art, and visual arts have a tendency to be even more pretentious than music or literature: the use of a French title (containing errors in grammar, spelling, and syntax, to boot, as it should have been titled &quot;Le portrait de la Petite Cosette&quot;) is in itself proof of this, as is the bundling of a whole bunch of different musical and visual styles. On the other hand, it is quite honest about its being pretentious, and it must be said that, in the end, what matters in visual art is the art, not story, and not character. Anime is visual art, and no matter how good a series is, it will never be better than a solid book in portraying story or characters. What it adds are visuals, and these enhance the story in a way words alone can never do. To me, it is not too pretentious to try and make the story revolve around the art, and not the other way round: in a way, that seems to be what anime should in the end be about.I won't lie. I consider Le Portrait de Petit Cossette to be the best piece of film I have ever seen, without a single doubt. As implied above, it is very difficult to make an objective statement on story and art, as you either like the style, or you don't. To me the different scenes do connect, and portray a story about longing, love, and sacrifice that portray thoughts that can be felt, but not put into words - though they can be shown.In a way, I am in love with these three episodes like the protagonist is in love with the painting, and, thus, am unable to see anything that could detract from this impression. Perhaps that simple fact is the greatest compliment a show can receive."", ""There are a lot of ways to frighten people and make them feel vulnerable in a primal way, and therefore there are a lot of ways to execute horror—outright screaming and slashing, psychological mind games, the appearance of the supernatural. And somewhere, buried under all of those, is a subset of horror which I internally refer to as “weird and atmospheric.” Not very professional, I know, but it's the sort of bin into which I throw things like Le Portrait de Petit Cossette, a three episode OVA that is just plain strange more so than anything else. Of course, you could also call it a...romance, or a drama, or a mystery; Cossette is a very creative and ambitious work that plays leapfrog across genre boundaries, but unfortunately, so do its numerous flaws.Cossette's story is relatively simple, but for whatever reason, its creators seem eager to make it as difficult to follow as possible. There are frequent changes in setting between the real world and a surrealistic hallucinatory world that the protagonist visits. These transitions take place with little tact, and they give the series a very warped sense of chronology which is only added to by the use of repetitive flashbacks to events that happened only minutes ago. There is little to no explanation offered as to what this surreal world actually represents, and the OVA seems to take it for granted that the audience will be able to interpret the significance (if there is any) of the events that transpire there without much help, a proposition that's dubious at best and downright foolish at worst. What's happening in the real world isn't very interesting, either; the protagonist's group of age-appropriate female friends are noticing that he's having a bit of a mental breakdown, they're all concerned with his well-being, and they take various actions to try to ensure his safety. This story thread ultimately serves very little purpose, and is more or less just a distraction from the central plot. To even understand that plot requires using tremendous amounts of speculation and assumption to fill in the gaping holes left by the writers. I'm confident that I'm a reasonably attentive viewer, and I don't feel at all embarrassed to say that on the first watch of Cossette, I could only guess at what was happening for at least forty percent of the OVA's running length. There's a fine line between minimalistic storytelling and poor storytelling. It gets crossed here, in spades.I wish I could say that the characters swooped in and redeemed everything, but it wasn't to be. Our male lead, Eiri, an amateur artist who owns an antique shop, is a neat concept, but he has all the personality of a dishrag, and is little more than a tool used to push an overly obvious thematic agenda on the audience. The same can be said of Cossette, the doomed young daughter of foreign nobility whose soul is trapped in a decorative glass; what a great idea, and what a shockingly lackluster execution. Her lack of character might be explained away by the idea that she is supposed to represent an object of obsession rather than a person, but the fact that she responds in kind to Eiri's love sort of voids that entire train of thought. There's an attempt at romance, but I've said it before and I'll probably say it again—romance holds no meaning when neither character is even identifiable as an individual. Supporting roles, you ask? Welcome to the cast of cliches: A close female friend who is in love with Eiri but has difficulty showing it, two local psychics who give Eiri vague spiritual advice (such gems as “there's a soul in everything”), a hard-nosed doctor who notices Eiri's failing mental and physical state, a girl smitten with Eiri who works at a local restaurant. They're introduced haphazardly and, again, we're often left to make assumptions about who they even are and what their relationship is to Eiri. Most of them are cardboard cutouts graced with the privilege of about two or three lines of dialogue, and their role in the story as a whole is rather unnecessary. There's some kind of halfhearted harem drama between the overly zealous friend who is in love with Eiri and the rest of the cast. This element isn't very well thought out, nor does it have any place in the OVA, and it falls more or less flat.Artistically, Cossette has a lot of merit. The production values are reasonably high. The character designs are inoffensive. The backgrounds are lovely, ranging from verdant forests to foggy city streets, and the atmosphere created in the bowels of Eiri's dusty antique store is suitably eerie. Somewhere along the line, though, Cossette trades all of that for a ridiculous amount of CGI, editing, and visual trickery that's really quite annoying. It turns into a regular slideshow of artistic tricks-of-the-trade. Name a strange camera angle, lighting or filtering choice, or visual distortion, and the odds are pretty good that it's here. Cossette just can't resist: A shot through stained glass here, a weird point-of-view through a digital camera there, an overlay of flickering static, an endless pan over a computer-generated landscape. Words cannot even describe the number of techniques in play here, most of which serve no purpose other than as a sort of directorial “hey, look what I can do!” In terms of the technical implementation, they might very well be flawless, but I'll be damned if I can see a reason for their awkward inclusion. The OVA is actually at its best when none of these are employed. The halls and darkened storage rooms of Eiri's store, with antiques stacked around him like tombstones, are a lot more unsettling than the tactless barrage of seizure-inducing effects.If you're the type to look at the staff listing, you might be able to guess that there's one aspect of Cossette that is tough to complain about, and that's the music. Yuki Kajiura does what she does best: Sweeping modern orchestral compositions backed by chanted vocals, intricate piano melodies, soft and haunting atmospheric noise. The soundtrack sounds great both in the context of the OVA and on its own. It doesn't sound as clear or as polished as her later work, but it's arguably as good as any other musical score she's been involved with, and that should say just about everything; it's grade-A, plain and simple. It's not terribly difficult to label the soundtrack as Cossette's strongest element. Imagine judging a dog show where the only contestants are a beautiful golden retriever and a dead possum. That's the choice I had to make.Harsh words all around, and yet, that number does say five, which is far from the worst available score. Cossette might have inexcusably poor writing, but it does have some technical merits to fall back on, and I'll begrudgingly admit that it's a captivating watch even though the visuals are obnoxious. It's also a very creative idea, and while that idea ultimately isn't capitalized on, I can tell that it is trying to make an ambitious statement about art and the nature of human interaction with art. This thematic material isn't handled well at all, but the fact that there's even any thematic material worth mentioning in the first place is something. In a word, Cossette is a mess, and I really can't give it the most enthusiastic praise, but creativity and ambition are present, and if nothing else, it's certainly a unique piece of work. romance, or a drama, or a mystery; Cossette is a very creative and ambitious work that plays leapfrog across genre boundaries, but unfortunately, so do its numerous flaws.Cossette's story is relatively simple, but for whatever reason, its creators seem eager to make it as difficult to follow as possible.

Golden locks glisten under the flicker of a saffron flame.  The soft, supple facial features radiate pure ineffable beauty, displaying no discernment of imperfection. She is the stimulus that evokes profound imagination, via the means of simply existing.  Her fortuitous, biological circumstances have destined her to inject inspiration into the psyche of the perceptive virtuoso, to invigorate him to produce marvelous portraits of exquisite splendor.  She is the beacon that guides his creative spirit towards its fullest potential, realizing the...end goal of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.She is Essential.  She is Beautiful.  She is Perfection.  She is a Muse.If the perceived perfection is identified as genuine, is it not irresponsible to allow ne plus ultra beauty to be squandered to the inexorable flow of time?  Marchello Orlando, a man obsessed with the unparalleled beauty of his “lover,” believed it immoral to permit such beauty to wither away — even if it required the assassination of the angelic person, whom he professed his adoration.  For Marchello, terminating inimitable elegance was paramount in the pursuit of “preserving” his masterwork(s).  But art is not an exercise in preservation, rather it’s a rendition of singular moments/conceptions that are ever-fleeting.  The art, itself, is preserved, but the transient process is lost to the annals of time.   Eiri Kurahashi, a young artist who becomes entranced by Cossette d’Auvergne’s haunting beauty, discovers the ennui of drawing a pseudo preservation of Marchello’s “divine” deed.  In a physical and emotional catharsis, Eiri uses his own blood to paint a stunning portrait of his tormenting muse.

It is said that “the eyes are the windows of the soul,” and given that the doll (Cossette) has no eyes, she, invariably, has no soul.  By virtue of his blood pact with Cossette, Eiri offers his own soul as a form of reparation for “his” past ill deeds.  He is, after all, the reincarnation of Marchello.

Where to start.... Well, the storyline is pretty good, but there are several flaws that come with it. The main flaw, is that there are several times where you have to &quot;fill-in-the-blanks&quot; yourself, or in other words, perhaps go back and watch it several times to undertsnad it. Anohter flaw is a lot similar to this is where you might wonder how the main character ends up in a particular place, just out of the blue. The story is actually for the most part quite well made but just with several flaws. The art is, in my opinion, very breath-taking....It is much more detailed than other Anime I've watched other than &quot; The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. The sound is probably the best part in my opinion, and I highly reccomend downloading or buying the Soundtrack. (I would give out a particular link but since MyAnimeList has asked me not to, I will do much to oblige them).=) But anyway, the music during each episode goes along so well with the story, keeping you interested the entire way through. The characters are great for the mst part. I did however think that they coud have made Eiri, the main character, sound a lot better with some better dialogue. Cossette is by far the best character in the story, including movements, actions, and dialogue. I enjoyed a lot and reccomend it to anyone. EXCEPT-kids. This is probably the most gothic Anime I have watched, and it is very, very gory and bloody. There is some slight nudity, but nothing too too, inappropriate. Overall it was very good, in fact, it was much better than I thought it would be. If you are into the whole romance anime mixed with some action fighting-for-the-one-you-love-with-gothic style, then by God, this Anime is definitely for you!

For the next five weeks we'll be looking at things that go bump in the night. Experience suggests that most of them will not actually be scary in the slightest in spite of the genre label. In fact, I think the only truly frightening anime I've ever reviewed in October was Perfect Blue and everything else just used horror to mean “there are monsters.” In any case, let's start the month off with Le Portrait de Petit Cosette which is a bit unique for an anime in that it's not based on anything. The three episode OVA was...produced by Daume, the studio responsible for Onegai Teacher and Shiki. There is a manga, but it's based on the OVA instead of the other way around. Let's turn out all the lights and take a look.Our story begins with our protagonist, Eiri, hanging out with some friends. But don't get attached to them because they'll only appear in one other, brief scene. They talk briefly about love and Eiri runs off for his part time job at his uncle's antique shop. He spends some time just holding and looking at a glass. A glass that seems to contain a girl that only he can see. The biggest problem with this OVA is that it meanders. What I mean by that is that there are a lot of scenes that go nowhere and don't tie into the main plot. Not only that, but the animation will frequently shift to random things (a street, a mailbox, tableware, bamboo, butterflies, etc...) during conversations. I still can't figure out whether this is supposed to be disconcerting or it's just a way to pad the OVA. If it's the former it doesn't work. The latter would seem more probable since this OVA drags. You wouldn't think I'd be able to say that about something that lasts all of three episodes, but it does. There are long stretches of scenes that just show random objects or filled with scene after scene where nothing of value happens. You could probably cut this down to a single episode if you only kept the relevant parts. Don't expect actual horror from this either. A lot of what happens is strange and/or kind of nonsensical but not frightening. There are some scenes that have promise, but the effect they could have had ends up getting spoiled by random object cuts and pointless scenes.The characters are pretty dull. Eiri and Cosette are really the only ones who matter, possibly Mataki if you stretch the meaning of “matter.” They could have developed the characters if they had spent less time on pointless moments, but they don't. They start out as  stock characters and experience very little growth as things progress.The art is pretty good. The random shifts and transitions may not do anything from a story perspective, but the things they cut to are drawn well. There are a lot of really good details in the backgrounds as well. Which I paid close attention to as nothing of merit was happening in the foreground most of the time. The character art looks pretty good as well. The biggest issue with the art comes when they try to do a “scary” scene and random objects of wildly shifting art styles start coming at you. Which just looks odd. Their attempt at drawing a monster, which oddly enough has a negligible effect on the plot, just looks silly. I honestly laughed out loud when I first saw it. They also like to do randomly tilted shots throughout the series. Which just look stupid and out of place.The voice acting ranges quite a bit in quality. Inoue Marina gives an excellent performance, and it's the only aspect of the OVA that actually comes across as creepy. But then you have Saiga Mitsuki and Toyoguchi Megumi who are just okay. You also have Ebara Masashi who, thankfully, only appears in one scene in which he over-acts like hell. I know he can act, I've heard him do it in Xenosaga and Fullmetal Alchemist, to name a couple examples. The effects, are not at the level of the acting. They try to create this disconcerting cacophony, but it just ends up spoiling the effect in a lot of cases. Inoue Marina will be delivering her lines in a genuinely creepy way, but then the effects will make her voice sound tinny, for lack of a better term, and the creepiness will be gone or the effects will be louder than the character voices and it'll be hard to hear what they're doing. The music is just pretty typical of “horror” fare.The ho-yay factor is a 1/10. This has no ho-yay. The cast is overwhelmingly female, but they can't be bothered to develop their relationships in any way, romantic or otherwise. Most of the male characters only appear in a scene or two.This is the best anime I've seen in the past four weeks. Which admittedly isn't saying much since the other anime were the two first series of Sekirei and Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari. The bottom line is that there are some moments that could have been effective but they're diluted by a whole lot of pointless scenes and random transitions. Still, I do recommend watching it, with two or three friends. Why? Because Le Portrait de Petit Cosette lies in that realm of dullness and semi-stupidity that makes for excellent snark material. Watch it to poke fun at it and it will lead to entertaining moments for you and friends. But as a serious horror piece I have to give it a 4/10. It's mostly just pretty dull but inoffensive. Horror anime month will continue next week with a look at the only horror anime on my request queue, Blue Gender. produced by Daume, the studio responsible for Onegai Teacher and Shiki.

The cast is overwhelmingly female, but they can't be bothered to develop their relationships in any way, romantic or otherwise. Most of the male characters only appear in a scene or two.This is the best anime I've seen in the past four weeks. Which admittedly isn't saying much since the other anime were the two first series of Sekirei and Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari. The bottom line is that there are some moments that could have been effective but they're diluted by a whole lot of pointless scenes and random transitions. Still, I do recommend watching it, with two or three friends. Why? Because Le Portrait de Petit Cosette lies in that realm of dullness and semi-stupidity that makes for excellent snark material. Watch it to poke fun at it and it will lead to entertaining moments for you and friends. But as a serious horror piece I have to give it a 4/10. It's mostly just pretty dull but inoffensive. Horror anime month will continue next week with a look at the only horror anime on my request queue, Blue Gender."", 'THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Usually, I tend to watch anime for their plot and characters. Cossette no Shouzou is the perfect example of a show that does not need them to succeed. It may follow a main story, but what\'s most important is its artistic ingeniousness. And I do not mean its art or animation; I mean everything about this fictional work. The music, the animation techniques, the simple story with its thrilling portrayal, and last but not least; the fact that it revolves around art itself. Truly, Cossette no Shouzou is not an easy watch for everyone. It\'s a niche piece of art, full...of risks and pretentiousness. But it knows very well what it is, and that\'s what makes it beautiful and fascinating.To begin my short analysis, I\'ll mention what I found best - and this was the atmosphere. On one hand, we have Yuki Kajiura (Noir, Kara no Kyoukai, Fate/Zero) giving it her best to create the most fitting horror vibes with her music, on the other hand we have Shinbou Akiyuki (Madoka Magica, Monogatari series) who is a unique director, and loved by his audience. If you ask me, the result is magical and this is one of the best collaborations I have ever seen in anime. Even if you don\'t really care about the story, you cannot overlook the exceptional atmosphere. You get spooked, you get hooked; it is the definition of successful horror.Furthermore, I\'ll have to say a few things about the story. It is clear from the beginning that the story is far from normal, the events happening are surreal and the writing is full of exaggerations and metaphorical approach. Now, it all starts with a young artist called Eiri, and his obsession with a supernatural phenomenon only he can see; a girl, trapped inside an antique glass. What follows up includes a gory and full of suffering yet romantic horror story, and a big contrast between two different kinds of artists. It also jumps from the 21st to the 18th century, there\'s a slightly historical viewpoint, ethical demarcation and a little bit of philosophy. Just in case you haven\'t watched it yet, I\'ll only leave a touch of what happens in Cossette no Shouzou here and leave some spoilers for the next paragraph.In this paragraph, concerning details about what messages the show wants to convey, spoilers are unavoidable. Like I said on the title, it\'s one of the most misunderstood fictional works and that\'s because the storytelling and flow of events are messy and chaotic. The main message is that of the main story; the difference between an artist who likes stable and everlasting art, and another one who admires and respects change and evolution, whether it is good or bad for the art itself. How different a work of art can be, if the artist\'s mindset and viewpoints are different as well. And it\'s not just about painters; it\'s about any human\'s approach on life. The way the plot point is expressed is tricky and full of metaphors, but it leads to something pretty simple. Nevertheless, Cossette no Shouzou has many other things to share with the viewer. One of those is woman\'s endless suffering, in all periods and eras of humanity. If you think about it, it\'s another tragic story with a bad ending for a female human, and the fact that Cossette\'s soul is enslaved for so long in the world she had already died is just a result of all the malevolent energy created by suffering and unfairness. Eiri, on the other hand, is also the victim here; he\'s the ""good"" kind of guy, who feels for the girl and tries to protect her. Traumatized and ignorant, Cossette will not accept him and will torture him until she is satisfied. But since there are heavy tones of romanticism in this work, it is implied that a positive attitude is praiseworthy and will prevail. This is something I really liked, and it was clearly shown by Mataki\'s last line as well.To end this review, the main reason I\'m writing it is because I watched this anime OVA yesterday and it can\'t leave my mind yet. Its music, its visuals, its atmosphere. That\'s because of the great work studio Daume made back in 2004 and the beautiful, haunting, short artsy trip it took me to. It\'s very rare for an anime to stay stuck on my mind, and it is one more reason to consider this anime a big success. It\'s far from perfect - even its french name is wrongly written - but at least it does not try to achieve perfection and it shows it is fine having some flaws.

Big respect to the staff!', ""The art in this anime is outstanding! But that's about all it has going for it. It's an anime that you just have to hate it or like it. The story line is confusing but as it goes on its a little bit more understandable. I definetly wouldn't recommend watching the dubbed version. I also dont get the fact that a French woman understands and speaks Japanese. Some of the characters are nerve racking and also not needed in the story line. Overall this isnt a terrible anime but no where near the best. "", ""Even if you don't like/watch anime, I assure you Le Portrait De Petite Cossette would blow your mind. Very mature and serious, something that is hard to find on anime, but still has that wild fantasy atmosphere with demons and art that could only be found in anime (and of course that Lolita character which, again, could only be found in anime) so both anime lover and non-lover could enjoy this OVA very much (yeah it's not anime, but OVA, only 3 episodes).Other than beautiful and and wild art, Yuki Kajiura as the composer of this anime's soundtrack had done an amazing job by composing...a Gothic, solemn, dark, and classic European sounded like music, but manage to add Japanese characteristic to it. I downloaded the OST. too and fell in love with it, Miss Kajiura is a genius, Houseki of course being the best.While very much enjoyable, the storyline might be a little bit difficult to follow thus you need to watch it without blinking your eyes, especially on the last episode. And seems like Eiri and Cossette were the only characters in here while the other girls were additional, maybe so it could have more than just two characters. They don't add much to the story though.Overall, this is a must wathc for anyone who loves something dark, Gothic, horror, psychological, yet romantic. a Gothic, solemn, dark, and classic European sounded like music, but manage to add Japanese characteristic to it.

An art student named Eiri comes across a beautiful small goblet. He begins to see an image of a young girl in the reflection of the glass. Eiri soon learns that the girl inside of the glass named Cossette was brutally murdered 250 years ago. After Eiri makes a blood pact with Cossette. The spirits whom witnessed her murder seek vengeance on the murderer's soul, and their intentions are to use Eiri as their instrument. Eiri soon vows to help Cossette even though it may end his life.-At first glance, when coming into this short OVA...the viewer will find themselves in awe with the production values. Le Portrait de Petit Cossette aka Petite Cossette is a beautiful assault on all of the senses. The moving soundtrack was done by Noir composer Yuki Kajiura, so one whom is familiar with her work already knows to expect a quality soundtrack. The BGM compliments the dark and Gothic setting, with classical pieces consisting of eerie piano keys and chords. Visually, the series is a work of art and it's leaps beyond the usual short episode OVA format. The artwork is gorgeous with Cossette's character design being influenced by the Victorian Era of 1830's Europe.The animation is a sight to see with fluid character movements, and the cinematography is also well used when displaying images, as well as character reflections through and off glass with amazing camera angles. This is also in combination with a vibrant color palette. The style of the series reminds me of both Soul Taker and Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo. If I was the type of viewer whom prefered visuals over a story, then this would be among my favorites.Now getting to the story, which is the soul of any form of visual entertainment in my view. The style of storytelling present in this short OVA may turn away plenty of viewers. Although the story itself is rather simple, in which it's a tale of blind love, utilizing the dark themes of obsession and revenge with a supernatural backdrop. The route taken seems almost as if the writers wanted to confuse the viewer. The story is delivered in flashbacks, visions, illusions, and dialogue, which makes it difficult to tell exactly what is going on. This really isn't a bad approach, however in the case of the less patient or action oriented. It will leave them with very little reason to care what's going on. Personally, I have nothing against this style of non linear storytelling, because it's actually a refreshing change once in awhile. I commend the screenwriter Mayori Sekijima and director Akiyuki Shimbo for taking a simple premise and turning it into a half way or so brain twister; but I've seen this done far better.I liked the themes that the series works on, because it pretty much shows it can lead to a destructive path. However, the writing tip toes very close to the realm of horror. These darker themes are exploited through torture sequences and even murder; butI feel that these scenes along with the blood and gore are greatly exaggerated. It's nowhere near disturbing or brutal as others describe it from where I see it. To me, it kind of loses its effectiveness due to constant overuse.I don't believe the characters were properly used. As it should be, the main characters Cossette and Eiri, are the only ones whom are focused on and actually developed; but in the case of Eiri, it's very hard to buy into him because I can't see someone falling in love with a girl he doesn't know, and is willing to give his life for her as well. There simply wasn't enough work put into this story element, and I feel it wasn't properly fleshed out. I think the character development was sloppy, and the disposable secondary cast could have used less screen time, because they were poorly developed and most served no purpose at all.Even though personally I'm not bothered by it too much; others may be very disturbed by the Lolita thing going on between Eiri and Cossette. Eiri is obviously an adult over 18, while Cossette appears to be around 12 years old. I understand this is accepted in some parts but I'm not sure if I'll ever be completely use to that.Petite Cossette is a series that had potential and could have been a lot better, but I don't praise things due to what it could have been. I will give credit in areas and that's about it. So the series isn't a failure from where I see it, but it's far from great. I do not for any reason recommend this to the action oriented. This is not an action themed series on any level, it's a drama using horror-ish elements. I think this will mainly appeal to those with patience, and die hard otakus who must see everything anime.Highs: Outstanding visuals and soundtrack, cinematographyLows: Undeveloped secondary characters, style will not appeal to many the viewer will find themselves in awe with the production values.

Most. Disturbing. Anime. I. Have. Ever. Seen.  I saw the first of this three-episode miniseries, and I\'m NOT planning to watch the rest.A young man falls in love...with a glass goblet?  He can\'t explain just why.  He carries it with him everywhere; looks at it, fondles it.  But soon this goblet starts affecting him, giving him dreams.  Is there a young girl\'s spirit trapped inside?  What does she want from him?  What plans remain unfulfilled from her life?It seemed interesting at first, with the mystery surrounding the goblet.  And the animation style was very...artsy and interesting.  (It was attractive enough that I raised my rating from, say, a 3 to a 5)  But as the episode progressed, it became very disturbing.  It entered surrealist scapes, littered with discolored human bones and body parts.  Blood gushes, bodies mutate, imagery of death and fear seep and sop.  The ""weird"" twists normalcy.  By the end, I wanted to vomit.So I\'d only recommend this if you can stomach super-horror.  The style was attractive at first.  And the story could end up being interesting.

My reason for doing treating the ""review"" process this way, in the case of Le Portrait de Petit Cossette (or ""Cossette no Shouzou,"") is because of how this anime was referred to me for viewership... Through the internet, via a small community of dedicated fans, whose voices eventually reached me over the sounds of an overwhelmingly mediocre public reception. You may have also heard these whispers on the wind.""Cossette is a masterpiece.""""Cossette is the only anime to have ever changed my life.""Such musings may have been what led you to consider...this anime, and by proxy this recommendation. Whether that may be the case or not, such earnest, impassioned proclamations of greatness are very rare to hear about anime these days, in the age of indifference. When they are made, even less often should they be taken seriously.Yet, time after time, I would continue to hear these whispers. Always, they were consistent in their tone and treatment of this anime. They guided me along my path of consideration, ever tempting me to defy my usual skepticism of anything directed by Akiyuki Shinbo. They cried out, with a genuine enthusiasm and love for anime, that more people should give this short OVA a try. Try as I might to rid myself of them, they were like a bad case of schizophrenia. I acknowledged those voices for years.I ultimately listened to those voices, and then I became one of them. In an abstract sort of way, that very experience-- of being whispered to, and then sublimated into an increasing belief-- defines ""Cossette"" in under one sentence.To speak further on the matter of my impression without going into details of the subject matter at hand: I went into this OVA preparing to be disappointed, only to have my expectations blown away within minutes. You know that an anime is truly great when it torpedoes everything below the level of Perfect Blue (to which, I think ""Cossette"" can be meaningfully compared.) As a matter of fact, I think there is a legitimate debate to be had about whether or not ""Cossette"" is superior to Perfect Blue. I feel that it definitively is, and I recognize that is an extremely bold claim to make, but I digress. Speaking as to Shinbo\'s own catalogue, ""Cossette"" obliterates everything else the man has ever made. I will make it clear, again, that Shinbo is not one of my favorite directors. I find his works to be largely overrated, and extremely pretentious. If he is not your favorite director either, I agree with you. Even so, it is my strong opinion that ""Cossette"" actually delivers in both style and substance, and is therefore worth your time in spite of the man behind the myth.Having made it this far into my recommendation, I\'m sure that you\'ve also noticed by now that this anime rates very low on MyAnimeList, relative to the high praises that it only occasionally merits from hardcore otaku. As of my writing this review, ""Cossette"" is communally rated with a score of 6.78. That is a horrible score on this website, especially when one considers how highly the public at-large rates the usual dross. Therefore, you probably want to remark on this, and likely possess some legitimate questions as to whether I am blowing smoke up your ass or not. I am not here to decide that for you. I will, however, disclose the following:Prior to watching this anime, I had never before been forced to consider if it was even possible that any anime media (including TV. series, OVAs, movies, etc...) could rise up to or surpass the level of Evangelion & EoE. I finally decided that the two were not immediately comparable, due primarily to a stark difference in run time. That being said, the fact that I would only raise this question one time in my entire life, despite having seen, and documented my completion of nearly 350 anime media titles, should lend itself as an additional force towards convincing you that it is worth two hours of your time. this anime, and by proxy this recommendation.

That it means nothing. That they - the unhappy viewer - needs more from their anime than random events strewn together without logic. As if the road to nowhere is not interesting in and of itself to them. It makes me wonder, why don\'t we expect our concept of narrative to be challenged more in the anime we consume? Why don\'t we put forth as much effort in confronting art, as the artist has put forth in confronting us?the story is  about a young...man uncovers a delicate Venetian glass that holds a startling secret within: a haunted beauty, named Cossette, has been waiting 250 years for someone to set her spirit free. The man soon becomes obsessed and determined to help the girl trapped inside the crystal, but the necessary physical and psychological sacrifices might be too great for him to bear.We are talking visual poetry here. For almost the entire 3 eps, every square inch of screen is minutely painted. Ordinary criticism doesn\'t apply, there is no comparison between this and any other anime.So many scenes have you holding your breath in awe. The smallest movement of light is choreographed precisely, the glass, the paintings, the dolls..these are not simply images of those things, but the ungraspable nature of life, beauty, love, memory. So much more lies beneath the surface, as we are shown a reflection in a glass that momentarily purports to be reality, but need not necessarily be interpreted as such.It\'s not easy to make such judgments, but this is my favorite anime. A personal choice, for sure, but what Cossette no Shouzou achieves is the height of poetry and literature. Its final moment, if it works for you (and I can imagine it wouldn\'t for all), is a success of the ""method of indirection"" sought by poetry. Its effect is cumulative and devastating.I cannot recommend this anime highly enough.

And I you, ...werewolf guy!]""French aristocrat Cossette falls for Marcelo, an Italian artist who stays with her family. He find her to be the epitome of Beauty and paints several portraits of her. She falls for him, of course, and the two become engaged (why her family allows her to take up with a mooching artist I don\'t fully understand - he wasn\'t a particularly good one). He loves her as well, except what he loves is her beauty and youth, not who she really is.So, inevitably during the course of his last portrait he fall madly in love... with his work; and  once it is finished he decides that he cannot abide to her growing older, so he does what any sensible mad artist would in his position [alt. version: so he does the only reasonable thing he can think of and] and slaughters her along her whole family (for good measure) so that she will remain forever young and beautiful.Which is just fucked up enough for her to become a vengeful spirit that eventually finds our protagonist (he\'s Marcelo\'s reincarnation - SURPRISE!) and bequeath him with the Eternal damnation of pain and suffering (FUN!) through the \'memories\' of the objects that witnessed the betrayal so long ago (she has very loyal cupboards). Each one witnesses said betrayal from a different perspective and so keeps a different \'memory\' of what happened, who whom and forms an opinion of how badly the protagonists should suffer because of it. Protagonist is a masochist with Stockholm Syndrome, so he naturally falls deeply in love with his imaginary tormentor. Keep in mind that however dark or surreal this anime becomes it is still a Magical Girl series at heart, so keep an eye out for the twisted transition ""quick change"" sequence (please see Hell Girl for another example of this art form).Later, when we get to the clock phase we see Cossette grow older, which is an interesting plot \'twist\' and Eiri Kurahashi (protagonist torture unit) states that he loves Cossette and will no longer fight against the torture since it means being with her (he is related to a madman, it\'s just a different kind of crazy here).   A while later she falls in love with him and decides that she doesn\'t want him to suffer the way Christ did and decides to leave the poor man be. This is where it gets even more fun!So, I forgot to mention it but there\'s a ""love interest"" (by love interest we mean she loves and he\'s obviously not interested as he has fallen for Dorian Grey\'s prototype). She pretty much only comes in to shout his name and get angry at him. And her age seems to change as often as her name does; I spent most of the anime thinking she was his mother or older sister or something and if that wasn\'t confusing enough different people refer to her by different names (family + given) and the way it is executed meant I spent the whole anime thinking there was ""Mataki - her"" the older cranky aunt and ""Shouko"" a faceless fellow student (same age) who loves him. Little did I know they were the same person the whole time!! And not only that - it turns out that she is the reincarnation of Cossette (or at least she becomes her later - it isn\'t clear which).Also, remember the painting that Marcelo was so madly in love with? Well, it turns out it reciprocated with the passion of 1000 fiery suns! And not only that - it\'s the jealous type! So we discover, far too long afterward, that Kurahashi was tricked into thinking Cossette came back for him and decided to love him for eternity. Except it was the painting the whole time, angry and jealous that Marcelo\'s reincarnation loved the real Cossette instead of it. But once he figures it out he beats it pretty quick - how one might ask? Well that\'s easy, he just says he implies that he loves the real Cossette for who she is and then paints her portrait with his own blood (still related to Marcelo, still crazy). This is apparently a ""warmer"" likeness and so it defeats the evil painting, thereby taking out the dreaded curse and it is implied that everyone lives ... surreally ever after.This is an odd anime, particularly because I couldn’t tell if it took itself seriously or not. On the one hand, it seems as though the artist just finished taking a course in Surrealism and wanted to apply it somewhere without fully understanding the best method of execution. Then on the other hand we have perverse magical girl transformation sequences and (this is my favourite part of the anime) a scene toward the end of the first episode where Kurahashi actually passes a wall in an alleyway on the way home from dropping off the folio that has been tagged “Gothic and Lolita loves me so much that he would forsake his own dear life... could it be you? If someone were to drown in the sea for me, I would be released from the stone, back to life. I would return to life.

Pun intended much?)There are a lot of gory scenes of the story, most very central yet some wer random at best.Yet the scenes of which portrayed the most misery and pain for Eiri weren't actually the scary ones.A must recommend for those interested in mystery horror type stories. "", ""Le Portrait de Petite Cossette is an ambitious attempt at high-minded horror which falls flat on its face. It is a bland, overwrought mess, and even at 3 episodes is a genuine waste of time. Beginning with the story, there is little to say in its favor, as it's broadly bad. Though, at the very least the concept upon which it is built is interesting. There's nothing wrong with the idea of haunted antiques attached to an 18th century murder, but the real problems come with how the show chooses to execute that idea. The 'twists', if you can call them that, can be seen...from a mile away, and the main story upon which the plot relies is so barren and anemic that all the various fever dream sequences that this show subjects you to serve no other purpose than to pad for time. This lazy approach to storytelling is a major factor in what makes Le Portrait de Petite Cossette disorienting, pretentious drivel. The other major accomplice in this regard is the art. Beginning with the good, the backgrounds are detailed and colorful, same with the wild 'fight' sequences, though it would be more apt to describe them as torture sequences. Moving on to the bad, there are a multitude of sins to cover. A great deal of shots, including the aforementioned torture sequences, are frequently and shamelessly reused. Every character, with little exception, is ugly as sin, especially the 'protagonist', if he even deserves that title. Also, they all suffer from the 'dreaded mask', where emotion is not properly displayed or animated on character faces when it absolutely should be, resulting in a jarring, mask-like emotionlessness. Disorienting animation choices are also ubiquitous, with flashing colors, static, and often nauseating shot composition coming together in the hopes of distracting the viewer from how mediocre this show is. The sound is, oddly enough, this show's strongest point by a mile. The voice acting and sounds of life are perfectly serviceable, but it is the music that truly stands out as a lone credit in this garbage heap. It manages to range from mysterious and foreboding to sweet and saccharine and even all the way to epic and soaring choral compositions in a way that seems effortless and, while not the best score in anime, is regardless a commendable effort. Though, this is not nearly enough to save Le Portrait de Petite Cossette. Ultimately, all the effort the music goes through to save this show is buried by the characters which feature in it. Every one of them feel like strange marionettes, strung along by necessity from one scene to the next, making decisions which make no sense and coming to conclusions nobody would ever come to. Overall, Le portrait de Petite Cossette is not worth your time, and while it's definitely not the worst anime out there, it's still pretty bad. Do not watch, even for the OST,\xa0 as it would be a better use of your time to listen to it on YouTube instead of subjecting yourself to the garbage anime it is attached to. from a mile away, and the main story upon which the plot relies is so barren and anemic that all the various fever dream sequences that this show subjects you to serve no other purpose than to pad for time.

He is pretty much known for his little girls and for anything that had to deal with mind games. Some of the shows he has done like this include Dance in the Vampire Bund, Negima, Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei, and Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase. This is a mindgame with a young girl.If we want to talk about characters, the only ones that mean anything are Eiri Kurahashi and Cossette. There really isn’t much in the story that shows just who these people are actually and so the characters seem bland. We do get story...line from Cossette but nothing that actually shows her personality. She is just a little girl but she is nothing innocent at all. It’s like she’s a demon the way she acts around Eiri and by the second episode, I stopped feeling sorry for her because she became like the no name Elfen Lied girls. All she really did was torture porn. Even though she is rather young, has the heart of a jaded lover inside her. She is rather manipulative and a strange trickster.Eiri isn’t much better, in fact, he’s worse. We get no info on his back story or personality, nothing about his friends that he was around in the beginning (we only see them once) and the girls that he’s around are bland and again, we hear nothing about how they are together. It’s just boring. There wasn’t something for me to grasp onto so I was sitting there laughing about how stupid he was for throwing his life away for someone he barely knew.The storyline would have been better if it was either longer with more detail in the story, or a movie. I would choose the first since a movie like this may be a little two hard to do. It’s sad you can’t feel for any of the characters at all.The artwork is rather pretty, the details striking. Cossette seems to feel more like a doll in some parts though, much too pretty and porcelain like with her pale skin and sweet eyes. Unfortunately, it becomes a bit to oil paint-ish in a lot of parts. When that happens, they look like still shots. The only thing that really awesome is the shots. It’s a lot of surreal angles and out of control beauty where we don’t see the stupid looking characters in the back room. Mostly, I think this was done with the idea that they wouldn’t have to animate much.The music is hunting and playful, almost like a music box. The English voice acting sounds rather well done. Maybe a bit too well then it has any business being, although it does start to sound cheesy when they start talking in poetics.

It's making fun of people who look at pretentious pieces of work by creating a character, Eire, who is absolutely infatuated with Cossette who has no depth, value, or substance. The only thing she has to offer is death, and for some ungodly reason, he still pursues her.For instance, those who look at this work and see it as a work of art beyond itself are merely playing into the folly of its beauty. This statement is incredibly ironic due to the fact that Cossette no Shouzou in itself is filled with depth and meaning but not in the...sense that most people may pick up on right away.This is exactly what we do as an audience when we fall in love with something that is not worthy of its praise. We kill it, replace it with our own image, and then from then on out it's forever this new thing that isn't anything close to the original.

This further iterates the notion mentioned above that we kill the things we love based solely on their outward expression and not on what they actually are. We've separated our ability to truly unite with that individual because we've already killed who they are from our perspective.I could get into detail further about how this story repeats these themes, but I'll stop myself here. Now that you're aware of them, the excitement is looking around for these themes throughout the work.Art:Overcrowded yet sufficient. Since the art is trying to convey the above message by showing how our infatuation with visuals is far beyond what a work actually offers, it makes a lot of sense for it to be overly abundant. However, this is ironic due to the nature that it itself has grabbed hold of so many people due to visuals alone. I find this unfortunate, but also to be expected. There's a point in which I must wonder whether the work is self-aware of this or not. There are many points where I can say yes, but there are a few in which I can also say it is not.There is an offensively high amount of repeated animations. This is ridiculous. With a work that puts so much effort into essentially bastardizing overly constructed visuals, I wonder why it couldn't create, you know, another overly abundant visual in place of these repeat animations. Perhaps there's something to be said about this in relation to the theme, but I'm coming up short on this end.Some proportions are way off. Characters look pretty bad in a few scenes. It's laughable.Sound:The levels on this are atrocious. Sounds are sometimes WAY to loud and others WAY to quiet. I am 100% it is not due to something on my end, so whoever was in control of the Sound Production totally screwed up on this part.Yuki Kajiura has no ability to write unique music. All of her soundtracks sound unbelievably similar. I could take this OST and place it in any of her other works (that have the same tone) and it wouldn't sound out of place at all. This is incredibly unfortunate. She has an ability to create pretty intricate orchestrations, but her music shouldn't sound similar to the point of identical in each work. I'm not buying Yuki Kajiura albums. If this were a Yuki Kajiura album, then yes I'd want relatively similar songs. I am watching an anime, however, and a visual art needs to have unique themes and melodies that cannot be swapped out with another productions music. I almost want to avoid any films or anime she's written music for.Character:Considering Eire is just a placeholder to represent the audience, I can't really say much of him. I can, however, explain a very early reason for why he is the audience. Within the first half of the first episode, you seldom see him when he talks. The characters around him are the main focus while his voice is off camera. The way the angle is set up is almost as if you are him. There's this sense that you are supposed to be him. I feel this is the first of many signs that imply what this entire project is about.Cossette's character is a bitch. I don't understand why Eire loved her. There was no chemistry. I know I said this is a commentary and they are all placeholders but the truth still stands that characters need to be believable to create a solid story, and there are definitely ways these characters could have been believable.There's a host of side characters that get very little screen time. I'm sure they each represent something but I felt they were nothing more than plot devices. A character should not feel like a plot device to the degree that I recognize it instantly.Enjoyment:Honestly, hated watching it. I found every character to be unlikeable and there was no urgency to save Cossette from limbo considering the only reason was Eire loved her. And that reason was unbelievable to me because I found his love to be superficial and ridiculous. This made it very difficult to watch and the only reason I continued is because I refuse to drop an anime.

They are all just like mmorpg classes and they all have random abilities for no particular reason. Characters pop in and out. The guy called Eiri in the anime is a pathetic loser like one of those guys who will do anything for a girl even though she wouldn’t even try to remember his name. The girl called Cossete sounds like a manipulative egocentric narcissist who believes the world turns around her or something.The art is oke and it has some good music. ', 'It\'s hard to imagine a better example of ""gothic lolita"" as a concept than what we\'re presented with here. A cautionary tale of obsession getting out of control, with the protagonist alienating those around him and eventually enduring some rather gory metaphysical punishment before the end is out.Although the OVA has some ambitious ideas, those get lost at times through clumsy handling of themes and a lack of restraint on the part of the director and his or her bag of visual tricks.

Each scene is framed up very artistically, to match the main character's personality. Often having the camera set behind, looking through and in reflections of the objects in the antique shop in which he worked, often giving the feeling that we are one of the trinkets looking in at the scene.The visual style is what kept me interested in the show, but the plot line got confusing as the main character (Eiri) is transfixed by the painting of Cossette, but then a Venetian glass. He...falls in love with the haunted girl of the painting and gets sucked into her world. It then takes on a Jigoku Shoujo (Hell Girl), The Grudge king of ghost haunting story.It's a short 3 volume anime, but well worth the time to enjoy the camera shots and details and of course the adorable gothic lolita. falls in love with the haunted girl of the painting and gets sucked into her world.

There was a MASSIVELY...long introduction to the character of Cossette at first. Eiri just faffed around constantly, and it was annoying.It has abysmal writing. The reasons for characters doing certain things don\'t make sense (like at the end of episode 2, both characters just mess around).Art - 10Pretty damn good.

Nothing bothered him until Cossette starting moving around, then emotion would spread across his face.And really, he\'s just the most one-dimensional fool ever. I couldn\'t bring myself to like him.

The anime is, by now, almost 14 years old and almost nobody talks about it, so it flew completely under my radar up until now. I ""met"" it by chance, if you want to put it that way, while listening to random Soundtracks. I listened to the first bits of the soundtrack, and immediatly knew I had to watch it.Now, seeing that I gave this anime an overall score of...7 you may think I was disappointed, but that would be too easy. Still, as it needs to be done, I will walk through the categories, and tell you why I rated it the way I rated it:Story (6)The story wasn\'t bad, but in my opinion it tried to be deeper than it actually was. There are a lot of cuts, which makes it hard to follow the details of the plot. This, in and of itself wouldn\'t be a problem, if those gaps were later filled in, but this didn\'t happen. I\'d also like to point out, that character development should be part of a good story, which, while present in some aspects, is largely missing. Especially when it comes to the topic of ""love"", which is kind of an inherent problem of the story since it has an understanding of love that...takes some time to get used to. Also kinda messed up ending, not really coherent with the beginning, but...whatever, at least it has an ending, right :)Charakters (6)There are only a few Characters, which I think is a good thing, since it kinda makes sense with the kind of main chara we have here. The problem is, that there are four side charas who all could have been interesting, but either didn\'t get enough screentime to get interesting or had character motivations that were not properly explained or even hinted it, which in my view is a problem. Same goes for the Mains, especially in the context of, as mentioned before, love.Enjoyment (6-7)It\'s hard to really enjoy this anime because of it\'s obvious flaws regarding characters and plot, but it was still somewhat enjoyable. I loved the style and the sound, even though it looks, by todays standards, pretty old.Now, what brought me the most enjoyment was not the anime in itself, but rather watching the anime while knowing who the director was. The director, Akiyuki Shinbou, also created the Bakemonogatari series as well as Madoka Magica. If you watched at least those to shows, and maybe some more of his less know shows like Arakawa or Zetsubou Sensei, you will easily enjoy this anime 10/10.If you want you could say, that this anime is the foundation of his later works. Here he implements elements like the famous screens from Bakemonogatari, with just some Kanjis, Signs or even just his favorite Red on them while still keeping the anime ""normal"". What do I mean by normal? Well, he doesnt go full abstract, like in Bake or Madoka, he keeps it mostly in a style, you would expect from an anime of that day and age. There are some close-up shots of the main character, especially the ones  where you look up at his face, where he looks a LOT like Araragi. As for Madoka: The soundtrack and some of the fight-scenes. You can definitly see that they\'re related. The lovestory is also a bit similar, maybe, just kinda feels like it.So, should you watch this anime: Yeah, do it. It\'s a great piece of art, that allows you to get a little closer to the artist, maybe even to get in touch with his soul ;)Should you have high expectations: Nope. Go in with low expectations, and let yourself be surprised, hopefully. 7 you may think I was disappointed, but that would be too easy.

If this is true, then you can only imagine the kind of forlorn souls that haunt your average antique shop.  Of course, you don’t have to imagine it if you get a job at one of these locations, like Eiri Kurahashi does when he takes a job at his Grandfather’s shop to help pay his way through art school.  Honestly, it’s not such a bad job, either.  He works...near his friends, a lovely young woman often rents the space outside for her tarot card readings, and all he really has to deal with is his grandfather’s compulsive purchases, as the worldly old man is constantly buying up antiques on his travels to sell at his shop for obscene and mostly arbitrary price markups.One day, he receives a piece from his Grandfather’s trip to Europe, and while it looks like a simple piece of furniture at first, he soon finds out that the piece contains two hidden items...  The first is a lovely glass chalice whose rim is tinted with an enchanting swirl of colors, and the second is an exquisite painting of a little white girl, dressed up in gothic lolita clothing like a porcelain doll.  Eiri quickly starts to lose himself in this glass, and not too long afterward, he begins to see that same little girl moving around inside of the glass, presenting him with a glimpse into many different moments of her young life, from the innocent to the sad, and to make matters more bizarre, she seems to be completely aware of his presence...  Whatever he’s seeing, it’s undeniably what she wants him to see, but the lovestruck Eiji may not be feeling what she wants him to feel.  As he continues to get drawn deeper and deeper into the haunted chalice’s mystery, and he uncovers more and more about a centuries old crime, can his body survive the strain that this new liaison is taking on his soul?Le Portrait de Petite Cossette was produced by the animation company Daume, which I’ve only spoken about once before, but that was before I started to adopt a consistent structure in my reviews, so I didn’t mention it at the time.  For the record, that anime was Shiki, and the similarities are there, although thank God Cossette doesn’t have the same wacky design problems.  Daume unfortunately didn’t exist for very long, as it was only active between 1999 and 2010, but from the few titles I have seen, their priorities seem to be pumping out trashy low budget ecchi shows, and saving the bulk of their money for more serious projects, like this, Shiki, and Strawberry Marshmallow, and with these titles, they put a lot of money and effort into animation quality and background detail, creating as realistic and immersive a tone as possible for the stories and characters that people will actually care about, leaving the titty shows that people will watch anyway to suffer the short end of the stick, and I can definitely respect that.Alternatively, when it comes to Cossette’s visual style, it looks far more like a product of it’s director than it does it’s production company.  Akiyuki Shinbou has a rather controversial reputation among anime fans, and while Cossette was his only real undertaking for Daume, he’s spent the majority of his career working for Studio Shaft, where his eclectic visual style has become synonymous with his name.  He’s built his career on using strange, unorthodox cinematography to make dialogue scenes look just weird and off-putting enough to distract the viewer from noticing just how little is actually going on in said scenes, and he’s been called pretentious because of this trend...  And not unfairly, either, it’s a label he well deserves.  His other constant quirk is that he likes to present female characters, especially underage ones, in sexually appealing poses, regardless of what kind of tone the project is going for.  His direction was, interestingly enough, one of the biggest criticisms that Madoka Magika received.Having said all that, his visual trademarks can be used for good.  His style added a lot of depth to EF: A Tale of Memories and it’s sequel, but even further back, he did a fantastic job on Le Petite Cossette.  There are a lot of visual effects in this production that feel essential to the story, such as intense shadow play and intricate lighting, as well as a lot of CG glass effects and dream like backgrounds, and I honestly can’t think of any other anime director with the broad vision and even broader scope of imagination to pull it off as well as Shinbou does.  His unorthodox visual style doesn’t feel wasted or arbitrary here, as it’s a story about art that’s being presented in as artistically daring a way as possible, and there’s some kind of meaning, no matter how small, that can be inferred from every off kilter shot of it.  This is of course not to say the series was low budget, or anything...  In the moments that rely on traditional movement, it looks fine.  It doesn’t look cheaply made, or like they were struggling, or anything like that.  I don’t know if i’d call this the best looking piece of Shinbou’s career, but it’s gotta be up there.With only three episodes ever made, Le Petite Cossette doesn’t have a very large soundtrack, but what it does have is hauntingly beautiful.  I shouldn’t really have to expand much farther than that, at least not once I drop the name Yuki Kajiura, one of the most celebrated soundtrack composers in anime history, and her work for Cossette is no exception.  While the instrumentations themselves are heart-breaking and exquisitely orchestrated, a lot of it’s tracks are songs with actual people singing lyrics, which is definitely not something you’d expect from most anime.  I wasn’t able to find out who sang every track, I could only place names to a few of them, but from what I was able to gather, the singing duties appear to have been split between Kajiura herself and Cossette’s Japanese voice actor, Marina Inoue, both of whom prove to be outstandingly talented singers.  There are a few exceptions to this, of course, and I’m pretty sure my favorite track is “Somewhere I Belong,” whose violin chords convey a very real sense of longing and loneliness.The English dub is a very fine effort from Geneon, which I regret to say was never one of my favorite dubbing companies when it was still around.  I was never a fan of how a lot of their dubs felt really samey, and quite a few of them tried way too hard to match the Japanese voices, resulting in awkward, sometimes screechy sounding deliveries.  This particular project, led by director Wendee Lee, is a much more subtle effort than I’m used to from them, and I’d even go as far as to say it’s almost as good as the Japanese.  One thing that I feel they greatly improved on is the casting of Eiri, who was for some reason played by a woman in Japanese, and yeah, it wasn’t very convincing.  They gave the job to veteran Johnny Yong Bosch in the dub, and...  You know that thing he does sometimes where he talks without any real inflections, but his voice is still entirely listenable due to how hypnotically soft it is?  That works to great effect when playing his character in the real world, bored and distant as he yearns for the world inside the glass.  Appropriately enough, he speaks with a lot more enthusiasm and genuine interest when speaking to Cossette.And speaking of Cossette, Michelle Ruff plays that role, and while she kind of faltered when playing a similar role in Chobits, she actually gives Cossette a bit more personality than her original VA Marina Inoue did, although that could be chalked up to Ruff being an established star at the time and Inoue having just debuted.  She plays her role a bit more playfully than Inoue did, and when the time came, she also delivered on the duality of the character nicely.  Unfortunately, aside from Tony Oliver’s terrifying portrayal of murderer Marcello Orlando, the rest of the cast feels kind of wasted in smaller roles, including industry heavyweights like Kari Wahlgren, Kirk Thornton, Sam Riegal, Julie Ann Taylor and even Wendee Lee herself, put on strong, subtly emotional performances, considering the limited screen time they were all given.  The English adapted script is also more than faithful enough.  Yeah, there’s some philosophical changes in episode 3, but they’re workable.  The sub is better overall, but both versions are equally listenable.You know what we don’t have enough of?  Stories where people fall in love with ghosts.  I absolutely love reading about or just watching the idea of love conquering all getting challenged by the barrier of mortality between the two lovers in question.  One of my favorite books growing up was Robert Westall’s The Promise, which was about an English boy falling in love with a beautiful classmate during world War 1, only for her to become a casualty of the legendary conflict.  She comes back as a ghost, they’re still in love, and their attempts to rekindle their mortal romance nearly leads him to death’s door.  He ultimately must choose between his life and his love, which is the kind of emotional dilemma I could die for.  no, that doesn’t make me a Twilight fan, because vampires have physical bodies, and that would be cheating.  Also, Twilight sucks.To be honest, though, Le Portrait de Petite Cossette has one of Twilight’s biggest flaws, in the fact that it features a love connection between a couple who are separated not just by death, but by an uncomfortable age range.  Yeah, in all fairness, Cossette was killed over 200 years prior to the story, but she’s still clearly a child Eiri still falls in love with her, and while their specific ages are never explained, it’s very likely that eiri is in his late teens or early twenties, while Cossette died between ages 10 and 12, creating a romance that would normally set off my lolicon alarm, if it wasn’t for what the writer was trying to do with it.  Taking a look at Cossette’s background, she was the oldest child of an aristocratic family, and she was also a child bride, which was a common enough practice in those days.  Her fiance was a family portrait artist who had fallen in love with her after several art sessions, and while the art we’re shown is fairly innocent, there’s a pretty decent chance he was also putting her in some Leo and Kate/Pretty Baby poses when her parents weren’t looking.Now, it’s kind of a spoiler, but I’m sorry, I have to talk about her death, and honestly, it’s not even that BIG of a spoiler, as I’ll still be leaving the entire third episode a surprise for you...  One day, her artist fiance, Marcello Orlando, goes crazy and slaughters her family before killing her, because...  Once again, I’m sorry, but here’s the spoiler...  Because she was aging.  Yeah, he stabs her through the chest with a huge knife to keep her from growing up, because if she did, she would no longer look like the girl he’d fallen in love with, the girl in his portraits.  When you add this to the fact that Eiri’s obsession with a little girl who wasn’t real and complete ignorance of the real life woman who’s in love with him feels like a very intentional metaphor for lolicon media and how it indulges a person’s socially unacceptable fantasies to the point of seclusion, this all becomes the most brilliant condemnation of pedophilia and lolicon culture that I’ve ever seen.  Well, from anime, at least...  The movie Hard Candy does a pretty solid job, too.And for those of you who are trying to be smart and point out that the main character also falls in love with a little girl, well, he doesn’t come out of this unscathed either.  Yeah, his love for Cossette is portrayed as being more pure than Marcello’s...  Which isn’t too difficult when you’re being compared to a murderer...  But the idea of his love is still shown through the same kind of lens, as it’s ultimately a delusion.  Even if the idea of an adult having a physical or romantic relationship with a child wasn’t wholly reprehensible...  Which it unquestionably is...  It’s fundamentally impossible for an adult who’s attracted to children to have a substantial relationship with one, as children don’t stay children forever.  This is why the anime is named after Cossette’s portrait, rather than Cossette herself...  Because it has a duel meaning. her portrait, in this equation, is symbolic of lolicon art, and to a more unsettling extent, child porn.  Cossette says at one point in the ova that she hates having her portrait done, and can you blame her?  She was killed over the fact that she, as a person, could never have the same kind of eternal youth that her portrait had.  This ties into the portrait’s second meaning...  It’s her.  The portrait, like her, is a ghost of something that once was, and can never be again.Of course, it also helps that Cossette as a character is never sexualized, or presented to us in a sexually suggested manner.  I guess Shinbou did have a sense of restraint and taste at one point.  We’re shown how she seduces Eiri, because she needs a man to fall far enough in love with her to willingly sacrifice himself to the torture and punishment her killer never faced so that he soul can be at peace, but they never bother trying to seduce US with her, so points to them on that front.  They could have easily tried to have their cake and eat it too, like the use of nudity in Sankarea, but they took the high road.  I wish I could say all of the work they put toward creating their metaphor and supporting their point had resulted in a stronger story and overall better writing, but unfortunately, with only three episodes of time at their disposal, a lot of this anime’s potential wound up falling by the wayside.  I do wish the other characters would have had more time for development, seeing how there’s quite a few of them and a lot of them seem genuinely likeable, and I wish they’d drawn the story out more so that it could be enjoyable to people who DON’T want to put in the work to understand it, but what are you gonna do.Le Portrait de Petite Cossette was originally available from Geneon entertainment, and with that company long since dead and buried, it’s since been rescued and redistributed by Sentai filmworks.  Both DVDs are available for cheap online, and the only real difference between them is that the Geneon release has a pointlessly higher content rating.  You also get a nifty poster inside, which is awesome.  The manga adaptation is also available stateside from Tokyopop, and is just as easy to find online.  As far as I know, no legal streaming site is airing it.Le Portrait de Petite Cossette is, at least for what it tries to do, one of the best independent OVA series I’ve ever seen.  Despite it’s weaknesses in characterization and plot, it tells an engaging story with an important message lurking beneath the surface.  But putting all of that silly depth stuff aside, though, is this a good, spooky show to watch on Halloween?  You bet your sweet ass it is.  Despite all evidence to the contrary, you want Eiri and Cossette to reach some sort of positive conclusion at the end(Even if you understandably don’t want to see them wind up together in any way, shape or form), and you will feel legitimately frightened for both of them, as well as sympathetic to their situations.  In terms of it’s visuals, you could argue that it was ahead of it’s time, as it holds up far better now than it did when it was originally released, making it a title you really wouldn’t guess the age of, unless you judged by the actors involved.  It’s smart, complex, and a feast for the eyes, so I highly recommend adding it to your Halloween watch list.  I give Le Portrait de Petit Cossette a 8/10. near his friends, a lovely young woman often rents the space outside for her tarot card readings, and all he really has to deal with is his grandfather’s compulsive purchases, as the worldly old man is constantly buying up antiques on his travels to sell at his shop for obscene and mostly arbitrary price markups.One day, he receives a piece from his Grandfather’s trip to Europe, and while it looks like a simple piece of furniture at first, he soon finds out that the piece contains two hidden items...  The first is a lovely glass chalice whose rim is tinted with an enchanting swirl of colors, and the second is an exquisite painting of a little white girl, dressed up in gothic lolita clothing like a porcelain doll.  Eiri quickly starts to lose himself in this glass, and not too long afterward, he begins to see that same little girl moving around inside of the glass, presenting him with a glimpse into many different moments of her young life, from the innocent to the sad, and to make matters more bizarre, she seems to be completely aware of his presence...  Whatever he’s seeing, it’s undeniably what she wants him to see, but the lovestruck Eiji may not be feeling what she wants him to feel.  As he continues to get drawn deeper and deeper into the haunted chalice’s mystery, and he uncovers more and more about a centuries old crime, can his body survive the strain that this new liaison is taking on his soul?Le Portrait de Petite Cossette was produced by the animation company Daume, which I’ve only spoken about once before, but that was before I started to adopt a consistent structure in my reviews, so I didn’t mention it at the time.  For the record, that anime was Shiki, and the similarities are there, although thank God Cossette doesn’t have the same wacky design problems.  Daume unfortunately didn’t exist for very long, as it was only active between 1999 and 2010, but from the few titles I have seen, their priorities seem to be pumping out trashy low budget ecchi shows, and saving the bulk of their money for more serious projects, like this, Shiki, and Strawberry Marshmallow, and with these titles, they put a lot of money and effort into animation quality and background detail, creating as realistic and immersive a tone as possible for the stories and characters that people will actually care about, leaving the titty shows that people will watch anyway to suffer the short end of the stick, and I can definitely respect that.Alternatively, when it comes to Cossette’s visual style, it looks far more like a product of it’s director than it does it’s production company.  Akiyuki Shinbou has a rather controversial reputation among anime fans, and while Cossette was his only real undertaking for Daume, he’s spent the majority of his career working for Studio Shaft, where his eclectic visual style has become synonymous with his name.  He’s built his career on using strange, unorthodox cinematography to make dialogue scenes look just weird and off-putting enough to distract the viewer from noticing just how little is actually going on in said scenes, and he’s been called pretentious because of this trend...  And not unfairly, either, it’s a label he well deserves.  His other constant quirk is that he likes to present female characters, especially underage ones, in sexually appealing poses, regardless of what kind of tone the project is going for.  His direction was, interestingly enough, one of the biggest criticisms that Madoka Magika received.Having said all that, his visual trademarks can be used for good.  His style added a lot of depth to EF: A Tale of Memories and it’s sequel, but even further back, he did a fantastic job on Le Petite Cossette.  There are a lot of visual effects in this production that feel essential to the story, such as intense shadow play and intricate lighting, as well as a lot of CG glass effects and dream like backgrounds, and I honestly can’t think of any other anime director with the broad vision and even broader scope of imagination to pull it off as well as Shinbou does.  His unorthodox visual style doesn’t feel wasted or arbitrary here, as it’s a story about art that’s being presented in as artistically daring a way as possible, and there’s some kind of meaning, no matter how small, that can be inferred from every off kilter shot of it.  This is of course not to say the series was low budget, or anything...  In the moments that rely on traditional movement, it looks fine.  It doesn’t look cheaply made, or like they were struggling, or anything like that.  I don’t know if i’d call this the best looking piece of Shinbou’s career, but it’s gotta be up there.With only three episodes ever made, Le Petite Cossette doesn’t have a very large soundtrack, but what it does have is hauntingly beautiful.  I shouldn’t really have to expand much farther than that, at least not once I drop the name Yuki Kajiura, one of the most celebrated soundtrack composers in anime history, and her work for Cossette is no exception.  While the instrumentations themselves are heart-breaking and exquisitely orchestrated, a lot of it’s tracks are songs with actual people singing lyrics, which is definitely not something you’d expect from most anime.  I wasn’t able to find out who sang every track, I could only place names to a few of them, but from what I was able to gather, the singing duties appear to have been split between Kajiura herself and Cossette’s Japanese voice actor, Marina Inoue, both of whom prove to be outstandingly talented singers.  There are a few exceptions to this, of course, and I’m pretty sure my favorite track is “Somewhere I Belong,” whose violin chords convey a very real sense of longing and loneliness.The English dub is a very fine effort from Geneon, which I regret to say was never one of my favorite dubbing companies when it was still around.  I was never a fan of how a lot of their dubs felt really samey, and quite a few of them tried way too hard to match the Japanese voices, resulting in awkward, sometimes screechy sounding deliveries.  This particular project, led by director Wendee Lee, is a much more subtle effort than I’m used to from them, and I’d even go as far as to say it’s almost as good as the Japanese.  One thing that I feel they greatly improved on is the casting of Eiri, who was for some reason played by a woman in Japanese, and yeah, it wasn’t very convincing.  They gave the job to veteran Johnny Yong Bosch in the dub, and...  You know that thing he does sometimes where he talks without any real inflections, but his voice is still entirely listenable due to how hypnotically soft it is?  That works to great effect when playing his character in the real world, bored and distant as he yearns for the world inside the glass.  Appropriately enough, he speaks with a lot more enthusiasm and genuine interest when speaking to Cossette.And speaking of Cossette, Michelle Ruff plays that role, and while she kind of faltered when playing a similar role in Chobits, she actually gives Cossette a bit more personality than her original VA Marina Inoue did, although that could be chalked up to Ruff being an established star at the time and Inoue having just debuted.  She plays her role a bit more playfully than Inoue did, and when the time came, she also delivered on the duality of the character nicely.  Unfortunately, aside from Tony Oliver’s terrifying portrayal of murderer Marcello Orlando, the rest of the cast feels kind of wasted in smaller roles, including industry heavyweights like Kari Wahlgren, Kirk Thornton, Sam Riegal, Julie Ann Taylor and even Wendee Lee herself, put on strong, subtly emotional performances, considering the limited screen time they were all given.  The English adapted script is also more than faithful enough.  Yeah, there’s some philosophical changes in episode 3, but they’re workable.  The sub is better overall, but both versions are equally listenable.You know what we don’t have enough of?  Stories where people fall in love with ghosts.  I absolutely love reading about or just watching the idea of love conquering all getting challenged by the barrier of mortality between the two lovers in question.  One of my favorite books growing up was Robert Westall’s The Promise, which was about an English boy falling in love with a beautiful classmate during world War 1, only for her to become a casualty of the legendary conflict.  She comes back as a ghost, they’re still in love, and their attempts to rekindle their mortal romance nearly leads him to death’s door.  He ultimately must choose between his life and his love, which is the kind of emotional dilemma I could die for.  no, that doesn’t make me a Twilight fan, because vampires have physical bodies, and that would be cheating.  Also, Twilight sucks.To be honest, though, Le Portrait de Petite Cossette has one of Twilight’s biggest flaws, in the fact that it features a love connection between a couple who are separated not just by death, but by an uncomfortable age range.  Yeah, in all fairness, Cossette was killed over 200 years prior to the story, but she’s still clearly a child Eiri still falls in love with her, and while their specific ages are never explained, it’s very likely that eiri is in his late teens or early twenties, while Cossette died between ages 10 and 12, creating a romance that would normally set off my lolicon alarm, if it wasn’t for what the writer was trying to do with it.  Taking a look at Cossette’s background, she was the oldest child of an aristocratic family, and she was also a child bride, which was a common enough practice in those days.  Her fiance was a family portrait artist who had fallen in love with her after several art sessions, and while the art we’re shown is fairly innocent, there’s a pretty decent chance he was also putting her in some Leo and Kate/Pretty Baby poses when her parents weren’t looking.Now, it’s kind of a spoiler, but I’m sorry, I have to talk about her death, and honestly, it’s not even that BIG of a spoiler, as I’ll still be leaving the entire third episode a surprise for you...  One day, her artist fiance, Marcello Orlando, goes crazy and slaughters her family before killing her, because...  Once again, I’m sorry, but here’s the spoiler...  Because she was aging.  Yeah, he stabs her through the chest with a huge knife to keep her from growing up, because if she did, she would no longer look like the girl he’d fallen in love with, the girl in his portraits.  When you add this to the fact that Eiri’s obsession with a little girl who wasn’t real and complete ignorance of the real life woman who’s in love with him feels like a very intentional metaphor for lolicon media and how it indulges a person’s socially unacceptable fantasies to the point of seclusion, this all becomes the most brilliant condemnation of pedophilia and lolicon culture that I’ve ever seen.  Well, from anime, at least...  The movie Hard Candy does a pretty solid job, too.And for those of you who are trying to be smart and point out that the main character also falls in love with a little girl, well, he doesn’t come out of this unscathed either.  Yeah, his love for Cossette is portrayed as being more pure than Marcello’s...  Which isn’t too difficult when you’re being compared to a murderer...  But the idea of his love is still shown through the same kind of lens, as it’s ultimately a delusion.  Even if the idea of an adult having a physical or romantic relationship with a child wasn’t wholly reprehensible...  Which it unquestionably is...  It’s fundamentally impossible for an adult who’s attracted to children to have a substantial relationship with one, as children don’t stay children forever.  This is why the anime is named after Cossette’s portrait, rather than Cossette herself...  Because it has a duel meaning. her portrait, in this equation, is symbolic of lolicon art, and to a more unsettling extent, child porn.  Cossette says at one point in the ova that she hates having her portrait done, and can you blame her?  She was killed over the fact that she, as a person, could never have the same kind of eternal youth that her portrait had.  This ties into the portrait’s second meaning...  It’s her.  The portrait, like her, is a ghost of something that once was, and can never be again.Of course, it also helps that Cossette as a character is never sexualized, or presented to us in a sexually suggested manner.  I guess Shinbou did have a sense of restraint and taste at one point.  We’re shown how she seduces Eiri, because she needs a man to fall far enough in love with her to willingly sacrifice himself to the torture and punishment her killer never faced so that he soul can be at peace, but they never bother trying to seduce US with her, so points to them on that front.

I give Le Portrait de Petit Cossette a 8/10.', ""AND THE AYES HAVE IT!!!!!…....errrr rather I mean THE EYES HAVE IT.  As in EYEBALLS.  This anime is OBSESSED with closeup shots of eyeballs.  You will see 100s by the end of the 3 films so get ready.Think I'm exaggerating?OVA 1 has (I counted for you) EIGHTY close up shots of eyeballs, eyesockets of skulls, eyeglasses reflecting another person talking, and random meaningless handrawn sketches of eyeballs, eyes with blood dripping out, egyptian OSIRIS style eyes, a cat with a letter A in the eyeball, and eyeball with a red heart for the pupil and a flythrough sequence of an human eye...then a skull socket, then a screen of skulls, then another skull eyesockets to finally Cossette standing in the skull eyesockets.Now that we've covered eyeballs and eyeball close-ups ……..Howdy folks, Greetings from Bullibaby.  This review is a more PRACTICAL GUIDE TO VIEWING what is kinda an anime confus-a-thon.First things first….I'm definitely 100% positively sort of entirely not completely sure you should watch this OVA 3 part series but I highly recommend you probably watch it if for nothing else...but to say you did and LIVED TO TELL.And it's got some really cool graphics IF AND ONLY IF imho you do the following:---->>slow the whole movie down to 0.8 or 80% speed.  Hopefully your using an app that can do this without destroying the audio.  The movie should slow down, while audio sounds normal (just FYI case ya didn't know that tech exists.)Why slow it down??? because the movie is a sequence of 100’s and 100s of still shots of buildings, chairs, lamps, candles, antique lights, Paintings, Venetian goblets dangling chains and of course TONS of eyeballs with animation sequences mixed in. But even the animation chooses to cut scene changes and viewing perspectives way too often.  It's not very fluid so SLOW IT DOWN or you will honestly get dizzy.  Warning:. Daume studios was kind ENUF to include lots of REPEAT REUSE sequences as well mostly of eyeballs etc etc. (Lame)2nd viewing instruction:. If you take my 100% positively ambiguous recommendation and watch the series...you should avoid at all cost the English dub UNLESS...**you enjoy a romance horror where Cossette the most desirable woman on Earth recites her lines like reading a Denny's menu or phonebook and almost no feeling or mood, nearly monotone mostly.**Eiri the boy madly in love with a painting that wants to kill him narrated with an overtone of complete disinterest like a complacent 8th grader talking about US history.  Nevermind how MADLY in love he is, you wouldn't know it by his tone.ANSWER:. Go Japanese with subs and the actual mood of the movie is conveyed EXCELLENTLY.  The diff between Japanese and English is profound.NOW FOR THE GOOD NEWS.  if you slow it down you'll have a chance to ACTUALLY SEE some very well done scenes and animation.  It's really a paradox, there's beauty to be found in this OVA and there's plenty of issues.I personally had a favorite scene where Eire is speaking to a co-worker and your vantage point is as if you put a stained glass window up to your eye and rotated it slowly observing the characters as they talked in a kaleidoscope of colors and textures.  BEAUTIFUL. 1 of 100s of incredibly detailed complex animations definitely worth seeing for artistry sake.So about the story.  First ya gotta understand the eyeballs obsession.  I believe the reason everything is EYES and EYEBALLS is 4-fold, maybe 5-fold depending.1--The story is about marchello Orlando an artist/painter who is obsessed with the beauty in the EYE of the beholder (namely his eye) of Cossette his girlfriend.  He so obsessed he wants to freeze her beauty in time by killing her.  Hence the EVIL EYE of the beholder.2--a SINGLE 3 SECOND frame shot of a psychic entering the antique store where Cossette painting is says one line “all these objects must have souls.”  Per Wikipedia this is referring to Japanese culture that any antique abandoned and forgotten for a 100 years or more spawns it's own soul due to TRAGIC loneliness.  An ANGRY LONELY antique per se with souls and the EYE is the window on the soul.3--With the angry antique theory, it would seem that ALL the antiques, glassware, furniture etc present in the house where Cossette was murdered has now spawned angry souls who not only WITNESSES her murder but wish to avenge what they SAW WITH THEIR implied EYEBALLS. (If u follow).4--Take this idea one step further you'll WILL (I promise) see scenes with 100s of eyeballs and big globular floating eyes thru out the movies.  Where did all these eyeballs come from u may ask???  Well, if the eye is the window on the soul then the SOULS of all the ANTIQUES that witnessed her death are represented by the eyes in these scenes and they are all going to kill Eiri.5--Finally, Marchello Orlando believed As KRUNCHYMAN so eloquently wrote in his review describing Cossette:She is Essential. She is Beautiful. She is Perfection. She is a Muse.Marchello only forgot SHE IS HUMAN in that list.  So it's entirely possible the eyeballs are a reference to his objectifying of cossetes VISUAL BEAUTY and they will now have THEIR revenge on machellos soul reincarnated in Eiri.Say what you will, as I said THE EYES HAVE IT.Overall, the concept was strong, the implementation was VERY weak.  I personally didnt FEEL the connection between Eire and cossette.  Eire seemed just like a total moron whose too dumb to know a bad thing when he's got iT and I thot Cossette came across as a stone cold bitch hell bent on revenge.  Imho there just wasn't ENUF character development for me to feel her loving side.Soooooo, At some point in movie 2, the REAL COSSETTE who wants to punish marchellos soul and all the EYEBALLS want to punish him as well seem to mellow and RELENT in battle. They no longer wants to torture this innocent reincarnation, at which point, Eire appears to NOW have to wage battle with The ACTUAL MYRIAD OF PAINTINGS.Now,I'm not telling you this as a spoiler, but I had to rewind it three times to just understand why COSSETTE was NO LONGER Cossette, but an IMPOSTER which was the PAINTINGS THEMSELVES.  you see the IMAGES of Cossette had now begun to FIGHT for their rightful place.  You are NOT I repeat NOT told or even implied of this switch.  But to relieve your mind, I'm telling you.I guess, since Marchello had exchanged Cossettes life for the life of the portraits, they had become living souls and quite frankly weren't happy with Cossette and Eiri making peace for cossettes soul.  This would have legitimized her as a human rather than a living IMAGE.So the LIVING IMAGE of Cossette, which there are 100s of in marchellos studio, becomes personified and tries to deceive Eiri and trap him in some special CLOSED ZONE in the underworld that only they can occupy.But Eire sees thru the plot by the paintings and rejects the LIVING IMAGE IMPOSTER and proceeds to paint with his own blood a final PENANCE for his crime.  This final act of contrition sets Cossette soul free, ends the INVASION OF THE EYEBALLS, and sets all the LIVING IMAGE IMPOSTERS on fire.HONORABLE MENTION:. Yuki Kajiura's soundtrack is amazing,For a perfect description of the actual storyline the writer probably intended...read krunchymans review.For a practical viewing guide I humbly submit mine.Best of luck and btw ask yourself occasionallY JUST FOR FUN, where in the name of God does Eire store ALL THOSE GALLONS AND GALLONS OF BLOOD spraying everywhere. :-). then a skull socket, then a screen of skulls, then another skull eyesockets to finally Cossette standing in the skull eyesockets.Now that we've covered eyeballs and eyeball close-ups ……..Howdy folks, Greetings from Bullibaby.

I would see snippets on AMVs for years and be blown away. I was surprised it was only 3ep Long. That length is perfect since the story is told in an abstract & disorganized fashion.Ironically this show\'s message is lost on those who need it most.

Much like how many modern anime fans have unhealthily obsessed with Lolita characters. He...starts out almost normal and quickly descends into madness. He puts her on a pedestal and treats her as if she\'s ethereal, a goddess. His constant talking, thinking, and moving as though she is in the room will have viewers debating if she actually is.

It is not pure, it is Tainted, it is dark, it is disturbing. He wants to harm her. He will destroy her & tell her it\'s her fault.

It's more of a 50/50 watch. You either like it, or you don't.Compared to some anime titles I've wasted my time on and regret ever touching, this was actually a fair watch.

I have gone out of my way and made an account and everything just to review this anime. This is how good it is. First of all, this is definitely not for everybody, so if you dont like what you are watching plz drop it and watch something else. This series doesnt deserve 6 as an overall rating. This is a crime. It is a work of art. More like a portrait a drawing, some people will like what they see and others are turned off or even disgusted by it. It is understandable that not...everyone likes the same thing. But for me, it is a portrait that bewildered me, that put me in a state of awe. A portrait that I rare and crave to gawk at a second time. The color scheme the nuances and shades of colors the mosaique of shapes, simply the setting was made in a very artistic way and I love it. The ost on their own are 10/10. The story, I mean it is crafted. The first episode was exciting yet a bit tiresome analyzing the story but its just a bit. Second episode was really fun to watch. Third episode is were all threads connected, everything has become even clearer. I got nothing more to add. This one of my favorites now top 5 easily. Can never be compared with modern day anime sadly the 90\'s psychological thriller era is long gone. Anime now a days is all about being shallow.

It really felt like watching a painting come to life at times.Now I would say that the anime isn't amazing, plus I think there were too many side characters that felt...unnecessary for such a short anime. Like, the story could have been told with just the main 2 people plus maybe 1 other person to witness the downfall of the main character slowly deterioratingPersonally I wouldn't recommend this anime for the sole reason of not disappointing people who mag be looking for a more straightforward story.

The characters are bland and shallow. You have to believe in love at first sight, because certainly there are never any reasons for the characters to fall in love.The art style has moments where it's excellent, but the animation is frequently very lazy. Even by OVA standards, the budget here feels low. Even when the art style is at it's best, to me it feels like a SHAFT wannabe.For me the saving grace of this show is the soundtrack.

Unbelievable as though it may sound, whenever he looks inside the glass, as if spying through a looking glass, he sees the daily life of a mysterious blonde girl living in...a strange world. Though doubting his own sanity, as he is the only one who can see her, he finds himself unable to relinquish the glass and ends up falling in love with the maiden. Weird shit happens.

I am clearly not the target audience – not of Cossette in particular, but of Akiyuki Shinbou’s works in general. I have enjoyed many of his creations, but always in spite of the visual presentation, not because of it. I would be tempted to give him some credit for some of the entries in the Monogatari franchise, Koimonogatari in particular, but I would be forced to take that credit right back because Nisemonogatari was one of the most obnoxious viewing experiences of my life. It’s just not my thing.The reason I gave Le Portrait de Petit Cossette a try is because of a recommendation made by DigiBro on a Halloween edition of the WeebCast podcast. Several anime YouTubers were giving their top pick recommendation for a spooky show that would fit the holiday’s theme. This was Conrad’s. The general consensus seems to be that Cossette is horror – among other things, to be sure.

Dekoboko Majo no Oyako Jijou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52985/Dekoboko_Majo_no_Oyako_Jijou,"['The Family Circumstances of the Irregular Witch — yeah, that\'s quite an irregular family with dysfunctional circumstances.Mangaka Piroya\'s only work that is Dekoboko Majo no Oyako Jijou, feels as if the author had some ideas for a simple story and plot, but, however, he/she decided to execute it in a rather...let\'s just say, questionable way of a gimmicky gag humour comedy that\'s as idiotic and ham as it can ever be. And before you ham your fists at me, I know the ""comedy is subjective"" tropey expression all too well.These kinds of ""strangers picking up abandoned children"" stories have slowly, like Isekai reincarnation stories, become...one of anime\'s mainstay tropes, and it seems even more exaggerated this season (see S-Rank Musume, Seiken Gakuin no Makentsukai (via fantasy reincarnation), and Ikenaikyo (via the outcast female MC)), though compared to the offerings as listed above, I would take this show anyday due to its relatively simple nature that anyone (yes, you, the review reader) can watch without any pretext.Anyways, the 200+-year-old young witch Alyssa, who lives alone in her own treehouse, one day finds the abandoned Viola and raises her for 16 years, becoming a full-fledged young adult woman who grows so much bigger in size as compared to her slow-ageing witch ""mother"" that people mistake the daughter for being the mother figure in the ""family."" And by appearances, it\'s not hard to see why it is that way, and that says so for the rather unusual daily lives of both Alyssa and Viola and the people involved with them.Let\'s start with the close contacts: the witch ""Obaa-san"" (a.k.a Auntie) friends of Alyssa\'s — Luna and Giriko. They\'re quite the nonsensical double trouble of older friends who are practical jokers, but they also care for their lone friend quite well, especially in the early years that Alyssa has had to raise Viola in the years since picking her up. The rather cringeworthy ""not-so-boyfriend"" material of elf Fennel, however, is that he\'s a walking joker that has interest in her but always gets stopped by Viola because of her unwavering obsession for Alyssa, or the mother complex a.k.a mom-con. This gets even stupider in the context after Viola wants to have a familiar, and this comes in the form of the ""thou hast arrived"" ostrich-looking Phoenix, which, my god, is the proper definition of a joker character. I have never, ever once failed to crack laughter over this nonsensical bird with its hilarious one-liners, made only worse when it\'s pulled with Viola to further implicate Fennel to make sure that he does NOT reach Alyssa in any capacity. Sure, there\'re other characters worth noting in the series, but the ""happy family"" of Alyssa, Viola, and Phoenix is where matters lie.Sure, I can gush about both Aoi Koga and Nana Mizuki\'s VA work here as both female MC leads, but I\'d like to highlight veteran VA Takaya Hashi (Naruto: Shippuden\'s Kakuzu, or more recently as Spy x Family\'s Desmond Donovan) as Phoenix;\xa0his voice just lends perfectly to the bird that, thanks to Piroya\'s subtle plot-driven dialogue, creates some memorable ""stupider than thou"" scenes in the show that will fade over time, but what a character.Also, with this show being produced by literally 3rd-rate people: director Masahiro Takata (of the abominable Winter 2023\'s Hyouken no Majutsushi ga Sekai wo Suberu a.k.a The Iceblade Sorcerer Shall Rule the World) and his staff, as well as the studio A-Real itself (which this show is its first full half-hour-run TV series), I\'d only say that Piroya\'s material doesn\'t really need extensive changes to translate from manga to anime (which has covered almost everything of the source material\'s 6 volumes out so far), and the execution itself came out decent and fine. Low expectations, but still low-key surprised at times.I\'ve really never been too fond of Nana Mizuki when it comes to her Anisongs (the last of which was Spring 2022\'s Tomodachi Game, which is surprisingly good), and her OP ""Sugar Doughnuts"" is just skippable at best. The same, however, could not be said for angela\'s ""Welcome!"" which definitely, IMO, suited the show\'s ED song perfectly.The only way to sell this show to you is to purely watch Episode 1 and see if the comedy makes or breaks you.

Me personally? I love it! There is a small and concise cast of characters that are unique and stylistically different, which keep the episodes from feeling same-y. Alyssa is the sweet, overly-doting mother to Viola, a human she found abandoned in the woods which she took to raise as her own. Viola can be very... protective of her mom, and constantly gets in people's way if she feels suspicious about them.

Depending the quality of contents, and if the jokes will fall flat over time.  If your show isn't funny, then it's going to be a chore to get through. But what makes this show stand out a little more than the rest, is it's style and cuteness.Story and characters: 7The story mainly revolves around Witches and magic, and one day, a witch by name of Alyssa, finds an abandoned baby, and decides to take it and raise it. Insert usual fun loving gag humor right after these sweet moments, and we're in...for nothing but randomness from here, toppled with actual serious lore, that may come up in the future, but with the way it's done, it progresses nicely, so you enjoy the characters, and if it slaps you with a serious moment, you'll least care about the outcome.Alyssa is a very kind soul, while trying her best to be the best mom she can be. While her supposed daughter Viola, is very expressive, and very childish to boot. It's a very sweet relationship. These two are backed up by a colourful cast of characters that are there to enjoy. Such as Alyssa's two witch friends, as one reminds me a bit of Sucy from Little Witch, while the other...Lmao. Once you learn about the other, you'll realize what type of character she is haha. But it's a good line of characters that'll take the show far.The only issue so far, is overused of certain gags, which in long run, might get a little tiring. It may be funny at first, but being a couple of episodes in, and it still hasn't changed, it may fall flat if said for the dozenth time.Art and sound: 8I think there is a lot to appreciate when it comes to it's art direction. Like Alyssa's eyes for example, they look gorgeous, and really make her overall look stand out. But the overall look to the whole show in it's concept looks stunning in it's colours, and animation. Really taking into a care for detail, and it's works. If anything, no matter what, you can't fault that this is a nice looking show, that is well presented in it's art style. Not to mention going super well with it's sound desgin.Dekoboko is a sweet show that is more than welcomed in this anime season. It won't knock you away, but it doesn't need to. Sometimes you need that kind of sweet fun show, to go along with your deep and intense kind of shows. A watch for sure. for nothing but randomness from here, toppled with actual serious lore, that may come up in the future, but with the way it's done, it progresses nicely, so you enjoy the characters, and if it slaps you with a serious moment, you'll least care about the outcome.Alyssa is a very kind soul, while trying her best to be the best mom she can be. While her supposed daughter Viola, is very expressive, and very childish to boot. It's a very sweet relationship. These two are backed up by a colourful cast of characters that are there to enjoy. Such as Alyssa's two witch friends, as one reminds me a bit of Sucy from Little Witch, while the other...Lmao. Once you learn about the other, you'll realize what type of character she is haha. But it's a good line of characters that'll take the show far.The only issue so far, is overused of certain gags, which in long run, might get a little tiring. It may be funny at first, but being a couple of episodes in, and it still hasn't changed, it may fall flat if said for the dozenth time.Art and sound: 8I think there is a lot to appreciate when it comes to it's art direction. Like Alyssa's eyes for example, they look gorgeous, and really make her overall look stand out. But the overall look to the whole show in it's concept looks stunning in it's colours, and animation. Really taking into a care for detail, and it's works. If anything, no matter what, you can't fault that this is a nice looking show, that is well presented in it's art style. Not to mention going super well with it's sound desgin.Dekoboko is a sweet show that is more than welcomed in this anime season. It won't knock you away, but it doesn't need to. Sometimes you need that kind of sweet fun show, to go along with your deep and intense kind of shows. A watch for sure."", ""this one... definitely FUNNY! i got a hard belly laugh at least ONCE in each episode! most of the 'jokes' got a definitive snort or a genuine chuckle out of me!for a four-panel-manga, this show had a peculiar but entertaining overall storyline. it isn't truly a story told in classical sequences: a beginning, a middle, and an end... more like... a hop here, a skip there, a jump over yonder. but the stories/vignettes in each episode don't just seem to be random snapshots of these characters' lives. there are backstories told, memories shared, and new experiences on-screen.as to the acting? Mr. Hashi... nailed...Pheonix. the man performed again and again with gravitas and depth without being pompous or overbearing or wielding the eras of Pheonix's lifespan as a blunt weapon. Ms. Koga and Ms. Mizuki as the mother Alyssa and daughter Viola just seemed to mesh so perfectly in every conversation. Mr. Suwabe as the granpa/dad/uncle... Auri... so SO far outside his normal casting... well, except for Captain Sukehiro ;) but i wonder if he found it fun to (once more) play that 'older guy who acts just a bit too irresponsible'? Mr. S did a stupendous job! Auri was quite the entertainer!the only thing that kept me from overall giving this a 10... the art style. Viola, knockout gorgeous. the 'aunties' wow, just hot. otherwise... it was just too... cute... for my tastes. the number of times i mistook Auri's pectoral muscles for breasts was unsettling... a tiny bit more anatomical accuracy there would have been appreciated by myself. Pheonix's design made me think of a 5-10 year old trying to draw a bird without doing the 'Thanksgiving Turkey Hand Outline' technique. he was an entertaining character, but he just looked... inexpertly drawn. if the show had been done with maybe... one SINGLE teaspoon of sugar sweetness LESS in the overall art style... i'd give it a 10. this show was just that fun, but the art was just that tiny bit TOO cute.this show isn't deep, it isn't insightful, it isn't... serious... for 99% of the content. here and there it does show inspiring or uplifting or in-depth stories with serious characterizations that go beyond, 'funny thing happen to funny people. ha hah.' so if you think this show is ALL FLUFF and nothing serious? you're mistaken.

This is the first debut film of Vegeta in the countless movies of this franchise as well as taking place onnew planet Namek.Now for the most part the action is really good but it does suffer from a rather ridiculous explanation on cooler's survival and why is it that cooler feels the need to take over planet namek is something that sounds so far-fetched to even begin with.From the start of this movie you have apparently a planetary size star...known as the Big Gete star which somehow revived cooler from the sungiving cooler a an entirely new form in a mechanised body even more powerful than before. All and all this was very stupidly written indeed.Whats more cooler has gain the power of controlling a host of mechanical machinery as well as creating an absurd army amount of metallic clones ofhimself like he is Ultron from the avengers or something, he has a body that is very durable upon powerful impact and can also use a lock on system, Goku's Instant transmission SOMEHOW even though we are not informed how that is even possible, He can repair his entire body from scratch from the big gete star system that detects any sign of damage on himself and he uses very fast artificial Regeneration like he is Tetsuo Shima from the anime Akira.Yeah I think you get the point he is pretty much more ridiculously haxed than before! Not even both super saiyan goku and vegeta could match him.Aside from that, we have other characters in the film joining goku and vegeta such as the usual kid gohan, krillin, piccolo but surprisingly also Yajirobe and Master Roshi who only offer the comedic moments but its nice to see master roshi as always but I definitely cannot stand that pig oolong for one second.The animation was ok and music just wasn't really anything that good.This movie I felt had a pretty rushed ending for the most part and the dumb thing is I dunno why I didn't mind it.The only things I enjoyed were the fights and the fact that vegeta made his debut which is cool but all in all this film is just average like other films of the Dragon ball franchise I felt the weaker films were bio Broly, Lord Slug and curse of the blood rubies AAaahhHHI cringe whenever I hear those names.P.S I swear saying the Big Gete star almost sounds like I'm saying the spaghetti star which sounds weird to me for no reason. known as the Big Gete star which somehow revived cooler from the sungiving cooler a an entirely new form in a mechanised body even more powerful than before.

This is the movie I will be discussing today, before wrapping up my trilogy of reviews with DBZ Movie 11: Bio Broly.Plot: 1/10Warning Spoiler!!!The general consensus is that Cooler\'s Return has the single worst plot of any DBZ movie. I fully agree with this conclusion. After being blasted into the Sun with a Kamehameha, A small fracture of Cooler\'s skull including his eye has somehow managed to escape...the Sun\'s tremendous gravity and travel an unbelievable distance into deep interstellar space. In the void of interstellar space, the skull fragment collides with a super advanced alien computer chip, which is drifting way out in deep space because...reasons. This computer chip uses Cooler\'s remaining brain (even though we can see VERY little if any brain survived) to construct a giant mass called the ""Big Gete Star"" out of astroids and self replicating nano-machines. This giant, grey blob called the Big Gete Star happened to be near the new Planet Namek, so Cooler took control of the Gete star and commanded it to attach on to Namek like a giant tumor and drain the planet\'s energy. Even if we were to buy the bullshit about Cooler\'s skull fragment escaping the Sun\'s gravity, how in the HOLY FUCK did the skull fragment travel far enough to be near New Namek when it collided with the computer chip!!? New Namek wasn\'t even located in the same quadrant of the Universe as Earth. If you were to divide the entire Universe into 4 giant chunks, this is another quadrant and probably BILLIONS of LIGHT YEARS away! In less than 1 year, Cooler\'s skull fragment with no ""warp drive"" or teleportation managed to travel a couple Billion light years distance! Even by the idiotic standards of DBZ, that is fucking preposterous!!! At the same time Cooler\'s blob attacks Namek, the Z fighters just happen to be on vacation there using a ship....even though it was an important plot point in the Future Saga that they had no idea where it was in the series and only Goku could travel there using ""Instant Transmission"", which locks onto a Ki signature and teleports to that Ki source. The Z fighters then fight against Cooler and his clones in order to save New Namek.Action: 5/10Goku and Vegeta fight against an army of Mecha-Cooler clones and the rest of the Z fighters all fight against lame cyclops robots. I will give this movie credit for being the only DBZ movie in which our heroes must fight a massive army instead of a single powerful opponent. That was actually a kind of neat idea. I also give it credit for including more of the other Z fighters and giving them a tad of action instead of JUST getting their asses kicked in 2 minutes. Unfortunately, we don\'t actually get to see the fight between the Cooler Army and Goku/Vegeta. I\'m serious! The fucking movie fades to black and we see Goku and Vegeta tied up inside the Big Gete Star after presumably being beat up offscreen. Cooler attempts to drain their energy, but apparently they still have so much energy left that it overloads the computer\'s systems and causes the Gete Star to explode along with all the Coolers. That\'s really what happens! This is by far the STUPIDEST villain death in all of DBZ. It isn\'t satisfying, it is completely anti-climactic, and it wasn\'t even given any kind of foreshadowing or anything to make it acceptable.Animation and music:Like with Lord Slug, the animation and music are average here. They aren\'t terrible, but not notable either. The only interesting sequence of animation in this movie is Cooler using nano-machines to regenerate parts of his body after repeatedly getting blown apart. That...actually looked kind of awesome! Other than that, I don\'t really have any praise left.Overall:Deciding which is worse between Lord Slug and Cooler\'s Return is a VERY difficult decision, but I think Cooler\'s Return is the SLIGHTLY better movie for a few reasons. Firstly, the movie at least had the concept of the Z warriors fighting a massive army of opponents, which DBZ honestly had never tried before this point and never really tried again until the new movie ""Resurrection of F"". Secondly, at least Cooler looked a lot...well...cooler than Lord Slug! Despite just being a watered down version of Freeza\'s character with no independent personality traits, quirks, or anything to set him apart besides an extra transformation, fans of DBZ actually LIKE Cooler. He kind of looks badass and gives us another member of Freeza\'s unusual race, which we learn VERY little about during the manga or anime. It is hinted in the anime filler that Freeza\'s race is the ""Arcosians"" that North Kai said gave the Saiyans their technology and ran the Planet Trade Organization. Although this has never been stated in the manga or confirmed by Akira Toriyama himself. Lord Slug on the other hand, is just a lame ripoff of King Piccolo that NO ONE thinks is badass and no one actually wants to learn more about his character. That is why Cooler got 2 different movies and Lord Slug only got 1. Of course Broli got 3 because he is BY FAR the most popular movie villain. Lastly, this was the first DBZ movie to take place away from Earth and set the stage for the vastly superior Movie 8. All previous DBZ movies used the same formula of: evil dude comes to Earth and Z warriors must kill him. This movie at least ""sort of"" broke the mold and allowed a TINY bit more creativity to go into DBZ movies, which ultimately allowed for the zany, off the wall fun of future movies like DBZ Movie 12: Fusion Reborn. Conclusion: This isn\'t a good movie by ANY stretch of the imagination, but it isn\'t quite as bad as Lord Slug. If you are a diehard DBZ completionist and feel the need to watch this movie, just relax and try not to think too hard! the Sun\'s tremendous gravity and travel an unbelievable distance into deep interstellar space.

Yes, it follows the same old tired format; bad guy shows up and do bad stuff, Goku fights the bad guy to the end. Plus the story is shit. However, unlike the previous movie, this one focuses solely on the action and actually has a better plot. The writing is a bit more solid and this movie isn\'t a chore to watch at all.The Return of Cooler is the sixth movie in the franchise, and is the direct sequel to Cooler\'s Revenge. I really like this one as it gets...to the point rather quickly, and most of the characters are used very well. First of all, there\'s none of the whole, ""you have yet to see my true power"" taking place as all of the main players go for the throat almost immediately. Goku goes Super Saiyan really quick against Meta-Cooler which delivers some really cool action scenes. At times, there\'s some really good face offs and imagination. The secondary cast; Piccolo, Gohan, and Krillin, aren\'t just bodies this time around for the lead baddie to decimate in record time. They battle Cooler\'s robotic guards in a cool action segment.The plot is heavily pushed by the action until the climax, however this really isn\'t a bad thing at all. I also laughed at some of the comedy here, such as Krillin constantly being pummeled in comedic fashion. The 45 minute run time felt really short but in a good way though. I thought the animation was pretty good with some detailed action here and there, and very little of the reused cel approach that DBZ is well known for. I didn\'t have an issue with the character designs, and I dug Cooler\'s new look. The soundtrack is a pretty big issue if you come into this expecting the same from the last movie; but even ignoring the last movie, I feel the BGM is very weak, and it doesn\'t really help the action scenes.Outside of this feature being completely linear, the problem I have with it is that it doesn\'t fit into the series continuity at all. There are plenty of elements here supporting that this story could have never taken place. Also, this is not a good place for newbies to start. At the very least, the first four seasons or so should be seen.In closing, The Return of Cooler is a solid movie in the DBZ mythos. It will more than likely appeal to serious fans. Recommended only to those who are well rounded in the franchise.Highs: Lots of actionLows: Just another DBZ title for the most part, weak music score to the point rather quickly, and most of the characters are used very well.

At the very least, the first four seasons or so should be seen.In closing, The Return of Cooler is a solid movie in the DBZ mythos. It will more than likely appeal to serious fans. Recommended only to those who are well rounded in the franchise.Highs: Lots of actionLows: Just another DBZ title for the most part, weak music score', 'Dragon Ball Z Movie 6: Cooler Returns is a sequel to Dragon Ball Z Movie 5: Cooler\'s revenge. So unless you don\'t to get spoiled about stuff from the previous movie, I suggest watching the previous one first.It is the first movie where Piccolo doesn\'t appear to safe Gohan since that cliche was introduced. But it is also the first movie Vegeta appears and seeing up his role as ""Only I can beat Kakarot."" as he stopped the villain from killing him. And its the first time Vegeta and Goku actually work in unison to beat a bad guy.As the name suggest this movie...is about Cooler reappearing Frieza style. Tho not to take revenge on Goku but to invade New Namek which looks like regular Namek for some reason. Well, you can tell this movie was made before the Boo Saga so the writers didn\'t know how New Namek actually looks like.In this continuation which takes place around the time of the Cell Saga before the use of the time chamber, Dende is the new God of Earth ealier and requested from Goku and the gang to go to New Namek because of shit happening there.We have Goku, Gohan, Piccolo and Krillin as fighters. Roshi, Yajirobe and Oolong for comic relief and who want to explore I guess. Yajirobe only exist obviously because he was ordered by Korin, the god of martial arts as he has the Senzu.On Namek the Namekian are enslaved by Super Robots from a giant squid like planet that eats planets to get mightier. Goku and the gang arrive to stop them and pretty much struggle against these Robots. Normally I am against some robots posing a threat to the Z Fighters, but we will find out that the machines are created with the energy of god knows how many planets the BIG GETE STAR consumed. So they stronk.Amounts the robots there is obviously Cooler who was saved from being incinerated from the Sun fighting Super Saiyan Son Goku. He obviously is happy that Goku came for a rematch saving him the trouble to look after him.I think this movie uses its cast far better than the awful Revival of F movie. The foot soldiers are actually posing a threat and Goku is kept busy fighting Cooler. While in Revival of F Frieza didn\'t lift a finger and made it feel like the movie time is being padded.Many complain about this movies art quality. While it looks bad in some scenes and if you pause during action scenes, the fights if you watch it is very well animated. When it comes to action, very few Dragon Ball movies can keep up with Return of Cooler.This movie is also good at setting the tone of hopelessness. There are several times where it seemed like the character\'s trump card finally worked only for it to fail or something more dangerous to happen. An example is when Goku finally decided to turn Super Saiyan looking like he got the advantage and delivered a major blow. Only for the Gete Star fixing Cooler in a  way such a strike won\'t work twice.This made Cooler\'s regenerative powers unique amounts other Dragon Ball villains and honestly his responses to anything thrown at him. The film is also really good at justifying machines being able to fight the Z Fighters. While I don\'t like the Androids from Gero, minus Cell, being able to fight anyone at Frieza\'s tier, I can buy Cooler and the robots being able to fight them. Considering one of the robots is Frieza\'s older brother who required a Super Saiyan to put down and the Gete Star having energy of several planets and its lifeforms in it.It really feels like the common man vs the industry. So there are some interesting symbolism that goes more than 2 guys punching each other until the other is down.Finally what brought down Cooler and the Gete Star also had a great symbolism where human has things like willpower and spirit aka there is more to men than flesh and blood.Besides the comic relief cast, each member was crucial. Without Vegeta, Goku would likely not be able to beat Cooler. Unlike in many other movies where he feels like he exist because he is popular like in Dragon Ball Movie 13 Wrath of the Dragon or Dragon Ball ""Z"" Movie 15 Revival of F. That is because in most movies he gets beaten up and his fight don\'t really have any consequences to the outcome.CriticismThere are also some negatives. For instance Goku still using the Kaioken despite it being outdated when he can just turn Super Saiyan. The comic relief trio being kinda irrelevant considering Krillin and Gohan were also kinda filling that role. Not that I personally hate the scenes since I really love me some Master Roshi. Especially being in a movie without any ""hot chicks"" for him to fall over for. So you don\'t get the same repetitive jokes.One last scene that bothered me is when Vegeta and Goku seemed like they finished off Cooler only for them being surrounded about to enter another fight. And that is when Goku flat out states the obvious in the scene with a great scene where they perfectly worked as ""Show don\'t tell"".And obviously some scenes looked godawful where many use this movie as means to defend Dragon Ball Super\'s early shitty animation. I also feel this movie could have worked without Cooler being the villain since the Big Gete Star was already justifying its prominence as a threat. So this felt like the writers were cashing in on the popularity of a villain. Tho it\'s not as bad as Frieza returning for a billion times and Broly keep reappearing in various forms.Lastly Piccolo, despite being the strongest at this point, because he fused with God, didn\'t do as much as you would hope. The Super Saiyans pretty much overshadowed him in this movie.Overall this movie was very good. Despite its negatives it pretty much shits on most Dragon Ball movies in terms of writing and quality. The soundtracks in Japanese are used amazingly and the visuals feel like its an homage to old scifi anime. So if you like these kinds of things, you will definitively fall in love with his movie.And like Cooler\'s Revenge, it is highly recommended to watch it even if its ""non-canon"". is about Cooler reappearing Frieza style.

So if you like these kinds of things, you will definitively fall in love with his movie.And like Cooler\'s Revenge, it is highly recommended to watch it even if its ""non-canon"".', 'I think Cooler said it best, when he described super saiyans as a ""all show and no substance."" Well... that\'s exactly, how I would describe both this movie, and this franchise, as a whole! Beneath the brightness and flashiness, with pretendous epicness, there\'s this sullen, sunken and hollow emptiness, that I for one, just can\'t seem to be able to fill... and for once, I\'m not sorry because of it!Let me get one thing perfectly straight! I do think, that Toriyama, is very intriguing atrist... with his stupid poses, singular face-motions, and character-styles, that\'ll all just blend in together, without much distinction between each other......but artist, nontherless! The namekians truly look good, same with Frieza\'s final form, and Cell\'s... first form. What I don\'t think he is, is a storyteller, or even capable of comprehending even the most simplest human minds, emotions and motives. His characters are just like tools for him, with very little personality, or motives, which leads him telling them, what to do, instead of them telling him, what they want to do, thus engaging the characters to grow, and develope naturally, without force, and with actual subtlety. Forcing characters to change, or stay the same, for the sake of the plot, is not very talented writing, and what comesn out of it, is just some pointlessness thrown in the air, resembeling this ultimate mess, called DBZ. Characters are so blank and unindearing, that they\'re like a memes from themselves - little to no personality, nor motives, with stupid/non-existent/implossible development, and stories, that are just as much actual stories, than five rounds in a row, of Street Fighter arcade-game! The show had the same problem, and so does these movies, and more I see them, the more they start to look exactly the same, with same colors, and same taste... which is the taste, of wet cardboard, soaked in piss!But, what about the actual movie, itself? Well, sadly - not really - I have to say, that this movie, in it\'s 40-minutes running-time, is just another padding-session, for fans, with lots of adrenaline-boners, actual boning, and finaly, the happy ending - why, I have no idea! Cooler is basically just our ""poor mans choise"" for Frieza, having even less of a character, personality, or motives, than his predecessor... who, by far, was just some coward, with sadistic tendencies, and gleeful racisim. Cooler isn\'t even that, and I really have to wonder, how come he wasn\'t immediately laught at, in his stupid meccha-form, with his stupid plan to brake some shit, with his stupid Spagetti star - I don\'t even care, what the actual name is, anymore! Cooler has really no other motivation for his doings, but a whiny, man-childish temper-tantrum against those, who slapped him in the wrist, but, even if he actually had any real motivations to beging with, it wouldn\'t have made this story any more bearable... because, it wasn\'t! The story was so stupid, thin, and unneeded, that this movie, felt just like one of those fanfics, writen by a 13-year-old boy, which does explain alot of this franchise, if you really think about it! Maybe Akira didn\'t want to flesh-out his character any more, than he absolutely had to, because he already knew, that there were a lot more talented writers out there, than him, and just decided to leave the actual brainwork, for the fanfic-sites! Seriously, when you stumble upon a poorly written fanfiction, that\'s still better, than the original work, there\'s something seriously wrong! One thing this fanfic still missed though - the dragonballs! Collect them, wish this mess to go away, and just... go away! Isn\'t really that hard, you guys! You do this shit all the time! What\'s a hold up, on this one?! And why oh why, did Goku and Vegeta find it so easy to team forces together in this movie, but not in Resurrection of F - makes no sence!And speaking of Vegeta... what was his purpose, in this movie?! I know his one of the favourite fan-wanks of this franchise, but still... even stupidity has it\'s limits! More than that... what was a beef between Vegeta, and Frieza, anyway? They obviously didn\'t like eacother, because Frieza was a racist, and Vegeta prideful brick, but... why take it so personally? Vegeta didn\'t care, if his whole planet was destroyed, and race killed, when he was a child, and as an adult, he actively tried to kill every last survivor, of his kind, man or a child! In japanese dup, he never even once begged Goku to avenge his people, nor his father, and he really didn\'t seem to mind, if he really was only one standing, of his race. He was just pissed, because Frieza just was stronger, than him, and then, begged his not--yeat-victim, to finnish the job - lame! Later, he himself said, that he enjoyed killing, for the pleasure of it - like any good psychopath would - but then he just cries, how he was held in bondage, and being the only actual saiyan alive... after establishing, that he doesn\'t really need anyone. I know, the fans of this dick-wrench, are more than happy to defend him by saying, that he developed out of these... tendencies, but let me tell something lads... psychos don\'t just cure themselves - no one does! Both Vegeta, and his development, are both just as ludicrous, and implossible, as they can get, and it really sickens me to see, how forcefully, Toriyama, is making him to go through changes, that would never ever occur, in any other franchise! And suck that ""Frieza the Slaveowner""- bullshit!  Frieza gave both Vegeta, and the saiyans everything, those barbarians could ever ask for, without unneeded cruelty or violence - as far as I could see - and if by bondage, you mean like a father, who tells you to clean up your rooms, do your chores, and stay away from drugs, in order for you to keep killing and doing what the hell ever you please, then yes... truly, you are the one, with the deepest scars, Vegeta! Oh, all the tears of... not caring, one bit! Vegeta was, and always will be, in my books, just some spoiled, murderous and psychotic brat, and the very fact, that they\'re trying to paint him over, as a hero in this movie, truly makes me sick! That kick in the nutts by Cooler, was the very least, what he deserved... too bad, that Frieza was way too bro, to deliver the blow, himself!Atleast, one thing is clear for me by now, after watching my fair share of these movies. Dragon Ball franchise knows, what its fans want from it. Lots of lights and color, but no substance - characters with two or three traits, no motivations, to stories nor plots, little to no brainpower behind any of it, and padding. Lots, and lots of padding. And, since it already knows, what to give to it\'s audience, it\'s not trying to evolve, or develope, like any other franchise would atleast try to do, and same goes to this movie! It knows it\'s fans, and celebrates the fact, that it doesn\'t even have to try to be anything else, but what its fans expect it to be, thus just feeding that stupid man-child inside of them. While not bad, per say, it also doesn\'t offer anything, in return - no thought, no morals, no lessons, no consept of actions=consequense, and no developtment, both from its characters, or its stories. Hardly any of these movies, nor this franchise, has any real, or actual conflicts, and what very little there is, the only working solution seems to be... hitting it harder. Like... really hard. Like your trying to pop a boner, in a middle of the dentist, pulling out your teeth. And, since it\'s so obviously empty, pointless and lacking any real substance, it\'s fans try to make it feel more grand, and meaningful, than it actually is, and that\'s the real problem - pointing out meaning and substance, where there is non, is just as bad, like those spin-off cartoons of Titanic... your soul knows the truth! It\'s not even trying to challenge its fans, by giving them any actual characters, morals, stories or conflicts, because it already knows, it doensn\'t have to, and to me, that\'s never a good sign, for a good movie, neither a franchise!All in all, this movie was pointless, and so is this franchise, for not offering us nothing more, but some mindless, unentertaining junk, that even a 5-year-old would sneer at! Don\'t see this movie. It\'s not worth it... even if you are a fan. It\'s mercifully short, but that\'s about it. It holds every single flaw, and weak point, like this whole franchise does, and if youre not a child, or someone, who\'s already seen some actually good anime, you really shouldn\'t bee enyoing this one, either.Story: 2Art: 3Sound: 3Characters: 2Enjoyment: 1Overall: 2 but artist, nontherless!

It makes me want more plain old Dragon Ball stuff, in the time before constant power levels and fifty-chapter long fight scenes forced all of the humor and fantasy into the background. Considering how unstoppably popular Dragon Ball Z was at the time, they easily could have utilized these movies to focus on the lesser characters and the ways they\'ve grown over the years when they aren\'t training or anything. Instead, we get more Goku (and Vegeta this time!) fighting against...a bland villain with bland motives.Worst of all, this movie is made impossible to reconcile with canon BECAUSE of Goku existing. This story has to take place after the Cell Saga stuff in the series due to a few factors, but... clearly that ain\'t it here.Anyway, Cooler sucks, even though cyborg planetary hybrid Cooler is a neat cosmic horror concept that could have been real cool, and the plot is once again just ""fighting fighting fighting.""

If you consider how Frieza looked after Namek's explosion.2, This movie is about fighting only. There's no interesting addition to Cooler persona. His purpose is the same as the previous movie: Frieza vibes plus Darth Vader vibes.3, Vegeta appearing out of nowhere is a big plot hole.4, Big Gete Star. I am not a fan of this plot device.For me, Return of Cooler is worse than Revenge of Cooler. It doesn't take any time to attempt to develop Cooler as a character. Instead, they give us cheap Darth Vader and fighting fanservice, and that's not enough for me.I've rated Revenge of Cooler 6/10, and since I think Return of Cooler is worse, I give it 5/10. I guess you can try this movie. I did enjoy fighting, but I can't recommend it to you as it's just below average, and fighting scenes won't save its score. and never happened in the manga.My positives from the movie:1, Metal Cooler looks cool2, Fighting fanservice3, 10 million Coolers vs Vegeta's ballsack (no, that's not a name of a porn movie)4, DBZ art style and music coat.My negatives from the movie:1, The fact Cooler has survived the sun's heat head-on is absurd.

But like most Dragon Ball Z movies, it can't fit into the main story and is another parallel timeline kind of experience.New Namek is being invaded by overpowered robots, and Dende, who has become the new guardian earlier in this continuity, sent Goku and the gang to investigate. These new robots pose a massive threat since they can take attacks even from Piccolo before changing his fighting style who is the strongest character at this point from the good guys. Amongst the...robots is a robot version of Cooler who happened to survive his encounter with Son Goku.Can Goku defeat the powered up Cooler and can they stop the Gete Star who is the host computer who tries absorbing the planet which explains why all these robots can even pose a threat?The fights in this movie are amazing and the characters have to figure out how to penetrate the armor of these robots. Metal or Meta Cooler is also a unique foe with various tricks up his sleeve such as regeneration which fixes issues in its components or Instant Transmission.This movie is also the first time Goku and Vegeta team up and fight alongside each other which wouldn't happen in the main continuity until the Boo Saga. It is also the first time Vegeta appears in a Dragon Ball movie and it doesn't feel like he is shoehorned in like in other movies since his assistance is pretty much required to finish the main villalin.While the artstyle and still frames look awful, the animation itself is fluid and looks great. And being a movie mostly focused on action, it does a really good job at it and the fight against Cooler is memorable because of the shift in power. Cooler really feels like an unbeatable force in this movie since he gets stronger each time he repairs himself even pressuring two Super Saiyans. Even the images seen can give first time viewers the creeps being unusually scary how Cooler outclasses the until then unbeatable warrior or legend.But it wouldn't be a Dragon Ball movie without comedy sprinkled around and the good thing is there are no sudden tone shifts that ruin these intense scenes. Comic relief is provided mainly by Yajirobe, Oolong and Master Roshi who just came to sightsee I guess.In terms of movie cliches, it establishes Vegeta's role of saving Goku but telling that only he can kill him. And some of the flashy scenes like the Big Bang Attack and Instant Transmission being used. It is also one of few movies where they win with teamwork without giving away energy to Goku.This movie is very underrated despite having a popular character like Cooler in it probably because of the akward still frames. But if you like Dragon Ball Z for the amazing fights, good humor and the characters, you will probably enjoy watching Cooler's return. robots is a robot version of Cooler who happened to survive his encounter with Son Goku.Can Goku defeat the powered up Cooler and can they stop the Gete Star who is the host computer who tries absorbing the planet which explains why all these robots can even pose a threat?The fights in this movie are amazing and the characters have to figure out how to penetrate the armor of these robots.

Dragon Quest: Your Story,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39274/Dragon_Quest__Your_Story,"['I am legit mad over this bad movie. I was shocked going into this to see this movie didn\'t make its budget back in Japan. Dragon Quest is like a religion in Japan, how could it not be the biggest earning movie ever. Now I know why. It is because it\'s trash.Obviously most of the time people are only driven to review something if they really enjoyed it or really hated it, and as stated I am the latter. In fact I am still riding the high of how disappointed I am so keep that in mind while reading.I will start with good.The art is...actually pretty good. I know a lot of people wanted the OG Toriyama style but it is still a pretty movie. The effects are probably hands down my favorite thing about the movie, they really hit it out of the park with the partical effects.Music is classic DQ, so there is that. Even though the scene you first hear the overture in kind of ends with imagery that doesn\'t match the triumphant tune.And that is all that I liked...So the movie has bad pacing issues, which in all honesty I expected as a lot of adaptations have the same issue, especially anything trying to condense a story. I was able to deal with some of it, as I am used to that with a lot of anime adaptation films for tv series. I initially felt it would help if they didn\'t assume that everyone has played DQV, though I understand those are the people they assume will see it. (Also, in Japan it is probably safe to assume most people have some knowledge of it.) However, it is more than just rushing through the story. Their ability to set up a scene suffers from the pace they try to maintain the whole move. There are few if any establishing shots to give you a feel of an area or give any extra weight to a scene. We go from the Hero being kidnapped, to 10 years later in a prison camp, to them escaping a prison we barely see, through a city we never see again, to him returning home that we only saw for seconds in the beginning of the movie, where we have little to no connection to because the Hero himself barely reacts to being home after 10 years because the plot need to start up again.The story suffers more than I thought it would after starting it. I figured they would give an abridged version of the first few hours of the game so we could get to the main story. What I didn\'t think they would do though is introduce characters vital to the story without an actual introduction. It reminded me of G1 Transformers. A character shows up and they are already established and have a connection to the Hero. Bianca gets your typical ""Oh I haven\'t seen you since..."" intro but she is the only one. Everyone else, they just start talking like they have always known one another for years and it takes half a conversation before you realize why the Hero knows them already. Not to mention when they just talk about dungeons and quests from the game as if we would have already seen them. Again it is assuming you have played the game but this time it assumes that you have an intimate knowledge if the game.This is more of a nitpick but they had a few fourth wall moments and ""in jokes"" that took me out of the movie. Stuff like this always bugs me because it feels like either the screenplay writer or the director throws it in because they don\'t take the property they are working on seriously. One that really took me out was when the Hunter Mech/Killing Machines were introduced and a comment about robots being ""a little random"" was thrown in. (wording may be different from subs to actual spoken Japanese in the scene.) It just sucked me out because the Machine Family of monsters has been in this universe since the second game. That is maybe just me being to much of a nerd about it though.I could have dealt with all that though and walked away with this as like a 6.5 or 7, HOWEVER, once the ""twist"" ending was revealed it all started to make sense and piss me off. The rushing through the intro to the game along with certain story segments, the stupid little jokes, the painful nods to the camera, and even some of the particle effects used. I tried not to spoil anything in case someone out there really wants to watch this and is reading reviews first, but this twist ending not only killed the whole movie for me but really has me questioning why fantasy as a genre is so stale in Japan right now and why they are so stuck on the big thing at the moment when it comes to ""fantasy"". Also, the whole idea that people need to grow up and let this story/game/video games in general go and just let them be a fond memory all while faking some kind of sincerity in delivering that message really pissed me off. I am sorry if you can figure out the twist with that, but maybe I saved you some time instead.In the end, I was really hoping this movie would do good outside of Japan. It could get some more interest in Dragon Quest for new fans and ride the wave of positivity from DQXI. Then maybe we could have gotten a few more games that we never got here (DQX) or just more Dragon Quest stuff in general. That was apparently just me setting the bar WAY to high.So yeah, I have strong nerd opinions on this one. Watch it if you are interested but I wouldn\'t recommend it. actually pretty good.

And I heard that people were angry they did not used the original Akira animation style.  Considering that, I still find the animation very nice.  I like the artstyle and the animation is FF7 Advent Children caliber.  Very far from the likes of the new Berserk or Kingdom.  The plot twist at the end, although im not sure if its a spoiler, but to be on the safe side, i will consider it a plot twist to avoid spoilers, is very nice eventhough this plot...twist element is something i have grown to hate lately as its been used as the main element of most animes.Overall, I enjoyed the anime very much.

I am abit curious though if my opinion would differ if id have played the game.', ""As someone who has very warm memories of playing this game on the DS back in the day, I was really looking forward to this movie. Dragon Quest games never had the deepest stories, but they're always engaging, and DQV is arguably the game with the best story in the franchise, so it was very exciting to hear that the choose this specific game to adapt into a movie. However, that also leads to one of the biggest obstacles this movie has to face; it choose the game that would be the hardest to live up to.The main problem with this movie is that it...often doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. On the one hand it seems to base itself almost entirely off nostalgia, meaning that if you don't have fond memories of the game and remember it's story fairly well, you'll probably be at a loss for what the hell is going on most of the time. On the other hand, barely anything that happens in this movie is done as it is in the game, with a lot of characters never even appearing, and the ones that do often acting totally different from how they are in the game. Visually the movie also clearly does it's own thing, which isn't necessarily negative as it's visually quite solid for the most part,but for nostalgic fans (which again, this movie clearly tries to pander to) it may be a bit weird to see these characters look totally different from their original designs by Akira Toriyama.The entire movie also has an incredibly rushed pace throughout it's runtime, which makes it hard to get attached to the characters, as they're always rushing off to the next goal without ever giving us any breathing room to get to know them better. This means major events like Pankraz's death or the hero's return home after ten years as a slave aren't given enough time to leave any impact on the viewer.There's also the twist of the movie, which I won't spoil here, but it's fair to say it's a twist most people will either love or hate. I'm guessing most viewers will lean towards the latter. It's not a dumb twist per say, but it IS a confusing one, as it doesn't really add anything to the movie other than a weird, almost cultish, message that encourages escapism to an unhealthy degree. As someone who really adored the game when I first played it, and still occasionally play it to this day, the message didn't resonate with me in the slightest, and I'd honestly be a bit concerned for the people who do. These games are awesome, but in the end they're still games, and should be treated as such.Sound-wise this movie has a solid soundtrack, but the voice acting is a bit more of a mixed bag, especially if you watch in english. I watched the movie with the English dub, and though the voice actors all do a solid job with what they're given, it's hard to get invested when the script gives them very little to work with. Nearly every line is phrased awkwardly, using wording that sounds either stilted or just plain unnatural, which really took me out of the experience. It also doesn't help that the English lip-syncing is rather poorly done. I watched the movie again in Japanese, and the difference in quality is noticeable enough that I would definitely claim the Japanese dub as superior. Still, kudos to the English voice actors who clearly did their best with what they had.Overall, this movie clearly tries hard in a lot of areas, but sadly doesn't really live up to any of its many ambitions. It looks and sounds great, but the plot is all over the place with a pace that's so rushed it's hard to ever really care what's happening. It expects you to know the game's story before even watching it, yet at the same time it ignores and glosses over so many major plot events it leaves me wondering who they even made this movie for in the first place.

Throughout the runtime I was always invested in the characters and plot and captivated by the fight scenes and beautiful art and animation. While the characters are likable, they aren’t very nuanced and leave a little bit to be desired. The score is decent, if a little repetitive and the sub had very good voice acting for the most part while the dub left much to be desired. While the world was believable, it didn’t really seem that livens in or fleshed out. Ultimately, this movie suffers from pacing that just feels to fast and, like...a lot of anime movies, it just feels like it would’ve been better as a series so it could have better plot progression and world building. While there is room for improvement, I wasn’t disappointed by this movie at all. a lot of anime movies, it just feels like it would’ve been better as a series so it could have better plot progression and world building.

I wasn't really on board with the character design since I thought they didn't really recreate Toriyama's style all that well but I liked how the world and monsters looked. The soundtrack is also fantastic, from what I could tell they just re-used the soundtrack from the game but it worked really well and added a nice bit of nostalgia.The story itself is pretty much a rushed version of the original RPG, with some minor details being changed. They erased some characters like Deborah...(which is fine by me) and Hero's daughter (which is very questionable) and skipped over some story beats. The whole movie feels somewhat rushed but I thought they did a decent job retelling the story in a way that makes sense for people who don't know the game. It's a bit sad they skipped over the childhood part with Bianca in an 8-bit sequence, but I understand why they did this.So, of course this isn't the best way to experience the story of DQV at all. If you have the slightest interest playing the game, skip this movie and play it first, it would be a waste to spoil yourself on all the twists since the story of DQ V in particular is really great. If you don't have any interest whatsoever then you can easily watch and understand this. I think it works that way too.But I feel like this movie was aimed specifically at people who already played Dragon Quest V. The ending in particular really reinforces that idea. I don't want to spoil it, but the twist towards the end is something a lot of people watching the movie utterly HATED and while I think I understand why, I totally disagree.

Based on the classic Dragon Quest V, it should just be a summary of the game and that's the feeling you will have for most of the film. Oddly enough it dares to be more than just a summary film and unfortunately that's where it falls from being something enjoyable to leaving you scratching your head wondering what exactly just happened.As a tale about Dragon Quest, it struggles. It handles the big moments fairly competently, but a good story isn't just about the big moments. It's also about the little transitions that got you to those...moments. That is where Dragon Quest: Your Story stumbles for anyone that hasn't watched or enjoyed the classic video game.There are very few scenes that transition you from moment to moment in the movie. It's like the animators had been told they have to put specific scenes into the film and they put them in order and then they told the editor to make it work while they had a beer after work. It's poor story telling, but overall it's just sloppy. If it was a time constraint thing, I might understand but the movie makes that painfully aware that's not the case.Sadly, the ending of the film dashes that assumption as an unnecessary and unappreciated twist that lends the title a bit more weight hurts any hopes of really needing to revisit the film in the future. I'm not going to spoil it because the film takes such a left turn it should be experienced by those actually curious to view it. I will say that the somewhat poor implementation capped with a sloppy ending hurts what should have been a big debut for a Dragon Quest film in the West.With all the negative aside, the film is pretty. Sure it isn't quite legendary artist Akira Toriyama's classic designs come alive on screen, but the art we are given isn't a disservice to his original creations. The sound is what you have come to know and love from Dragon Quest's numerous classic titles. For all extents and purposes, those animators and the sound crew did their job the way they were supposed to. When you are experiencing the battle with Bjorn, it really does feel like a fun little film.For Dragon Quest fans, this is a particularly aggravating film and for those that aren't, it's a bit confusing.

This short review contains spoilers.The start was very rushed. I think it\'s around 10 hours long in the game and it gets 10 minutes. The death of the father is supposed to be emotional, but it\'s laughable. He was only in about two scenes before his dramatic death. It\'s so dramatic it\'s cringey to watch because there\'s no emotional attachment to his character owing to the short screen time.Beginning the movie as a \'game\' is also questionable. After seeing the ending I know why they did it, foreshadowing.The middle, and the longest part of the movie,...is actually very good.

I only played some of the GameBoy Color games as a kid, but even then, I never completed them because they were hard. But Dragon Quest is a pretty popular game series in Japan, with the most recent game, Echoes of an Elusive Age, being released on the Switch with glowing critical reception. So when it was announced that a movie was being made, based on what many consider to be the best game in the series, Dragon Quest 5, people were ecstatic...until they saw the very end of the movie, which had a very strange plot twist put...in that was so out of place and came out of nowhere that after the fact, reviews poured in that lambasted the movie for it. Even people in Japan hated it, feeling like it was a huge cop-out. As of now, Your Story is on Netflix, and I just finished watching it. What do I think of it? Well...I honestly don't feel it's as bad as people are making it out to be, but even without the twist, the movie still has a lot of problems.The story focuses on a young man named Luca, who is the son of a famed hero named Pankraz. After his mother is kidnapped by the evil Bishop Ladja, he and his father attempt to save her, but Ladja kills Pankraz and takes Luca and his friend Harry to be slave labor. When he and Harry escape a decade later, Luca decides to return home and find answers. There's a legend about a hero being able to wield a magical sword, and his father left a final message in his diary, thinking that Luca might just be that hero. Armed with this knowledge, and joined by a saber cat and a friendly slime, Luca embarks on a worldwide quest to find the magic sword, stop Ladja from summoning an evil being named Nimzo, save his mother, and by extension, the world.Overall, if I were to use one word to describe this movie, it would be overstuffed. Being that Your Story is adapted from a video game that can be about 20-30 hours long, it's inevitable that a lot would get lost in the transition from game to movie, since that's plagued video game movies for years. However, Your Story is clearly trying to adapt as much material as possible within a one hour and forty-five minute time frame, but at the expense of pacing. The pacing in this movie is very fast, so you'll never feel bored, as there's always something going on. However, some segments, which should have been more fleshed out in order to make us care about the characters, such as Luca and Bianca's entire childhood together, aren't given any focus at all, so when we actually meet those characters, the audience is confused as to why she's so important and why they should even care about her or her relationship with Luca. It doesn't help that the very beginning of the movie just blatantly uses footage from the game to set up said relationship and just glaze over the events that led to the entire plot, which to me is just lazy. Honestly, that part bothered me more than the plot twist, because using game footage in favor of, you know, doing your own interpretation of the beginning of the game with your own fingerprints just makes you seem lazy and insecure. The game footage was completely unnecessary, because the creators could have used that time to show Luca being born into the world and flesh out his character more.It's especially insulting from an animation standpoint, because in all honesty, the CG animation here is absolutely stunning. Like, practically Pixar-level quality. I've never seen a CG anime movie that looked this amazing before now. This makes Land of the Lustrous look like Rapsittie Street Kids. The textures and overall look of the movie are amazing to look at, with the environments all rendered in exquisite detail. If you didn't know any better, you'd think the environments were live-action. The human characters actually look like people, and not like polygonish-looking humans with weird faces and awkward mouth movements. One other thing people didn't like about the movie was that Akira Toriyama's designs weren't used in the movie. To be honest, I don't really mind, as I think he's kind of overrated, and I figure his style would be really hard to animate, especially in a CGI movie, so I think the animators dodged a bullet on that one. I also really like that the animation doesn't skimp on really small details, like the scars and scratches people get on their bodies when they're fighting monsters, the texture and myriad of strands in someone's hair, or the transluscence of a slime's body. Those little things really make the setting and the animation feel much more alive. The actual character motion is just as amazing, and every movement is fluid and smooth, with little to no sluggishness or choppy frames. Seriously, Japan really set a new standard for CG movies, and considering their CG movies tend to have a bad rep, they should really learn from Your Story.The soundtrack is pretty great too, with big, epic orchestral pieces that really make you feel like you're on an adventure to save the world. From what I've heard, these are redone versions of pieces from the game soundtrack, and I think they've been rendered pretty well here. However, in light of some really disgusting things fans have learned about Koichi Sugiyama and his political views, that's the only thing I'm going to say about the soundtrack. I like the music, but I don't like the composer as a person. But that's neither here nor there, so I won't waste time dwelling on it.Because of the movie's brisk pacing and its attempts to tell a huge story in a limited format, the characters don't the development and fleshing out that they deserve. As a result, they all come off as bland archetypes that we've seen in a million other fantasy movies of this caliber before. Luca's the idealistic hero, Bianca is the tomboyish childhood friend, Nera is the friendly princess, Ladja is yet another Saturday morning cartoon villain who is just evil for the sake of it, so on and so forth. I'm sure they got a lot more depth and development in the game, but again, I haven't played the game, so I can only judge them based on how the movie portrays them. Honestly, Ladja was just terrible. He was just a stereotypically evil villain who's there to just laugh all the time and be a dick to the hero. Nimzo was basically a non-entity as a character, and he only appears for a few minutes and that's it.The story itself isn't really anything special. It's just another sword hero saving the world plot, only he gets married and has a kid later on. That's not a spoiler, by the way. The game does this, too. As for the controversial twist in the movie...well, I agree that it did come out of nowhere and seem lazy in concept, but I don't hate it nearly as much as other people do. Don't get me wrong, I do hate the twist, but considering the movie's other problems, the twist is only a small part of a very flawed product overall. Honestly, I thought the Ni no Kuni movie's final twist was much worse, more out of place, and much more mean spirited. Do I feel like Your Story could have benefitted from leaving this twist out? Absolutely? It would have just been another fantasy movie if it did so, but I'm okay with that. From what I heard, the creators meant for this movie to be a love letter to fans of the franchise, so the twist was put in there to appeal to them specifically. But when you put it like that, you wind up alienating audiences who have never played Dragon Quest, me being one of those people, when the movie could have done just fine without it. Sometimes trying to add in a bunch of out of nowhere twists can hurt a product rather than make it better (Looking at you, Guilty Crown). They say less is more, after all.Do I think Your Story is bad? Actually, no, I don't. True, there are a ton of other movies that are way better, but for what it is, it's a fairly decent, if very flawed and bumpy fantasy romp. But unless you're a diehard Dragon Quest fan, I doubt it'll appeal to you specifically. in that was so out of place and came out of nowhere that after the fact, reviews poured in that lambasted the movie for it.

But after watching the ""Stand By Me Doraemon"" movies, I saw that the directors of those also made this. Holy shit. This movie is incredible.It goes through an entire SNES JRPG that was packed with story, so it\'s constantly at a breakneck pace, but it never felt like anything was under-explained. We saw what we needed to see. The things we didn\'t see (such as the transformation into the Zenith Dragon) would not have served the larger narrative. It\'s so economical.

It\'s trying to give these character designs room to make themselves believable instead of surrounding them with photorealism that constantly makes us check. I can\'t know if the work behind this was a labor rights violation, but I hope it wasn\'t.The twist at the end upset a lot of people, and I just cannot understand why. It\'s literally just a celebration of nostalgia instead of a condemnation of it, which has become trite at this point. Yeah, they made a ""Dragon Quest V"" movie because people still like ""Dragon Quest V"". There\'s nothing wrong with that. Anyone should be allowed to make one, and only the evil of copyright stands in the way.Also, the introductory sequence where it plays out like a scene on the SNES (while it didn\'t translate well to the English adaptation I was watching) was so fun and experimental.

It has gorgeous 3D animation perfectly-suited to Akira Toriyama\'s fantasy-world of cartoon monsters and rolling, green hills; some perfectly-timed gags; and runs at a fast-enough clip to gloss over the less-interesting moments of a lengthy JRPG campaign. Most of the controversy surounding this movie comes from the third-act twist, which reveals this picture-perfect world to be a virtual game simulation being experienced by an adult DQ fan seeking to relive his childhood, and being confronted for it by...a condescending A.I. who breaks out of the machine to, I guess, mock him? It\'s a confusing climax that doesn\'t seem to commit to any particular message, as the protagonist fights back for his God-given right to experience nostalgia with the aid of cutting-edge VR technology. Is it telling DQ fans to grow up, or to not grow up? I guess it could be charitably interpreted as saying ""you don\'t need to abandon your inner child to grow up,"" or something along those lines, but it\'s an ending that just leaves me weirded out. One of the more bizarre and abrupt tonal shifts I\'ve seen in what is ostensibly a children\'s movie in a long time. You could argue that DQ: Your Story is symptomatic of a wider industry trend where toyetic, nostalgic IPs are being stretched thin to serve the needs of multiple generations of fans until they no longer mean anything at all.

The point of this OVA was purely entertainment.in the first half of the OVA your watching a ISDA film with all the main characters in a completely different role then what they had in the anime. Toa's role was closest to her original one being the main female character in love with the...main male character, which happens to be howling star in the film. but after that the OVA pics up with every one in a deserted nursing home and trapped inside by a fierce thunder storm which sends a bolt of lighting into an abandoned ISDA research facility and activates a failed experiment with CSS which dont harm the dragons, but instead does one of two things, either amplifies an existing characteristic of there personality, or makes them a 180 degree of there former selfs.so if you want to see the cast in a pointless but funny and perverted as hell mini episode then watch it, for all you perverted toa fans you'll love the out going, kinky and neko version of toa. main male character, which happens to be howling star in the film. but after that the OVA pics up with every one in a deserted nursing home and trapped inside by a fierce thunder storm which sends a bolt of lighting into an abandoned ISDA research facility and activates a failed experiment with CSS which dont harm the dragons, but instead does one of two things, either amplifies an existing characteristic of there personality, or makes them a 180 degree of there former selfs.so if you want to see the cast in a pointless but funny and perverted as hell mini episode then watch it, for all you perverted toa fans you'll love the out going, kinky and neko version of toa."", ""This Special has nothing to do with the other storyline, but is hilarious and features all the main characters from the actual story.The first is  a movie trailer which starts off the hilarity, with Howling Star as the hero at a not-so-normal high school.The second is when the Dragonauts take a vacation on an island where the dragons' personalities are reversed.Story: Probably one of the best side stories I've seen in a while.

However, I want to quote my review of the series ""If we let Sagiri\'s relationship leave the spectrum, we can appreciate some characters like the promiscuous and introverted personality of Elf Yamada and the shy, educated nature of Muramasa, but unfortunately if we add Sagiri into the equation, Masamune\'s relations are unbalanced and, in some cases, forced.""As you can see, the real OVA explains that phrase. The OVA is beautiful and enjoyable. We can laugh at the ideas and reactions of Yamada Elf. I most enjoy the song, the lies,...her attitude, and all the actions during the OVA. I wonder why I enjoy the OVA ... Ohh yes, Sagiri wasn\'t there. It is similar to episode 9 from the main series.On the other hand, we can see the contrast in the second episode. I do not consider the second episode as an OVA; it is a surplus of the main series, and the opening gives me the reason. None wanted to transmit it, so let\'s add it as an OVA, none will notice that is a residue. Yes sure, we noticed and the score for that episode is 3 - 4 and I am being generous.That extra episode is very dull. Seeing how Sagiri tries to take care of her ill brother is nonsense.

When spring 2017 brought us this, we thought we had seen everything anime had to offer. We thought. Eromanga Sensei launched into the anime fandom with a clear message: Anime is trash and it will only get worse.Now there are a few OVA's of them and I gonna tell you if they are worth watching.The first OVA has Elf celebrating a party because one of her novels got an anime adaptation. However, her mother wants to bring Elf with her because Elf hasn't find a husband yet. Elf doesn't want that and wants to stay. Pretty okay episode. I liked the...musical piece, but it did not blow my mind in any way and just was kinda there. Overall, okay episode.The second OVA has Sagiri caring for her brother because he is sick. This is, In my opinion, a far better episode then the first OVA. The biggest reason for this is because of the incredibly simple premise. The first OVA has a set story and there is very little room for creativity. This OVA has tons of room for creativity and jokes and it makes good use of it. I chuckled multiple times throughout the episode.Overall, I think the first OVA is okay but can be skipped and the second OVA is a must watch if you liked Eromanga Sensei.Now I need to finish the review, the lights are going out at 7 PM and if I keep going like this the prison guards will punish me. musical piece, but it did not blow my mind in any way and just was kinda there.

I chuckled multiple times throughout the episode.Overall, I think the first OVA is okay but can be skipped and the second OVA is a must watch if you liked Eromanga Sensei.Now I need to finish the review, the lights are going out at 7 PM and if I keep going like this the prison guards will punish me."", ""The two OVA episodes are unrelated, i.e. each one has its own story and no need to watch them in sequence, therefore I'll have to review each one separately.The first episode is about Elf and a party made for her first anime adaptation (or whatever) and her mother, who's not too keen about her life. Frankly I think it's pretty boring. Proper disclosure - I watched this show when it aired back in 2017 and didn't bother watching it again just for the OVA, and I didn't really remember Elf and it took me a while to even understand who she is. Also, it refers...a bit to past episodes, again could be an issue if it's been a while since you last watch the show. Even assuming that you do remember the characters I still don't see much of a plot here. I'll give it a 5 and that's being generous.The second episode is about Masamune being sick and Sagiri tending to him while he's in bed. Sagiri is then forced to face her fears when someone actually depends on her. I don't really want to go into further details in order to avoid spoilers but I will say that it doesn't require you to remember any details from the show besides the fact that Sagiri is virtually always locked in her room. Overall a way better episode and I give it an 8.Since I can't give a score of 6.5 I'm giving this one a 7. If you're short on time you don't have to bother with the first episode, but do watch the second. a bit to past episodes, again could be an issue if it's been a while since you last watch the show.

Frankly , this should\'ve been included with the parent anime from 2017, IMAO this was more like done to boost up the Novel sales, but then again...watching this was pretty much ok, especially when we have the Ymada Ef arce where we see Yamada\'s relationship with her mom as she finally get her own way, but whether or not she kissed Masamune was debatable, thought I\'d wish she did. Characterwise nothing has changed since we still see the same character around here, but there were some developments   with Yamada elf as she tries to further her relationship with Mansamune and Sagiri as she tries to break her chains of isolation by caring for her onichan. Soundwise , well we did get to know about Yamada Elf\'s song that was substituted for  ""adrenaline!!!"" by TrySail that was played on the 2nd ep of the OVA...Btw as you watch this there will only be one fanservice around here and that\'s with Yamada Elf, but don\'t expect it to be a good one , So how I rate this anime is:Story-mediocre 5: The OVA still rides with the parent anime.Art-Mediocre 5: No changes whatsoever, even Yamada\'s fanservice wasn\'t that good.Sound- Good 7: For Yamada\'s song in ep 1.Character- Fair 6: The same character , but there were some developments with Yamada elf\'s to Masamune  and Sagiris coming out of her room kind of thing.Enjoyment- good 7: Since it was still as funny as ever especially when Muramasa tries in vain to see the sick Masamune.Overall- fair 6: Welp it was just very usual for original creator, Fushimi, Tsukasa to focus on sibling relationships like he did with OreImo, so basically for him to make such as this OVA was just him who can\'t get enough of that BroCon kind of thing, in fact his 13- Banme alice , Neko-sis  and Meitantei Shikkaku na Kanojo weren\'t much of a success.So Boom (Mic drop)!!!!!!! watching this was pretty much ok, especially when we have the Ymada Ef arce where we see Yamada\'s relationship with her mom as she finally get her own way, but whether or not she kissed Masamune was debatable, thought I\'d wish she did.

Extremely pleasing and enjoyable short stories. Eromanga-sensei, especially its OVA, really is the epitome of the definition of the word MOE. It revived the goddess Kirino from Oreimo, creating the unending kyunkyun dokidoki feeling.

The sound and music might be lacking, but it doesn't hinder it from getting a ten from me.

It’s trash. And no, it’s not the “haha it’s the trash anime eromanga-sensei”, it’s actually just trash. The whole episode revolves around elf overcoming her struggles against her mom that appears out of nowhere, and how does she do it? A random song inserted into the episode, which was so bad I actually had to fast forward it.Hold on, it gets even worse from there. The one redeeming factor of this episode (and honestly the whole show), Sagiri, got done one dirty by this episode. Not only did she barely appear, the scene where she did appear, are either...masked Sagiri or her in the formal dress. Frankly, it does not suit her at all. There are a done of outfit that can portray her cuteness, but a formal dress was not it. This episode makes sure to spit in your eye one last time with the final scene which may or may not imply a direct kiss between elf and Masamune, when not even Sagiri has kissed with Masamune yet.However if you notice my score, you would see a 10. This is because if the first episode gets a 3 (and that 3 is purely from the fact it is an Eromanga Sensei OVA), then the second episode gets a 30. Words cannot describe how good this episode was; it’s completely not an understatement to say this was the best OVA I have ever watched. The episode revolves around Sagiri taking care of an ill Masamune. There isn’t some “grand difficulty” that they need to overcome, but only the details of this cute little plot.This episode contains every you could ask for. Firstly, Sagiri’s various expressions and reactions. Her cuteness this episode was completely on par, and possibly every surpass that of the main series. This episode also had its fill of meta fourth wall breaking comedy moment that genuinely made me laugh, and realistic heartwarming moments that genuinely made me smile.And, as much as I support Sagiri (the reason I watch this show), I don’t hate the other side characters at all. This episode shows all the side characters appearing shortly, and the scene they appeared in was actually funny and enjoyable. They portrayed the side character’s charms and personalities, without making them overstay their welcome (*cough first episode cough*).We end this brilliant episode on a final scene of the OVA(and, as unfortunate as it might be, possibly the final scene for the anime adaptation), where Sagiri kisses Masamune on the cheeks. It is shown directly rather than left vague. Nothing is emphasized in particular during the scene- it wasn’t even a direct shot- but it does nothing to take away how happy you feel for the two of them.And of course, the S tier OP and ED that we all know and love is back for both episodes.If you want to understand my review, watch the first episode, but be prepared to later regret it. On the contrast, DEFINITELY watch the second episode. If you think my review hasn’t convinced you, then it’s probably me, not the episode itself. I still feel like what I have written haven’t done the episode justice, and all you need to do is just watch a few minutes of it before becoming hooked and begging into the void for more minutes on the “time remaining”.I just wish both episodes could have the quality of the second episode, but even just the second episode by itself is sufficient to carry this OVA to a solid 10. masked Sagiri or her in the formal dress.

Anyways, that was the impression the main series had on me, the OVA, however, accomplished what the vast majority of OVA's fail to do: develop characters instead of just putting them in a cute and simple scenario.

But what Masamune being sick gives us a Sagiri focused episode really and seeing now Sagiri in the role Masamune had always been in and seeing her both tend to Masamune and deal with his day to day chores (and even an allusion back to the ending theme) and friends in the process was interesting funny to say the least and lastly once again reaffirming Sagiri\'s sibling love to Masamune.Not much to say in the production front as it\'s the same as it was in the original season, with A1-Pictures at the helm and doing some decent amount of detail to the simplest things and the always vibrant character designs and yes this is an OVA, thus showing some skin is in order, well yeah there is, but like the original season, they never go too far so fanservice is rather bare and rare either way.

The Chinese Zodiac is a figure that has long since been used to identify one\'s characteristics and personalities, since there\'s a saying that people are like a certain way on account of their perspective zodiac animal.  So, with an anime about this particular zodiac that is NOT Fruits Baskets, what are we to expect with Etotama?Story (6.34/10): Etotama\'s story is based around the life of one particular individual named Amato Takeru, a high school student who moves into a rather large house by himself in Akiba.  There, he notices a...strange hole in a corner of his house, a hole that for some reason leads to the world of gods (probably).  Here, he meets a girl who comes out of the hole, a cat-girl by the name of ""Nya-tan"", sending Takeru on a journey with this strange eto-musume (basically, a god-like girl, but not an actual god) on her goal to become one of the twelve members of the zodiac.Etotama plays off from the original legend of the zodiac, where the rat tricked the cat before the start of the footrace to determine the twelve zodiac animals, leaving the cat no chance.  With the main story being surrounded around the idea of Nya-tan collecting the twelve sol-lull seals (basically, sol-lull is moe power/gratitude from humans and such) of the twelve zodiac animals so that she can become a member of the zodiac.  The show itself plays with this VERY straightforward plotline for literally the entire show.  Within a given episode, Nya-tan will fight any given Eto-shin (aka, the zodiac animals) in a battledome-style fight where if she wins, she can get their seal and continue off towards the next one sort of like your classic tournament-style anime.Its simplistic plot really only scratches the surface as to what kind of story Etotama has.  The biggest issue I have with Etotama is that for the most part, it\'s inconsistent with the way it wants to deliver its story, particularly in the latter half in the show, which is, mixing comedy, with a serious, dramatic plot.  I see this as Etotama\'s main problem because a good chunk of the time, the show will not only go serious for a brief moment and try and instill an actual plot aside from a cat dicking around with eleven animals and a dragon, which heavily clashes its for the most part, light-hearted and comedic tone that it sticks with most of the time.  They just don\'t really fit together well, and that\'s my main issue with this show.  Another problem I have is the fact that this show REALLY has no consequences with what it does.  Because it mixes comedic elements with an attempted serious tone, a lot of the more dramatic aspects/plot points that are presented in the less funny moments of the show basically get resolved later on when the show decides it wants to bust your funny bone.  To me, it\'s a bit of a distasteful experience because serious and funny don\'t really go together all that well, especially when your characters are gods that have the ability to reincarnate, essentially disregarding any sort of serious moment you attempted to put in the show to begin with.Another thing that bothers me with the show is the fact that it has all of these commandments, rules, and terms that while do get an explanation, don\'t really retain that explanation all that much.  Really, you\'re told what a certain term/rule is, then you\'ll probably forget it in a few episodes because the underlying complexity of these terms racks the brain quite a bit on account of their definitions taking at least 3-4 lines of text just to explain, so yeah, I\'ll pass on that.In terms of a comedy aspect, Etotama is a show that heavily references the fourth wall.  (Insert there is no fourth wall joke here.)  Most of the show\'s comedy comes from Nya-tan herself as her crazy and varying antics boot us from scene to scene of her ridiculous hyperactive personality.  But that\'s not all.  While a lot of the moments are created thanks to Nya-tan, a lot more of them become more prominent because of the expansive zodiac girls cast, which each have their own unique personality to give every joke a little bit of a different twist.  But, like all comedy, it\'s really depending on whether you think it\'s funny or not, since all comedy is subjective.Overall, Etotama\'s story isn\'t really all that fantastic in any real story aspect.  All it is mostly just a group of characters fooling around in an episode by episode story where each episode differs from one another with different and sometimes random topics like Shogi, a horserace, kick the can, and even just straight up bribery on several occasions.  (Nya-tan will do anything to get those seals.)Overview:+ Easy to follow base story+/- Good comedy (if you\'re a fan of fourth wall breaking)-  Has serious moments that clash with the show\'s mostly comedic aspect-  Terms within the show are somewhat complicated to actually remember (for the most part, you just know what the purpose of said term is, then move on with the show)Characters (7.72/10): Characters in Etotama are what I think really the selling point of the show, and really the bigger reason as to why someone would really want to watch this show.But since we have to be follow the rigid formula put in place by the reviewer himself, we\'ll start with Takeru, the only important human character in this show.  (Yay for continuity...) Takeru as a character really...isn\'t all that special.  As a person who produces very good Sol-lull (aka, that moe power thing I was talking about earlier), Takeru is for the most part put into this plot device role rather than an actual main character that has a grave impact on the show.  Most of his work within the show is done in the sidelines as a source of power to Nya-tan, and doesn\'t really involve himself as much with the affairs of the zodiac or Eto-Shin as one may think.  He does have this development where he ""appreciates"" the company of Nya-tan a lot more, but to me, it feels like forced development to give the serious areas of the show more impact, when in reality, it really doesn\'t.  I mean, he\'s already WAY too accepting of a literal dozen of animal girl gods just showing up in his house randomly.  He doesn\'t even so much as flinch when he learns that gods and a world of gods exists.And of course, we have the true star of the show (quite literally, cause she has a starfish thing on her head for some reason.  I don\'t know how that thing works tbh.  I swear it\'s like alive or something...), Nya-tan.  As a cat eto-musume, Nya-tan aspires to be a member of the zodiac for reasons that she herself doesn\'t even remember.  Oh well.  As the central character for the show, Nya-tan is a very exuberant character, attempting to find a character-type for herself so that she can shine and basically, make better ratings for the show.  (Or something like that.)  What I like personally about her is that she\'s not a very grounded character.  She\'s selfish, greedy, sometimes smart, sometimes helpful, determined, lazy, all sorts of adjectives.  I think that\'s what really makes her so much of a memorable character and truly stands above all the other characters in the show.  Of course, whether or not you like her is really your decision, cause she is a character that goes on quite literally, opposite ends of the spectrum.And finally, we have Chuu-tan, the rat Eto-Shin.  Personally, I felt like this character deserved mention specifically because she mainly serves as the show\'s antagonist and has a creed to ""destroy the cat clan!"" and all of that lovely business.  As far as villains go, Chuu-tan is a lacking character for no other reason than her lack of screen time.  While acting as the bad guy for basically the entire run of the show, she doesn\'t really appear all that often and has a very lackluster existence overall because she not only doesn\'t have much to go off on on account of how little she actually appears in the show, but because her actual motives for wanting to slay the cat clan was something I felt was explained very poorly.  It didn\'t really make sense, so I really just had to go along with it, even if I didn\'t truly understand what was being talked about.  That to me, is a major flaw.But truly though, I believe that the real stars of the show belong to the side characters, particularly the eleven Eto-Shin in the zodiac.  While each one of them really gets 1/2 - 1 episode completely devoted to themselves, and they all basically have one-note personalities, they don\'t actually falter all that much in that aspect.  In fact, the one-noteness actually makes most if not all of them more memorable characters.  They\'re a colorful cast that are all fairly easy to remember, and they all show up so often that it really makes it hard to not at least recognize the lot of them right away.  And besides, how can you forget characters like a perverted cow, a traumatized horse, a rooster with a three step memory, a sheep nurse, and the exposition pig with the sesame oil addiction?Overview:+ Interesting female lead+ Great supporting cast-  Male lead leaned towards supporting-  Villain was for the most part, not present/unexplainedArt and Sound (7.44/10): The art for Etotama was made by a little known animation studio by the name of Shirogumi, a studio that really...hasn\'t done all that much in terms of quality work.  Nonetheless, Etotama\'s art style leans heavily towards the moe-style of animation.  With big eyes, cartoony expressions, and these very innocent looking ears on the girls of the show, with the standard animation not really looking all too different from animation these days.  For the most part, it\'s standard fare.  That is, until you get to the battles.Etotama in addition, also uses CGI whenever the characters within the show do battle.  And contrary to what you may think, it\'s not actually that bad.  The CGI for these specific scenes doesn\'t actually look all to bad in terms of Japan\'s CGI standards and does actually give a new depth to the visuals for the show.  Of course, it clashes with the original visuals for the show, that\'s an aspect of it on account of how glaringly different they look from one another.In terms of sound, the OP in particular for Etotama is a very...interesting track to say the least.  Similar to the show itself, the OP switches its tone as well, going from a rock sounding theme with the guitar before leading towards a bouncy melody and cute lyrics.  Personally, I found this song to be VERY addicting and found myself listening to it an absurd amount of times.  Is it a good song?  It\'s ok, not the best, but decent enough.  The ED on the other hand is a very mellow piece, reminiscent of sleeping on a meadow with its calm atmosphere and tones.  The tracks for Etotama aren\'t bad per say, and they\'re actually quite memorable, but they don\'t really stack up to be anything more than a fun song.  They\'re good, but not masterpieces.Overview:+ Standard fare animation+ Decent soundtrack (that I personally find to be memorable)+/- CGI is good, but clashes with the standard animationPersonal Enjoyment (9.00/10): Admittedly...I had more fun with this show than I really should\'ve.  Not only am I a big fan of girls with animal ears (yes, I\'m that kind of person), the fourth wall breaks and the overall comedic style of the show just perfectly suited to my personal tastes.Did I like this anime?Far too much.  It was fun for me to watch, I enjoyed the characters, and I really liked the style of randomness and just overall oddity that the show presented itself to be.  I\'m a personal big fan of fourth wall breaks, so that was definitely an aspect of the show that I really liked.  The music for me is one of my favorites this season, and even with the flaws that I will mention very soon, I really enjoyed this show regardless.What didn\'t I like about this anime?The clash between serious and comedy was really the only true personal downfall I felt.  It\'s tough to balance comedy and plot together, and when you don\'t succeed, the end result doesn\'t really turn out well.  That being said though, every other flaw didn\'t really stick out or bother me too much, and because I really enjoyed the show a lot, there\'s really not much to complain about.Would I recommend this anime?If you\'re looking for something that isn\'t too thought provoking, Etotama is decent for that.  It\'s by no means a masterpiece, but rather just a fun show with randomness, CGI, some ecchi acts from a questionable cow, and lots and lots of fourth wall breaks.  This show really doesn\'t serve much beyond a casual watch on account of its material and style of comedy.  It\'s a decent show, and if you\'re into slapstick or random episodic episodes, and want something new, Etotama\'s a good pick for something of that category.Overall Score: 7.23/10 strange hole in a corner of his house, a hole that for some reason leads to the world of gods (probably).

The very instant I knew it was about members of the Chinese Zodiac battling out with one another in cute chibi forms, the decision was made. Because I am absolutely fascinated with this idea. Coming from a Chinese background,...I am pretty much familiar with the stories regarding the Chinese Zodiac, especially the conflict between the Rat and the Cat. So what made this even more special was that the Cat actually tries to battle her way up the ranks. It\'s a great addition and twist to the initial knowledge I have. Nevertheless, throughout the 12 episodes there were intense battles, heart-warming moments and occasional comical (albeit forced at times) scenes. All these made up what I thought was a decent plot.[ART: 8/10]Not perfect but good enough to portray what had to be portrayed. This is, after all, a light-hearted action/comedy series. Character designs need not be that complicated and detailed, and they complied to that. The battle scenes were sublime though, with all the effects brilliantly worked out and helped to capture most viewers attentions.[CHARACTER: 7/10]Well, 12 Chinese Zodiacs represented by 12 girls, all in 12 episodes. Trying to concentrate on individual character development would be quite a mammoth task. That being said, overall it went pretty well. You can evidently see the Cat growing in confidence along the way, as well as her comrades\' trust in her. Although one down side would be that the Rat\'s did not feature much, and was kinda rushed towards the end.[ENJOYMENT: 8/10]Since Day 1, this series has been something to look forward to every week, for me at least. I\'ve enjoyed it; all the battles were exciting and the jokes made me smile. Though I doubt I\'ll be missing this one badly, but for sure this series won\'t be hard to remember about, because it\'s just so darn unique.[OVERALL: 7/10]For anyone who just wants to while time and watch a series which has a jovial mood to it in addition to some action/adventure, this would be the one for you. If you do pick it up, hope you\'ll enjoy it as much as I did! Cheers! I am pretty much familiar with the stories regarding the Chinese Zodiac, especially the conflict between the Rat and the Cat.

Well, if you have not seen this anime yet, you are going to miss the experience of getting sucked into Satan’s chamber. At the same time, no spoilers in this review.So, Etotama popped up this season. I did not know what to expect when I first heard about it, since I came to put in on my watchlist because of the voice actresses involved. But upon watching the first episode, I just find out how insane it is....Produced by Encourage Films, it revolves about Nyaa-tan, a cat who has an amnesia, and she aims to be a member of the Chinese zodiac through her silly methods. She meets Takeru, a high-schooler who lives in Akihabara, and decides to become a freeloader in his house. In order to reach her goal, she has to battle off against the twelve main zodiac characters and obtain their “Sol/Lull seals”. To explain about this battle system, it will have to take some time (probably a few episodes from the start) for a viewer to understand it fully. Even I had some trouble understanding about it, but after a while it came clear. It is a simple “collect all tokens, reap your rewards” kind of battle. Do not worry as there are eye-catch cards with a piece of information about the battle system during the middle of an episode. Back to the main story, usually in each episode, it introduces one or a few zodiac character(s) and how they will carry forward the story. The synopsis may sound quite clichéd, since there are many other anime with a similar one. It started out a bit weak, but as it progresses, the amount of pleasure into watching the anime grows, with more understanding and development. However, having this fast-paced, some parts of the story can be seen as rushed. The comedy is one of the high points in the anime - there are so many hilarious moments such as how meta it goes. There are also a few emotional scenes, especially during the last two episodes, but I do not think the staff is serious in most of them, since they break into more comedy afterwards. The zodiac is something unique since I never heard of other anime that played zodiac as a part, hence it is good to have a bit of originality here. Overall, it is a nice story to follow up on with extra hilarious comedy.You have twelve zodiac characters, Nyaa-tan, Takeru and maybe two more side characters that are not important as the cast. About Nyaa-tan, the main focal character, she may be dumb and crazy most of the time, but sometimes she understands the situations she face and gets on working to solve them. Maybe a few people will find this daunting, thinking that once she goes back being her usual self, the mood of the story gets ruined. But I felt quite the opposite, since I never want the emotions of the anime to develop further to become forced drama. Her involvement with Takeru is very big, in that case he is like her support. However silly she tries to force him into giving support, he usually does it whenever it is needed. I do not know if there is a lesson learnt in this, but I find it nice. For the other characters, I can say that they definitely have different personalities which have similar anime tropes. As I mentioned earlier, one or a few of them gets their own spotlight in each episode, but I feel that the spotlight do not necessarily be bright. The range of their involvement depends, so while some do have something, others are treated more as side characters who probably make people laugh. Character development is minimal, or I think it was not noticed enough.Another high point in this anime is the 3D animation. This anime has a fair usage of 3D animation, and most of it is used during the battle scenes. I loved the transformation scenes, the sceneries where two characters battle out, the action and visual effects when they fight and also the cute chibi character designs. Everything there is perfect, and I do not think I have any complains in their 3D animation at all. For everything else, I say that it is normal - nothing really stands out from the rest of the anime this season. The sceneries look nice, the character designs look great, and the facial expressions are funny.The opening song, sung by the voice actress of Nyaa-tan, is quite catchy and nice to listen to, if you are into this sort of music. The ending song, sung by all the voice actresses, oppose towards the opening song. It has a much more emotional feel and the vocals are good and they match to the instrumental well. There is one original soundtrack during the transformation scenes that I like, which fuses one type of genre into something more Asian. For every other tracks, I think that they are okay. Voice acting is good - yet again, nothing special. I appreciate Rie Murakawa for voicing Nyaa-tan since she did a great job as acting out with that kind of personality.Etotama is an anime that I found myself to be very high whenever I watch the episodes. Thanks to the comedy, the awesome 3D animation, Nyaa-tan herself, and some of the other characters in the anime, I pretty much enjoyed it a lot. Sure, there are some flaws along the way, but they are just unnoticeable if you do not care at all. And now that is over, I really hope there is another anime next season that fills that spot similar to the anime. Produced by Encourage Films, it revolves about Nyaa-tan, a cat who has an amnesia, and she aims to be a member of the Chinese zodiac through her silly methods. She meets Takeru, a high-schooler who lives in Akihabara, and decides to become a freeloader in his house. In order to reach her goal, she has to battle off against the twelve main zodiac characters and obtain their “Sol/Lull seals”. To explain about this battle system, it will have to take some time (probably a few episodes from the start) for a viewer to understand it fully. Even I had some trouble understanding about it, but after a while it came clear. It is a simple “collect all tokens, reap your rewards” kind of battle. Do not worry as there are eye-catch cards with a piece of information about the battle system during the middle of an episode. Back to the main story, usually in each episode, it introduces one or a few zodiac character(s) and how they will carry forward the story. The synopsis may sound quite clichéd, since there are many other anime with a similar one. It started out a bit weak, but as it progresses, the amount of pleasure into watching the anime grows, with more understanding and development. However, having this fast-paced, some parts of the story can be seen as rushed. The comedy is one of the high points in the anime - there are so many hilarious moments such as how meta it goes. There are also a few emotional scenes, especially during the last two episodes, but I do not think the staff is serious in most of them, since they break into more comedy afterwards. The zodiac is something unique since I never heard of other anime that played zodiac as a part, hence it is good to have a bit of originality here. Overall, it is a nice story to follow up on with extra hilarious comedy.You have twelve zodiac characters, Nyaa-tan, Takeru and maybe two more side characters that are not important as the cast. About Nyaa-tan, the main focal character, she may be dumb and crazy most of the time, but sometimes she understands the situations she face and gets on working to solve them. Maybe a few people will find this daunting, thinking that once she goes back being her usual self, the mood of the story gets ruined. But I felt quite the opposite, since I never want the emotions of the anime to develop further to become forced drama. Her involvement with Takeru is very big, in that case he is like her support. However silly she tries to force him into giving support, he usually does it whenever it is needed. I do not know if there is a lesson learnt in this, but I find it nice. For the other characters, I can say that they definitely have different personalities which have similar anime tropes. As I mentioned earlier, one or a few of them gets their own spotlight in each episode, but I feel that the spotlight do not necessarily be bright. The range of their involvement depends, so while some do have something, others are treated more as side characters who probably make people laugh.

It could be seen as a rant however I back up the claims that I could be seen as ranting with events and why I didn\'t like it in the series.Story overview:Etotama\'s story is about a cat character Nyaa that wants to join the Chinese Zodiac such as the synopsis states.Sounds like a good idea right? That\'s what I thought but the comedy so far just ruins the episodes. The comedy is really the same thing with them breaking down the 3rd wall with saying ""between episode 1 and 2"" as well as...fan service every now and then. I don\'t mind them breaking down the 3rd wall if it done in a fresh comical way such as Blood Lad when he was bringing up examples of the events being something found in a shounen manga and reference to Dragon Ball Z. Etotama could have been more creative but seemed to go for low brow comedy. As I stated the ecchi between characters seemed to be way over the line to point it was coming close to the level found in Queen\'s Blade. I did find the comedy with the Chicken zodiac to be funny.Animation/Art:The downside of the animation is really the seal battles. The animation goes from ""meh, not really my style"" to downright ""what are they thinking?"" I think that the animation could have been better if the didn\'t drop normal animation to CGI for the fights. Of course the CGI could have worked if it was more like the CGI used in Accel World instead of really seeming to be a huge drop off.Sound:The sound was the only decent thing about the series. The voice acting really fits the characters and the battles had great sound effects in the background. The only issue I have with the sound is the music and sound effects seemed to be deeply buried in the background when theres speeching and I can honestly say I wish they kept things more balanced.Characters:The characters could have been better but it goes back to the story which is the comedy really put me off with the characters. This happened with the perverted character of School Rumble. I start to like them then all of a sudden they make a joke and it just puts me off of them. I\'m sure I\'m not the only one that has this happen to them if not in this series then should be in another series.Enjoyment:I did not enjoy this series but I had to keep watching it because new profile so I\'m trying not to have more dropped than completed series. I\'m not attacking anyone\'s tastes that loved the series I watched this series with an open mind, skipped reading reviews as the series was airing and after each episode I took time to reflect on what I just seen. I tried to find the good but more times than not I couldn\'t find one. I can say that this is going to be one series I\'m not going to buy or re-watch. Once is more than enough for me.Overall:Overall I loved the overview from outline. I loved that the series had an original story and not resorting to a magical girl or someone has magic powers and have to save the world. I can say that I can praise it for the original attempts but the other sections had things that I didn\'t like which is why I can\'t really give it a good score because I take all negatives into account and it wouldn\'t be an honest review if I gave it an 7 or 8 out of 10 when I honestly didn\'t like the series. fan service every now and then.

Anyway the story of each episode was pretty good anyway. As this is a light hearted comedy anime without much story to it. I am not going to write more on it.Sound: 8/10 The sound was pretty good and it kinda matched all the scenes in one way or another. The fighting scenes had a nice set of music too also the...transformation music was really good as you could hear nice tones.Characters: 7/10 Cause I didn\'t likes some characters. The characters didn\'t have anything special in them. It\'s like they do this and they become this = I Didn\'t like it. Takeru was an interesting character in the start till middle episodes but then he fell down the throne as he became uninteresting to me and Nyaa-tan took his place as she was really carefree (I like carefree people).Animation: 9/10 The animation done during the transforming and the beautiful Chibi 3D animation done deserves points as another chibi 3D anime I know sucked in 3D (Psst - It\'s Show By Rock). Normal 2D animation was pretty good and colorful itselfEnjoyment: 9/10 There was no limit for the enjoyment I had in this anime.

Spoilers ahead!)Have you ever, intentionally or not, compared yourself or another person to an animal? “He is as free spirited as a bird” or “she swims like a fish” are easy to understand because the animals themselves are, too. Indeed, you would be hard pressed to find someone who does not know some of the most prevalent creatures in the animal kingdom. It also makes more sense to relate to an animal than their equivalent, manmade devices. For instance, calling someone an airplane or a boat is not as becoming because those vehicles are autonomous; they do...not choose to act the way they do. Thus, “he is as ferocious as an alligator” or “she is as harmless as a butterfly” are quick and simple approaches to describe people and the way in which they behave. Etotama is all about spirit animals – the Chinese zodiacs, to be specific – showcasing a girl as selfish as a cat fighting to achieve her dream of joining the ranks of the heavens. Although the journey is short, it highlights that while we may be similar to birds, fish, alligators, butterflies and cats, we will always be, above anything else, ourselves.STORYEtotama is a classic case of “do not judge a book by its cover.” It looks silly – women dressed up as cows, chickens, and monkeys – and its premise is even sillier – Nyaa-tan the cat fights other animals to become a god. However, the anime takes full advantage of each of its elements it has at its disposal, earning it success where none might otherwise have been. It is not perfect, but when it is consistent and reasonable, the narrative stands strong and proud.The structure of the narrative itself demonstrates Etotama’s first signs of consistency. From the beginning, the anime lays out the adventure: Nyaa-tan must defeat 12 “Eto-shin” to make her dream come true. Therefore, the audience immediately knows (for the most part) that the rest of the season will consist of Nyaa-tan going paw-to-paw with each member, experiencing a spiritual journey that culminates into a resolution that befits the tone of the show. This type of narrative structure – “X must obtain all Y to succeed” – is simple but easy to understand. The groundwork is established, the goal is set, and the proceedings never feel “unfair” in the sense that the events fit comfortably within the rules and confines of the world. It also uses its breaks during episodes to maximum effect when it explains said rules. That is, extra information is provided without stealing attention away from the action, fun, and purpose of the anime. All of this leads to a narrative that is understandable and therefore capable of focusing on the aspects that it wants to because the pacing, progression, and plot derive from the structure itself.Two aspects in particular are given the most priority: the battles and the comedy. First, in order to avoid the potential predictability and repetitiveness that also comes with the aforementioned structure, Etotama spends a great deal of effort on making each “Eto-shin” encounter unique. One battle involves stealing socks, another revolves around go-cart racing, and another still is mired in a “shogi” (colloquially, Japanese chess) motif. The battles are a byproduct of the structure and are designed to be fresh with each new reiteration, but more than this is the reasoning stems from the characters themselves. Using the same examples, Moo-tan’s obsessiveness, Uma-tan’s franticness, and Piyo-tan’s arrogance allow the previous events to occur naturally, demonstrating the anime’s awareness of the variables in its formula and the consistency of its direction. Second, the multiple fields of comedy Etotama delves into keeps it from going where it does not want to. Meta humor about future sales of the anime, slapstick with Nyaa-tan to amuse the audience, and recurring jokes like Bu-tan’s perishing are a small sampling of the types of comedy employed. The entire summary episode is even tongue-in-cheek, where it was just a ruse to cook some food. But no matter the comedic genre, the anime almost always makes sure to follow its comedic tone, even during sentimental or dire situations. Nowhere is this more evident than in the finale; it completely mocks Nyaa-tan’s whole journey, ending the show on the same note it had always been playing. In other words the direction of the comedy, like the battles, remains consistent from start to finish.Unfortunately, Etotama does get lost now and again; as was said, the narrative is not perfect. One of the most glaring grievances is Nyaa-tan’s amnesia. It was mentioned, referenced, and discussed throughout the whole season, but the curing of it happened all at once rather than gradually, leaving the impression that the anime lacked the foresight to deal with one of its most major plot points. A missing narrative theme is also a fault. While Nyaa-tan’s battles help to develop her actual person, they do little to serve the plot. Indeed, the main antagonist is prominent only in the beginning and end, meaning the most important conflict is barely present. Consequently and simultaneously, the middle section awards small, simple, yet saturated messages that are endearing but do not mesh well with the anime’s tendency for comedy. Thus, consistency gives way, and the show must sit where it once stood.So while the cover for Etotama might appear off-putting, what lies within is a tale (and tails) that manages to be more worthwhile than at first perceived.ANIMATIONWithout a doubt, Etotama’s highest feat is in the art and animation it offers.More specifically, the CG work is some of the best – if not the best – in the medium. In fact, it would not be a stretch to consider Etotama the king of CG in anime, the shining figurehead that all subsequent shows should look up to. The worlds shown are not only vibrant but purposeful, since each world coincides with a specific character’s personality. Dora-tan’s world is an icy plain that matches her cool persona, Usa-tan’s all-over-the-place décor goes along with her quickness, and Shima-tan’s is a forestry jungle that follows her tiger qualities. But it is not just the art itself but theactual animation that is so surprising. The choreography of the fights uses: slow-motion segments, diverse abilities, explosions, easy-to-follow camera operations, and fluid attack patterns that, taken together, create a set of battles that are executed wonderfully. The cartoony depiction – where the characters go into “Pretty Mode” or “chibi” stature – aids the entire process because the unrealistic portrayals gives leeway as opposed to a realistic setting where exact movements would be required. Overall, the CG art and animation in Etotama deserves nothing less than the highest of accolades.As if the CG were not enough, the two-dimensional aspects are strong as well. The character designs are quite detailed, with each zodiac accurately representing their respective animal. The animation of common interactions, balls of light, and body movements is easy to spot. Lastly, while Takeru’s abode is the main location visited, the show is not afraid to go to other areas, like the local café, parts of the city, and different spots of the heavens.These aspects are not as strong as the CG (that is difficult to do in this context) but at the minimum they are “icing on the cake.”CHARACTERSIn a show like Etotama, where the prominent cast is quite large – more than twelve characters – it becomes inherently difficult to develop them in a meaningful manner because resources are spread so thin. The anime stumbles into this pitfall, with little growth seen from anyone besides Nyaa-tan. Arguably, Nyaa-tan’s development is poor at best; she goes back to being who she was after remembering everything rather than learning from the entire experience. However, the characterizations are, like the story, taken advantage of as much as possible, leading to its theme on people being nobody else but themselves.When the characterizations are looked at superficially, it is somewhat easy to discern that the characters and their personalities come from the zodiacs they represent. That is to say, the zodiac symbols symbolize the characters – their actions, their mannerisms, and so on. A quick example would be Chuu-tan the Rat. Rats are dirty and gross, with the connotations of being conniving and sinister, which is exactly what Chuu-tan is: the evil villain of the show. Another example is Usa-tan the Rabbit, who is quick on her feet and fast in the game of business. One more is Shima-tan the Tiger, tomboyish in attitude, rough when dealing with others, and incredibly powerful. While some are a bit more difficult to classify – Mei-tan the Sheep is a nurse because wool covers, protects, and warms others, “healing” both body and mind – each and every “Eto-shin” has some connection to her respective zodiac sign.But there is another connection, one that is not so superficial. Interestingly, each symbol also forms a dichotomy; each character has traits that are the opposite of their chosen zodiac. Using the same examples once more: Chuu-tan becomes the most pure of the bunch, Usa-tan’s weakness is her heel (a “rabbit’s foot” is considered a lucky charm), Shima-tan is teased about being the most womanly and sexiest due to her good looks, and Mei-tan gets “sick” after the “love bug” bites her. Again, this type of dichotomy can be seen with each character, not just the ones listed. These twists are minor, but because they are so ironic, they improve the base and symbolic characterizations further since they help to give a new and different angle to view them with.Nyaa-tan the Cat follows suit, having symbolism and dichotomy of her own. As a cat, she is shown to be quite selfish and carefree, doing whatever it is she feels like doing. Yet, unlike a cat, she is actually the most selfless, handling duties all over the world while being concerned for everyone around her. Since Nyaa-tan and the other cast members each follow these ideas, it begs the question: what about Takeru? As the (literal) odd man out, it is not immediately clear how he fits in among the other characters, let alone what he symbolizes and what sort of dichotomy he holds. But after watching the show, listening to his speech on imperfection, and accepting him being the “Human” zodiac, the beauty is that he does not fit because he is not supposed to. Symbols and dichotomies do not define Takeru because he, and by extension the other women, is more valuable than that. He might have traits like a dragon or a monkey or a horse, or he might have traits that would seem uncharacteristic. But at the end of the day, people are who they are and nothing more. Furthermore, since Takeru represents all of humanity in the context of the anime, this interpretation has more weight because it does not apply to just himself but all people. This might explain the missing character development; people do not necessarily have to turn or change into someone else because sometimes it is not needed, sometimes people are who they are, and that is okay.Development or no, this theme – people are not symbols or dichotomies, but simply themselves – is nicely captured through the characters, giving Etotama yet another leg to stand on.SOUNDEtotama’s weakest area is the music it incorporates. The opening theme has fun bits in the beginning and middle, and the end can be somewhat catchy, but the vocalist does little to instill emotion or prepare the viewer for what is to come. The ending theme, however, does well due to the sheer number of singers involved. With a new zodiac being included with each subsequent episode, its power only increases. Plus, like the dichotomies previously, the mellowness of the piece contrasts with the anime, helping to ease the audience out of each episode after the craziness contained within them.The rest of the soundtrack contains background pieces that more or less serve their purpose. Uppity tracks for the fun times and piano tracks for the sad ones, as well as other arrangements to fit the occasion. Nothing noteworthy, but nothing grating either. The voice acting can be seen the same way: average outings all around. The exception, of course, is Rie Murakawa as Nyaa-tan who gave a fantastic performance as the rambunctious, lovable, and “boo-boo” spouting cat god.ENJOYMENTIn order to like this anime, one has to like Nyaa-tan. Luckily, I really liked her. She was the star of the show, always putting a smile on my face with her fun, cute, and endearing antics. Something I still quote to this day is one of her lines from early on in the series, where she says “got it” in a sly voice after pretending to defend Takeru from everyone else calling him a “Sol/Lull battery,” which was just a ploy to get said “Sol/Lull” from him. Nyaa-tan was incredibly vibrant and hilarious, and I will always remember the laughs she got out of me.I am giving Nyaa-tan a lot of praise, but laughs were also had with many of the other characters as well. Uma-tan’s apologizing because she felt it was her fault the other zodiacs were always forgotten, Piyo-tan’s memory loss after three steps yet still having negative emotions towards Nyaa-tan, and Uri-tan’s vocal tic (“desu, desu”) were all funny, with each character having their moment in the spotlight. However, the only gripe I have is that there were too few interactions between everyone. Due to the “zodiac-of-the-week” format, Nyaa-tan would have comical, one-on-one skits, but this left little time for the other zodiacs to have relationships between each other. Still, what the anime gave never disappointed.That is Etotama, a show that does not disappoint. It has some flaws in its story and music, but the rich CG, the thematic cast, and the nice amount of entertainment it dishes out mostly make up for the tiny missteps it has along the way. While the anime might not be as strong as an ox, it accomplishes what it wanted to be all along: itself.SUMMARYStory: Fine, consistency in its narrative structure, battles, and comedy are a boon, but mishandling of key plot points and overall theme are evident flawsAnimation: Great, a shining example of CG art and animation for animeCharacters: Good, symbolism, dichotomies, and a theme on people being nobody but themselvesSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, average soundtrack, average VA work with the exception of Rie Murakawa providing a fantastic performance as Nyaa-tanEnjoyment: Good, Nyaa-tan was hilarious the whole way through, the rest of the cast was funny as well, but not enough non-Nyaa-tan character interactionsFinal Score: 7/10 not choose to act the way they do.

One battle involves stealing socks, another revolves around go-cart racing, and another still is mired in a “shogi” (colloquially, Japanese chess) motif. The battles are a byproduct of the structure and are designed to be fresh with each new reiteration, but more than this is the reasoning stems from the characters themselves. Using the same examples, Moo-tan’s obsessiveness, Uma-tan’s franticness, and Piyo-tan’s arrogance allow the previous events to occur naturally, demonstrating the anime’s awareness of the variables in its formula and the consistency of its direction. Second, the multiple fields of comedy Etotama delves into keeps it from going where it does not want to. Meta humor about future sales of the anime, slapstick with Nyaa-tan to amuse the audience, and recurring jokes like Bu-tan’s perishing are a small sampling of the types of comedy employed. The entire summary episode is even tongue-in-cheek, where it was just a ruse to cook some food. But no matter the comedic genre, the anime almost always makes sure to follow its comedic tone, even during sentimental or dire situations. Nowhere is this more evident than in the finale; it completely mocks Nyaa-tan’s whole journey, ending the show on the same note it had always been playing. In other words the direction of the comedy, like the battles, remains consistent from start to finish.Unfortunately, Etotama does get lost now and again; as was said, the narrative is not perfect. One of the most glaring grievances is Nyaa-tan’s amnesia. It was mentioned, referenced, and discussed throughout the whole season, but the curing of it happened all at once rather than gradually, leaving the impression that the anime lacked the foresight to deal with one of its most major plot points. A missing narrative theme is also a fault. While Nyaa-tan’s battles help to develop her actual person, they do little to serve the plot. Indeed, the main antagonist is prominent only in the beginning and end, meaning the most important conflict is barely present. Consequently and simultaneously, the middle section awards small, simple, yet saturated messages that are endearing but do not mesh well with the anime’s tendency for comedy. Thus, consistency gives way, and the show must sit where it once stood.So while the cover for Etotama might appear off-putting, what lies within is a tale (and tails) that manages to be more worthwhile than at first perceived.ANIMATIONWithout a doubt, Etotama’s highest feat is in the art and animation it offers.More specifically, the CG work is some of the best – if not the best – in the medium. In fact, it would not be a stretch to consider Etotama the king of CG in anime, the shining figurehead that all subsequent shows should look up to. The worlds shown are not only vibrant but purposeful, since each world coincides with a specific character’s personality. Dora-tan’s world is an icy plain that matches her cool persona, Usa-tan’s all-over-the-place décor goes along with her quickness, and Shima-tan’s is a forestry jungle that follows her tiger qualities. But it is not just the art itself but theactual animation that is so surprising. The choreography of the fights uses: slow-motion segments, diverse abilities, explosions, easy-to-follow camera operations, and fluid attack patterns that, taken together, create a set of battles that are executed wonderfully. The cartoony depiction – where the characters go into “Pretty Mode” or “chibi” stature – aids the entire process because the unrealistic portrayals gives leeway as opposed to a realistic setting where exact movements would be required. Overall, the CG art and animation in Etotama deserves nothing less than the highest of accolades.As if the CG were not enough, the two-dimensional aspects are strong as well. The character designs are quite detailed, with each zodiac accurately representing their respective animal. The animation of common interactions, balls of light, and body movements is easy to spot. Lastly, while Takeru’s abode is the main location visited, the show is not afraid to go to other areas, like the local café, parts of the city, and different spots of the heavens.These aspects are not as strong as the CG (that is difficult to do in this context) but at the minimum they are “icing on the cake.”CHARACTERSIn a show like Etotama, where the prominent cast is quite large – more than twelve characters – it becomes inherently difficult to develop them in a meaningful manner because resources are spread so thin. The anime stumbles into this pitfall, with little growth seen from anyone besides Nyaa-tan. Arguably, Nyaa-tan’s development is poor at best; she goes back to being who she was after remembering everything rather than learning from the entire experience. However, the characterizations are, like the story, taken advantage of as much as possible, leading to its theme on people being nobody else but themselves.When the characterizations are looked at superficially, it is somewhat easy to discern that the characters and their personalities come from the zodiacs they represent. That is to say, the zodiac symbols symbolize the characters – their actions, their mannerisms, and so on. A quick example would be Chuu-tan the Rat. Rats are dirty and gross, with the connotations of being conniving and sinister, which is exactly what Chuu-tan is: the evil villain of the show. Another example is Usa-tan the Rabbit, who is quick on her feet and fast in the game of business. One more is Shima-tan the Tiger, tomboyish in attitude, rough when dealing with others, and incredibly powerful. While some are a bit more difficult to classify – Mei-tan the Sheep is a nurse because wool covers, protects, and warms others, “healing” both body and mind – each and every “Eto-shin” has some connection to her respective zodiac sign.But there is another connection, one that is not so superficial. Interestingly, each symbol also forms a dichotomy; each character has traits that are the opposite of their chosen zodiac. Using the same examples once more: Chuu-tan becomes the most pure of the bunch, Usa-tan’s weakness is her heel (a “rabbit’s foot” is considered a lucky charm), Shima-tan is teased about being the most womanly and sexiest due to her good looks, and Mei-tan gets “sick” after the “love bug” bites her. Again, this type of dichotomy can be seen with each character, not just the ones listed. These twists are minor, but because they are so ironic, they improve the base and symbolic characterizations further since they help to give a new and different angle to view them with.Nyaa-tan the Cat follows suit, having symbolism and dichotomy of her own. As a cat, she is shown to be quite selfish and carefree, doing whatever it is she feels like doing. Yet, unlike a cat, she is actually the most selfless, handling duties all over the world while being concerned for everyone around her. Since Nyaa-tan and the other cast members each follow these ideas, it begs the question: what about Takeru? As the (literal) odd man out, it is not immediately clear how he fits in among the other characters, let alone what he symbolizes and what sort of dichotomy he holds. But after watching the show, listening to his speech on imperfection, and accepting him being the “Human” zodiac, the beauty is that he does not fit because he is not supposed to. Symbols and dichotomies do not define Takeru because he, and by extension the other women, is more valuable than that. He might have traits like a dragon or a monkey or a horse, or he might have traits that would seem uncharacteristic. But at the end of the day, people are who they are and nothing more. Furthermore, since Takeru represents all of humanity in the context of the anime, this interpretation has more weight because it does not apply to just himself but all people. This might explain the missing character development; people do not necessarily have to turn or change into someone else because sometimes it is not needed, sometimes people are who they are, and that is okay.Development or no, this theme – people are not symbols or dichotomies, but simply themselves – is nicely captured through the characters, giving Etotama yet another leg to stand on.SOUNDEtotama’s weakest area is the music it incorporates. The opening theme has fun bits in the beginning and middle, and the end can be somewhat catchy, but the vocalist does little to instill emotion or prepare the viewer for what is to come. The ending theme, however, does well due to the sheer number of singers involved. With a new zodiac being included with each subsequent episode, its power only increases. Plus, like the dichotomies previously, the mellowness of the piece contrasts with the anime, helping to ease the audience out of each episode after the craziness contained within them.The rest of the soundtrack contains background pieces that more or less serve their purpose. Uppity tracks for the fun times and piano tracks for the sad ones, as well as other arrangements to fit the occasion. Nothing noteworthy, but nothing grating either. The voice acting can be seen the same way: average outings all around. The exception, of course, is Rie Murakawa as Nyaa-tan who gave a fantastic performance as the rambunctious, lovable, and “boo-boo” spouting cat god.ENJOYMENTIn order to like this anime, one has to like Nyaa-tan. Luckily, I really liked her. She was the star of the show, always putting a smile on my face with her fun, cute, and endearing antics. Something I still quote to this day is one of her lines from early on in the series, where she says “got it” in a sly voice after pretending to defend Takeru from everyone else calling him a “Sol/Lull battery,” which was just a ploy to get said “Sol/Lull” from him. Nyaa-tan was incredibly vibrant and hilarious, and I will always remember the laughs she got out of me.I am giving Nyaa-tan a lot of praise, but laughs were also had with many of the other characters as well. Uma-tan’s apologizing because she felt it was her fault the other zodiacs were always forgotten, Piyo-tan’s memory loss after three steps yet still having negative emotions towards Nyaa-tan, and Uri-tan’s vocal tic (“desu, desu”) were all funny, with each character having their moment in the spotlight. However, the only gripe I have is that there were too few interactions between everyone. Due to the “zodiac-of-the-week” format, Nyaa-tan would have comical, one-on-one skits, but this left little time for the other zodiacs to have relationships between each other. Still, what the anime gave never disappointed.That is Etotama, a show that does not disappoint. It has some flaws in its story and music, but the rich CG, the thematic cast, and the nice amount of entertainment it dishes out mostly make up for the tiny missteps it has along the way. While the anime might not be as strong as an ox, it accomplishes what it wanted to be all along: itself.SUMMARYStory: Fine, consistency in its narrative structure, battles, and comedy are a boon, but mishandling of key plot points and overall theme are evident flawsAnimation: Great, a shining example of CG art and animation for animeCharacters: Good, symbolism, dichotomies, and a theme on people being nobody but themselvesSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, average soundtrack, average VA work with the exception of Rie Murakawa providing a fantastic performance as Nyaa-tanEnjoyment: Good, Nyaa-tan was hilarious the whole way through, the rest of the cast was funny as well, but not enough non-Nyaa-tan character interactionsFinal Score: 7/10', ""What's your zodiac sign? This is basically what this show tackles. Etotama portrayed Chinese zodiacs as anthropomorphised beings and did it without losing the essence of their origin. If that weren't enough, it even included historical background to make it seem like it actually did happen.The story was pretty funny the first few episodes, the everything gets serious on the following ones. Despite that, the show still retained its humor of breaking the fourth wall and, yes, slapstick humor. And very few shows can provide dramatic scenes while remaining a comedy.Characters pretty much the personality of their corresponding signs. If you read the traits of...each sign and observed the characters, you'll see it's not that different. Of course, Nya-tan is an exception, but she still personified a cat nonetheless.One thing I really liked was the mix of 2d and 3d graphics. Truth be told, I would've been fine with it just being 2d, but 3d made it all the more interesting. The mix of both dimensions provided me a chance to watch the show at a different perspective. It's not everyday you get to see one show in 2d and 3d.The tracks had a cute vibe which fit the show. That's all I can say about it.Overall, this show was quite different from all the other. Actually, when I first picked it up, I thought it was gonna be another harem. Boy, I was wrong!

And perhaps you'll know why we need zodiacs in our lives..."", 'I\'ll kick this review off by saying my final verdict of this show, if you happen to be intrigued as to why I wrote what I did, you can read further below to see my first, short analysis of an anime.Etotama can be judged and brushed off as a regular harem series with very few intellectually advanced points, and to be honest, that is not very far from the truth. However, it is not often that we see a harem with such drive for its story (instead of dismissing it for fan service), as well as original elements like the 3D battles given in...this anime.Story (7/10):The story was good, nothing ground-breaking or even great, but just satisfying. Each episode was certainly somewhat entertaining, even for a battle-of-the-day type of anime. Those types can get boring, but Etotama does it by sprinkling some comedy and downtime here and there. The battles themselves were great. Even though the outcome for each one is obvious, the variety of \'em is refreshing, going from standard brawls to shogi to races.For the cons, the comedy is not for everyone: most people won\'t laugh out loud, a chuckle from time to time perhaps.  It\'s not horrible, but it\'s not nearly good as it should be for a show qualified as a comedy above all else. Another thing, this one robbing the story some points, is the transition between comedy and the more serious moments. The show is ridiculous, it\'s meant to be that way... but it is hard to take the moments of conflict and hardships seriously with the atmosphere Etotama builds.Art (8/10):The strong point of Etotama. The regular art used in 80% of the episodes is fine, good I might add, not ""knock-your-socks-out-10-feet"" fantastic however. What does make the art an 8/10 is its use of CG battles. The animation during these is great, but more importantly, is something we rarely do see be this well done.Sound (6/10):Generic comedy show soundtrack. It sets the mood just fine, but no memorable tracks who could boost the score higher than the average.Characters (5/10):This can go one way or the other for anyone, and can turn your opinion of Etotama from: ""Eh, alright"" to ""I want a season 2 soon"". Here\'s why:Main Characters: You have your female protagonist, whose personality is hit or miss. You will either love her or dismiss her as the standard hyper loli who-loves-her-friends stock character. The male protagonist is not much different, he doesn\'t offer anything new to the anime table, and in all honestly is just a standard wasahii-onii-chan-archetype character.Supporting Cast: It\'s a harem, what do you expect? You\'ll have most personalities types you see in anime covered: twins, submissive, athletic, idiot, loli, glasses, pervert,  crybaby, and many more.The problem here is whether or not you will judged the characters as ""already seen this before"" or just take them for what they are and enjoy the show. As mentioned before, this will most likely be what sells it for you or makes it a ""no no"".Personal Enjoyment (6/10):I didn\'t enjoy Etotama, I didn\'t dislike it either. The original battles scenes intrigued me, and I think I may have had fun here and there, but that isn\'t enough for me to qualify it as good. I am, however, highly biased, as I entered the show with a mindset of ""this is a wish-fulfillment anime for people who want to wake up one day and find a group of cute girls in their room"".Overall (6/10) and Verdict:If you like the cast after the first couple of episodes, hey, you\'ll probably enjoy this one. To the others, you may want to turn tails, or just watch the ""eh"", with a dozen ""ahhhh"", for 12 episodes. In both cases -and this is my opinion- there are ALOT of better things out there to watch, and unless you\'re just trying to relax and unwind after whatever you might be doing, you should probably search for something with more enjoyability (is that even a word?). this anime.Story (7/10):The story was good, nothing ground-breaking or even great, but just satisfying.

The fight scenes voice actors and characters speaking were all in sync and sounded great but based on OST and that its nothing special.Characters- The Chinese zodiac includes 12 people represented by an animal so their are a decent amount of characters including the male leading character and another character which adds up to about 14 you will see 13 majority of the time. The characters had all different personalities some cute and enjoyable and some you couldn\'t really hate or like because they weren\'t broadcasted as much to form an opinion i enjoyed some characters but overall it was just average no real character development just static characters throughout the anime.Enjoyment- a light 7... 7/10 truly a 6.8/10 in my personal opinion.Overall- 7/10 if you are just looking for new anime to just watch and add to your list then watch it but dont expect much but everyone has a different opinion so you may hate it or you may love it but i thought it was OK at best. funny alot with the ""breaking the fourth wall"" scenes and so on but the ecchi seeming fanservice was kind of a turnoff for me throughout the span of the anime the path to trying to obtain a position within the zodiacs was also enjoyable through great looking fight scenes which uses the cgi effect which some people hate but if it looks good i have no complaints and if the fights are decent i have no complaints.Art- 2 words really vibrant,the color palette the anime has is great its just really in your face colorful even during some dark scenes it still looks great.It uses cgi animation which looks good during the fight scenes esp in the last episode.Sound- Honestly it wasn\'t terrible but there was absolutely nothing in my opinion that stood out to me the intro is probably the only that stood out and was somewhat decent but everything else was just straight up generic i don\'t really have a gripe or love for anything in terms of music.

This does not distract from the story and i did enjoy the ending, its a cute, funny anime with its sweet moments that i am sure many will enjoy!', ""This was an interesting anime to watch, it's nothing spectacular, nothing ground breaking, and certainly not the best sounding either, but it does have one quality that shines through the rest. The style and idea, while the story was more interesting by the second half, the style and overall idea was extremely enjoyable. With Chibi Zodiac girls duking it out in a relatively (almost identical) Mega-dimension Neptunia style (mostly during the 3d sections) the show takes on a more of an actiony and interesting story following a weird cat girl and her wish to become part of the zodiac, which, somewhat follows the tale of...the actual zodiac.I won't go into too much detail because if I explained it to in deeply, it'd be ruining the show greatly, but all I can say in general is if you've got nothing else to watch and a couple hours to grind out, then this show is GREAT binge material, especially if you like cute things duke it out in the battle field. the actual zodiac.I won't go into too much detail because if I explained it to in deeply, it'd be ruining the show greatly, but all I can say in general is if you've got nothing else to watch and a couple hours to grind out, then this show is GREAT binge material, especially if you like cute things duke it out in the battle field."", 'Another anime without a plan. Basically its selling point are cute characters.Writter run out of weak jokes, even while whole anime is basically cute girls run around saying random words acting stupid. Anyway anime turns to be a drama as usual for animes without any real story.So drawing is okey, characters are boring stereotupes. Its is kind of like a harem anime, just not all the girls love protogonist, some seems to be there just as fanservice. Then there are those 3d scenes that look interesting but getting boring soon. I dont recomend watching this unles you like Lucky Star show. ', 'Etotama has many unique qualities. The chibi-style 3D fights are genuinely impressive, and the CG and traditionally animated scenes are both fantastic. Paired with a really good OP/ED, and some decently funny meta comedic bits, creates a decent package that won\'t blow anyone away. However, my mixed feelings come from its laser focus on one or two characters, while neglecting its wonderful cast.The main characters are decently explored, with enough exposition to drive some motivation to watch from episode to episode. As the theme suggests, this is very much a gag/comedy focused anime. It is incredibly light hearted with no real stakes. There is some...semblance of romance, but it is very light.Mostly, the show revolves around the antics of its mixed bag female protagonist Nya-tan, and her relationship with the MC Takeru. The show seldom explores a deeper connection between them, and keeps all their developments surface level, which can be a major turn off if you\'re looking for romance. This show is not advertised as one, so don\'t get your hopes up, despite all the hints.Secondly, the laser focus on Nya-tan is honestly one of the bigger turn-offs. While hyper eccentric and sarcastic characters can be enjoyable to watch, it can get irritating when the show refuses to indulge in its unique colorful cast, sacrificing all that screen time for a repetitive protagonist.This is at its core a show about Nya-tan\'s growth, however her growth is largely uninteresting and bogs down to a slog whenever the repeated formula of ""Nya-tan\'s going to lose! Oho! Here comes some motivation and flashbacks, she wins!"" is used.I cared less about her and more about Takeru\'s involvement with the other members of the cast. So many characters are left forgotten in the dust or just pulled over for a cheap gag, when you could theoretically direct all 12 episodes to focus on each singular eto-shin. I also found myself not rooting for Takeru and Nya-tan because of its stubborn fixation on maintaining her gag character traits and not sufficiently evolving her into something more.Overall, I wish it was 24 episodes instead of 12, and focused largely on its side cast just as much as its main cast. Its protagonist Nya-tan gets boring and repetitive fast, and her dynamic with the MC Takeru is left superficial, without any bold writing. If you want a gag/comedy focused anime to maybe have a laugh at, go for it. But if you\'re looking for a really good package of character development and inclusion of its many characters into the overarching storyline, you\'ll be left disappointed. semblance of romance, but it is very light.Mostly, the show revolves around the antics of its mixed bag female protagonist Nya-tan, and her relationship with the MC Takeru.

Girls & Panzer: Saishuushou Part 1 - Fushou Akiyama Yukari no Sensha Kouza,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39429/Girls___Panzer__Saishuushou_Part_1_-_Fushou_Akiyama_Yukari_no_Sensha_Kouza,[]
Freezing,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9367/Freezing,"['*Fan-service aside, this anime did a great job at adapting the manga material.*It breaks my heart to see such horrible overall ratings and reviews on this anime that, for all intents and purposes, was fairly accurate and stayed faithful to the manga if one were to ignore the anime original contents (eg. mostly fan service and one useless episode).  While it is fair to say there are multiple flaws in the anime series that could have been improved on (or unnecessary contents that could have been done without), the anime as a whole has served itself quite nicely considering it is only a one-cour...series.  Covering nearly 60% of the available manga materials at the time the anime finished airing, there really isn’t any way for the production staffs to wrap up the story without ruining any chances for a second season.  For the record, the manga material is only two measly arcs ahead of where the anime finished at the time this review was written and the actual plot did not proceed very far.I fully understand the complexity the anime brings to the new viewers who have no background knowledge from the manga.  Numerous terminologies coupled with even more numerous unfamiliar faces does prove to be quite difficult for one to digest at first.  Additionally the anime added tons and tons of boobs and nipples sprinkled everywhere in the show from the dormitory room change scenes to intense battles scenes. In short, there are bound to be boobies for the unprepared!  Thus this served as another excuse for viewers (even loyal manga readers) to detest and despise the show.  Even I have to admit it would have been better if the staffs can use those boobies air time to produce something more constructive like elaborating on certain flashback stories or further develop some characters and their personality or background.  So let this be a fair warning to all you potential viewers, only watch this show IF you can stomach the fan services and accept the fact that the story is a work in progress!!  With that said, let us finally turn our attention to introducing this anime for those of us who are still interested.Set in the near future, roughly 50 years from now, the world we know today has already been invaded by an alien race known as Nova.  Normal military is powerless in the face of this new threat and thus the world can only rely on girls with special tissues implanted into their backs (called Stigmata) to fight these unknown aliens.  These girls, known to the outside world as Pandora, fight in pairs with a younger boy, in order to neutralize a special effect cast by the aliens (called Freezing which freezes anything within the cast radius).  Now don’t quickly jump to conclusion just yet.  While this may sound like a military action genre to you, the story in actuality takes place in an academy where Pandora are being trained.  Following the school life of a second year sophomore, Satellizer el Bridget, the story introduces the problems and threats of the reality very (and I mean very) slowly to the point where one may end up asking more questions than there are answers to.  Thus to be fair, I would categorize the anime as ecchi, school life, romance with a fair bit of action, but nothing dramatic nor is it deep in plot (though the manga is getting there).  Without a doubt, the story department is the weakest one of all as all the emphasis so far is placed on the characters interaction.Characters.  Many many lovable girls with great looks and even better body proportions, albeit with a nasty attitude.  Yes! This is certainly not for the average female viewers!  In fact, the anime was never meant for the female audiences as evident from the trailers and even more evident as the series progress with all the boobie attacks on the screen.  With that said, the one major downside in the character department for this show is the fact that there are too many girls with not enough time to introduce them properly.  It will come as no surprise that you will likely be introduced to a new character in each episode and that the old ones will be brushed aside until close to the finale.  On the bright side, our main hero and heroine does have their own lengthy flashbacks and character development for us to “know them better”.As a manga reader, seeing this series get animated with voice was wonderful.  Unfortunately it was not quite to my level of expectation in a few ways.  Firstly and perhaps the most obvious is the fact that the broadcast of the uncensored version is at a horrendous 4:3 aspect ratio (and please don’t bother with the censored version, you won’t understand a single thing).  Though it remains a mystery as to why the opening and ending animation are in 16:9.  The second disappointment, coming from a manga reader perspective, is the altered character looks which may or may not discourage some readers, but it was a disappointment nonetheless.  Lastly, and this I am sure is a common sentiment among all viewers, is the miscast voice acting role for Aoi Kazuya.  This voice will surely cause some damage to your eardrums. However, other than that one miscast role, it is fair to say this anime has a lot of strong seiyu in the cast.  Additionally, both the opening and ending them songs are extremely catchy and are few received by fans in general.Overall I have mixed feelings for this anime.  It was a pleasant surprise when the news that Freezing manga was to be animated.  While the fan service ruined some enjoyment of the show for me, I must confess that in the short one-cour time frame I am quite impressed by the production studio with the amount of manga content they were able to include in the series.  Most notably the inclusion of certain subplots that really makes certain characters much more realistic and likable.  Staying faithful to the original material and introducing some anime-original contents as enhancements to the overall story made me very pleased particularly with the fact that the production studio did not opt for an anime original ending.  With that said, I still cannot recommend this series to those who does not enjoy watching ecchi series as this show clearly relies on boobies as its major selling point.  However, if the premise of the story does intrigue you then I highly recommend giving the manga a try.  Afterall Dall-Young Lim’s manga are quite well received in Korea, Japan, and even Taiwan. series.

Afterall Dall-Young Lim’s manga are quite well received in Korea, Japan, and even Taiwan.', 'I freely admit that I have a guilty pleasure when it comes to silly ecchi action anime just like Freezing.  So initially at least I was quite intrigued with this series and for the first few episodes I was amused.  However that amusement soon waned as it was buried under it\'s dozens of characters, inane nonsensical plot, and confusing terminology and technobabble.The premise for Freezing seems like it might have had an enormous amount of potential.  Mysterious entities called Nova are invading earth intent on wiping out mankind.  All that stands in their way are special soldiers known as Pandora and...their Limiter partners.  Our setting is a school/laboratory called West Genetics which trains future Pandora and their Limiters.  This is where that potential I was speaking of starts to get lost.  The Pandora are all, unsurprisingly all big breasted girls (hey this is anime after all!) and the Limiters are all guys.  Given that the Limiters are timid, weak, and mostly useless this is unsurprising and the only thing they really do is hide behind the skirts of the Pandora and yell ""Freezing!"" and other clichéd nonsense.  The girls on the other hand are violent and uncouth and spend most of their free time trying to kill one another or bully their underclassmen.Now since I have not read any of the original manga I can’t speak to how well this anime adapts its story.  Even if the manga has an amazing story (which I doubt honestly) it is completely lost in its transition to an anime.  Really nothing is adequately explained from what the Pandora are to what the enemy is or why or how they are even ended fighting.  Eventually by the end you do get some explanation and can make some conclusions from the action and context but this is a piss poor way to present a story to your viewers.  Additionally for pretty much two thirds of the series nothing of significance to the plot happens.  We get introduced to the lead, Satellizer el Bridget, learn a few snippets from her past, watch her take ALOT of showers, and get groped and bullied by the cunts and bitches she has as classmates and seniors.  And for about the first eight episodes that’s just about all that goes on.  What story there is remains unresolved with the ending.  Though it leaves the viewer with the impression that at least one additional season should be expected.  This kind of series always seems to get a sequel if it wants one so it’s really hard to hold the ending against it.For a series that is at its core about fighting, the overall action is a bit disappointing.  Don’t get me wrong, there is a lot of fighting but the majority of it is crammed into the last few episodes.  Most of the early fighting is uninteresting and more about tearing apart the girls’ flimsy school uniforms to expose their breasts.  If you enjoy exposed nipples and breasts then the world of Freezing should be like heaven to you. Like most fighting anime, the characters yell out lots of nonsense.  With Freezing most of it is mindless technobabble and engrish and little to none of it is ever explained.  While you can get the meaning from some of it through context it sure would be nice for the story to explain this to you once in a while.Like the story the characters are also a major weakness.  Neither one of our leads, Satellizer or the boy Kazuya are very interesting.  Kazuya is your typically weak and unremarkable anime boy with powers (unsurprisingly) far beyond your typical Limiter.  He has a special attraction to Satellizer that is both mysterious and due to the fact she reminds him of his dead sister.  I know shocking that someone should have a sister complex in anime right? (Pardon my eye rolling)  Satellizer, known in the school as the ""Untouchable Queen"" is a girl of dual personalities.  Her external persona is that of a cold and ruthless killer while her true personality is that of a meek and mild mannered girl with a fear of men.  Other than learning every inch of naked body through her regular trips to the shower or having her uniform torn off in all her battles we don’t learn all that much about her.  What is learned fits into the narrow stereotype her character has its basis in.The supporting cast is no different.  I seem to beat this point to death in an awful lot of the shows I review but the main issue with Freezing\'s cast is the sheer number of characters in the cast.  It is literally impossible to keep track of all the characters.  They bring in 2 or 3 a week, many of which looks almost identical to each other.  Their main purpose seems to be only to bully Satellizer who for some reason seems to really butt hurt them.  Even so, you’re likely to have at least a couple that amuse or even interest you just a little bit.  For me it was Rana Linchen who is a quasi-main but whose personality I enjoyed as well as having a pretty sexy character design.Artistically, Freezing is also weak.  For one the character models are absolutely ridiculous in most cases.  While I do like the ""full figured"" look, the extreme and impossible bust and waistlines really detract from the series.  Given how much tits and nipples are visible they really should have done a better job with this.  Everyone\'s figures are pretty much interchangeable and the actual animation of all the ""jiggle"" is really not that realistic or even appealing.  The color palette is very drab and depressing, with maroons, dark blues, grays, and blacks dominating the series.  The world is also incredibly dark and depressing.  While I am certain this is by design that doesn\'t explain why there is basically no sunlight at all and while they seem to be stuck in a world of eternal midnight.Freezing\'s voice cast is quite impressive as it seems to include almost every current seiyuu of note.  However this is a double edged sword as the reason it has so many is because the cast is so enormous.  Because of this none of the actors really gets a chance to shine.  Additionally Satellizer is horrible miscast with Mamiko Noto.  While I really enjoy her work and also seeing her portray a bit of a different character than she normally does (though also exactly the same) I just don\'t think her voice works for her character.  The music is solid but unspectacular action anime fair.  The OP is particularly exciting but also really drives home how ridiculous, Satellizer\'s in particular, chest measurements are.Even though I never really had any high expectations for it, ultimately Freezing is a failure.   I was hoping it would entertain me somewhere between other anime it has a lot in common with such as Seikirei and Ikkitousen.  But its lack of a coherent story, bland characters, and unappealing visuals make me unable to recommend this to anyone. their Limiter partners.

But its lack of a coherent story, bland characters, and unappealing visuals make me unable to recommend this to anyone.', 'Have any of you played the Battle Raper series? Basically, it\'s just another ero-fighting game where most of the time two female characters fight each other and the main goal of some players is to destroy as much clothes as possible before actually defeating your opponent.So what does this have to do with Freezing? If you\'re still asking this question after watching at least an episode then clearly you\'re either still a cherry or you watch Mormon porn.If you understand where I\'m going with this then congrats! Your right hand is your best friend (or left for some of you) and the only reason...you stumbled upon this is because you finished jerking off to Sekirei and wanted more hot overpowered girls with wimpy guys. Lucky for you, Freezing has all that aspects!So the story is pretty simple. In the future, big inter-dimensional creatures invade Earth, hot girls used by the military to fight the battles for them (Yes, military men are all perverts ;) God bless you Uncle Sam!) and wimpy guys giving them orders. Right.. At least guys are still giving them orders.. That\'s all what we\'ve got in the future.So a young boy wit a japanese name (where as everyone has cool high class western names) Kazuya Aoi just transfered into one of the many Academy use to militarily train poor clueless students by robbing them of their adolescence. Now Kazuya is one lucky bastard. Because he got to see his elder sis naked before she died?? No you sickos!! It\'s because he is able to touch the prestigious ""Untouchable Queen"" of the academy without the risk of getting his balls chopped off.The artwork... Graphics are above average especially during combat scene and throw in a couple of panty shots and hundereds of ""Mune"" shots no one would be complaining. ""Im sick and tired with all these fanservice!!"" I know, I know... But this would probably never had cross your mind. Why? Because chances are you stumbled upon this review because you saw ""Battle Raper"" and instantly reminisce on your ""Semen scented days""Combat music is top notch as well, sending ""chills"" through my spines. Get it? Chills? Because this anime is called ""Freezing"" Get it?? What? I\'m lame for making a lame joke??...Screw you guys.....So introduction of characters! I love this part when Im reviewing.Kazuya Aoi! Weak, but protective, lovable to all. A fine candidate for a harem male lead. Has a strong relationship BUT NOT TO THE POINT OF INCEST with his sister who died while fighitng one of those huge inter-dimensional beings.He blushes easily to any girl...seriously... ANY GIRL!Satellizer el Bridget! Strong in the outside, mushy in the instead. Apparently has a traumatic past and thus wont let any guys touch her except to Kazuya Aoi.Why is this so? Well, according to the"" Theory of Evolution"", some males had develop into a new species named by the science community, ""Justinian Bieberious"" Im no expert on this matter, but Im guessing Kazuya Aoi is under this new species.NAHH... Im just kidding... The fact is Kazuya Aoi possess something that normally the female characters in the anime would only possess (wont spoil anything here)So other than those two, the rest of the cast are psychotic female warriors, a hot teacher, a hot nurse, another gay looking roommate, and powerless student council members.Overall, fanservice anime with hot girls fighting each other and/or giant inter-dimensional beings. If you\'re complaining why Japan is always making such repetitive animes its because you\'re probably not the targeted demography. Remember kiddies, animes are made 1) For Japan... after that 2) Rest of the world...This is one type of anime that will make you perverts go yay! when her clothes gets shred off and boo! when their clothes regenerate. So enjoy it while you can.Now, if you\'ll excuse me, I\'ve got some clothes to shred as well.. Damn.. Why do I always end up defeating the girl in battle raper before shredding her clothes?? Wait? Wouldn\'t it be easier to defeat her first then shred her clothes?? I mean, have you ever tried shredding clothes of an unconscious girl. Waaaay too easy.. Umm.. Not that I\'ve ever tried... REALLY! you stumbled upon this is because you finished jerking off to Sekirei and wanted more hot overpowered girls with wimpy guys. Lucky for you, Freezing has all that aspects!So the story is pretty simple. In the future, big inter-dimensional creatures invade Earth, hot girls used by the military to fight the battles for them (Yes, military men are all perverts ;) God bless you Uncle Sam!) and wimpy guys giving them orders. Right.. At least guys are still giving them orders.. That\'s all what we\'ve got in the future.So a young boy wit a japanese name (where as everyone has cool high class western names) Kazuya Aoi just transfered into one of the many Academy use to militarily train poor clueless students by robbing them of their adolescence. Now Kazuya is one lucky bastard. Because he got to see his elder sis naked before she died?? No you sickos!! It\'s because he is able to touch the prestigious ""Untouchable Queen"" of the academy without the risk of getting his balls chopped off.The artwork... Graphics are above average especially during combat scene and throw in a couple of panty shots and hundereds of ""Mune"" shots no one would be complaining. ""Im sick and tired with all these fanservice!!"" I know, I know... But this would probably never had cross your mind. Why? Because chances are you stumbled upon this review because you saw ""Battle Raper"" and instantly reminisce on your ""Semen scented days""Combat music is top notch as well, sending ""chills"" through my spines. Get it? Chills? Because this anime is called ""Freezing"" Get it?? What? I\'m lame for making a lame joke??...Screw you guys.....So introduction of characters! I love this part when Im reviewing.Kazuya Aoi! Weak, but protective, lovable to all. A fine candidate for a harem male lead. Has a strong relationship BUT NOT TO THE POINT OF INCEST with his sister who died while fighitng one of those huge inter-dimensional beings.He blushes easily to any girl...seriously... ANY GIRL!Satellizer el Bridget! Strong in the outside, mushy in the instead. Apparently has a traumatic past and thus wont let any guys touch her except to Kazuya Aoi.Why is this so? Well, according to the"" Theory of Evolution"", some males had develop into a new species named by the science community, ""Justinian Bieberious"" Im no expert on this matter, but Im guessing Kazuya Aoi is under this new species.NAHH... Im just kidding... The fact is Kazuya Aoi possess something that normally the female characters in the anime would only possess (wont spoil anything here)So other than those two, the rest of the cast are psychotic female warriors, a hot teacher, a hot nurse, another gay looking roommate, and powerless student council members.Overall, fanservice anime with hot girls fighting each other and/or giant inter-dimensional beings. If you\'re complaining why Japan is always making such repetitive animes its because you\'re probably not the targeted demography. Remember kiddies, animes are made 1) For Japan... after that 2) Rest of the world...This is one type of anime that will make you perverts go yay! when her clothes gets shred off and boo! when their clothes regenerate. So enjoy it while you can.Now, if you\'ll excuse me, I\'ve got some clothes to shred as well.. Damn.. Why do I always end up defeating the girl in battle raper before shredding her clothes?? Wait? Wouldn\'t it be easier to defeat her first then shred her clothes?? I mean, have you ever tried shredding clothes of an unconscious girl. Waaaay too easy.. Umm.. Not that I\'ve ever tried... REALLY!', 'Entertainment is a fickle thing. Everyone has different tastes and different opinions, so making a series that satisfies the tastes of every single individual who may come across the series is a fundamental impossibility. Although, the entertainment industry keeps tabs on what has been deemed popular all throughout the course of history, and if nothing else, they use it to their advantage. While certain aspects of entertainment may be popular, that does not always guarantee those aspects can improve the quality of a title. These things could be criticized as the intentional use of said aspects in order to draw in viewers and have them...pay for something they may not really be interested in. And what is debatably the most recognized aspect of this kind in the anime industry? Sex. Enter Freezing, a series that I would describe as the gold standard of what a title looks like when you only focus on the viewer\'s primal instincts, and the characters\' chests.The driving force behind the series called Freezing is a busty, young woman named Bridget Satellizer, who\'s reputation as ""The Untouchable Queen"" runs rampant among the other characters present at the university. With blonde hair, a different uniform from anyone else, and the biggest bust of the bunch, her role as the main character is set in stone, and it\'s apparent from the start. While there are other characters introduced before her, it\'s hard to recall said characters when comparing them to Satellizer\'s overall design. While she appears menacing and cold on the outside, she\'s actually cold and menacing on the inside as well. That is, until the appearance of the other central, yet less important character, Kazuya Aoi transfers into the school. From that point, Satellizer\'s image as ""The Untouchable Queen"" comes under fire, while a looming threat lingers in the distance.One thing about this series that I never understood was its priorities. This is part of my claim that this series is simply a combination of popular anime tropes. At one point, the series focuses on developing the relationship between Satellizer and Kazuya through the role of damsel in distress, as one of them is placed in a difficult situation, while the other rescues them (or attempts to) from their conflict. This is typical in shounen series and Super Mario games in particular. At another point, they focus on melodrama based on testing the bond between the two of them as new characters are placed within the plot. Then there is also the evident antagonist threat, those called Novas, that eventually become a threat to everyone involved at the school and the world. These creatures are written off as unknown creatures with unknown purposes, which may or may not be an excuse for lazy writing. The sudden shift from one situation to another is more distracting than anything, and it shows an unusual desire to move on from a certain plot point into something new, which may also be a result of lazy writing.Everything I\'ve said up to this point about the plot was basically underlying problems, problems that arise after digging deep into a title and finding nothing. But what isn\'t underlying is the inexplicable amount of fan service shown on the outside. Sex appeal and the violence. The strongest argument I can give to support my claim is the apparent focus on these two qualities. Throughout every episode, these two qualities make themselves known in almost every situation. Whether the situation stem from tension between characters, the closeness of partners or comic relief, Freezing finds every single possible excuse to show exposed breasts or unnecessary violence. And while the violence isn\'t as prevalent throughout the series than the skin, it still panders to the whims of the viewer, finding unreasonable excuses to have the characters duke it out and show off their exaggerated weapons and speed. While this may not be a problem, it starts to become expected. And to expect something before it happens takes the pleasure of being surprised by the creativity of writing out of the equation. And what does this series become memorable for? When someone or something repeats a certain action enough, they become what they do, and they\'re remembered for that reason alone. How do I remember Freezing? Fan service alone.Characters within Freezing are about as typical as the writing of the series. They display qualities similar to that of other characters from other series. Satellizer is a tsundere with a remorseful past. Kazuya is the equivalent of the male harem lead. Every other character serves to back them up. They each have one quality that defines who they are, and never develop past that. Their designs are a different story, however. Satellizer\'s appearance is memorable and does well to support the viewer\'s interest in her life and problems, if not her chest. The uniforms that all other characters wear are enough to draw interest, but some issues arise in the fact that they\'re either never in them due to fan service, and that their battle armor looks identical to it. Which, in turn, leads to the quality of animation, which is slick and shiny enough to keep even a sloth awake. The art is of higher quality compared to other titles released during that year, but doesn\'t take any risks to ensure a place in history. It\'s well done, but it\'s nothing different. And with the glorious amount of exposed sexual features, it\'s within my power to state that they\'re well done, but with how much it\'s shown, anyone would expect them to pay attention to detail.In a society where money is everything, it\'s easy to assume that titles like Freezing will be prevalent far along in the distant future as much as they are today. As long as sex and violence remains a popular spectrum in the minds of viewers and they use their money accordingly, these things won\'t disappear anytime soon. At this point, those against it have to at least applaud their durability throughout time. And to those who are so against it, perhaps they should take the chance to see how it can be improved in the future. Fan service is not a bad thing. It lets the viewer identify with the writer or writers of a title and provides them with evidence that these writers had them in mind. But that isn\'t to say that a series should only rely on fan service, as there are other parts to a story that need to be constructed in order to make a quality work. This statement is both controversial and a gateway to debate. A debate that I hope everyone will take seriously and will take into consideration when watching series in the future. What makes a title successful? Its revenue or its attention to quality? Freezing is a good example of this, as nothing of its quality outside of fan service could be considered good in any sense. pay for something they may not really be interested in.

But besides that, Freezing is a definite different from anime i have watched so far.Please remember that this is my own personal opinion, whether you find it distasteful or outright wrong in your viewpoint, is your own valued perspective.Story: The story is original, although it has the overused theme of aliens coming to earth for reasons unknown other than destruction, a typical fanservice-harem anime was easily revealed when the main roles were given to sexy teenage girls with giant racks and fetishes...for younger boys. They attempted, and accomplished well to have a good amount of action and shounen aspects which I found the most blatant factor of why this anime was good. The amounts of ecchi were tastefully included, not shoved in your face at every scene, which is a plus, and the overall plot kept you guessing. Near the end however like many other short anime, was rushed dramatically, dropping the amount of effect it has on the audience. My guess was that Freezing never intended to have a second season, but did particularly well,which is why i look forward to it airing in October of 2013.Art and Sound: The animations for the Limiter's Freezing have to be my favorite, other than that the soundtrack complimented well with the scenes and the art was very good. Although giagantic oppai that are too large for reality do kind of disagree with me, they kept it fairly under control. Respect points for that. The action scenes were well done too,with enough gore to add effect, but not too much to make you lose your lunch, it was done thoughtfully.Characters: The personality traits is mainly what i look for in characters, that said,some characteristics were standard in all harem anime, but who can deny the desires of the audience =P.Overall i enjoyed this anime series and i recommend it to any that enjoyed similar ones such as, Pokemon (XD), Date a Live, Guilty Crown and possibly Angel Beats! fans.SPOILERThe ending really got me hooked on expecting a second season. for younger boys.

Pandora is fighting against creatures called ""Novas"". Only girl can become Pandora. Pretty convenient for fandom, right? Well, Media Factory at least thinks so.Art (7/10)I have nothing to complain about here. Graphics seems pretty good. There were few too bright scenes, but that is all.Sound (4/10)This is probably first time I have said so, but I NEVER saw opening so much NOT fitting into show as here. Song is not bad itself, but seeing it with animation made...me wonder if it was written for this show. Rest of sounds was decent. Background noice was just like you would expect it to be. Still this feeling after opening lingers in me...Character (9/10)Bridgett. \'Nuff said.Enjoyment (2/10)TOO MANY PANTSU-SHOTS! There were quite few in manga too, but what we saw here was just disturbing. There is something as restraint. Some people should remember about that.Overall (6/10)I\'m dissapointed in this. After manga I was expecting something of at least decent quality and I saw what was done many times recently.

At this point I can feel only dissapointment.', ""This is my first review:Every once in a while, an anime comes along that you watch and wonder why you liked it so much.  Well, for myself this is one such anime.  The overall graphics and sound quality may not be as high as some of the new productions, but the story is very interesting.I only wish the anime was longer than 13 episode because only the surface of the story can be portrayed in such a short format; only a brief back-story to why the world is in its current state is discussed.With that being said, I really like the...two main characters and the romantic feelings between then.  I like the idea of the super fine girl who no one wants to get involved with, due to her perceived personality and background, has an immediate reaction when she first meets the new guy, who may not look like much but definitely has that kinda hidden inner strength and swagger that any main guy should have in an anime.Although I've only watched 4 episodes, I truly like the idea of the story and the development between the two main characters; I only hope the show continues in a good direction and doesn't turn to crape.The main negatives:- graphics aren't the greatest, buy definitely aren't bad- same with the sound- some might say the intro is bad but who cares about the intro and ending credits anyway, I never watch 'em- a little nudity never hurt anyone, but pointless excessive nudity can just get annoying, this show edges on too many pointless boob shotsMaybe this wasn't the best review but I'm sure the best thing I can tell you is that you'll either hate it or love it, hopefully it's the latter of the two. two main characters and the romantic feelings between then.

It does a lot of things I like, things that give a feel-good feeling (and I'm not talking about the fanservice here, which is nearly constant, btw). It also mostly avoids some of the common annoyances of the action, ecchi, romance genres that tend to turn me off of a series. I'll explain all this in a moment.The setup:The underlying premise isn't anything special. You've got a school that trains students solely for combat. The girls are powerful fighters with lots of abilities, but...they need the support of the boys for a special power that only the boys have called Freezing. This relationship generally requires compatible males and females to pair up and develop strong bonds (in other words, become close as boyfriend/girlfriend). Fine. Accept it. It serves as a good excuse to add romance and sexual tension to the ecchi, which is always a good addition to otherwise mindless ecchi.The story:The story isn't anything complex or unusual. While you might think the story is supposed to be about fighting aliens from another dimension, that really isn't the focus of the story. That part of the story is just developed slowly on the margins until the final episodes. In fact, the aliens don't become a factor until the 9th episode, as part of a multi-episode climax. Almost all the fighting before then is between the heroine (Satellizer el Bridget) and the other girls. And even though fighting happens in each episode, I wouldn't exactly say it is the focus of the show.#1 reason to watch, romance/tsundere:The focus of the story is mainly on the development of the romance between the main hero, Kazuya Aoi, and heroine, Satellizer. This is one of the feel-good aspects of the show I mentioned at the start of this review that I really enjoy. The heroine is a tsundere, not the kind that is violent and abusive, but rather the kind that is shy and normally a loner. She's actually feared by most of the other students and thought to be ruthless. But the Hero Aoi, who is a transfer student, is unaware of her reputation and so treats her kindly and without fear, which is new and unexpected for the heroine. This leads to all the cute feel-good stuff that usually happens with this kind of thing in anime (it's why we love tsunderes). Note: there is also some harem type romantic action from a competing love interest which sparks some jealousy, but it's mostly friendly rather than a bitchy cat fight.#2 reason to watch, hero and heroine being impressive/cool:Another feel-good repeated feature of the show that I really like is the way that the 2 main characters (who you'll probably be rooting for) continually impress others by greatly exceeding expectations. Much of the fighting involves other students trying to put them in their place and humiliate them, but they manage to turn the tables and be the ones doing the humiliating, and being awed and respected in the process. They are constantly showing us new, more advanced abilities that they shouldn't have. They take bravery, defiance, and perseverance beyond the limits. It's fun to watch.The fighting, not bad and possibly pretty good:I typically don't care for fighting-based anime. But I actually looked forward to the next daunting challenge each fight brought here. I didn't feel the fights were random or forced. I thought there was a very believable purpose to each fight. Each was nicely more epic than the last. Each had a distinct sense of progression and unique challenge. Thankfully, the fights aren't done in a corny shounen way where they yell and shout and it suddenly results in them being stronger. Instead, the battles are a bit more technical and skill-based rather than being based on grunting and getting pumped up mentally. They were pretty cool. The sound effects and music added positively to the coolness as well. The art wasn't anything spectacular, but I didn't think it detracted from the scenes either.Fan service:Of course, the show is absolutely full of fan service. I can't complain. I like it. It doesn't get in the way of anything. It's just there and can just as easily not be there without changing anything. All the girls look great. Boobs are larger than average, but not excessive. Though, I suppose I can complain about the one time early on that the hero sticks his face in the boobs of the heroine to hug her and is oblivious to how awkward that is. I don't like ridiculous stuff like that, but thankfully that is rare here.Conclusion:The story is fairly typical. Not many surprises to be had there. The fighting is at least better than average. Fan service is there in force, if you like that. But the real draw for me was 1: the cute tsundere romance and 2: the awe-inspiring displays of raw talent and virtues from the two main characters as it gains them the respect and admiration of others. If these two things sound particularly appealing to you, and you don't mind fighting, fan service, or a background plot that spends most of the time being secondary to the romance and high school student based storyline, then I think you'll enjoy this.

So, my rating for this anime is as follows:Story: Dreadful number 2.The story is about genetically modified girls called ""Pandoras"" duking it out with extra dimensional invaders called ""Novas"" which only appers at the frist part of the episode, flash backs and obviously on the last 2 episodes, but instead it has more to do with the Pandoras who engage in CATFIGHTS and a whole lot of ecchi.Art: Very Good 8.What can I say, I like the way...the chicas were drawn.Sound: Decent 4.No need for me to say anything.Characters: Fair 6.Let\'s go over the charaters:Satellizer El Bridget - the infamous ""UNTOUCHABLE QUEEN"" she earned the reputation because she beat the crap out of every humbre who wants to be her limiter and whom also makes a dreadful mistake of touching her (except Aoi), she also doesn\'t take any crap from other Pandoras regaurdless of seniority. According to info, it is said that she was implanted with stigmata from Aoi\'s sister which may partly explain why she didn\'t instictily attacked Aoi when he touched her and later on develop a brother sister relationship with him, eventhough she doesn\'t want to perform a baptismal with Aoi she does wants to bond with him. She\'s born of noblity, but she also experience a rough childhood in the hands of her half brother molesting and abusing her, but she was saved by her elder half-sister. She\'s a regular at a Queen Burger stand in the school\'s canteen always ordering a lot of cheseburgers.Aoi Kazuya - At frist Satellizer avoids him, later on she takes his offer to be her limiter on the condition that they will not performed a baptismal, his realtionship with Satellizer is that of a brother and sister relationship. He\'s the only limiter who can use freezing without being baptize, him being close to has more to do with the respect that he earned from Satellizer for standing out for her even at the cost of his own life. Also according to info, her sister is also a Pandora who risked her life to save the reamining Pandoras from the Nova\'s onslaught, surprisingly his attraction to Satellizer has to do with her resemblance to his sister, who also goes by the name Aoi Kazuya.Clipton Arthur- who\'s is Roland Genessa\'s boy bitch and Aoi\'s friend, he\'s always seen with Hiiragi Kaho and one would mistaken him to be her Limiter.Mably Elizabeth - Satellizer\'s next opponent, I think.Linchen Rana - a tibetan Pandora who has hot\'s for Aoi.Fairchild Chiffon- she\'s the president of the west genetics student council, and may soon to be Sattllize\'s opponet.I have no words to say as to why the rating.Enjoyment: a very good 8.Don\'t ask.Overall: a fair 6.Hey, this anime is more about fanservice.the end. the chicas were drawn.Sound: Decent 4.No need for me to say anything.Characters: Fair 6.Let\'s go over the charaters:Satellizer El Bridget - the infamous ""UNTOUCHABLE QUEEN"" she earned the reputation because she beat the crap out of every humbre who wants to be her limiter and whom also makes a dreadful mistake of touching her (except Aoi), she also doesn\'t take any crap from other Pandoras regaurdless of seniority.

For the impatient, this is an Ecchi anime with a fair amount of fan-service but equally as good characters and story. The art and animation is decent enough that it will not deter from the overall enjoyment of the anime and the characters each have backgrounds which are briefly explained at varying levels at some point. I enjoyed this anime, if you are a fan of... fan-service, then. Enjoy yourself ;)The story is pretty interesting, girls...and guys take on roles to use somewhat interesting abilities. It takes place in a school, from the eyes of a young male protagonist, based on the make-up of how the roles are set, it\'s normal to see younger males pairing up with older females. Considering the rating of this anime and the ""Ecchi"" tag, you can imagine what it\'s all about. It does however pick up a lot of depth towards the end, nudging you towards the edge of your seat in anticipation as more exciting events unveil.The art is pretty standard just as the animations are. Do not expect jaw-dropping visuals unless you\'re asking about the fan-service stills growing like mushrooms on your screen in-between each episode? Yeah, they\'re okay.The sound, there are a variety of voices you can hear. The soundtrack is actually very decent, which took me by surprise. You can expect some interesting orchestral spin-togethers and catchy Opening and Ending sequences.Characters are fairly well portrayed and as with any decent anime you get a good feel for each personality. Each major character has a varying amount of background information shown either in a flashback or self-introductory scene.But all in all, I enjoyed this anime and as said at the start you will enjoy it too if you are a fan of Ecchi. There\'s fighting, fanservice and plenty of cool-down time where you get to know the characters, as well as some pretty decent gripping action towards the end. and guys take on roles to use somewhat interesting abilities.

There are some good aspects. However, if you decide to watch this, you are in for one hell of a ride, to hell. The combination of tits-for-brains characters and constant meaningless fanservice left me cringing and facepalming on multiple occasions. If you don\'t feel like reading my jumbled thoughts, skip right to the conclusion.Story:Lets start with the good news. The story was actually quite interesting. Although it could have been executed much better, the story intrigued me enough...to watch until the end despite all the horse shit (which will be discussed later) that takes place from beginning to end. The season finale looked like it was going to be meaningful, but don\'t be fooled, it\'s a mediocre harem after all.There is one filler-like episode where nothing happens plot-wise. It\'s in this episode that you see exactly how boring this anime would be without the story.Art:If you ignore the disproportionate tits and constant meaningless panty shots, the artwork is fairly decent. Most of the fight scenes are decent. Some of the action scenes seemed too slow and lazily drawn, but for the most part, they managed to keep the momentum going.( \'-\')bThis anime also contains some scenes of gore. Although it wasn\'t implemented the way I liked, at least it was a step in the right direction. An arm or leg falling off illogically here and there, very meaningful ( \'-\')b (sarcasm). Aside from that, gore is decently implemented for scenes where the tits-for-brains syndrome doesn\'t kick in to overshadow the blood.I will now tell you about tits, because it seems to be the heart of the anime. Most of the important characters have over-sized over-sized tits. Not so bad right? Well they sure like to slap it on your faces :). What happens when someone gets slashed? They bleed right? Well in the case of Freezing, you constantly wonder where the blood comes from. When a female gets slashed, blood splatters and the cloth covering their tits shreds off. You will notice that the female shows no signs of slash wounds, her tits are conveniently uncovered and unscathed. You begin to wonder where the blood really comes from, them or their clothes? If you happen to like watching clothes (only around their tits) being torn off randomly and illogically during important and meaningful scenes, then this may be the anime for you. Along with that, they seem to think it\'s a good idea to slap in as many meaningless panty shots as possible.Characters (I think this section has spoilers):The entire school staff in this anime seems to only consist of two or three tits-for-brains, because that is how incompetent they are. Despite chaos and earthquakes, teachers either are never there to resolve issues, or show up too late. For some reason they seem to only show up when it\'s inconvenient for the main heroine. FOR SOME REASON, the main heroine is always taking most of the blame even though it\'s painfully obvious who is at fault.There is a social hierarchy in the school between students of different grades. For some reason, most of the 3rd year students who are part of the cast are extremely stupid psychos. I wonder why they are not expelled from the school. I forgot, the staff members have tits for brains.Let me introduce you to the main villain of this anime, the main character (MC). Are you looking for an MC that surpasses the generic harem MC? Well look no further. Actually, you shouldn\'t look here at all, because the only aspect in which he excels is... stupidity. Take a generic harem MC, and replace his brain with rocks. Congratulations, your typical harem MC has evolved into Aoi Kazuya! It appears that this MC has no sense of common decency whatsoever. During times of crisis he gives out some cool speeches, and sometimes they even sound stupid. There isn\'t really much depth to this character. Make an MC, throw in some random ""cool"" speeches, make the girls love him for no reason, and don\'t forget the overdose of idiocy.Unlike the MC, the main heroine seems to be likable... at first. The main heroine was intriguing. I wanted to know more about her past and why she behaved the way she did. Oh I found out all right, that she is probably delusional. Her backstory contradicts the way she feels for the main character, and she seems to only act like that towards him for... hold on, there is no reason whatsoever. Go harem MC power ( \'0\')/Sound:For god\'s sake, stop moaning when you transform. Other than that, it seems pretty normal, except for the MC\'s annoying voice.Conclusion:It pains me to watch a potentially good anime being destroyed by excessive fan service, illogical events and characters that lack common sense.

The reason the Anime are associated with being such a low caliber comes from the fact that most of the ecchi genre places what possibly amounts to to much emphasis on the fan service.  That doesn't mean though, there aren't shows in the ecchi genre that actually have quality to them.Freezing, despite sharing similar attributes to Claymore, happens to be one of those Anime that stands out as having quality to the storyline despite being of the ecchi genre. Sure, the...series has plenty of fan service, but none of it is forced and every shot is actually believable within the context of the story. There is no pushing “the willing suspense of disbelief for this story.” Every step is thought out.This includes the artwork and the characterization. All of the action scenes flow realistically, not to mention this is one of those shows that as I've said before, due to the subject matter, would be hard to pull off without the ecchi moments. On top of this, the female characters aren't degraded into being mere eye candy for the main protagonist and his friends to ogle over and have to protect because they are girls. No... the girls are allowed to stand on their own two feet. series has plenty of fan service, but none of it is forced and every shot is actually believable within the context of the story.

No... the girls are allowed to stand on their own two feet."", '\'Freezing\' is an anime that people will approach from several different angles. There are the people that will be watching for the outrageous fight scenes,  and others will watch for the ample fan service. What surprised me at the conclusion of the show was that I thought back on the series as, first and formost, a futuristic apocalyptic tale in the same realm of subject matter as Neon Genesis Evangelion. It is a return to the subjects of a show that created a surge of more adult-themed stories and content in anime. Every rose has its thorns, as the show itself says, so let\'s...delve into the components of \'Freezing.\'Story: I will try not to give away the best bits! Basically, the story revolves around a highschool-aged group of female superstrong Genetics soldiers and their slightly younger male partners, whose power combined is just enough to fight Genetic\'s greatest foe, the Nova. Right from the beginning, this show flaunts the extreme violence that comes with training for war. We meet the main characters, Sattelizer and Kazuya just as a ""carnival"" (read: masochistic annual tournament) is wrapping up, with Sattelizer as the heavy favorite in the second years. The late transfer student and the secluded, tormented fighter makes for a great story of reconciliation and selfless love. We get to see the characters as they fight over school politics, war partners, and each other\'s hearts. The story has a tendency of showing emotions through protracted fights rather than dialogue, and there were a few points where I just wanted to shove two characters in a room and make them talk. It\'s frustrating when the source of drama is sometimes just silly miscommunications or assumptions, but I guess these fighters and defenders of the earth are a tad egotistical and self-involved. It comes with the territory.By the time you\'re wondering just where the show will go with its fleshed out leads, a large attack befalls Genetics, and Sattelizer and Kasuya find themselves right in the middle. The emotional plot really does play into each character\'s effectiveness as a fighter, which makes the story much more enthralling. I loved the last four episodes. They were dramatic, had some great twists in the fight, and generally made the show. The stakes feel high in the battle, and I was caring for the different characters, as their survival did not seem to be assured. Now, here\'s some not-so-sweet news: there is a good amount of boobs and poses thrown into this anime, and though it is almost always related to the fights (as their ever-shredded stigma fabric suits are indicative of their condition), some will see this as gratuitous and pointless. And as I said before, the fights can last quite a while, robbing the viewer of more character development or general setting about the outside world.Animation: The character designs for everyone is great. We see many nationalities at Genetics, and it actually shows some in their look. Also, every Pandora\'s a babe, and you will be seeing many a pair of fight-revealed titties (for better or worse, this show is a kind of ecchi), and if it\'s important to you, they are quite the mammaries. The fighters use a variety of tactics and weapons in their fights, and oh are the fights extraordinary! Great animation paired with a visceral feel of classmates/comrades fighting all out (thank goodness for their magical hospital!) makes for exciting fights that feel like they have lots of power behind them and real consequences. Both the fights and the more dialogue-heavy scenes are well-animated, with good, strong emotions coming through with most of the characters. CGI is used for some of the special moves in a way that blends well with the drawn characters and enemies.  It looked like it belonged in the fights, and I think that\'s the best compliment I could give. Blood and gore are present, but never gratuitous, and the expressions of pain that comes with each hit looks the part. Settings can sometimes be bland-- the school is pretty, I guess, and the city in the last arc does give off a futuristic vibe, but sets in the Genetics compound and during fights are dark and spartan. This is a more generic future than NGE\'s Nerve center, and the beautiful landscapes of that world. The most important parts, though (the characters, the fights, and the enemy design) come out as the focus, and these elements more than make up for the lack of pretty sunsets.Sound: The OP is fairly good, and this is coming from a chronic skipper. I found myself humming along often, and the montage during the song is a good overview of the characters and their job: kicking ass to protect the world. The ED is more techno, and has stills behind it rather than animation, but it\'s still a catchy tune. The soundtrack is usually servicable techno, some piano. It gets the job done. I thought the seiyuu performed admirably. Sattelizer and Kazuya are well-done by their respective actors. There\'s a ""rural"" character in the show, and her dialect sounds different even to me, a complete japanese newb. Everyone has great force behind their lines during fights, and especially at the end. Overall, a great and even effort. Also, the sound design for the fights and Nova are great. The special moves really pick up intensity when their sound effects give some weight to the punches and slashes. Oh, and that sound the Novas make? It\'s really creepy and scary. The sound helps make these behemoths seem menacing and frightfully dangerous.Characters: The crux of this show is the relationship between Sattelizer and Kazuya, and as they draw closer to each other, both of them have to look back on their lives and their motivations to fight before they can handle a Nova fight. Sattelizer had a traumatic childhood, but in the beginning, all you can think is ""ice queen"". Who better to thaw the Untouchable Queen\'s heart than Aoi Kazuyah, the brother of the deceased hero of the last Nova war? There\'s plenty of meat on these characters, and seeing Kazuya\'s iron will and its affect on Sattelizer makes for good drama, most of the time. It seems like they pulled the rug out from under our feet at the end, though. We never get to see the result of them caring for each other, this ""baptism"" of sorts, which cheapens the conclusion of the series, in my opinion. Though the other, secondary characters also have varied and refined personalities, the focus on fights and the main two mean that you\'ll be left reading info cards after the commercial breaks to learn about the other fighting vixens. Lana, Ganessa, and Chiffon are all great personalities to have around Sattelizer and Kazuya, but I just wish I knew more about their stories. In the end, the characterization are meant to lend emotional power to the action climax of the show, and for all my complaining, it worked!So there you have it. I started watching for the fight scenes and boobs, and ended up staying for the exciting, world-in-the-balance conclusion. This is an adult anime that eschews the ditzy humor of most ecchi for a serious sci-fi story of love and sacrifice. About the 20th time a blade cuts of a girl\'s clothing but not her skin, you realize that fanservice is a big part of the show, but by no means is it the biggest. If you can\'t stand these parts, ask yourself what the difference is between this and the naughtier bits of Rome, True Blood, or Weeds. Adult shows have some T&A, get used to it and just watch the censored version if you\'re too boob-shy. There are some niggling issues with bland-ish settings and Sattelizer\'s crushing inability to talk to Kazuya about important things in a normal manner, but these are all small imperfections on a generally good, sometimes great futuristic sci-fi action series.

Then a bunch of aliens show up and try to destroy the world.In short, if you like sci-fi magic combat anime and are willing to turn off that part of your brain that insists that the good guys actually have some redeeming qualities, you might enjoy this one.Story: 3I score it this low because of the setting, which drives the plot.  WORST MAGICAL COMBAT SCHOOL EVER!Let me explain.  The school claims to...be run with military discipline.  But this is the school's idea of discipline: Upperclassmen can beat up on lowerclassmen all they want, and if the lowerclassmen do anything about it, they get punished.  That's right, this school is like three years of frat house hazing.  It teaches you to hate people stronger than you and take out your frustrations on people weaker.  Throw in the super powers, and the result is clear.  The perfect school for creating super villains!Wait... that's not the goal of the school?  It's meant to train superheroes instead?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  You're kidding, right?  What's that?  You're serious?  Wow.  That is just soooooo lame.  If this is where they train the heroes who are going to defend us against the alien invaders, then I'm rooting for the aliens.I wouldn't mind so much except that this drives the plot for most of the show.I score it a 3 and not a 2 or 1 because of the occasional tender scene between Satellizer and Kazuya.  He's like her very own bad luck charm, but if you can ignore the fact that he inadvertently ruined her life, their relationship is kind of sweet.  Plus I have no complaints about the battle against the Nova toward the end.  Normally I hate it when a show suddenly introduces a new conflict toward the end, but in this case I was so tired of the girls fighting each other that it was actually a relief to see the Nova show up and give them someone else to attack before the school imploded from all the infighting.Art: 4Don't get me wrong; most of the artwork is fine.  I'm just disappointed by the half-hearted job they did on the nipples when the girls get their clothes ripped off in battle.  If they're going to throw out interesting characters and plot in favor of a bunch of boobie shots, they should at least make the boobies look nice.By the way, in this case there's a perfectly valid explanation as to why the fights involve clothes vaporizing.  The clothes are maintained by the Pandoras' powers.  The benefit is that they can regenerate their clothes instantly after the battle.  The drawback is that when the Pandoras get injured, their clothes take damage too.  Think of the clothes as a kind of video game health bar.Sound: 6It mostly gets out of the way and lets you focus on the fights.  +1 for the eerie howling of the Nova.  Very alien, and very creepy.Characters: 3I can describe these characters in one word: unlikable.A really cool nickname does not make an interesting heroine unless she can back it up, which apparently, Satellizer can't.Kazuya is fine, although he's so forgettable that you could swap him out for any other hero in any other anime ever made and it wouldn't hurt the show.  Actually, in most cases it would probably improve it.The supporting cast is composed of whiny brats who have all the emotional maturity of a bunch of 5-year-olds.  They need to be taken out of high school and sent back to kindergarten until they can learn to play well with others.Enjoyment: 3Look, I get it.  Bodice-busting cat fights sell DVD's, and I have no problem with that.  I'm not one of these morally upright types who get offended by the sight of a bare breast.  But I want to watch interesting characters, not walking temper tantrums with boobs.Overall: 3Okay, I'll admit I'm not a big fan of serious combat anime, but I try to judge a show on how well it accomplishes what it's trying to do.  By this standard, PMS the Series... I mean, Freezing... fails miserably.  With mediocre characters and a plot that doesn't convince me that what the people are fighting for is worth it, this is one of the few animes I wish I hadn't watched.But hey, at least they show a lot of boobs. be run with military discipline.

A butt load of action, and a lot of naked butts to go with it. Of course, that is a very simplistic and 'large in identity' assumption of me, but that is the type of eye candy we usually get. I have to say, despite my open distaste for fanservice, I have to admit that Freezing is pretty good at hitting the sweet tooth it aims for.There are a lot of things that work against this show; firstly the plot is very slow and somewhat shallow as every girl, in this academy pandora, decide...they want to pick a fight with Satella. Despite it being faithful to the manga, the ending arc which has actual relevance to the setting seems as if they just wanted to have some actual plot. While it is nice it has a lot of action, this is what ends up limiting the story of the show.The action is solid and pretty enjoyable, and it damn right should be seeing how it takes up some much screen time. I wouldn't be wrong to judge that at least a third of the show is spent with weapons drawn. The girls each have their own special pandora weapon and after watching the opening battle you know that nobody is pulling their punches as the blood rains down.Of course our female lead might be a little uptight and tsundere, but her background fully justifies her behavior, and allowed me to sympathize with her a lot. The same can not be said for our pathetic cliché male lead. He is completely stupid and head over heels for Satella, but unfortunately we can't have a bad lead right? So they made him the most powerful limiter* in existence - The pandora's male companion who can use 'freezing' to stop the enemy movement. This is another shounen aspect in case you weren't wondering, where the main character pulls tricks out of his butt without having any idea why he is special. The rest of the pandora's we meet are average characters without much depth, but they aren't horrendous either.Freezing is an okay watch if your looking for something that is easy to follow. It doesn't have very good characters or story, but it maintains a high level of enjoyment despite these weaknesses. they want to pick a fight with Satella.

Ever since I've seen the first episode, I fell in love. The series has some amazing characters, with unique traits, fears, dreams and aspirations that made the characters easily lovable and connectable. The series also includes some great humorous scenes and acts, some great romance sub-plots and plenty of action.A little warning though, despite all the said above in favor of the series, the series' storyline tends to get somewhat confusing if you don't pay enough attention to the details, and there's some new and nifty terminology to it that...you must pick up early, or you'll miss a lot. you must pick up early, or you'll miss a lot."", ""I haven't read the manga yet, so my review will be based solely on how I enjoyed the anime.Story/6I shamelessly love the aliens-are-invading-lets-genetically-modify-teens-and-putem-in-a-school plot.

The story line is episode-by-episode for the most part but easy to keep track of.Art/4The characters were physically distinguishable - if only by hairstyle for all the redheads but I mean. The breasts were unnatural and vaguely uncomfortable to look at, since they more like resembled balloons that jutted outwards. Ehhh.

It was pleasant to listen too, nothing felt phoney or forced. I highly recommend the dubbed version!Character/7Satella's whole character was really admirable to me. I realize that she might be viewed as cliche, but when we were given her backstory and then guided through her character development it was so easy to sympathize with her. Her never-give-up personality makes her fun to root for. She's a strong female character who is finding genuine affection and companionship for the first time. It made me like Kazuya's character as well, since he was the one who was the first to fight for her.

If you have already seen this anime and are reading this then you\'re kind of just along for the ride.Story/Characters:The story for freezing is set in a semi-futuristic world where humanity is under threat by inter-dementonal aliens called Nova and young girls; augmented with superpowers named Pandora are tasked with...fighting them (Read the synopsis).Freezing from the very get go has a pretty solid concept and story with a few sci-fi things sprinkled here and there and enough lore to flesh things out and in fact the story is probably one of this anime\'s strong points, but if only it could focus on that all the time. This anime; being included as Ecchi has it\'s fair share of fan service and occasional female nudity, I\'m just letting you know so this doesn\'t come as a surprise.Despite all of that the story alone still holds it\'s own with some consistent action sequences featuring some pandora vs pandora combat. It\'s doesn\'t have the greatest story in the world but this anime defiantly had me watching one episode after the other and I wasn\'t disappointed.As for the characters, the characters to some extent were a little weaker than the story but with some exceptions. Kasuya; the leading male protagonist didn\'t seem all that interesting to me, sure most of the story was seen through his eyes and there were a few things we got to learn about his character and he develops a good working relationship with Satellizer the Female MC but he unfortunately still came off as a little dull to me. Another character that\'s kind of weak (in writing) was Rana who comes in later in the series, Rana\'s only real purpose in the story seemed to be to create a love triangle between the main characters and despite proving useful sometimes, this anime really could have done with out her.To end this section on a good not Satellizer; the Female MC I mentioned before, was probably the best character in the whole series, and that\'s something I don\'t say lightly. This character is introduced as a badass with a hard exterior and prefers to have people at arms length. I won\'t say anything more other than that there is a lot more than what is seen on the surface, which is uncovered over the course of the series.Art/sound:The art and animation is another strong point in this anime, the action sequences were really well choreographed and character designs were really good, especially for the female characters.The music though I don\'t remember any of the particular tracks from the OST was pretty solid for the most part.Sub/Dub:Honestly I wouldn\'t really suggest one version over the other for this anime, though I will mention that Funimation did a pretty good job with the dub, as for watching it subbed, I had a pretty similar experience with it, so my suggestion would be to go with what ever you feel comfortable with.Final Verdict:I\'m going to give this a 7 out of 10, this anime isn\'t perfect with all it\'s fan service and love triangles but I have to give credit where credit is due and say ""hey, this wasn\'t half bad.""I would almost suggest watching this if you want to see something with fanservice for the sake of watching fan service, that way you also get a good story out of it as well. fighting them (Read the synopsis).Freezing from the very get go has a pretty solid concept and story with a few sci-fi things sprinkled here and there and enough lore to flesh things out and in fact the story is probably one of this anime\'s strong points, but if only it could focus on that all the time.

But then she gets to see a boy called ""Aoi, Kazuya"". She starts to get feelings for Kazuya and let him touch her body, normally she nearly killed people who touched her. After that Kazuya wants to be her Limiter but she is too shy to accept and confront...Kazuya, that\'s actually how the story starts...So every Pandora girl has an Limiter, except for Satellizer due to her trauma. Normally to fight the enemy Nova, the girls need Limiters who can Freeze the enemy movement. That is only possible if those both partners have done the Baptism (joining). But Kazuya is able to Freeze without the need of Baptism, like his sister ""Aoi, Kazuha"".So actually its pretty interesting how the story continues, I really enjoyed this series, hope there will be an Season 2 in future, the ending was open.======Now about the rating,Story 8, is very interesting and enjoyable!Art 7, the art could have been better, but still its pretty decent!Sound 9, the sound is very good, the effects/fighting sounds are really good, soundtracks was very nice, I really liked the Nova screaming sound!Character 9, nothing to tell about it, characters are awesome!Enjoyment 9, really enjoyed it, no boring episodes or childish stuff.Blood splatters, slashed body parts, the fighting scenes are all topnotch!Overall : 9/10 Kazuya, that\'s actually how the story starts...So every Pandora girl has an Limiter, except for Satellizer due to her trauma.

I\'m a great fan of ecchi animes XD so i decided to make this review for freezing that is personally one of the few good ecchi animes around with a decent characteristics. Well, lets no waste time and start!Story: 6/10The story is set in a futuristic wold where the earth is being attacked by aliens called novas that comes from a other dimension. In order to stop it, modified genetically girls are created using some nova...fragments on them called stigmas in order to fight novas using new abilities, those girls are called Pandoras. The story starts with a young japanese boy called Kazuya Aoi, that enters in a special school that trains both pandoras and limiters(limiters are male partners of pandoras that uses a freezing ability in order to stop the opponent\'s moviments). As the story keeps going, Kazuya meets a older second year girl called Satellizer el Bridget, that are the strongest pandora of her class but yet she don\'t have a limiter for her. Kazuya somehow feels attached to satellizer since she really looks like his old deceased sister that died during a nova clash years ago. So he decides that he will become satellizer\'s limiter even if most of his classmates warn him about She don\'t like having limiters. And so the story keeps going.Where we have see this before? Monsters attacking the earth and the humans...Female warriors were created, using same powers as the monsters for defeat them...a old female protagonist having a newer male partner on her side...? Many animes are like that, a clearly example is Claymore. The story itself is not so original and also have a very slow pacing, with few things explained. What makes interesting and unique are the events, the diffeent setting(futuristic setting) and the atmosphere of the anime that becomes slighty dark as the animes goes but do not expect something deep. For now, i won\'t critique the story totally since is still in the beginning, Freezing\'s story is good but it had potential to be better with more things explained.Art: 7/10I will be mixed in this part, in other words, i will be positive and negative about the art and designs. I personally liked Freezing\'s art, even if there is no such deep details, i liked it, principally the effects during the fight scenes. What i don\'t really liked is...some designs of the gils in the beginning of episode 1. I reallyl liked satellizer\'s design and some other characters\'design aswell, but there some girls that...how i say...had some unnecessary designs like very short pants, short shits, short skirts and etc. As i said, i like ecchi animes, but there things that are really unnecessary, like those designs that i told, it makes the girls looks immoral somehow...idk..is hard to explain.Sound: 7/10The Op and ED is good, is not so memorable with that feeling of ""want more of it"" , but yet the OSTs were very good. It fits every scene(sad, fight, etc) with  those piano, violin and orchestral marvelous themes.Characters: 3/10Now...the weakest part of the show, the characters. There are very few FEW enjoyable characters in this show, incluing the main characters of the show, Satellizer; Kazuya and Rana. Well since we started about the main charactes how about talking about them? Lets start thenKazuya Aoi: he is your typical correct and unmotivated shounen hero with those repetitive typic phrases like ""i will never leave you side"" or ""i will protect senpai no matter what"", making girls attached to him. Kazuya is neither likeable or dislikeable, he is a OK character but is not a character that will motivate us or catch us somehow. The problem of kazuya is because he don\'t have anything new that lock us on him. we have see too many of his kind, thats ends being a boring and repetitive character. 1.5/5Satellize el Bridget: Satellizer is a typical strong female warrior, with great powers that most of the times you will think she is OP XD. Besides of the being a strong and unstoppable woman, she is very shy and have unconfident mood and also she don\'t like being touched duo the trauma of her past. Satellizer somehow catches me deep, even if the authors used the same formula on her for being a typical strong character(just like erza, clare, teresa and etc), there is something new , that is her background story that was very unexpected and also very dark, causing us to enjoy the character in some terms. The only thing that i don\'t like about her is because she constantly says ""i won\'t lose to anyone"" and she don\'t have any other interesting phrase. =/ if you repeat this phrase a lot, it will comes a time that you will be sick for always see it, but yet, is a good character. 3.5/5Rana Linchen:She is that agitated happy and confident character and also rival(of love) of Satellizer about Kazuya(since they both start to have feelings for him as the series goes). She is simple, honest and like kazuya, have the ""Correct"" will, also she is attached to kazuya and always plan to be his pandora. Rana is a mixed character because you will feel like her only hole is being a rival of love and nothing more. Is not really interesting but yet you somehow will like it her scenes, since she is a funny character and likeable in the same time. Rana should have a better background story, since she is just a fighter that ends having love for a main character and only that, i was kinda expectating more for this character, but yet, is more better than kazuya that somehow entertain us. 2.25/5Honorable Mentions: Chiffon Fairchild, Cassie Lockheart, Elizabeth Mably, Ticy Phenyl(when i make the review on freezing vibration, i will tell more about them, since is when they characters gain a little more of focus)Now i have told about the main characters and some honorable mentions. Now i will tell the problem of the characters variety in freezing....they are just simple...not interesting. I will explain, in the first episodes and more to the near of the final(1-9), is satellizer fightning with diffeent pandoras or a random fanservice. After the pandoras fight with satellizer, they basically...leave the anime, they don\'t appears anymore and if they do, is just in a scene. Most of the characters don\'t have a good background story, interesting concepts or developing characteristics, and is just there for fight with satellizer and then leave the anime like it doesn\'t existed =/. Freezing have a very poorly amount of memorable characters, most of them are annoying or egocentric in some terms, and you will end hating or not likeing them, there times that will don\'t even care if they appears or no in the scene. Characters are not very well developed.Enjoyment: 6/10I Pesonally enjoyed Freezing for being a anime with different concepts and environments, set in a future atmosphere. Even with the flaws and mistakes, you somehow will enjoy the fights, character relationships and few stories and events that somehow will lock you even if is not too much.Overall: 7/10If you are searching for a deep plot, deep characters, great sounds, great arts and great enjoyment with replay valuable, skip freezing. Freezing is a ecchi anime with, let\'s say, decent characteristics in terms of Arts, Sounds and few background stories and some interesting events, but this anime have a personal group target, that are the ecchi fans. The story for now is focus in the relationship of Rana, Satella and Kazuya, with a slow pacing plot. If you are fan of boobies, pretty girls, nude, love triangle, fights and some emotional scenes , you will enjoy it, if you don\'t then don\'t even watch. Soon i will give my review of freezing vibration...and i have really many things to talk about it.Pros:+Good Animation Quality+Stunning Effects+Good Atmosphere/Unexpected Events+Balanced Harem/Ecchi scenes and Fan serviceCons:- Poorly Developed Characters, not a great variety of interesting characters-Story have a slowy pacing. Many things left unexplained-Most Episodes will feel repetitive fragments on them called stigmas in order to fight novas using new abilities, those girls are called Pandoras. The story starts with a young japanese boy called Kazuya Aoi, that enters in a special school that trains both pandoras and limiters(limiters are male partners of pandoras that uses a freezing ability in order to stop the opponent\'s moviments).

Kazuya somehow feels attached to satellizer since she really looks like his old deceased sister that died during a nova clash years ago. So he decides that he will become satellizer\'s limiter even if most of his classmates warn him about She don\'t like having limiters. And so the story keeps going.Where we have see this before? Monsters attacking the earth and the humans...Female warriors were created, using same powers as the monsters for defeat them...a old female protagonist having a newer male partner on her side...? Many animes are like that, a clearly example is Claymore. The story itself is not so original and also have a very slow pacing, with few things explained. What makes interesting and unique are the events, the diffeent setting(futuristic setting) and the atmosphere of the anime that becomes slighty dark as the animes goes but do not expect something deep. For now, i won\'t critique the story totally since is still in the beginning, Freezing\'s story is good but it had potential to be better with more things explained.Art: 7/10I will be mixed in this part, in other words, i will be positive and negative about the art and designs. I personally liked Freezing\'s art, even if there is no such deep details, i liked it, principally the effects during the fight scenes. What i don\'t really liked is...some designs of the gils in the beginning of episode 1. I reallyl liked satellizer\'s design and some other characters\'design aswell, but there some girls that...how i say...had some unnecessary designs like very short pants, short shits, short skirts and etc. As i said, i like ecchi animes, but there things that are really unnecessary, like those designs that i told, it makes the girls looks immoral somehow...idk..is hard to explain.Sound: 7/10The Op and ED is good, is not so memorable with that feeling of ""want more of it"" , but yet the OSTs were very good. It fits every scene(sad, fight, etc) with  those piano, violin and orchestral marvelous themes.Characters: 3/10Now...the weakest part of the show, the characters. There are very few FEW enjoyable characters in this show, incluing the main characters of the show, Satellizer; Kazuya and Rana. Well since we started about the main charactes how about talking about them? Lets start thenKazuya Aoi: he is your typical correct and unmotivated shounen hero with those repetitive typic phrases like ""i will never leave you side"" or ""i will protect senpai no matter what"", making girls attached to him. Kazuya is neither likeable or dislikeable, he is a OK character but is not a character that will motivate us or catch us somehow. The problem of kazuya is because he don\'t have anything new that lock us on him. we have see too many of his kind, thats ends being a boring and repetitive character. 1.5/5Satellize el Bridget: Satellizer is a typical strong female warrior, with great powers that most of the times you will think she is OP XD. Besides of the being a strong and unstoppable woman, she is very shy and have unconfident mood and also she don\'t like being touched duo the trauma of her past. Satellizer somehow catches me deep, even if the authors used the same formula on her for being a typical strong character(just like erza, clare, teresa and etc), there is something new , that is her background story that was very unexpected and also very dark, causing us to enjoy the character in some terms. The only thing that i don\'t like about her is because she constantly says ""i won\'t lose to anyone"" and she don\'t have any other interesting phrase. =/ if you repeat this phrase a lot, it will comes a time that you will be sick for always see it, but yet, is a good character. 3.5/5Rana Linchen:She is that agitated happy and confident character and also rival(of love) of Satellizer about Kazuya(since they both start to have feelings for him as the series goes). She is simple, honest and like kazuya, have the ""Correct"" will, also she is attached to kazuya and always plan to be his pandora. Rana is a mixed character because you will feel like her only hole is being a rival of love and nothing more. Is not really interesting but yet you somehow will like it her scenes, since she is a funny character and likeable in the same time. Rana should have a better background story, since she is just a fighter that ends having love for a main character and only that, i was kinda expectating more for this character, but yet, is more better than kazuya that somehow entertain us. 2.25/5Honorable Mentions: Chiffon Fairchild, Cassie Lockheart, Elizabeth Mably, Ticy Phenyl(when i make the review on freezing vibration, i will tell more about them, since is when they characters gain a little more of focus)Now i have told about the main characters and some honorable mentions. Now i will tell the problem of the characters variety in freezing....they are just simple...not interesting. I will explain, in the first episodes and more to the near of the final(1-9), is satellizer fightning with diffeent pandoras or a random fanservice. After the pandoras fight with satellizer, they basically...leave the anime, they don\'t appears anymore and if they do, is just in a scene. Most of the characters don\'t have a good background story, interesting concepts or developing characteristics, and is just there for fight with satellizer and then leave the anime like it doesn\'t existed =/. Freezing have a very poorly amount of memorable characters, most of them are annoying or egocentric in some terms, and you will end hating or not likeing them, there times that will don\'t even care if they appears or no in the scene. Characters are not very well developed.Enjoyment: 6/10I Pesonally enjoyed Freezing for being a anime with different concepts and environments, set in a future atmosphere. Even with the flaws and mistakes, you somehow will enjoy the fights, character relationships and few stories and events that somehow will lock you even if is not too much.Overall: 7/10If you are searching for a deep plot, deep characters, great sounds, great arts and great enjoyment with replay valuable, skip freezing. Freezing is a ecchi anime with, let\'s say, decent characteristics in terms of Arts, Sounds and few background stories and some interesting events, but this anime have a personal group target, that are the ecchi fans. The story for now is focus in the relationship of Rana, Satella and Kazuya, with a slow pacing plot. If you are fan of boobies, pretty girls, nude, love triangle, fights and some emotional scenes , you will enjoy it, if you don\'t then don\'t even watch. Soon i will give my review of freezing vibration...and i have really many things to talk about it.Pros:+Good Animation Quality+Stunning Effects+Good Atmosphere/Unexpected Events+Balanced Harem/Ecchi scenes and Fan serviceCons:- Poorly Developed Characters, not a great variety of interesting characters-Story have a slowy pacing. Many things left unexplained-Most Episodes will feel repetitive', ""Despite being a female, Ecchi and fanservice are two things I don't mind in my anime. That is, if it is done in moderation and is not acting as the crutch of the series. Unfortunately, Freezing is one of those anime, one that rides on its fanservice.Now for an ecchi/ harem anime, we shouldn't come in with high expectations that you're going to get amazing, dynamic characters, a killer story-line, and perfect pacing. 90% of the time you're going to get the exact opposite. Well I came in with my expectations low and by the end of Freezing I had that feeling I hate having...when I finish a show: The fact that I just watched something that was either really bad or only decent, when the show could have been so much more.Story: See, this disappointment mostly came from the story. Its not your typical slice of life harem, its the seemingly less taken supernatural harem, one where it actually seems like its at least trying to have a story. Its got an interesting backstory, where super powered girls called Pandora's are assisted by their male Limiters to eradicate an alien threat in a futuristic world. The original mangaka seemed like they took care in crafting this world and the Pandora's power. But the anime seems to want to focus more on tits and ass. You won't even really see the alien threat (the Nova) until near the end. The anime seemed to only show battles between the Pandora, needlessly squabbling for who knows what and who really gives a shit.And these fights are really there to expose the girls, who's clothes seem to be made out of tissue paper. Long story short: Very interesting concept, not realized to its full potential. 4/10Characters: Most of the characters in this show are forgettable. They simply exist to either have their ass handed to them by Satelizer or for eye candy. Most of the female side characters are bitchy, violent, and unlikable. I can't even remember the names or faces of any of the male side characters. They are far and few. The 3 notable main characters are a bit more interesting. Satellizer el Bridget is quite the badass. A few minutes into the first episode you see her whooping ass and tearing her opponents apart. We find out later that she is quite the shy girl in reality, and as the series progresses, she unfolds in typical tsundere fashion. Kazuya Aoi, is probably one of the dumbest things ever. He's not totally unlikable, despite being the stereotypical loser who managed to score a hot girl. But I don't know what else to call someone who shoves his face in the chest of a girl (the UNTOUCHABLE queen at that) 5 seconds after meeting her. Seeing his relationship with Satellizer bloom was one of the more interesting parts of the anime. I don't really care for this guy though. Rana Linchen was my favorite character by far. She's nothing revolutionary or dynamic, but she's funny, hyper, and an interesting rival. 5/10Art and Sound: The insert tracks weren't anything special. The opening and ending themes were good. Now the art...oh the art. This anime doesn't look like it was animated in 2011 at all. It looks like an anime made in the late 90s/early 00's. Characters and backgrounds are bland and flat. You would think that they would have did better in the animation department, seeing as this is an ecchi and the focus is mostly on beautiful busty girls. 3/10Enjoyment: Well I sat through the whole thing if that means something. I don't mind fanservice at all, but Freezing was a bit much. I enjoyed the fights with the Nova toward the end, and I liked the basis of the story, and even liked the 3 main characters. But I wouldn't say I fully enjoyed this anime. 6/10Overall: It was interesting enough to keep my attention and root for the main characters but Freezing really doesn't live up to its potential. It has action, it has romance, it has aliens, it has magic, it sounds as if it'd be perfect. If they decided to make a second season with more focus on story and characters with better art, then I'd definetly watch it. But as it stands now, Freezing is just average. 5/10 when I finish a show: The fact that I just watched something that was either really bad or only decent, when the show could have been so much more.Story: See, this disappointment mostly came from the story.

Bare? Ample? Frequent?If you answered yes to any or all of the above, Freezing is perfect for you!If not, weeeell, you're not going to have such a great time.I had to mention the boobs at the start because the one of the first thing you'll notice is how much fan-service there is in the show. There is not one single episode where a girl doesn't get her breasts out. Seriously. Not even one. They'll come out during fights after they take a hit on the chest, even if its a punch. I'm not sure how punching somebody makes their...clothes explode, but that's what happens. This, and the frequent panty-shots take you out from the experience. While they would be fine if they were littered about occasionally (gotta keep the viewership interested), the sheer volume of them is just too much, not to mention the timing. There will be numerous serious moments which will be broken because you can see a bunch of panties, or a girl has her boobs hanging out, and this just breaks the atmosphere.The show also throws in some shower scenes for no real reason other than to show off some more skin. And they even change a story sequence from the manga (which it's adapted from) so that they can show off some more boobs, and the intermissions/half-way points in episodes just display the profiles female characters, while showing them off in skimpy-ass clothing. Because, why not?The show has a pretty interesting premise (read the synopsis), though it can't exactly be called exactly original. I would therefore have scored this higher, except it doesn't even get onto dealing with the alien Nova until episode 9 (out of 12). That's 3 quarters already into the series. Until then, the Nova are only shown in a couple of flashbacks, and the show just deals with in-school drama, which is far less compelling compared to facing off against towering unknown invaders. Fortunately, when it finally does get to the characters encountering the Nova, Freezing really picks up the pace and it starts to really feel like its going somewhere. The action gets more intense and you finally start to take an interest.One small gripe about the show is how some important information is revealed by one character just talking to themselves in order to explain and reveal some plot details. While this does a fine job at explaining what's going on and providing a bit more backstory, it doesn't make much sense in terms of why the character is saying that to nobody.For the most part, the art is pretty good. The characters look good, although the main character's breasts just seemed a couple cup-sizes too large. And while the designs aren't unique or anything, they are well drawn. However, the art does suffer when compared to the manga, especially in the design of the 'Pandora Mode' that some characters can go into. In the manga, their outfit changes almost completely, and they have a more sci-fi/battle-suit look to them, but in the anime, the characters just have this white glow around them, without changing the way they look at all. This just seems lazy.The Nova look great. They look smooth and elegant, and appropriately alien, while also carrying this sense of power. However, their body parts don't move (although this is probably to create an atmosphere of strangeness around them) and they just hover about. The overall animation for the show is mostly smooth, with only a few occurrences when things look a bit choppy.The characters were a big weak point in the series for me, and there just weren't any mains who I liked. Kazuya is annoying and needy, Satellizer is just not likeable due to her personality and Arthur (really a side character later on) is one of the one sycophantic anime characters I have ever seen. I initially like Rana, until she turned out to be very petty. In fact, the only characters who I did like (or at least, not hate) only appeared a couple times throughout the series, and even then, only for a few minutes.Personally, I didn't like the music, but that's just my taste (I generally don't like anime music). I felt that the voice acting in Japanese was good, fitting for most of the characters, and I would have given the sound a higher rank, but then I watched the English dub. Many of the voices didn't fit their characters, and at times, the acting wasn't very good and were hard to take seriously. The English dub is pretty horrible. If you're going to watch it, watch it in Japanese.Overall, Freezing has pretty good art and animation, but wasn't as good as it's manga source, and an interesting, albeit unoriginal, premise. Unfortunately, the story just didn't get interesting until three quarters into series, and this was too late to completely salvage it. The characters were a weak point as they weren't very likable and while the Japanese language version is fine, the English dub suffers from poor voice-work. The show is brought down from a 6.5, to a 5 because of slow story, poor characters and the overload of fan-service, sometimes even breaking the atmosphere and seriousness of some situations.Story:5          Art:7         Sound:6         Character:4        Enjoyment:5Overall:5 clothes explode, but that's what happens.

But what I DIDN\'T notice is the teeny-weeny text at the start of each episode (I discovered this at episode two) so I went back and everything made sense. *AHEM*Freezing MAY not be for everyone but for me personally it was my first ""ecchi"" anime and I nearly fainted at the first scene showing breasts as I was watching it at work and didn\'t know what ecchi was at the time. That aside the story is essentially about finding...a partner, which I believe was well done BUT I could live without the confusion of everything leading up to the end. I had to rewatch a couple episodes and figure out what happened to lead up to the climax of this short series. The character development and how they interact with each other was the bread and butter of this show and you would be insane to not give credit to how well it was brought together. You start with a young woman who is extremely endowed with a HUGE detest of being touched and you slowly get to see who she really is with the help of her partner who she reluctantly chose at the last minute. The love triangle is there as well which I enjoyed, it added a few laughs and comic relief which I believe for a very intense anime such as this one neededOverall if you\'re into action-packed anime girls kicking ass and asking questions later this is the anime for you and TRUST ME, you will love it just as much as I did a partner, which I believe was well done BUT I could live without the confusion of everything leading up to the end.

I have not read the manga (as I am not a huge manga reader), but I quite enjoyed the anime counterpart. The characters were well developed, the storyline was well thought out, and the fight scenes... were good and bad. I liked the Pandora vs Pandora fighting, but then when they fought the Novas, it became a little boring and monotonous. (You kill them this one way, in this one process, every time, oh look people died, new skill!) One of my only drawbacks, (aside from some of the fights) was the art. It just seemed a little outdated,...in my opinion. But, otherwise, a very good anime! in my opinion. But, otherwise, a very good anime!', 'I loved this show because i thought it was enjoyable,funny,romantic and a lot of tits.i first saw freezing on youtube where there was ova episodes and they were short but i liked it-me gustaaaaaaa.i thought the whole show was gonna be like that as well which i would have loved but i thought the plot and story were as good.i loved the characters so much and i loved the relationship between satalliete and aoi kazuha.after i watched freezing first season i then watched freezing vibration which is the second season and i loved both of them and it also had a good ending which i...loved.10/10 for me.I hope they make a season 3 because its great loved.10/10 for me.I hope they make a season 3 because its great', 'Freezing is one of those shows where it had a lot of potential, to a certain extent, and it didn\'t use it as well as it could have. Then again, it\'s also one of those shows that would be better if it didn\'t use an excessive amount of nudity even during the most serious moments. (Looking at you HOTD)This review will be spoiler free.I do admit, the show was entertaining, though, and there were quite a few moments that stood out to me. I find that the romance was one of the best aspects, although there\'s an annoying love triangle involved. (Don\'t get me wrong,...love triangles are alright as long as they\'re not outright fighting over the main character and shoving themselves on top of him all the time.)Either way, I\'ll try to keep this review nice and simple.Story: 7The story is somewhat similar to shows like Attack on Titan, whereas it\'s a large group of Teens/Adults who are trained specifically to fight off a race of superior beings, defending the planet from it\'s demise. Despite this, there\'s actually only one real fight (Well, it\'s against four of the beings at once, so I suppose it\'s four fights) against said beings that they\'re defending Earth against. I give it a 7 because of this, and, due to the fact that they spent more time showing the teens fight each other instead of the creatures, the story wasn\'t really brought out until the last few episodes. It was somewhat explained in the beginning, but it really all comes out in the end. I just found it ridiculous that the students were killing off each other instead of, you know, the giant alien race that\'s trying to destroy the planet.Art: 8The animation is a bit above average. Intense and fairly well animated fight scenes, good amounts of blood and gore, and of course... boobs. Though, when it comes to the boobs, I say they\'re overdoing it. Now you may ask; ""How can you overdo boobs? They\'re BOOBS."" Well, when the show is trying to be serious, like for example, a sad and emotional death, but a large pair of melons is covering the screen (I say this because whenever the girls fought each other, literally the first part to rip off their clothes was their chest, and their boobs would hang out, nipples and all, throughout each fight.) it\'s hard to take it seriously. Other than that, the character designs are... interesting, I suppose, and overall animation is great, again, above average.Sound: 10I give the sound a 10 because of this show\'s outstanding soundtrack. Seriously, the soundtrack is just marvelous and made each and every scene better than it actually was. Nice, sad and atmospheric piano tracks during emotional scenes or intense and fast paced full out orchestras during fight scenes. I myself and looking somewhere to get the soundtrack, because it\'s very well composed.Characters: 6The characters were alright. Some typical and annoying characters, such as the proud and arrogant school girl who\'s rich and calls herself a princess, (including the annoying laugh they do.) and a sort of bland main character in which all he really wants is to protect the ones he cares about. Pardon my French, but most of the girls are this school are straight out bitches. Seriously. I wanted to slap almost every single one in the damned face. All they wanted was to beat up the main characters, to the point of near death, and laugh in their face. They wouldn\'t leave them alone and it was aggravating. My favorite character, honestly, was the main love interest; Satellizer L. Bridget. At first glance, she seems to be the typical ""Most powerful girl in the school, who is a bitch and tells the character to leave her alone"", somewhere along those lines. This is actually wrong. She\'s strong, and tends to not talk to anyone, but when the main character, Kazuya is near, the she becomes girly, shy and flat out adorable. Especially with those glasses. Unf.Enjoyment: 8Overall it was a fun series to watch. Great action scenes, amazing soundtrack, adorable main love interest and fairly good stand out emotional scenes. The story is average, but enjoyable when it finally reaches it\'s climax. Apparently it doesn\'t finish until season 2, which I haven\'t seen yet, and I\'ve seen that season 2 isn\'t even better. But, I\'ll judge that for when I see it.Anyway, I recommend this for anyone who likes see boobs and butts during intense fight scenes and even emotional ones. Basically if you like shows like Highschool of the Dead for the boobs and action then this show is for you. love triangles are alright as long as they\'re not outright fighting over the main character and shoving themselves on top of him all the time.)Either way, I\'ll try to keep this review nice and simple.Story: 7The story is somewhat similar to shows like Attack on Titan, whereas it\'s a large group of Teens/Adults who are trained specifically to fight off a race of superior beings, defending the planet from it\'s demise.

It IS SOO RARE THAT YOU FIND A BLOODY, GORY, SEXY, FIGHTING ANIME that doesn\'t take place in a stupid high school. Technically it\'s a ""battle academy"" and they are trained as elite warriors, but unfortunately they still have the lame overused school uniforms (I have no idea why japan is so obsessed with making anime related about school/dress code)When you first start watching this anime, the first thing you\'ll keep finding yourself saying is ""Kick his Ass, Kick his ass!"" This regarding the annoying little kid following...the dangerous heroin around abruptly grabbing her when they first meet. But for some reason she doesn\'t do it!I had to put that in before I told you guys about the pros and cons about this series lol!Pros:*Awesome fighting*blood/semi gore*Sexy Echi*Not in a high school/middle school setting*When fighting, armor/clothes get torn*Good character development*Sci-fi not involving mechs*Good graphics*Good musicCons:*Semi school girl outfits*At times Echi goes a little too far*Could use more gore*Needs more seasons!!! the dangerous heroin around abruptly grabbing her when they first meet.

Vulgar, Unacceptable, Talentless, Waste of my time.COURT ADJOURNED."", ""I honestly have mixed feelings about this anime. The nerdy part of me, who loves action-packed animes with constant blood and gore, whole heartedly enjoyed this anime. The romantic/over-analytical part of me, could not be more annoyed with certain aspects of this anime that seemed to disgust me.Let's start with the nerdy side. The action was good. Very good in fact. There was a lot of gore and blood, as well as some ridiculous moves and action sequences I couldn't even possibly imagine. It was very well done, and the plot was definitely interesting and unique. However, I will say that there wasn't as much...action as I predicted, and some of the battles were all hyped up and somewhat of a letdown. But still, nonetheless, enjoyable.The analytical romantic part of me, hated many parts of this anime. If you don't like boobs, naked anime women, a few scenes that could be even considered soft core hentai, then you will not enjoy this anime. It seems every chance the anime gets, there are naked boobs, as though it's just to keep the attention of the 12 year old boys (no offense). But if you're like me, and can handle the ridiculous amount of unenessary nudity because the action mostly makes up for it, then you should still like it. Though, this anime is meant to create a second season, and once again, the huge hype of the ending battle was just a huge disappointment, and there's a good chance that all of these negative factors add up to an anime that you may not want to watch. And as for me always enjoying the romantic parts of animes, this one drove me insane. In the end, I wanted to punch all of the main characters for their ignorance.To conclude, it was a solid anime. A lot of moments I absolutely loved, other moments not so much. I'm interested to see where the second season goes. This anime could be your friend, or your enemy, it just depends on personal preference. action as I predicted, and some of the battles were all hyped up and somewhat of a letdown.

"", 'So, finally, I was worried for a moment there, got all the way to ep.11 and then no ep.12, but fortunately after a couple weeks ep.12 was there, so now that it\'s complete I can give my take, ok nothing really out of the ordinary plot-wise, aliens from another dimension invade in order to destroy humanity, old hat as far as anime plots go, but what\'s new and exciting is the Pandora concept, a school for warrior girls and their male assistants, "" Limiters"", very cool, so you have a school-age drama set on the backdrop of fighting evil aliens bent on human destruction, I...very much liked the way the girl rivalries were brutally played out in act of combat, *and I warn you, it gets pretty violent at times, there\'s no holding back on blood, maybe not as extreme as Elfen Lied or Afro Samurai, but rough enough, not for the squeamish, and ironically, the fiercest battles are between the girls themselves, the action and pace are pretty good and the actors are excellent in giving the characters life and making the audience care about them, actually my only criticism is that there\'s a little too much ""ecchi"", don\'t get me wrong, I\'m a guy, and yes I do watch ""hentai"", but sometimes I think that ecchi is over done in modern day anime, it\'s ok to throw it in now and again during a story, just like you would a little comic relief, so as to temper the action, but in Freezing there\'s a panty and boob shot for every couple of frames, even when the girls are trying to cut each other to shreds, a little over done I\'d say; otherwise an excellent series with lots of action and drama, the animation is 1st class, and as I said before the acting is excellent, so I major recommend for RONin very much liked the way the girl rivalries were brutally played out in act of combat, *and I warn you, it gets pretty violent at times, there\'s no holding back on blood, maybe not as extreme as Elfen Lied or Afro Samurai, but rough enough, not for the squeamish, and ironically, the fiercest battles are between the girls themselves, the action and pace are pretty good and the actors are excellent in giving the characters life and making the audience care about them, actually my only criticism is that there\'s a little too much ""ecchi"", don\'t get me wrong, I\'m a guy, and yes I do watch ""hentai"", but sometimes I think that ecchi is over done in modern day anime, it\'s ok to throw it in now and again during a story, just like you would a little comic relief, so as to temper the action, but in Freezing there\'s a panty and boob shot for every couple of frames, even when the girls are trying to cut each other to shreds, a little over done I\'d say; otherwise an excellent series with lots of action and drama, the animation is 1st class, and as I said before the acting is excellent, so I major recommend for RONin', 'Im honet I really like this anime because has many SCI FI and is not a common anime...Is a good story and has many characters with many differents personalities.But I think that has many characteristic of Neon Genesis Evangelion, in the 10th chapter show a corpose.... like Lilith in NGE.... pretty similar.The main building of the school is divided in sectors... like Centrla Dogma.And enemys (Novas)... are like the ""angels"".I think that they decided use the succesful concept of evangelion....In conclusion good anime.Thanks In conclusion good anime.Thanks', 'i enjoyed watching these first four episodes, they have been great and very fast paceStory- it is ranked at a good 8 that seems correct because so far all i have seen is the story begin to build up. In each episode it seems something new is revealed in this story that makes it all the more exciting such as the powers each character has.Art- The art is very good it seems like they put a lot of effort in for the art and it seems very well done.Sound- The music is good each part fits well and the opening and closing theme music is...good and really gets you going.Character- The characters each have a background story and each small background story ties into the main character\'s background story.Enjoyment- i seem to enjoy this anime and it is well worth the time to watch, butalso be warned that it has blood, gore and violence along with other ecchi elements that makes it a good balanceOverall- it is a great anime and has that ""boy with powers saves girl"" thing going while it also gives a twist and doesnt not make one lose interest good and really gets you going.Character- The characters each have a background story and each small background story ties into the main character\'s background story.Enjoyment- i seem to enjoy this anime and it is well worth the time to watch, butalso be warned that it has blood, gore and violence along with other ecchi elements that makes it a good balanceOverall- it is a great anime and has that ""boy with powers saves girl"" thing going while it also gives a twist and doesnt not make one lose interest', 'Okay so this show is pretty bad. It\'s not the worst anime that I have ever seen but its still pretty lame. On a positive note it has good art and music not to mention there are a lot of fight scenes. On a negative note I\'m on episode 9 and I\'m not seeing where this anime is going. There are aliens called Nova but none have actually appeared except in flash backs. So far it has just been the ""good guys"", Pandoras fighting each other every episode. And there is Kazuya who is a puny little boy who is a very powerful limiter who...is obsessed with a powerful pandora named Bridget ""The Untouchable Queen"". Bridget goes on a rampage when ever someone touches her and practically kills them. Except for Kazuya for some reason who accidentally ""motor-boats"" her the first time he meets her in the first episode . Bridget is cold, antisocial, and over all not a pleasant person to be around but Kazuya loves her for no other reason than that she looks like his dead sister from behind? Also the whole motor-boatting incident maybe. Did I mention there are a lot of fight scenes? Well there is about double that number in ecchi scenes. There is a lot of full frontal nudity. Usually showing breasts and nipples. In fact most of the fight scenes are ecchi. It appears all Pandora weapons seem to have the uncanny ability to tear off women\'s clothes and expose their breasts. Every fight scene in every episode eventually leads to all the pandora battling with bare breasts, almost completely naked. It\'s like a lame hentai but without sex, genitals, or octopus tentacles. Though I am interested to see when a Nova does finally appear whether or not the Pandora weapons will have much the same effect on them. Nova monster titties. LOL. Another thing I don\'t like about this anime is every episode Bridget is getting in a fight with another ""bad"" pandora or three instead of sticking with one antagonist a couple of episodes she is fighting a new ""bad"" pandora each episode. Anyways. If you like chicks fighting and lots and lots and lots. and LOTS of breasts. This is your anime.

Looking forward to reviewing Freezing Vibrations.', ""Freezing...a manga that brings up being controversy and mostly shaking heads to anime fans as the amount of fanservicei you will find her, is quite frankly ridicoulous , despite it being an actually good story - if you leave all of the fanservice aside.Hello and Welcome, my name is Ryoki and welcome to my Review of Freezing.First of all lets talk about the setting and story in general ( may contain spoiler so scroll down if you dont want to read this)Freezing is set in a post-apocalyptic world where supernatural beings called the ,,Nova'' reign terror in the lands of humanity.  Nova are...somewhat like aliens, this  at least is what the anime says. You then immediately see a jump backward so the Pandora can be explained. The Pandora are, you could have guessed, Humanitys answer to the Nova.Basically by giving them fragments of a nova body, they are able to become a weapon against the nova, like in the good old tale ,, lets beat fire with fire.'' These women are having male companions which they call a Limiter,  in which also Nova fragment have been implanted, granting the ability to create a forcefield which immediately immobilises the target - that is what they call ,,Freezing.''.The story focuses on a certain pair or on as a primary point on Satelizzer ,,the Untouchable queen.'' given the name by the fact that no one on the whole campus dares to fight or touch her. Until then the faithful day when the brother of the last pandora heroine comes to the facility. Aoi Kazuya, which still doesnt know anything what is happening on said schoolground until he comes inbetween a fight in which Satelizzer and a second student clash, he mistakens Satelizer for his sister and then holds her back from fighting , making her loose though by the attack of her enemy. He feels bad afterwards, and wants to apologize to Satelizer, even after being warned by the class president Chiffon. And even when being taken into a fight and then even facing a real third year pandora , he doesnt want to leave her side and then eventually becomes her Limiter.Satelizer on her own is a bit a damaged character , damaged in the way of that she hides her insecureness. She had a very cruel childhood and had to sustain many things and thus searched the resolve to fight on while trying to never loose a fight.Kazuya on the other Hand is like the mirror to her , they resemble a very good pair together. Kazuya on his own is a justice-loving character as naturally after his sisters death he wants to make him self useful and join West Genetics.Art, i dont really know what to say at this point, the animation on itself is not bad but also not fantastic, what im personally disappointed is at the design choices that the makers took , instead of choosing the way that the manga took. A big example of that is the Pandora Mode, in the manga, you have real suits in which they look final fantasy  styled and really cool.

Themes are supposed to catch your attention and make you pumped up for what is about to come but those from freezing arent really gripping - not for me at least. Neither the opening or ending are really that epic - which should have been necessary for an apocalyptic anime.Even so , at the end of this review - i'd like to recommend to try this anime at least - at least one episode to see how it goes. I have calculated the overall score depending on my ratings for story, art, sound & and character and naturally also my enjoyment and have given Freezing a solid 6.6 - which would be 7.I hope this review could help you with your choice if you want or do not want to give this anime a try.

I simply cannot bear to watch yet another anime that forces a stupid love triangle into the mix for absolutely no reason. And the fan service was getting obnoxious to boot.Having recently watched Cross Ange, seeing fan service isn\'t out of place for me, but the way Freezing does it, is just obnoxious. Literally every other camera angle is a panty shot,...and every single fight starts off with all girls having their tops slashed off or ripped off, so that their tits go falling out. And every other scene is a girl naked in the shower having some deep philosophical moment with themselves.It\'s the absolute worst type of fan service. Even raw hentai makes it more subtle. And it\'s more than distracting when combat with hefty gore, flying bodyparts and such, gets constantly interrupted by panty shots and tits. It\'s dumb.The main characters are also UTTERLY intolerable. The female lead is 50% badass and 50% a 12 year old girl discovering for the first time in her life that boys exist. No, she\'s not 12, but she acts like it. Which is annoying. The male lead is your average ""I know nothing about nothing, except this pretty girl I\'m attracted to, so now I\'m gonna stake my life on protecting her for no particular reason other than I have literally nothing else in my life and have no other personality to fall back on.""And don\'t start me on a random addition to the cast, some girl that just shows up halfway through the season only to immediately choose to become a third wheel in the MC\'s barely blossoming mutual interest. Absolutely disgusting storytelling that is the bane of every other romance these days. Main characters go their entire lives without even meeting anyone they like, but in the scope of a few episodes the story needs them all to develop multiple deeply in love, love interests? Nonsense. Get out of here with that crap.The story seems interesting and the visuals are enjoyable. But I cannot tolerate another minute of these teenage failures that are supposed to be protagonists, nor those endless panty shots with those double G cup tits flying all over the place non stop.Also why is so much of the content in every episode about the girls bullying each other non-stop? ""Last hope of humankind in fighting off the evil invaders"", and the ones in charge of the fighting are just fighting each-other to the point of gladly going for kills. Another show that tries to portray that teenage girls are literal psychopaths who would cut off the heads of their classmates for no reason other than petty jealousy and social hierarchy.Watch this stuff only if you\'re a sucker for fan service and forced, awkward teenage romance, because as fun as the combat and story is, that romance and fan service is hard to overlook. and every single fight starts off with all girls having their tops slashed off or ripped off, so that their tits go falling out.

""Last hope of humankind in fighting off the evil invaders"", and the ones in charge of the fighting are just fighting each-other to the point of gladly going for kills. Another show that tries to portray that teenage girls are literal psychopaths who would cut off the heads of their classmates for no reason other than petty jealousy and social hierarchy.Watch this stuff only if you\'re a sucker for fan service and forced, awkward teenage romance, because as fun as the combat and story is, that romance and fan service is hard to overlook.', 'This anime really was enjoyable. The story line had depth and had the whole ""transfer student surrounded by new people"" and before anyone knew it, he had an extraordinary power. And to add even more excitement, he jumps a girl who hates to be touched by anyone!The art was pretty good and well drawn. I\'ve seen better in more recent anime but the art in Freezing defiantly had no room for concern.The sound was good, no badly made sounds like in some anime and the intro and outro songs were pretty decent although I have a habit of skipping past them.The characters were good. They...all had their own personalities but after about 4 episodes you could predict how they would act to most situations that they were placed in.I really really enjoyed this anime. My heart was racing during every scene of it. It had a perfect blend of ecchi, romance, action and comedy in every single episodes and for those more into ecchi; I guarantee boobs and pantyflashes in every episode.Overall this anime was extremely well thought out and prtrayed as a very touching but action filled story. all had their own personalities but after about 4 episodes you could predict how they would act to most situations that they were placed in.I really really enjoyed this anime.

Well, actually it is. A look-like high school, ecchi (or maybe full of service: I mean, you know… FAN-one), girls with weapons, girls, girls, few men, girls, wome… anyhow! Semi-default harem setup, as men do exists, but they’re either ignored, killed, or looked down. Do not expect comedy from Freezing, regardless of this harem setting. It is a really good serious anime; you just have to look for its serious points.Freezing’s about future and it happens on Earth. We have this military high-school-like made to train its students to destroy an earth-invader race called “Nova”. Well,...actually, Nova’s have nothing to do with it, as the author focus on character development of a Sattelizer L. Bridget and its relationship with Aoi Kazuya (our hero here), and OMG wow fights.Story 7Freezing’s story has one or two positive points on it, but that's not the reason people should watch it. No complex square, pentagon relationship, and no girls-fall-from-the-sky (for the love of God, thanks) setting. Despite that, it has cliché and bad points.It is an 80% cliché made scenario.A default school, default girls, default service, default giant-not-so-realistic boobs (that's not the point, I know: I mean, anime has nothing to do with reality some times, right?), default environment. Nothing really breathtaking to notice. It is just one more futuristic Sci-Fi anime in the anindustry, though there’s no Mecha here. I guess the author did something original here, since Gundam series drowned all the possibilities of doing similar stories with mechanical parts and sick energy generators on it. First, school. I need to ask myself, why school? Maybe because they torn all other-than-school-clothes and then made people there use school uniforms? Nova’s are school otaku and find hard to invade an Earth that has lots of girls in uniforms? Because creativity is lost? Anyhow, school sucks in this plot because the uniforms: they have so much beautiful female characters and make all of them use the same piece of already-torn-clothe! Girls? They are (excluding some girls) not developed at all, and all we know is her name, weapon and breast size. The environment’s just boring: no new places, no good landscapes, no fine cozy rooms (which would fit some parts at this point).Although it’s remaining 20% make seeing it worth. Romance 9Well! What you have really here, is the development of a relationship between our two heroes, one male, Kazuya, and one female, Sattelizer. Of course, there are others, but they’re not as heart-warming, out of expectations, neat, and screen-timed. Sattelizer inside weak tsundere personality is fulfilled with Kazuya’s determined mind, and that is worth your time. She had a hard time in the past, and Kazuya is willing to be on her side: but she does not show her true self to anyone, but the newcomer Kazuya. She is just brave and cool, trying to open herself to this unknown guy who hugs her strongly and sticks his face on her breasts (annoying, but nevermind).They do give us lots and lots of turnabouts, which makes you dig deeper and deeper into the plot. Eventually, you find yourself hoping they have a good time together, and it all ends well.OMG Battles make up with the rest. 10^2Battles are just wow. They don’t recycle a single screen, and that makes my life feels lighter. They are well drawn, well fought. Characters just don’t seem to waste movements (although they seem to waste lots of clothes), and either chat a lot when fighting: for that, when they chat, there’s a real reason to stop fighting or something similar. Animation is great and pleasing when I see anime like that. To be able to balance impotence (when they’re not even able to touch it’s enemy getting pretty worn out and hurt), with a strong resolve (when they are able to surpass all the pain and past, in order to protect the loved one). This way, the story climax and climax all over again: over despair, bravery, perseverance, hate, and love, it won’t disappoint you.But, as you can see: service can (but it doesn’t) spoil the idea of serious anime (*1)A little note: regarding the forced ecchi: you see, there’s LOTS of forced fan-services scenes. Although when they’re shown there’s no escaping, you can notice they focus on it only in the “IT-IS-GOING-TO-RIP=SEEME!!!” and “you know, bath and getting changed” period. Somehow, I feel they’re ignored when they don’t have a significant meaning to the plot. Like leaves falling: they fall, and everyone’s aware of that, but people don’t worry about it usually. I prefer seeing it as an ornament: it makes those scenes less idiotic. At least, it is not forced as Sekirei, HOTD, or Ikkitousen. Regardless the fan-forced-service and clothe wasting issue, I think there’s no more comments on that.Art 7I don't see anything that does stand out in the matter of art in this anime. One thing good to point is that it makes the job done. Characters have the right expression on the right time: annoyed, happy, gloomy, weak, painful, hatred expressions are shown when they need to be, a really good point. It makes some climaxes better, and some serious conversation parts even more serious. Those expressions are not comical though. The plot does not leave so much space to the comedy super deformed heads, which seems to be fair enough, because I find it really hard to find a serious recent anime with no comedy (at all, if I recall correctly) SD shots. Yeah, pantsu and breasts are well done, but this is normally the thing it is.Sound 1/9 (1 for the op/ed, and 9 for the bgm)It has some good features on it, but no tear-shredder music, no. Besides, I wasn't expecting too much after hearing the opening and ending, It wasn't that picky. Well, opening seems off its place, since this is not a love comedy eating burguers, it is a battle anime, come on! Ending’s just the sound of water to fill the “I-like-fanserv-chicks-time!”.Even though, I was able to be pleased with the (anime minus op minus ed) sounds and effects. They do have the right bgm for the right moment. At least it didn't seemed as off-place as the op/ed. They did chose the right bgm for battles, and that makes battles even more thrilling, making yourself really excited when they start – the music & the battle. Accel bullet-like effect sound’s just too overwhelming to comment. Every explosion is right-timed, and footsteps are according to the screen. If default, a really good default soundwork. And if perfect, I wouldn't say that much.Characters 6/10 (6for support and 10 for main)Well, till episode 11 of the anime, I know the name of 2 male characters. Seems like they don’t have the impact what it takes to be remembered. Aside 2 of them, the others are just Freezing capable machines. Female characters have their own weapon, sick skills, and blood all over the place! Women are just cooler and easier to remember. Chiffon Fairchild, Cathy Lockharte, Sattelizer L. Bridget, Ganessa Rolland, Ingrid Vernstein! COOL! Anyhow, they do not develop as much as they should. For example, take Rana: she’s more than what the screen shows, but it she wasn’t developed at all.On the other hand, main characters are just too well developed: they have reasons to smile, to cry, to battle, to be sad and to to be happy. The author made a good job while triggering Sattelizer events. Sometimes it is relaxing, seeing how can love be so simple and pure, and sometimes is just not romantic and idealistic that sounds banal. Mainly very pure and childish, maybe that way makes us feel like falling in love for the first time. Sweet!Enjoyment 10YES, freezing has a highly enjoyment payload if you like either romance or a tsundere relation. I mainly see it because of the breathtaking turnaround battles making your heart beats faster, and Accel. Otherwise, it will be just a boring with a forced fanservice anime.ConclusionI’m certain that you’re going to like seeing this anime. Well, in its beginning, it really may suck, but as the history develops, you find it very pleasant to get excited with upcoming battles, lame opening, light, very light romance, and a beautiful blonde tsundere.Although these separate parts (story, art, sound, character and enjoyment) suck, alltogether deserves 9! actually, Nova’s have nothing to do with it, as the author focus on character development of a Sattelizer L.

So ill try to keep this as short as i can.Story 7/10:  Overall I think they do a good job of mixing the story and backgrounds of characters in with the fight scenes and the flashbacks very rarely bore me. However, they do have some instances where they could have gotten across the same idea in half the time, and that bugs me. The storyline does match the Manga fairly closely so far, with only small things being switched out/in but everything else remaining the...same.Art 8/10: Everything looks very good to me visually, I can't spot any crappy artwork or strange movements in the characters for the most part. I also think that the artists did a good job of showing 2 sides (Cute and Shy and Badass) to Satellizer L. Bridget in how they portrayed her. The only reason I gave this score an 8 instead of a 9 was because every once in a while I might see a face that just looks weird to me (this has only happened 2x in 7 episodes for less than 5 seconds)Sound 9/10: The sound really makes you enjoy the fight scenes and magnifies the experience quite well. The opening and closing songs aren't bad or weird in any way. Unless you try hard to focus on some inner meaning (which there isn't one really).Characters 7/10: With the exception of the main characters Aoi Kazuya and Satellizer, not many characters get fleshed out and have much depth so far.

Lackluster ""plot"", characters and devices.You don\'t have to read the manga for this one(I sure as hell didn\'t). There\'s nothing complex about the terminology or the correlation between characters and plot devices. It\'s everything you\'ve seen and heard before from any EVA clone: Aliens appear.

But it wasn't long that I was proven utterly wrong.Story:Freezing takes place about a hundred years into the future where extra-dimensional alien beings called Nova mysteriously appear out of nowhere and wreak havoc upon the Earth. Mankind's sole defense against these monsters are Pandoras-superhuman girls who fight the Nova and their Limiters-boys with special support abilities.The story may seem simple at first but its very unique...and interesting, not to mention scientific and intriguing. It has been a while since some nascent scientific concept have been introduced in an ecchi anime. And surprisingly, the story gets gradually more and more appealing, gripping and spectacular. The past of many of the characters are revealed as we go along the story.Art:The art is just mind-blowing! The girls, much like any other ecchi series are beautiful, stunning, gorgeous and voluptuous. The fight scenes are all very well drawn and their actions and movements are fluid-like and smooth.Sound:The soundtrack, although short is acceptable and is done by Color. The music does well to complement the tense moments and fights and really makes you sit on edge.Characters:Although character development is not much, the characters themselves are very interesting and quite a handful, if I might say. However, more character development should've been there but there are only 12 episodes, so you have to cut them some slack.Enjoyment:It's a bit bland at first but as the story gets going, it really does the anime justice and it's very enjoyable.

I first began watching Naruto with my brother which he got from his friend. After binge watching Naruto in three weeks I began to crave more anime and thus my brother's good friend introduced me to the wide world of anime.I took 3 anime after Naruto namely Z/X ignition ,Highschool DXD and Freezing including the second season Freezing Vibration. Once again I am a binge watcher ,if I like an anime i will watch it until it is finished.As most of you know Highschool DXD and Freezing are both...ecchi anime. A lot of people dislike ecchi and harem anime but I really like these genres.First I will get the obvious out of the way. Yes there is a lot of fan service and perverted scenes including during the fights and yes this is what made me interested in the anime at first but after finishing the first three episodes I began watching it for different reasons.I mainly enjoyed the anime because of the main female character Satellizer. After being introduced I instantly realized that something must have happened in her past to make her react the way she did to people. She distend herself from everyone and she was feared by everyone but i just couldn't understand why. After later finding out more about her past I just felt sad for Satellizer and finally understood why she distend herself from everyone.The opening song 'COLOR' by maria was just damn amazing for me. I did not once skip that song. It is a pretty relaxing song and matched perfectly with the opening scene. After watching a lot more anime i realized that there was nothing that special about the art style in Freezing but I still just love how it looked when they used their powers.Freezing just put a smile on my face after watching each episode and left a huge gaping hole inside of me after binge watching it in a day. The story was good enough to keep me interested after each episode but the mystery of Satellizer's past was what kept me really interested. Her story is made more clear after each episode. The romance plot between her and Kazuya was very enjoyable as well.I like anime with a touch of gore and violence and Freezing quenched my thirst for this. Fighting scenes had nudity in with a touch of blood and decapitation of limbs here and there.Overall Freezing was initially one of the anime that made me love anime more and more and will always remain one of my favourite anime of all time. ecchi anime.

Never read the manga which i heard was better but since i haven't read it im going straight off of what i watched in the anime.Story-  It had all the genres that it was given down to a pact it had alot of fighting(action), Drama during alot of the fight scenes it had the ecchi i didnt really think it needed it but it doesn't ruin or cause any problems in the story  it had romance between the main characters but since its not solely that genre its not as prevalent as you would want...to had the sci-fi factor within the weapons and the characters abilities etc its a harem also is a seinen so it caters to older guys but whatever. OG(original) story but uses the theme of many other anime when it comes to the enemies and what not being random and come out of nowhere and just cause destruction the story was very good but in the harem portion its very generic typical fan service so big breast attractive essentially attracted to the young guy who does something bold and they randomly are into him this is nor sexual or from the use of words but like every harem the girls eventually want him... All i can say is the fan-service doesn't really distract you but sometimes you don't really want it there but the  fighting is what will really keep you interested so all in all a good story few cliche things and few flaws but good.Art- well done although it isn't the most beautiful top of the line when it comes to the visuals but Great visuals during the fight scenes The blood and gore factor is in the middle nothing super crazy which is great because its not something that will make you just not pay attention. its good dont really have anything bad to say about it.

For a harem its aight.Enjoyment- It was quite enjoyable to say the least a lot of the episodes will keep you super tuned in and wondering is there gonna be a final enemy and what not the story is honestly what will make you enjoy it and the music in the fighting scenes if it didn't have those it would be kinda average but it is a good anime.overall- 8/10 just something good to watch not crazy good but just a good anime it also has a second season so you should watch that as well if you enjoy watching the first season. to had the sci-fi factor within the weapons and the characters abilities etc its a harem also is a seinen so it caters to older guys but whatever. OG(original) story but uses the theme of many other anime when it comes to the enemies and what not being random and come out of nowhere and just cause destruction the story was very good but in the harem portion its very generic typical fan service so big breast attractive essentially attracted to the young guy who does something bold and they randomly are into him this is nor sexual or from the use of words but like every harem the girls eventually want him... All i can say is the fan-service doesn't really distract you but sometimes you don't really want it there but the  fighting is what will really keep you interested so all in all a good story few cliche things and few flaws but good.Art- well done although it isn't the most beautiful top of the line when it comes to the visuals but Great visuals during the fight scenes The blood and gore factor is in the middle nothing super crazy which is great because its not something that will make you just not pay attention. its good dont really have anything bad to say about it.

Let me tell you something. There isn\'t a single moment boobs are present without being accompanied by action or emotional character thought/development. Therefore, no sacrifices are made to squeeze in fanservice like other series tend to do. That aside, the story here is a really solid one. The problem is the students spend a ton of time fighting amongst themselves rather than directing their power to the true enemy. Because of this I found myself feeling like I couldn\'t really root for the ""good guys"" due to them all being...incredibly ignorant assholes. But they aren\'t just assholes. They are really savage about it and fuck each other up pretty bad. This really made the story suffer.If it weren\'t for the storyline flaw, this anime would be supreme.

Season 2 (Freezing Vibration) puts it to shame.This show really does start off awkward. The sheer amount of exposition in Episode 1 is staggering. The delivery is typical teacher giving a lesson, but it\'s less natural than others shows have done. Within the first four episodes and the majority of the first, there\'s a moment of supreme social embarrassment every 5 minutes. I have never seen a show that makes me cringe so much as this one has. If all you want is Ecchi, I feel like DXD or HotD would...be better choices. They have better action, Ecchi that isn\'t as much in your face ""Here it is! The Ecchi!"", and fewer moments that make you feel insufferable embarrassment for the MC. And if you like good action, those others are a far better choice as the action is much more varied.Aside from episodes 1-4 being near-insufferable, ep 5 was actually really good. By episode 7, the show takes off and gets progressively better, though it sticks tightly to cliches and plot conveniences. The MCs wear thick plot armor in this show. I\'d rate the last eight episodes at around a 7, and the first four at a 2 or 3.I gave season 2, Freezing Vibration, an 8. I\'m not very big on Ecchi, but I gave DXD and HotD both a 7, in comparison.

For example, it has lots of fast-paced battle scenes (good), but because it shows fights all the time it leaves very little room for character development (not so good).Further, the fighting does not need to take so much screen time. This show pauses in way too many places for expository dialogue. For every few seconds of a fight, the action will stop for a moment so a couple of lines of dialogue can tell you exactly what you\'re seeing. It\'s kind of stupid, since half the...time you\'ll be thinking ""what show do you think I\'ve been watching up to now?""

Freezing is not hesitating to reveal beautifully shaped cleavages while the next time blood is spilled during combat.When it comes to characters, Bridgette has a rich personality. On the outside she is The Untouchable Queen, a mighty Pandora that rarely loses, merciless, relentless, cold and distant. But on the inside, she's a woman with a troubled and abusive past that simple seeks compassion and, most possibly, love.

I just love that merry-go-happy style combined with an awesome body and a cute face.The soudntrack starts enjoyably and nicely, but as the story progresses it becomes kinda dull and repetitive. The sounds effects however are spot on. The sounds of steel clashing with steel, the explosions, the creepy Nova voice, the sound of flesh as it gets torn apart add depth and realism to every battle or scene.You will definitely enjoy this one.

So that's why I'm writing this.Story - 9Whilst watching a lot of anime what you have to bear in mind is that there is usually some sort of material that it is being adapted from. Freezing, the anime, has only part of a story. And that part is awesome. The story has many parts to it that will intrigue you, if you're the sort of person who likes to know everything there is to know about what...you're watching. Throughout there  are undertones that something else is going on behind the scenes and if you pick up on it it makes for a headscratcher. The actual plot is more or less stubborn guy meets strong but fragile girl and his relationship with her in a world where everybody seems to be out to get them for one reason or another. But, like I said, it has a very nice and mysterious undercurrent to it.Art - 8Yes, I enjoyed the art of Freezing, sue me for liking bouncing boobs. Two aspects of the art I particularly enjoyed were the NOVA and the 'evil' looks of Satellizer. Both were pretty impressive.Sound - 9It's rare I enjoy a soundtrack so much. The intro is one I'll actually sit there and listen to and the battle between East and the NOVA....... wow the soundtrack gave me chills.Characters - 8The characters were kind of... meh ranging from a guy with some obvious unresolved issues with his sister, a girl who hates to be touched to the point where people dont even like getting close enough to talk to her and someone rather worryingly nicknamed 'Intoxicating Bondage.' Of the main cast, only Chiffon Fairchild is truly memorable and that, for me, is purely because her eyes are actually shut and not just drawn that way. How she goes through the whole series without opening her eyes is beyond me. For almost solely that reason I'm saying 8.Enjoyment - 9I definitely enjoyed this, so much so, it's one anime I actually bought.Overall - 9Blood, boobs, a school where older girls are required to 'please' their juniors, intrigue, mystery, some kickass fighting sequences, the occasional comedic moment and some nice character development I didn't mention above.

Many fights, many battles, but obviously they are going to hold big events to the end as usual for any type of anime or movie at that. But there is at least I believe 3 battles during each episode which makes the anime worth watching. The battles are pretty cool with all the different types of stuff that they have and it fits well with the plot of the story.This is a fantasy since they are fighting these alien things and they are using weapons that they otherwise would not have. It  is very entertaining (being serious).Overall this anime is really good which is why I have given it a 10 and has been added to my all time favorite list.

Because the Wapanese animu industry is by and for spineless herbivores.Then there are shows like Freezing; a fan-servicy show with an otherwise gruesome story to tell. And the people behind it try not to harm the male lead(s) as badly. But oh well.You have Satelizer; that scary ""invincible ice queen."" Nearly everybody tries to bring her down a peg... ...unsuccessfully.  But all it took to defrost said ice queen is a young guy, one Kazuya Aoi, whose...sister ""gave her life to save the world.""The question I need to ask: Why is there little-to-no hentai doujins based on this animu whilst TONS AND TONS of such doujins are made based on misandrous bullcrap like Infinite Stratos and Ore no Imouto? And ""be a pussy, get the pussy""? What The Hell? sister ""gave her life to save the world.""The question I need to ask: Why is there little-to-no hentai doujins based on this animu whilst TONS AND TONS of such doujins are made based on misandrous bullcrap like Infinite Stratos and Ore no Imouto? And ""be a pussy, get the pussy""? What The Hell?', 'I will NOT stand for this! All these negative reviews, and not one justifying fact to them! Lets start from the beginning. I just finished Highschool DxD (Another great BTW) and was paging through my book marks. I see so many interesting animes and have friends recommending them to me that normally I just bookmark the anime for a later time. I actually found freezing by accident, a mis-click. Now, I read the synopsis and thought it would be interesting. So I started the first episode. *Sigh* why did I open Pandora\'s Box? This anime was written SO well that it actually felt...I can\'t even...grasp how it made me feel. Later on, it made me feel sad and ripped my soul to shreds like the uniforms in this show, but moving on. Now, yes I\'m a guy, this has what you\'d call a lot of ""Battle Porn"" or clothing destruction. But that is what hentai is for so I just rolled with it. Come on! Swords, whips, quarter staffs, your going to lose some clothing! It\'s realistic (And hot but that\'s my perv side talking). But if you look deep into the anime and start peeling through the layers (No pun intended), there is a deep anime here. One that has such an emotional tie to it that you will feel it (I sobbed, OKAY! You happy?! The 265lb football player grew a heart for this anime). The story I can\'t talk about due to the annoying bullets on the right hand side of my screen. But you\'ll feel it all fold together.The characters, on the other hand, is what I fell in love with. But, that was Pandora\'s Box. The Trojan Horse. The Trap!. I felt so much for these characters that it was like I knew them. Befriended them. Loved them. Hated them. Despised them! So when the back stories came to light, that\'s what buckled me over. I\'ve only had one other anime do that to me and that was Angle Beats. But unlike waiting for the last episode to rip your guts out, this one dose it right off the bat. The first episode makes that clear. Seeing the things they went through, you just lose all heart. These high school students have been through so much in their lives that your surprised most have yet to kill them selves. And that is a big morale. With all the crap that they went through, all the pain and shame, they Survived! And found strength in their past. It\'s inspiring.                                                                                                                                                 The art is well done. Not the best I\'ve seen but far from the worst. The animators were not shy to show decapitation. And the sound all matches the weapons. I\'m a weapon nut and these weapons sound great. Since that is what you hear most of the time, that\'s a good thing. To top it, the voice acting is good and crisp. These people knew who to play. The brat had a good stuck up tone to her while the main Pandora had that ""Steel on bones and Ice water in veins"" sound to her.                                                                                                                                                         If this anime wasn\'t so hard to watch (Personal stuff), I would watch it about 5-8 more times before I left it for a while. It set a whole new bar for my expectations for character and story progression. So yeah, I enjoyed the living Pi$$ out of it!

Now i admit i do read/watch ecchi for the girls, at least in part. However i personally am the kinda guy who doesn't appreciate nudity like at all (just ruins it to me), so the topless scenes were something i could've gone without. that aside tho this anime had some of the cutest girls i've seen in anime, especially Bridget. I loved her rough outer atmosphere but with the gentle, vulnerable girl underneath. Although the anime seemed to show that side a bit too...often and took a bit away from the rarity of it...but it was ok. I very much enjoyed the true love aspect of the story as well with Kazuya and Bridget. Now the fighting, i must say some of the most intense relentless fighting scenes i have ever seen! The maker also did a great job with keeping u informed with the terms and names of abilities. However, now comes my biggest complaint to the anime: it doesn't stay as true to the manga as i would like. Sure some things were a bit smaller like cutting out the flashback with Ingrid and the change in how Kazuya met Rana. However there where other bigger changes that i think they should have not changed such as Pandora mode which instead of being this Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep awesome armor was just a thing with glowing lights (although it did still look cool don't get me wrong, its just i think the armor was more appropriate). THE BIGGEST problem was the ending.....the PREMATURE ENDING!!! I don't know whats up with anime creators nowadays but there's been a growing trend of creating anime from smaller, kinda third party manga and ending them prematurely by cramming everything from the end of the series into the last couple episodes or making up an entirely new ending. Freezing, Claymore, High School of the Dead (although i have not read the manga for that so i don't know if they really screwed it up that badly), all of them were ended at earlier times then they should have! In Freezing in particular they sped up the threat of the Novas and referenced a major character and plot that hasn't even been seen in the manga yet! I guess I'm getting too angry, its just i hate seeing anime that have a lot of potential being ended so early before they even have time to bloom into something great! Overall though, Freezing is an amazing series that has great characters, intense fights, hot girls (although a bit of nudity), and great pure love with the main characters. I do recommend this anime however i strongly argue to read the manga as well, since it keeps going and does a little better of a job. often and took a bit away from the rarity of it...but it was ok.

As a heterosexual male I consider it to be a guilty pleasure.However, I\'ve often found that anime in the genre are something to go into with low expectations as more often than not the fanservice basically takes priority over the actual plot. That being said there are ecchi anime that do at least make the effort to tell a good story such as the brilliant and hilarious Kill la Kill while some have the potential to tell a good story but just throws in so much...fanservice that it distracts from the story such as Senran Kagura.Which brings us to Freezing. And when it comes to low expectations, by God did I have them for this series. I remember reading a review in a magazine once that gave it a negative review with a one star rating out of five. Nonetheless I went into the show and decided to see it for myself.And I ended up coming out of it feeling unfulfilled.To cut a long story short, the series is set in the far future where giant aliens called NOVA threaten humankind. The only way to fight the threat is by sending in female soldiers called Pandora whom are trained by a school/training facility named Genetics and are backed by male partners called Limiters who cast an ability called Freezing to trap the aliens and supply power to their Pandora partners while they handle the fighting.At least that\'s what the series is suppose to be about. Instead we get another school fighting anime where many of the female characters are absolutely hateful, big breasted brats who\'s sole intention is to bully and kick each others arses rather than focus on dealing with the alien threat because there so caught up in fighting each other.And the male characters? HA! Talk about a joke! They practically do nothing but hide behind their Pandora partners while casting their Freezing spells and empowering them. Other than that they do practically nothing and might as well not even be there.Now your probably wondering where the whole ""alien monsters bent on destroying humanity"" plot point come in to this. Well, sadly it doesn\'t. Oh it\'s brought up in the first episode and a few other times in the series but it never comes into the story until the final three episodes.And it\'s unfortunate because this is where the series had potential! Instead we get an other Ikki Tousen clone (so to speak) with plently of clothes shredding fight scenes of women hating each other for one reason or another with male characters that might as well be redundant.Okay, so I should probably move on to what was actually good about the series.Well, the animation and art are fantastic, the fight scenes are certainly entertaining and the music is decent.To conclude, Freezing is a well animated series that had the potential to be pretty decent but ultimately falls flat due to bad story telling and bland characters.

The enemy remains essentially faceless, there isnt a classic ""bad guy"" and it makes the Novas more terrifying as a result. The musical sore was pretty good, i really enjoyed the inspiring main battle song and it added an ""omph"" to some of the scenes.the Two Main characters were alright as well....Satilizer had FAR more depth than Kazuaha (or however you spell it) and she was a fairly 3 dimensional character. i was frustrated in the beginning how she kept saying no to him, but it was refreshing to see a character stick to their guns for as long as she did until agreeing to be partners. unfortunately that never really happened. the whole ""baptism"" never happened for the two of them and instead we get one of the most forced and shitty harems i have ever seen. which leads me to my main statement.everything good about the show, i have already mentioned. everything bad is literally the rest of the show.the side characters are exhaustively stupid, petty, arrogant, scheming and just amazingly dumb.you have the MC\'s two main friends who are complete cowards, almost every scene with them is ""stay away from satilizer, she crippled a limiter before"" and they NEVER question her motive for doing so.the upperclassmen might as well be the fucking novas themselves for how often they try to LITERALLY MURDER THEIR UNDERCLASSMEN.EVERY. DAM. EPISODEeven in the fucking finale the characters are as worthlessly petty as they have ever been.Every time satilizer gets in a fight because some stupid bitch decides that she doesnt like her, the president is like""how could you satilizer? what did she ever do to you?""this of course comes after 5 minutes of said classmate beating the shit out of her and the MCspeaking of which the MC is pathetic ""dont hurt her"" all white knighting and everything and when it really matters he is either unconcious or being retarded. he has incredible power but the story rarely touches on that and even when it does he almost never uses it offensively against the novas. he even stops an entire concert hall full of students completely just so he can get satilizer out of it all with barely any effort. but that power is never shown again and instead he gets tossed around like a puppy dog.speaking of dogs, Rana, the biggest leg humper of them all, comes in out of nowhere from essentially Tibet and sees the MC and decides that he will be hers. Then, after he straight up tells her no, shes like ""well i wont give up"" and then proceeds to be a boat anchor the rest of the series. like i said before, its the most shitty, pointless, fruitless and worthless rivalry ever. had she not been in the story i am sure my review of this series would have been way way different.i enjoyed parts of the finale, but it just brought about the same stupid comments and personalities from the rest of the series. these people just fought 4 novas as well as tons of their classmates and nothing changed at all. the upperclassmen are still cunts, the arrogant bitch from the first episode is still the arrogant bitch from the first episode and satilizer and the MC still havnt baptised and made things official and rana is still humping the MC\'s leg like a sad ugly puppy.it was a complete let down.

However, the plot is very, very straight forward of just fighting monsters that chop up girls AND this plot only really exists in the background and is by no means anything intricate. Most of the show is some really unamusing (and at times cringe) bullying of one shy girl...with a history of sexual abuse at home. The first season does not tell the whole story and spends way more time than necessary focusing on all sorts of ways to bully one chick.No themes, no exploration of any novel ideas. No thinking involved.Also, the characters don\'t really change at all. There is hardly illustration of the main character\'s inner minds. This thing would have done well if it had sex scenes so it could have been a good hentai but unfortunately, by trying to sell itself as a legitimate narrative with ecchi elements, it really barked up the wrong tree. with a history of sexual abuse at home.

They use a lot of technical terms in it as well related to human biology and the brain since the anime is very science oriented. However this new science allows humans to have powers that are a double edged sword, since too much of this power can cause a human to turn into an alien like creature (aka nova)....The main protagonist is a girl named Satellizer, and she is very anti-social due to her past experiences. However, she is one of the strongest pandora and she is a very strong female character in terms of personality. What really drew me in to this anime was that the women are the ones who are the protectors of the human race while younger men are chosen as the supporting characters but have lesser powers. I was looking for a show that had strong female protagonists instead of male and this definitely fits that description. The show ends on a good note, but does have a season two that has even more drama and explanations to several questions. If you read the manga later on, the manga has a lot more plot and action to it and is way ahead than both seasons. The OST for this anime is really good too, it matches the fighting scenes and the sad scenes. Some songs that stood out to me was Sentou (piano version) and the original Sentou, which is the main theme of the anime.My only complaint about this anime was that there was too much nudity for scenes that didn't really make sense. Everyone seems to skinny dip in pools and for some reason their clothes don't regenerate when fighting and leave body parts exposed even though they have the ability to regenerate asap.

I've seen fan service done for a lot less reasons.The amount of fighting is extensive and kind of gets old with the same wash, rinse, repeat situation in every episode. There is 0% development of almost anything outside of that. I was pleasantly...pleased and did enjoy the fact that the initially perceived protagonist based on other tropes within the genre doesn't end up being the protagonist or even maybe a solid sub protagonist. There's an existence and attempts to play voice of reason, but even in this show, you don't have much. There's one purpose and one purpose only, and that's to fight.I am curious what the other installments are going to be like, but this laid the groundwork for what I might expect when I go to those later on. I don't think I would recommend it as a top show for anyone, but this is a nice change if you are not typically interested in battle or sci-fi topics. pleased and did enjoy the fact that the initially perceived protagonist based on other tropes within the genre doesn't end up being the protagonist or even maybe a solid sub protagonist.

I don't think I would recommend it as a top show for anyone, but this is a nice change if you are not typically interested in battle or sci-fi topics."", ""I'm not sure what to say - or what I just watched for that matter.After some time it honestly felt more like watching some trash series rather than something one could take seriously. Story is completely non-existent or just plain nonsense (I mean, basically the whole anime is about people beating eachother up in their school instead of what their purpose as fighters actually is), the characters are just... there, apart from a bit of backstory for the main protagonists.And somehow their opponents managed to cut open their clothes so that the breasts pop out in basically every. single. fight.

With that being said, the show really is pretty decent. Don't get me wrong the first four or five episodes were pretty rough to get through but after that its pretty decent. The trick to enjoying this anime is to know exactly what you are getting which is 98% fan service. There is a little bit of good story in show depending on your own personal opinion, but that is not the focus point. So if you go in knowing that what...this anime is going to give you is a face full of fan service then i think you will enjoy it, otherwise it might not be your cup of tea. this anime is going to give you is a face full of fan service then i think you will enjoy it, otherwise it might not be your cup of tea."", 'I feel like this anime was very well written & the voice actors did a wonderful job. However, I have a few complaints. The story and concept are very cool, my issue is that the times where we actually see the Pandora fighting the Nova are very limited to around 2-3 encounters total. That was kind of a let down to me because the story contains mostly infighting between Pandoras. Another issue that I personally have that you may not have is the amount of ""fan service"" the anime seems to have. I just don\'t think that it needed as much as it contains. But...overall I liked this anime, the concept is cool, so I give it a 6/10. overall I liked this anime, the concept is cool, so I give it a 6/10.', ""The plot seems to be driven by person vs person battles when there are giant monsters that appear out of nowhere.  There isn't much explanation given about said monsters, even later in the series from what I understand.The art is Modern, but it's on the older side of modern.  It was from 2011.  The sound is nothing special.  The lead female seems to be switching personas on a frequent basis.Overall, I'd say it's not that great.  It sets you up with anticipation rather than excitation.Tons of in-your-face fan service and the animation of it is weird compared to other anime....Is it weird to criticize an anime for the way it draws boobs?

As there are a lot of other reviews for this anime I am going to write a short review with some little points that are not included in other ones.-First of all Freezing hasn\'t got any content that could qualify as ""Harem, martial arts, or sci-fi"", so for the ones that are tempted to watch it looking for that kind of content will feel disappointed (I point this out because it is categorized with those genres). This is a romance anime with poor interaction or development with the ones involved (Main + Main...Heroine 1 + Main Heroine 2) and with absolutely one sided attraction from one of the main heroines. About the martial arts, this anime has none. Only two characters fight bare handed and it is just that. And about sci-fi, the only thing that comes to my mind that could be sci-fi is the technology used for making the ""Pandoras"" (why don\'t call the anime that way, it has more sense) and some computers they use; and they don\'t speak of that too much.-Second, this anime is indeed over dramatic. For and ecchi-action series this has tons of childish drama. And everything goes around the fame and prestige of the students in this school and who beats who and to respect the senpais... They put more focus on the competitions between students than to fight the eva-like creatures that attack the planet-Third, the only relation between the title of the anime (Freezing) and its content is that the male students only ability (Yes the only reason for males to exist in this school is to use one ability that at some point is useless) is called ""Freezing"". Also there is a very annoying fact about this, all what males do here is to follow around this rich ladies as they were dogs; and when they use their only power somehow it is easily countered by almost anyone.-Fourth and last, as much as I dislike overpowered characters I found quite annoying the way they changed the main heroine in the last episodes (and got worse in the second season). I don\'t want to spoil the background of this character, but to summarize it she has been harmed in a way that made develop a phobia to be touched; this bound together with the fact that she is kinda overpowered presented her as an untouchable character. The problem is they change her too much, to the point that in the second season she is has almost the opposite personalityStory 5 + Art 6 + Sound 6 + Character 5 + Enjoyment 6 = aprox 6Conclusion: This is a regular quality battle-ecchi-seinen anime. You will not find harem or romance or martial arts, and you will find almost nonexistent comedy or character development. Watch it if you have nothing better to watch, I would recommend ""Ranma 1/2"" for romance-martial arts or ""Mahou sensei negima"" for action-ecchi (not to much action but is better made) Heroine 1 + Main Heroine 2) and with absolutely one sided attraction from one of the main heroines.

Lately I have been enjoying animes with post apocalyptic themes, and ""Partner battles"" reminds me of elemental galde, except the women rule!Anyways, I actually enjoyed this anime, there was a LOT of fan service, but understandable given the nature of the show, I would say that what bothered me was that even in the end, I ended up with more questions in regards to the storyline in the end than I did with the beginning.The character development is wonderful, anime seems to be coming back to the ""Blond"" phase, and the main male wasn\'t lack luster,...he was VERY interesting, but not in a cliche harem type of way. Any way, I would recommend this anime, it\'s different and it gets a little dark and....morbid at time but it opens up to a new world and leads into the second season very well.Again, it does leave a lot of plot holes, if it weren\'t for the developing manga chapters and future anime seasons I\'d have given this anime a 2/10 for that reason alone. he was VERY interesting, but not in a cliche harem type of way.

Militaries around the world came up with a plan to fight back against the NOVA. The Military in each country has an acadamy for men & women who attend the acadamy to hoan thier skills & become stronger to fight against the NOVA. The women who attend this school are known a Pandoras, a rare  being capable of skills to bring...a NOVA to its knees to protect humanity. Though Pandoras are powerful, they would be nothing without the aid of their Limiters. The NOVAs are capable to cast a field to FREEZE their attackers in place & also making them supceptible to an attack from the NOVA itself. To counter this, the Pandoras have male partners known as Limiters, the abilites of a Limiter is the same as a NOVA, they are able to cast a field freezing anything in its range. But this ability is normally used to counter a NOVAs freezing to give the Pandora a chance to strike at the NOVA.Yes, this anime is a ecchie & a harem, but the PLOT only seems to revolve around a single male. Normally, that\'s what a harem is, but in this anime the girls who want to become more then friends are 2 girls with occasional attention from other girls around the school. I\'ll get into detail in my breakdown review. At any rate this show is anything but bad, it\'s a interesting & enjoyable watch to those who are ecchie & harem fans. If you can\'t take nip slips & there I advise not to watch it. But to those who want that & believe me I know what you want or you wouldn\'t of clicked on this anime to begin with you won\'t be disappointed.BREAKDOWN REVIEW: Scoring ranging from 1-10, 1 being dredful[9]STORY: Don\'t let the over-top action fool you or the PLOT keep you in a trance. They actually has some substance to it, meaning there\'s actually an interesting point to the story. It kinda resembles an average high school. Students fighting among each other but coming together when they face a hurtle they cant defeat alone.[8]ART: The art in this anime is very good & an on par with a lot of other popular animes.

As special he may be he can\'t help but be stuck in his older sister\'s shadow because of her sacrifice many years ago. But through self realization he breaks free from her shadow & becomes his own person.-Satellizer el Bridget- A powerful Pandora who is known as the ""untouchable Queen"" who does not rely on anybody but herself & rather die then admit defeat to anyone & refuses to have a Limiter. Ironic as it may seem she reluctantly meets Kazyuya. Very mean & resiliant at first to Kazyuya she evenually warms up to him slowly.-Rana Linchen- A transfer student from a an old world country & who is not aware of certain terms amongst average Pandoras. She only wishes to find her ""destined one"" aka her Limiter. By chance she meets Kazyuya & falls head over heals for him & is convinced that Kazyuya belongs to her NOT Saterllizer, thus forcing Kazyuya into a love triangle.[9]ENJOYMENT: The show is not a bad watch, with the fan service it actually makes the show even better.[9]OVERALL: Freezing overall is show worthy of praise for its originality & worth watching if you\'re really into ecchie & harem with a side of action packed fights.To those looking for another ecchie & harem I recommend this show you will not be disappointed.Enjoy =) a NOVA to its knees to protect humanity.

We are also...shown the ""entities that are wiping humanity"" as Nova\'s (some angel-like deity that are feared for), on top of that, the school, West Genetics have something of a student hierarchy where the Third Years tries to keep a leash on the lower years as well as the nature of the male students being essentially support students to the Pandora battle-ready female fighters. If anything besides the the premise itself, not only does the world building of Freezing break the mold from the genre this anime is in, but the hierarchy of the school as well as the solid dark and edgier tone makes this anime an outlier and rather unique.In terms of characters, Aoi Kazuya voiced by Mitsuhiro Ichiki our main male protagonist isn\'t a dense idiot all throughout the anime and he actually makes proper and smart decisions, to be precise he isn\'t cliche like most typical main male protagonist as it is the genre cliches that make him ""cliche"", he has a personality and a goal people. Satellizer el Bridget is your ace of the Second Years and the best fighter in her year, she is afraid of being touched though it gives her a bit of gap moe (which was even pointed out in the anime itself), she was LA\'s favorite character and Rana Linchen voiced by Kana Hanazawa a transfer Tiebtan student who completes the love triangle to Satellizer and Kazuya and often butt heads with Satelllizer, although Rana isn\'t LA\'s favourite character in the anime, but she DOES have some of the best and funniest lines in the anime. Many of the other students such as Ganessa Roland voiced by Eri Kitamura a fighting rival of Satellizer to Attia Simmons voiced by Kana Ueda a third year who pulls the strings to get the third years to go after Satellizer and Rana were some characters of interest, LA\'s favourite minor character actually goes to the student council president Chiffon Fairchild voiced by Marina Inoue because well of Marina Inoue\'s moe voice (but her being something of a mysterious badass by the end of this season\'s anime). Kazuya and especially Satellizer along with her backstory gets the most character development within this anime. Kazuya\'s development if anything is development through his relationship with Satellizer as well as him as our audience surrogate getting to know the world of Freezing. Rana however gets shafted for harem hijinks with hardly any character development besides being a love interest for Kazuya.Now onto the world of Freezing, there are two major focuses, the political hierarchy of West Genetics school where the third years or just rivals of Satellizer battle each other in which the battles themselves are extremely brutalized, sure clothes rip like ""Ikkitousen"" but blood gets spilled and body parts gets cut open like playdough.On speaking of the battles and clothes ripping, the fanservice for Freezing at best goes to uncensored breasts, full nudity and panty and chest shots nearly every episode, but doesn\'t go anything further from that (though the is used for typical ecchi romance cliches) and guess what LA didn\'t care about the excessive fanservice, because although the camera likes to leer at the girls butts or breasts, the fanservice isn\'t the sole focus of the anime.Back onto the other major focus of the anime, the ""Nova\'s"" (the entities trying to wipe humanity out) and the Pandora\'s fighting them, the Nova themselves are really something to be feared by and no just ""some monsters to fight and defeat"" as they are actually quite smart monsters and just shows why the Pandora\'s and the Limiters (the male students) were made to fight them.The animation by A.C.G.T by all means have some very good quality animation throughout, from the distinct character designs to the battle scenes to heck even the backgrounding. Though throughout the anime it has drab dark tones throughout signifying the world that they live in though LA would wanted to see more of color palette other than light black or dull blue for the backgrounding. It\'s in stark contrast to the character designs with the many differing hair colored main cast of characters and militaristic student uniforms (red and white) for females and typical school uniforms for males (yellow and blue). A.C.G.T overall did a good job in the animation department.Voice acting-wise, well LA said this in the character section, but since Rana Linchen had some fo the bets lines in the series, Kana Hanazawa was LA\'s favorite voice actor in this anime, though Mamiko Noto as Satellizer was a close second, though Freezing\'s voice cast is AMAZING from Sayaka Ohara, Rie Kugimiya, Akeno Watanabe, Rumi Ookubo, Ai Kayano, Izumi Kitta, Ami Koshimizu, Asami Sanada, Miki Ito, to again the aforementioned Kana Hanazawa and Mamiko Noto, this voice cast is AMAZING, LA had to point that out twice...The ending went into a climactic arc and solely focuses on a huge Nova raid and further gave Satellizer and Kazuya major development (Satellizer defrosting to her comrades and Kazuya to Satellizer\'s relationship moving further) and really there were lots of risks within this ending HOWEVER by the end of the ending\'s ordeal, the risks (*cough* deaths) were just wrapped up and ""the risks weren\'t really risks"" which was a shame as it would have solidified the ""darker and edgier"" tone for Freezing.If there were anything else LA would complain about Freezing would be it\'s pacing issue around the middle of the anime where it pretty much goes into ""Third Year fight"" of the week kind of scenario or just filler episodes here and there and yes, we do get relationship building as well as seeing more of hierarchy of the school, LA would wanted to mix this and the Nova fighting up from time to time (though LA could see why they put the Nova fighting near the end of the anime giving us a looming and deadly threat and why the Nova should be feared in the first place), as for the filler episode\'s defense LA would say it was to cool down before getting into the more serious plotlines, nonetheless as LA put some defenses to these complaints, the complaints LA put out are minor. The only major complaint however is that due to the huge cast of characters, the majority of characters (besides Satellizer, Kazuya, Rana and the Third Year Elites) get little screentime and are either spectators or one-off rivals who become comical after Satellizer\'s fight with them thus their little screentime for the minor characters is a bit of a problem.However with all the praising and faults Freezing has, by all means is a good anime, excessive fanservice or not, from it\'s great world building to it\'s hierarchical nature of the school to the brutalized battles to it\'s darker and edgier tone which due to the anime being executed very well, the ""darker and edgier"" statement is justified and not just a statement to overstate this anime. shown the ""entities that are wiping humanity"" as Nova\'s (some angel-like deity that are feared for), on top of that, the school, West Genetics have something of a student hierarchy where the Third Years tries to keep a leash on the lower years as well as the nature of the male students being essentially support students to the Pandora battle-ready female fighters. If anything besides the the premise itself, not only does the world building of Freezing break the mold from the genre this anime is in, but the hierarchy of the school as well as the solid dark and edgier tone makes this anime an outlier and rather unique.In terms of characters, Aoi Kazuya voiced by Mitsuhiro Ichiki our main male protagonist isn\'t a dense idiot all throughout the anime and he actually makes proper and smart decisions, to be precise he isn\'t cliche like most typical main male protagonist as it is the genre cliches that make him ""cliche"", he has a personality and a goal people.

Kazuya and especially Satellizer along with her backstory gets the most character development within this anime. Kazuya\'s development if anything is development through his relationship with Satellizer as well as him as our audience surrogate getting to know the world of Freezing. Rana however gets shafted for harem hijinks with hardly any character development besides being a love interest for Kazuya.Now onto the world of Freezing, there are two major focuses, the political hierarchy of West Genetics school where the third years or just rivals of Satellizer battle each other in which the battles themselves are extremely brutalized, sure clothes rip like ""Ikkitousen"" but blood gets spilled and body parts gets cut open like playdough.On speaking of the battles and clothes ripping, the fanservice for Freezing at best goes to uncensored breasts, full nudity and panty and chest shots nearly every episode, but doesn\'t go anything further from that (though the is used for typical ecchi romance cliches) and guess what LA didn\'t care about the excessive fanservice, because although the camera likes to leer at the girls butts or breasts, the fanservice isn\'t the sole focus of the anime.Back onto the other major focus of the anime, the ""Nova\'s"" (the entities trying to wipe humanity out) and the Pandora\'s fighting them, the Nova themselves are really something to be feared by and no just ""some monsters to fight and defeat"" as they are actually quite smart monsters and just shows why the Pandora\'s and the Limiters (the male students) were made to fight them.The animation by A.C.G.T by all means have some very good quality animation throughout, from the distinct character designs to the battle scenes to heck even the backgrounding. Though throughout the anime it has drab dark tones throughout signifying the world that they live in though LA would wanted to see more of color palette other than light black or dull blue for the backgrounding. It\'s in stark contrast to the character designs with the many differing hair colored main cast of characters and militaristic student uniforms (red and white) for females and typical school uniforms for males (yellow and blue). A.C.G.T overall did a good job in the animation department.Voice acting-wise, well LA said this in the character section, but since Rana Linchen had some fo the bets lines in the series, Kana Hanazawa was LA\'s favorite voice actor in this anime, though Mamiko Noto as Satellizer was a close second, though Freezing\'s voice cast is AMAZING from Sayaka Ohara, Rie Kugimiya, Akeno Watanabe, Rumi Ookubo, Ai Kayano, Izumi Kitta, Ami Koshimizu, Asami Sanada, Miki Ito, to again the aforementioned Kana Hanazawa and Mamiko Noto, this voice cast is AMAZING, LA had to point that out twice...The ending went into a climactic arc and solely focuses on a huge Nova raid and further gave Satellizer and Kazuya major development (Satellizer defrosting to her comrades and Kazuya to Satellizer\'s relationship moving further) and really there were lots of risks within this ending HOWEVER by the end of the ending\'s ordeal, the risks (*cough* deaths) were just wrapped up and ""the risks weren\'t really risks"" which was a shame as it would have solidified the ""darker and edgier"" tone for Freezing.If there were anything else LA would complain about Freezing would be it\'s pacing issue around the middle of the anime where it pretty much goes into ""Third Year fight"" of the week kind of scenario or just filler episodes here and there and yes, we do get relationship building as well as seeing more of hierarchy of the school, LA would wanted to mix this and the Nova fighting up from time to time (though LA could see why they put the Nova fighting near the end of the anime giving us a looming and deadly threat and why the Nova should be feared in the first place), as for the filler episode\'s defense LA would say it was to cool down before getting into the more serious plotlines, nonetheless as LA put some defenses to these complaints, the complaints LA put out are minor. The only major complaint however is that due to the huge cast of characters, the majority of characters (besides Satellizer, Kazuya, Rana and the Third Year Elites) get little screentime and are either spectators or one-off rivals who become comical after Satellizer\'s fight with them thus their little screentime for the minor characters is a bit of a problem.However with all the praising and faults Freezing has, by all means is a good anime, excessive fanservice or not, from it\'s great world building to it\'s hierarchical nature of the school to the brutalized battles to it\'s darker and edgier tone which due to the anime being executed very well, the ""darker and edgier"" statement is justified and not just a statement to overstate this anime.', ""I expected what was promised an academy of people being trained to fight enemy aliens and what not...I got a bunch of stuck up bitches and teachers who don't care about bullies and in that regards rewards them and the ones being bullied punished for defending themselves...Atleast that's what happens to Satellizer she tried to protect a guy and got punished for it, almost got raped by a female upper classmate and had her lackeys take pictures of Satellizer almost naked to publish it across the school to humiliate her for trying to save this guy Kazuya and when she defended herself the teachers who...are supposed to uphold the values of conduct instead of protecting her and reprimanding the one person who actually did something bad they punished her by putting her into a cell in isolation for a week...

I wanted to enjoy the series because it had an interesting premise, but the plot and themes took a backseat from the fan service that was suffocating. I like and expect a certain amount of fan service, and appreciate it when its done right and has artistic value, but this was just fan service for the sake of! The main character was made only as a sex symbol and then treated like target practice from the other students at this school. The supposed love story is non existent and the guy acts more like a...little kid forced into a sexual situation. I'm also really getting irritated by the out of proportion and the oversized chest of female characters. Granted, there are large breasted women, but not like that! The rest of the bodies are like size 2-6 models with a chest 3-5 times that of a 200lbs woman.

Most aspects of it are above average to say the least. However, there's no denying the fact that the anime could've been much better if it had avoided some frustrating cliches.The thing that struck me the most about this anime is how similar the setting is to Neon Genesis Evangelion. Humankind under threat of invasion by otherworldly beings of alien origin, some kind of top-secret technology that allows them to combat the unknown threat and even conspiracies to top it off. It has NGE written all...over it thus far. But this is where the similarities end and, cracks begin to appear. To begin with, I do not think an anime with such a serious theme should have had as much ecchiness as Freezing did. This is a minor complaint though and shouldn't affect the experience much if you've decided to pick it up after seeing the 'ecchi' tag as I did. The second and the biggest problem is that the plot veers wildly off course after the introduction. One doesn't witness epic battles for survival. No, the viewer is instead treated to squabbles between the female protagonist (Satellizer) and other random Pandora. Given the backdrop of the series, this is an odd decision on the part of the producers. That said, the plot does manage to recover partially towards the end. It may be too little too late for some, but I personally liked the cliffhanger ending. If only the plot and setting were bolstered by not-so-weak characterization, maybe this anime would've stood out of the crowd.The characterization is probably the weakest link in Freezing. In fact, it's downright frustrating. To the extent that you might be inclined to drop the series solely because of it. Let's talk about Satellizer first. She is the only character who receives some semblance of development during the course of the series. This by no means implies that she is tolerable as a character. Satellizer is irritating, period. She comes across as a tsundere of the highest order at the beginning (first few minutes of the first episode). Now, that impression is destroyed as soon as it is created by none other than Aoi Kazuya, the male protagonist. He has a sudden urge to hug her because she resembles his late sister, a legendary Pandora. This effectively sends Satellizer's reputation as the 'Untouchable Queen' down the drain. Thereafter, she transforms into this cute, shy insecure high school girl whenever she comes into contact with Kazuya. This, frankly speaking, is downright pathetic and a pain to watch even after the flashback to her distressing past. The chief reason for this is her 'I will not lose' personality. Under normal circumstances, this is supposed to be something admirable. But it's obvious that this is only a facade and she requires Kazuya to bail her out of tough situations. So, what happens when it's all done? You guessed it, she acts all feminine, says something like 'I didn't need your help' and makes a hurried exit from the scene. Satellizer does change during the course of the series though, in fact, she's the only one. But it comes after eleven episodes of utter stupidity. In other words, it doesn't amount to much.Aoi Kazuya is another entity that I would like to discuss in detail. But I'll keep this one brief. Basically, he's your idealistic hero who doesn't take 'no' for an answer and is obsessed with becoming Satellizer's Limiter, probably because of his sister complex. Kazuya's okay for the most part, but it has to be pointed out that his tendency to deliver long, emotional (mostly uninspired) speeches can get irritating. Also, he has some kind of mysterious power which makes his Freezing a lot stronger at the right time. Personally, I'm not a big fan of characters with 'hidden potential' who come through for others in the nick of time and that too, recurrently. Personal views aside, Kazuya doesn't receive any development AT ALL. This is unfortunate as he is one of the leads in this show. The rest of the cast is composed solely of extras. Even Rana Linchen, Satellizer's rival, is just that and doesn't serve any other purpose. But as strange as it may seem, she is actually better than either protagonist in many ways. This is one of those rare anime in which the supporting cast is apparently far better than the protagonists. Don't ask me why though, I have no answer. Overall, this is one of the worst assortment of characters I've seen in any anime.The art and animation are pretty well done for the most and manage to portray action scenes quite nicely. It's nothing revolutionary, but it's more than adequate for an ecchi anime. The same goes for the character designs. They're ok, albeit a tad generic.The audio on the other hand is slightly disappointing. The voice cast does a pretty good job, but, none of them really stand out. One gripe I have about with regard to this is that most of what Satellizer says to Kazuya after about five episodes is annoying. Almost every dialogue is delivered in an irritating hesitant tone and has numerous pauses which are quite unnecessary. The soundtack is average, but manages to get the job done.Freezing isn't a bad anime by any means. In fact, it has an interesting setting and more than adequate back-story for an ecchi anime. But it fails to use that solid foundation to its full potential. Weak characterization and an uninteresting plot prevent it from being one of the best products in it's genre. despite everything I have said, I still think it's a good pick for anyone looking for mindless ecchi action.

It falls under the ecchi/harem category and has elements true to this. The story is about a boy named Kazuya Aoi that starts his first day at the East Academy for Pandora. A special group of women born with the ability to draw weapons and have super human powers. The Pandoras are required to find a male partner called limiters that are able to freeze enemies. Kazuya makes friends with one of the odd balls at the Academy named Bridgette L. Satellizer. Also known as the Untouchable Queen.Story: This Anime has a rather interesting story....Both characters hold a level of power and are against odds that seem possible for their skills. Which doesn't leave you angry or wondering how a character achieves such feats. The story has few fillers and many funny moments. The Atmosphere is that of a drama anime. There isn't alot of Harem/Ecchi going on in it compared to others. Only 2 girls really ever chase after the Protagonist. There is alot of cleavage, but it isn't to the point of ridiculousness.Art: The Art in this anime is great, perhaps due to it being a newer anime. The environments are great, the fight scenes are detailed, and the character designs are good. The CGI goes well with the Anime and doesn't look out of place.Sound: The opening for this Anime wasn't one of my favorites, but it was okay. The music in the Anime fits the scenes and adds to the drama feeling of the Anime. Such as when a character is being teamed up on and being beaten. The music starts eerily and leads the view into the emotion the artists want.Characters: The characters in this Anime are my favorite aspect. Kazuya can come off as rash and a bonehead at times, however he doesn't come as a complete idiot like many Animes. Bridgette exhibits the outcast for her power role well and isn't cocky. Over the course of the season she comes out of her and develops well. Other characters follow the development well.Enjoyment/Overall: This is one of my favorite Animes. Minus one annoying character it is almost perfect. The aspect of romance and action are just the right amount to keep it interesting and emotional.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes.

Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes.

Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series.

None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10. Next week I'll look at another franchise I've discussed before with a look at Galaxy Angel 2. the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes.

But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content.

Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie.

He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues.

And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens.

So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

The plot, and the charachters are as realistic as can be expected considering the situation This anime is GORY and deffanitly NOT intended for younger audiances."", ""Yu Yu Hakusho was a good anime. I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point.

I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues.

Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world.

It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes.

Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes.

Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

After leaving his body he finds that a place for him in the spirit world is not available! After fulfilling a task given to him, he is resurrected in his old body. This time around his body comes with Spirit Powers, and a few strings attached; he is called upon to work as a Spirit Detective to investigate any suspicious activities brought about by the demon world.Yusuke's resurrection changes his mind-set and behavior, he slowly discovers new ways to use...his Spirit abilities, and faces many strong opponents in his battle for good. Some of his opponents however are inspired by Yusuke Urameshi&rsquo;s honorable intensions. His love for his friends and family brought about a change in 2 of his most difficult adversaries, namely Kurama and Hiei.In addition to his two new allies, there exists an on-going rivalry between Yusuke and his schoolmate Kuwabara.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

Conversely, the series conditioned me to expect hard fights to drag on for many episodes, and this one was over so quickly that I\'m left with an incongruous feeling that it was simultaneously too easy AND too hard.While the comic relief moments tickled me, ""Yuu Yuu Hakusho: The Throwaway Episode"" is mostly dull, so much so that the rather epic background music feels out of place. The appearance of Kurama and Hiei was predictable, but did manage to breathe a little life into the proceedings - I admit: I\'m a sucker for cameos of cool characters.Other than that, there really isn\'t much to see in ""Yuu Yuu Hakusho: The Throwaway Episode"", and I would hesitate to recommend this ""movie"" even to hardcore fans of the main series.Personal rating: -0.5 (mediocre) is - given how powerful Yusuke must be by this point, I\'d expected him to wipe the floor with almost everyone, but instead he was forced to dig deep in the headline fight.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point.

I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues.

Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world.

It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes.

Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes.

Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

After leaving his body he finds that a place for him in the spirit world is not available! After fulfilling a task given to him, he is resurrected in his old body. This time around his body comes with Spirit Powers, and a few strings attached; he is called upon to work as a Spirit Detective to investigate any suspicious activities brought about by the demon world.Yusuke's resurrection changes his mind-set and behavior, he slowly discovers new ways to use...his Spirit abilities, and faces many strong opponents in his battle for good. Some of his opponents however are inspired by Yusuke Urameshi&rsquo;s honorable intensions. His love for his friends and family brought about a change in 2 of his most difficult adversaries, namely Kurama and Hiei.In addition to his two new allies, there exists an on-going rivalry between Yusuke and his schoolmate Kuwabara.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

Conversely, the series conditioned me to expect hard fights to drag on for many episodes, and this one was over so quickly that I\'m left with an incongruous feeling that it was simultaneously too easy AND too hard.While the comic relief moments tickled me, ""Yuu Yuu Hakusho: The Throwaway Episode"" is mostly dull, so much so that the rather epic background music feels out of place. The appearance of Kurama and Hiei was predictable, but did manage to breathe a little life into the proceedings - I admit: I\'m a sucker for cameos of cool characters.Other than that, there really isn\'t much to see in ""Yuu Yuu Hakusho: The Throwaway Episode"", and I would hesitate to recommend this ""movie"" even to hardcore fans of the main series.Personal rating: -0.5 (mediocre) is - given how powerful Yusuke must be by this point, I\'d expected him to wipe the floor with almost everyone, but instead he was forced to dig deep in the headline fight.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point.

I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues.

Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world.

It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes.

Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes.

Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

After leaving his body he finds that a place for him in the spirit world is not available! After fulfilling a task given to him, he is resurrected in his old body. This time around his body comes with Spirit Powers, and a few strings attached; he is called upon to work as a Spirit Detective to investigate any suspicious activities brought about by the demon world.Yusuke's resurrection changes his mind-set and behavior, he slowly discovers new ways to use...his Spirit abilities, and faces many strong opponents in his battle for good. Some of his opponents however are inspired by Yusuke Urameshi&rsquo;s honorable intensions. His love for his friends and family brought about a change in 2 of his most difficult adversaries, namely Kurama and Hiei.In addition to his two new allies, there exists an on-going rivalry between Yusuke and his schoolmate Kuwabara.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

Conversely, the series conditioned me to expect hard fights to drag on for many episodes, and this one was over so quickly that I\'m left with an incongruous feeling that it was simultaneously too easy AND too hard.While the comic relief moments tickled me, ""Yuu Yuu Hakusho: The Throwaway Episode"" is mostly dull, so much so that the rather epic background music feels out of place. The appearance of Kurama and Hiei was predictable, but did manage to breathe a little life into the proceedings - I admit: I\'m a sucker for cameos of cool characters.Other than that, there really isn\'t much to see in ""Yuu Yuu Hakusho: The Throwaway Episode"", and I would hesitate to recommend this ""movie"" even to hardcore fans of the main series.Personal rating: -0.5 (mediocre) is - given how powerful Yusuke must be by this point, I\'d expected him to wipe the floor with almost everyone, but instead he was forced to dig deep in the headline fight.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

I've also reviewed Hunter x Hunter, which had the same author and was great. Today, we're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho the movie. They call it that, but it's only the length of an episode so... that's a thing. But I've reviewed shorter anime that were classified as films and the length, in this situation, doesn't mater so much as the quality of the content. So, let's look at it and see how it holds up.Story:We open with Botan fetching Yuusuke & Kuwabara while they're engaged in a brawl. She tells them Koenma was kidnapped and...the culprit is demanding the golden seal, which is King Enma's proof of office, in exchange for him. Naturally, Yuusuke borrows the seal, saying it won't be a problem if he brings it back. He and Kuwabara run for the area where the exchange is meant to take place, not knowing their hosts have arranged for a welcoming party of monstrous menaces to munch their jugular veins.The big issue with it is just that there's not a lot of development behind anything that happens. Koashura's motivations are weak which, to be fair, they lampshade and use for a bit of humour. But even that's better than what we get for our big bad of the episode, I mean movie. Let's call him super generic shounen villain five. A lot of the content also comes down to a running battle as they progress towards their goal and just tear into expendable henchmen on their way. Which doesn't make for the most compelling content in the world. Nor does it ever do anything that's unexpected and attention grabbing.On the positive side, I  did like the confrontation that Yuusuke eventually has with generic shounen villain five. It has some strong moments. I will also credit the work with giving Koashura some sympathetic traits in his cutaway scenes. And, speaking as someone who liked the series, it is nice to see more of this world and its characters.Characters:We have the same major cast as the series. Hiei and Kurama appear rather briefly and get a bit of banter. The focus is on Yuusuke, Kuwabara and Botan. They're the same as they are in the series proper. None of them have undergone any life changing epiphanies. The main antagonist, old Five, is just bland.Art:The artwork is kind of good. I know, one of my issues with the series proper was the abundance of very noticeable art errors but this is a bit more polished. I noticed one sequence that was a bit awkward, but that was pretty much it for animation issues. The designs continue to be a bit odd but excusably so since it deals with supernatural beings.Sound:The acting continues to be a strong point. With Ogata Megumi, Miyuki Sanae, Sasaki Nozomu, Hiyama Nobuyuki & Chiba Shigeru all reprise their roles just as strongly as they performed them in the main series. Our new characters are voiced by  Aono Takeshi and Matsumoto Rica, both of whom do perfectly well. The music is the same as it is in the series proper, right down to the same theme tunes. And the series has good music.Ho-yay:You don't really get any here. Our characters who were a bit homo-erotic in the main series have a couple minutes of banter but nothing that really conveys that aspect of their relationship.Final Thoughts:The Golden Seal is basically like a stand alone episode of the series and not like one of the better episodes. It's decent enough and if you really liked Yu Yu Hakusho you'll probably enjoy it as a little bit more. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

The other is a bland Mega Strong blockhead that, of course, fails in the end.Enjoyment/Overall (5) - I only watched + liked it because, hey, more YYH! If I didn't enjoy the franchise already, I wouldn't have bothered LOL. Would only recommend this to completionists and/or hardcore fans. it feels a bit sloppier than usual. I don't know why, but some of the more 'intense' action scenes (namely involving the Spirit Gun) look really.......unfinished. Otherwise, standard fare.Sound (6) -  Same OP as usual, but the ED is for season two even though this clearly takes place before the Dark Tournament. Seiyuus do fine here (even the new ones).
