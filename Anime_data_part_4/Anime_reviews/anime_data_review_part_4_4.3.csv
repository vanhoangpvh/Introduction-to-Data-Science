Shiguang Zhaoxiangguan de Richang,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50105/Shiguang_Zhaoxiangguan_de_Richang,"[""This is your typical chibi style tie-in mini series to a parent anime, featuring in this case the 3 main characters from Link Click and their daily lives. Each episode is quite short and is comprised of the opening, the trouble at hand, the ending and an animal short with the characters as if they were pets. So if you find animals cute there's something to look forward to there.If that's not the case, I must say either way that the opening song can not only be quite catchy but as the episodes go on it improves in its animation and budget. Seriously I was...honestly surprised at how by a certain point it started changing. Not to mention that there's a chibi version of the iconic ending of the parent series.Nonetheless, the animation itself is not that of the anime, not by a long shot. It is 3D with few frames per second and the most movement coming out of facial expression changes since the bodies move very slightly. Also, there's also an ambient track from the main series throughout the main part of the episode, so apart from the opening and ending songs, there's not much to jam to.All in all, the most outstanding aspect of this miniseries is the opening, so if you're not gonna watch it, go look it up. honestly surprised at how by a certain point it started changing.

Lupin III: Lupin Ansatsu Shirei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1438/Lupin_III__Lupin_Ansatsu_Shirei,"[""The story is mostly about weapons of mass destruction, but there's a side plot for character development woman having a vendetta against Jigen. In the one Jigen and Fujiko get a lot of light, and don't waste it. I really enjoyed Fujiko in this one! She was dependable and had their backs the whole time!Goemon shows up for his usual random reasons and teams up with Zenigata for a little while, which was fun, though we don't see much of it. Zeni and Goemon seemed to get along, and Zeni really cares about Goemon just like he cares about Lupin, Jigen, and Fujiko even though...he and the samurai don't see each other as much.Character development woman is steadfast and not anxious about what's going on and the situation she's in. She seems pretty chill aside from having it out for the gunner, and she kicked all the way in when shit hit the fan. She doesn't always know how she feels but she knows to act, which safes the groups lives up until the end. She's not jumpy like most of the cdw I've seen so far.The art kind of fails, and I think this one has some mute parts to it. Like it's missing sound effects in some places, or the lip sinking is a little off in some places.I would recommend this to Lupin fans and people new to anime. he and the samurai don't see each other as much.Character development woman is steadfast and not anxious about what's going on and the situation she's in.

It's immensely boring. After this, the movie takes place on an evil guy's militarized headquarters in a jungle. The evil guy wants the submarine so he can fire nukes at people.Lupin, Jigen, Fujiko, and Goemon at the very least are treated decently in this. They act like their usual fun loving, money loving selves. One plus side in this very generic movie, is that the Lupin gang end up being nicer...to each other than they often do. Fujiko is especially nice in this one, and of course she brings that sex appeal to the table, which helps. These classic characters are the best part of this story.Inspector Zenigata is a complete joke in this one, he gets no respect. He's been taken off the Lupin case, so he just gets drunk and depressed, and even hangs out with the Lupin gang. At one point he wears an apron and acts like the Lupin gang's butler. This is very out of character, and pretty much sacrilege, though I admit it's a bit amusing.The movie does have an enjoyable action climax though, and a nice ending.All in all, this is on the lower end of the Lupin spectrum. For me, it was worth sitting through for some fun moments between the Lupin gang. If you're not a Lupin completist, this one is very skippable. to each other than they often do.

Lupin III was written for television, and so—as exceptions to the short and sweet episodic formula of the series—these films always end up needing to pad out the runtime with tiresome and predictable twists and turns. Yes it’s nice to see Masaaki Osumi’s return to the series in his only Lupin feature film, and yes his direction is just as sharp as it was in Part I, but the only directors who have truly been able to make Lupin neatly fit in film format...(to my knowledge) have been Miyazaki and Koike. Still, Osumi is no amateur, and this is certainly one of the better films in the franchise. The first half is excellent, and the character interactions are great, but unfortunately it just goes on for a bit too long. (to my knowledge) have been Miyazaki and Koike.

The character designs in this one were also super nice and again some of my new favorites. This one was basically just “the gang steals a nuclear warhead filled submarine just for shits n giggles” it’s a very engaging premiseThe movie girl this time was p interesting too and definitely one of the better ones (that’s not saying that much tho tbf). She wasn’t annoying so...she’s high on my movie girl tier list.Not a whole lot to say abt voyage to danger other than it was just really fun!

Kinnikuman II Sei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1707/Kinnikuman_II_Sei,"['Kinnikuman Nii-sei, most known as Ultimate Muscle in the West, is the follow-up sequel to the Yudetamago\'s classic Kinnikuman. Manly and action packed like its predecessor, however it still lacks the originality and epicness of the first series in my opinion. This series was the only ""Kinnikuman"" trademark anime that was released outside Japan towards the majority of the West (Latin America and France had the original Kinnikuman TV series running) so many of the viewers were unaware that there was an original Kinnikuman series that aired years before Ultimate Muscle. The original manga was released in 1979 (TV series in 1983) and this sequel...was released in 1998 (TV series in 2002). This sequel does not cover the full manga but it still covers the majority of it, so I\'ll be focusing on the TV series rather than the manga counterpart.Story: 7/10Story is enjoyable. Not great nor bad, but enjoyable. A mixture of comedy, action and some bloody scenes (also featuring MANLY MEN). The story focuses on Kid Muscle (Mantaro Kinniku in the original japanese), the son of the king of Planet Kinniku the legendary King Muscle (the original Kinnikuman) and its progression on becoming a strong fighter to defeat the invasion of the D.M.P, an evil Chojin (Superhuman) group that invades Earth. Since the previous heroes of the original Kinnikuman were too old and weak to enter the battlefield once again, a group of new super-heroes was created to combat the D.M.P, entitled the ""New Generation"". Kid Muscle starts as a clumsy and idiotic man, just like his father before him, but, like him, progresses from being a foolish man towards a powerful hero. I feel like I was watching a reboot from the original Kinnikuman, because the setting had the resemblance of the Chojin Olympics (over-the-top wrestling matches) and the fate of Earth lies in this event. It was good because it brought a sense of nostalgia but I think they could\'ve changed the environment a bit. But this is coming from me who watched the original series before going into Ultimate Muscle, so for the majority of you may think this doesn\'t happen in your minds. Now, like I said, the TV series does not cover the full manga. The last chapters of its manga counterpart were more dark toned than the ones the anime covered.Art: 8/10The art is very good for its time, the character movements are fluid and dynamic, shows us a great sense of action. Definately an improvement over the original Kinnikuman series, but we\'re comparing an anime that aired in the 80\'s and one that aired in the 00\'s, so it\'s a bit unfair. The manga counterpart\'s art improves upon its predecessors\' aswell.Sound: 6/10Soundtrack is okay, not memorable. The japanese opening theme is really good but the rest of the soundtrack is forgetable. The voice acting is great nonetheless. However, the english dub is horrible, I recommend to watch it in its original dub. Even the english version of the opening is nothing compared to the original one.Character: 6/10In my original Kinnikuman\'s review in MAL, I stated that one of the series\' best feature is its character development. However, the same I cannot say about Ultimate Muscle. The original series focused on Kinnikuman, yes, but his allies (Robin Mask, Terryman, Ramenman, Warsman, etc) had great screen time and character development, and we felt that Kinnikuman was not the only protagonist around there but the entire Super-Hero roster. In Ultimate Muscle, Kid Muscle is the main focus. The ""New Generation"" roster, mainly Terry The Kid, Kevin Mask, Seiuchin and Gazelman (the first two being the sons of the legendary Terryman and Robin Mask from the previous series) have little screen time so we don\'t actually connect ourselves to them like we did with the old roster\'s members. The villains are forgetable, some cool and others just...meh. Now, in Kid Muscle\'s case, he is clumsy and careless (like father like son in the first times), but a lot more pervert than his old man. Kid Muscle looks exactly like his father King Muscle when he was his age, except for the short piece of hair. Heck, the majority of the characters that returned from the original series, for those who watched the original series first, just brings a sense of nostlagia. I did like the fact that they brought back Alexandria Meat to be Kid\'s advisor, just like how he did to his father.The one character that I believe that was the only one that got its deserved attention and screentime was Ashuraman, also from the previous series. We can see his struggle to decide wether he\'s a good chojin or an evil shojin.Enjoyment: 7/10I enjoy this anime, even with its flaws. I just like action packed anime, plus I like wrestling, comedy, action and manliness so Ultimate Muscle is just the type of anime for me just like the original Kinnikuman.Overall: 7/10A 7 is fair by be.

You see, while Kinnikuman is a goofy franchise, its serious fights are too an important factor. This is even more important for Kinnikuman II, as the manga is more serious with some surprisingly graphics imagery. One would therefore expect that this difference between original Kinnikuman and Kinnikuman II would be retained in the anime versions, right? Wrong.If anything, the anime version of Kinnikuman II is even more goofy. I’m talking about story with not only straight out murder but brutal dismemberment and gore being turned into fart joke extravaganza. The damage in fights which as I’ve mentioned is...originally quite graphic is now barely a scratch – literally, most of the time there is no visible damage on the characters, it’s now pretty much like the actual real life wrestling, and not in a good way.Now, considering that this series was never subbed and the only English version is the 4Kids dub, you could assume this is just fault of 4kids. But not really. I’ve compared some episodes to Japanese raws, and while there are some slight changes – the main issues still stand (though admittedly I compared only handful of episodes). The dub introduces its own problems like corny puns, bad voice acting and baffling change of soundtrack, but the problem described above is still present even in the original.This of course doesn’t help with the pacing. Main content of the manga is fights, and now you have half fights and half shitty jokes – even the comedy that was originally from the manga is somehow done more poorly. And even the fights are considerably less entertaining as it was degraded to cartoon violence with no real impact.The poor pacing is also unfortunately complemented by poor animation which is simply low effort, simplified when possible and overall just ugly.Kinnikuman II is truly the equivalent of morning cartoons, and not the actually good ones. Unless you're a kid or you're specifically looking for something cheesy, it would be a waste of time watching this. Just read the manga instead, now that it's actually available in English. originally quite graphic is now barely a scratch – literally, most of the time there is no visible damage on the characters, it’s now pretty much like the actual real life wrestling, and not in a good way.Now, considering that this series was never subbed and the only English version is the 4Kids dub, you could assume this is just fault of 4kids.

Lost Song,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34338/Lost_Song,"[""Lost Song is by no means a revolutionary anime that's going to change the game forever. That doesn't mean that it isn't still unique and surprisingly enjoyable. In fact, I would say it's that surprise itself that lends a hand to my enjoyment of the series overall.I went into Lost Song with low expectations, given from the first few episodes it seems to be a standard fantasy era war show without any interesting gimmick that made it stand out. Only reason I kept with it was because I watched with a friend and we wanted to predict what would happen.Predicting what will happen in Lost...Song is a feat that proves much more difficult than you would expect. As I said, it was the surprise of how much we couldn't predict what would happen that made it so enjoyable. Partway through, the series pulls off one of the best plot twists I've encountered for such an unassuming series, and it's how discreetly packaged this show is that made it such a wonderful, delightful surprise.That isn't to say it's only the surprise that makes it interesting. You find that groundwork had been laid out this entire time, and unbeknownst to you, a well crafted and clever series had appeared beneath your feet before you knew what you were watching.All I can say is to give Lost Song a chance, and it certainly won't disappoint you. I wish there had been just a bit more time for better pacing to give a few more characters some spotlight or unfold a few more threads they'd lead with and tied off loosely at the end, but all in all, it's still satisfying and a very fun ride until the very end! The art is decent at worst and great at best, the music is enchanting, and the two protagonists are the characters who really sell the story. Lost Song is the hidden gem of its season.

Lost Song is the hidden gem of its season."", 'My favorite part about anime is when music, specifically singing, is a main focus. Japanese voice actors work tremendously hard to deliver their lines as realistically as possible, so it\'s a real treat when I get to hear their characters sing on top of that. That\'s what I was most excited about when I happened across an anime titled Lost Song on Netflix one day while I was cooking. The narrative told by the synopsis proved to be very intriguing as it described a setting in a fantasy world where two women are blessed by the power of song in a land where war is...about to break out. Captivated by the apparent uniqueness of the story, I pressed play without hesitation. Across the twelve-episode journey, I quickly found that the anime wasn\'t as great as I intended it to be.Story | 2/10Lost Song tries and fails in many aspects that are more successful in other popular anime. It plays with drama, comedy, and suspense. The problem Lost Song has with these tropes is that the story is so poorly configured that the tropes hardly work together in a seamless manner. Plot twists are tossed around from left and right in the midst of dramatic moments, each with an introduction that acts as if they\'re these huge, surprising discoveries that should be completely unexpected to the audience. I, however, found each plot twist to be entirely predictable due to the fact that the foreshadowing of events was less subtly hinted and more obviously thrown in your face through character interactions and expressions. For example, when I heard a line such as, ""Don\'t ever sing the Song of Mortality,"" it became detectable to me that the song would be sung anyway at some point, because why mention the song and how dangerous it is if no one is going to sing it in the future, right? That kind of dialogue, while sometimes can work in favor of foreshadowing, is used a lot in this anime, making it too easy to guess what will happen later on. This is a problem I noticed as a recurrence throughout the first half of the anime, and I was extremely disappointed because being able to predict future events in a show takes away the excitement involved. It also proves that not much clever thought was put into the story as a whole.On the other hand, the various bits of comedy that were included only seemed to be added as a means of preventing a moment of awkward silence, or as a means of slowing down a scene that was becoming too dramatic. The delivery of these jokes also felt forced instead of natural, and none of them really made me laugh either. Having a character scream out, ""There\'s food!? Where? Where\'s the food!?!?"" ever so often when another character randomly mentions food is not funny. Having a character attempt to explain why something isn\'t scientifically correct while the other characters interrupt him with, ""We don\'t care,"" isn\'t funny either. If anything, these types of lines are childish and cringy, and there\'s nothing funny about an adult or teenager acting like a child. Plus, I\'ve seen these exact same jokes before, so these aren\'t even original. I know comedy isn\'t a huge focus within Lost Song, since it isn\'t even listed as one of the genres, but there are hundreds of other anime that EXCEL in delivering good comedy when the focus also mostly revolves around drama and suspense.The story development in general isn\'t the best either. Pacing fluctuates between harshly rushed to push out as much information as possible and agonizingly slow as a consequence. Rinse and repeat. On top of that, the anime takes a drastic and questionable turn at the halfway mark where the story becomes way less predictable and a LOT more confusing. I can understand that the creators of this anime wanted to inflict shock within its audience by making such a sudden change in the story, but to me this change was too much for the type of setting presented in the beginning and felt as though the same idea could be accomplished with a change that was toned down a bit. Essentially, it seems like the story presented in Lost Song is trying too hard to achieve a ground-breaking plotline. By attempting to wow its watchers with such drama, heartbreak, and unexpected events in its twelve-episode time frame, the anime ends up tripping over itself and instead showcases a chaos of ideas and characters that aren\'t deeply explored.A last point I would like to mention before moving on is that Lost Song tries desperately to appeal to all audiences. On the surface it looks as though the anime is aiming for a younger female demographic with its shoujo-like art style and lack of raunchy themes, but with added gore, profanity, and a female character with breasts so big they look like they\'re about to spill out of her clothing, it seems like the anime is also trying to bring in an older female and male audience as well. This desperation to create an anime worth watching by all was so obvious that it was infuriating and distracting to the narrative trying to be told.Character | 2/10Throughout Lost Song, the story switches point of views between the two main characters: Rin and Finis. Besides their ability to control the elements with their songs, there\'s nothing about these characters that really stands out. Rin is optimistic and kind-hearted, and Finis is a naïve damsel in distress. For the two characters that are supposed to carry the whole story on their backs, the types of personalities they were given are ones that are extremely overused and boring. The goals they have are also entirely lackluster, and they give off the impression that the only reason these motives exist is only to advance the story. Rin\'s character in particular wants to find her true purpose in the world, which isn\'t a goal that encourages character development. Thus, Rin doesn\'t really develop at all due to the fact that she\'s already a ""good guy"" who has almost no reason to change or redeem herself. Finis, on the other hand, goes through a rapid development once her goal is hindered by the enemy of the anime. If done correctly, I might have thoroughly enjoyed Finis\'s sudden change in character considering it was probably the most interesting thing that happened. Unfortunately, with Finis\'s development came the unsatisfactory warping of the plot. The added confusion alongside her change really made it hard for me to appreciate the only piece of character development that was delivered.As for the abundance of supporting characters, it was easy to see not much thought was put into them either. This part of the cast is one full of stereotypes; the glasses character is the smart guy, the knight is the savior, the ugly guy is the villain, etc. so there\'s not really anything interesting about them. Over half of these characters are added with zero purpose to fulfil the plot other than using them to make conversation when things slowed down. All of these useless characters could have been cut from the anime entirely, and their screen time could have been replaced with scenes that explained the plot better or improved the pacing. Some anime do a great job managing a large cast of characters, but this isn\'t one of them.Art | 2/10I really hate judging an anime for its art, especially the older ones, but the art presented in Lost Song is utterly amateurish for the era of its release. It\'s 2018. Earlier this year we saw Violet Evergarden, and only a few weeks after Lost Song ended came Banana Fish. Compared to those two, the art style and animation of Lost Song looks as though it was released in the early 2000s. Multiple times throughout the anime, the movement of the characters felt really choppy and the least bit smooth. This was especially a problem when the characters were walking. It\'s clear to see that the animation budget was almost entirely spent on the animation of the characters singing, because it was only during those moments where it felt like the animation was somewhat up to par with other 2018 anime. It hurts me to say this, but I also didn\'t like how the character designs looked at all. Besides the villain being purposely made unsightly, I didn\'t find the rest of the cast to be pleasing to look at either.Sound | 2/10The music within this anime was what I was most excited for and most disappointed with. Lost Song features several insert songs that each represent their own power. There\'s a song of fire, water, Earth, wind, healing, and mortality. Some songs were more catchy than others, but none of them really stood out to me as exceptional compositions. Though the characters looked like they were having a blast singing their songs, I couldn\'t say I felt the same way while watching them. Rin\'s voice was tolerable since her character is a bit younger, so it makes sense for her voice to be higher pitched, but I wasn\'t particularly a fan of Finis\'s voice. Her singing was extremely nasally, and it was clear to see that she was trying to hide the fact that she couldn\'t really hit the high notes by making her voice go softer. The softness in her voice also takes away from the power of the song, which is incredibly unfortunate considering Finis is the one who sings the most powerful song in the anime. Moreover, when both Rin and Finis sing together, their high-pitched voices tend to blend in with one another instead of being distinctive. I really think that they should have cast a VA with a bit of a deeper voice for Finis, like Saori Hayami (VA for Yunhua in the anime Kanata no Astra, she also sings in this anime on two occasions) for example, not only because she could probably hit the notes better and make the songs more powerful, but her voice sounds a lot more mature for someone like Finis. Either way, for being the selling point of the show, the songs in this anime failed miserably at meeting my expectations.Enjoyment | 1/10This was not a fun anime to watch. The plotline and characters are packed full of generalizations and stereotypes, and the whole premise of the story just jumps all over the place. Honestly, if someone told me that a child wrote the script, I would believe it. As a female approaching my 20s, I saw no appeal for this anime beyond what I read in the synopsis. So much could have been done to improve everything we were given, but with the evident low budget this anime seems to have, I can see why it turned out this way. Lost Song was a one-and-done for me, so I have no plans of ever coming back to it. about to break out. Captivated by the apparent uniqueness of the story, I pressed play without hesitation. Across the twelve-episode journey, I quickly found that the anime wasn\'t as great as I intended it to be.Story | 2/10Lost Song tries and fails in many aspects that are more successful in other popular anime. It plays with drama, comedy, and suspense. The problem Lost Song has with these tropes is that the story is so poorly configured that the tropes hardly work together in a seamless manner. Plot twists are tossed around from left and right in the midst of dramatic moments, each with an introduction that acts as if they\'re these huge, surprising discoveries that should be completely unexpected to the audience. I, however, found each plot twist to be entirely predictable due to the fact that the foreshadowing of events was less subtly hinted and more obviously thrown in your face through character interactions and expressions. For example, when I heard a line such as, ""Don\'t ever sing the Song of Mortality,"" it became detectable to me that the song would be sung anyway at some point, because why mention the song and how dangerous it is if no one is going to sing it in the future, right? That kind of dialogue, while sometimes can work in favor of foreshadowing, is used a lot in this anime, making it too easy to guess what will happen later on. This is a problem I noticed as a recurrence throughout the first half of the anime, and I was extremely disappointed because being able to predict future events in a show takes away the excitement involved. It also proves that not much clever thought was put into the story as a whole.On the other hand, the various bits of comedy that were included only seemed to be added as a means of preventing a moment of awkward silence, or as a means of slowing down a scene that was becoming too dramatic. The delivery of these jokes also felt forced instead of natural, and none of them really made me laugh either. Having a character scream out, ""There\'s food!? Where? Where\'s the food!?!?"" ever so often when another character randomly mentions food is not funny. Having a character attempt to explain why something isn\'t scientifically correct while the other characters interrupt him with, ""We don\'t care,"" isn\'t funny either. If anything, these types of lines are childish and cringy, and there\'s nothing funny about an adult or teenager acting like a child. Plus, I\'ve seen these exact same jokes before, so these aren\'t even original. I know comedy isn\'t a huge focus within Lost Song, since it isn\'t even listed as one of the genres, but there are hundreds of other anime that EXCEL in delivering good comedy when the focus also mostly revolves around drama and suspense.The story development in general isn\'t the best either. Pacing fluctuates between harshly rushed to push out as much information as possible and agonizingly slow as a consequence. Rinse and repeat. On top of that, the anime takes a drastic and questionable turn at the halfway mark where the story becomes way less predictable and a LOT more confusing. I can understand that the creators of this anime wanted to inflict shock within its audience by making such a sudden change in the story, but to me this change was too much for the type of setting presented in the beginning and felt as though the same idea could be accomplished with a change that was toned down a bit. Essentially, it seems like the story presented in Lost Song is trying too hard to achieve a ground-breaking plotline. By attempting to wow its watchers with such drama, heartbreak, and unexpected events in its twelve-episode time frame, the anime ends up tripping over itself and instead showcases a chaos of ideas and characters that aren\'t deeply explored.A last point I would like to mention before moving on is that Lost Song tries desperately to appeal to all audiences. On the surface it looks as though the anime is aiming for a younger female demographic with its shoujo-like art style and lack of raunchy themes, but with added gore, profanity, and a female character with breasts so big they look like they\'re about to spill out of her clothing, it seems like the anime is also trying to bring in an older female and male audience as well. This desperation to create an anime worth watching by all was so obvious that it was infuriating and distracting to the narrative trying to be told.Character | 2/10Throughout Lost Song, the story switches point of views between the two main characters: Rin and Finis. Besides their ability to control the elements with their songs, there\'s nothing about these characters that really stands out. Rin is optimistic and kind-hearted, and Finis is a naïve damsel in distress. For the two characters that are supposed to carry the whole story on their backs, the types of personalities they were given are ones that are extremely overused and boring. The goals they have are also entirely lackluster, and they give off the impression that the only reason these motives exist is only to advance the story. Rin\'s character in particular wants to find her true purpose in the world, which isn\'t a goal that encourages character development. Thus, Rin doesn\'t really develop at all due to the fact that she\'s already a ""good guy"" who has almost no reason to change or redeem herself. Finis, on the other hand, goes through a rapid development once her goal is hindered by the enemy of the anime. If done correctly, I might have thoroughly enjoyed Finis\'s sudden change in character considering it was probably the most interesting thing that happened. Unfortunately, with Finis\'s development came the unsatisfactory warping of the plot. The added confusion alongside her change really made it hard for me to appreciate the only piece of character development that was delivered.As for the abundance of supporting characters, it was easy to see not much thought was put into them either. This part of the cast is one full of stereotypes; the glasses character is the smart guy, the knight is the savior, the ugly guy is the villain, etc. so there\'s not really anything interesting about them. Over half of these characters are added with zero purpose to fulfil the plot other than using them to make conversation when things slowed down. All of these useless characters could have been cut from the anime entirely, and their screen time could have been replaced with scenes that explained the plot better or improved the pacing. Some anime do a great job managing a large cast of characters, but this isn\'t one of them.Art | 2/10I really hate judging an anime for its art, especially the older ones, but the art presented in Lost Song is utterly amateurish for the era of its release. It\'s 2018. Earlier this year we saw Violet Evergarden, and only a few weeks after Lost Song ended came Banana Fish. Compared to those two, the art style and animation of Lost Song looks as though it was released in the early 2000s. Multiple times throughout the anime, the movement of the characters felt really choppy and the least bit smooth. This was especially a problem when the characters were walking. It\'s clear to see that the animation budget was almost entirely spent on the animation of the characters singing, because it was only during those moments where it felt like the animation was somewhat up to par with other 2018 anime. It hurts me to say this, but I also didn\'t like how the character designs looked at all. Besides the villain being purposely made unsightly, I didn\'t find the rest of the cast to be pleasing to look at either.Sound | 2/10The music within this anime was what I was most excited for and most disappointed with.

It was pleasing to the eye, but at the same time I noticed that some of the art had been more 3D than 2D. Skeptical, I continued to watch and boy was I surprised!The story itself was one that I hadn't been expecting. For such a short Anime you would have thought that the story would be nothing special but in reality it was more than special! So many different plot twist and the story was lighthearted but explored deeper concepts. So many mysteries explained in ways that I would have never expected...them to be! Even a few hidden characters that were hidden in plain sight!Following Finis go through her story was, to say the least, breath taking. You start to connect with her on a level that is beyond anything you could have ever felt before. Seeing her connect with Rin added something to the story that was more of a surprise, but a sweet one.The art style was, as I had stated before, pleasing to the eye. I think they did a wonderful job with designing the characters and the backgrounds. Yes, there were a lot of different elements such as medieval like settings with a bit of a magical and futuristic aspect with the clothing and the inventions and such, but they complimented one another instead of one overpowering one another. It was never to harsh on the eyes, and they were paired together nicely. I stated before that there was a lot of 3D art involved with the 2D art, but I was surprised that never once did they interfere with one another.They actually went well together, and the 3D was done so well that most times you couldn't even tell that something was 3D. Of course there were things that were obviously 3D, but they weren't too bad.Being that this is an music based Anime, it's no surprise that the music was wonderful. The music in its own was powerful in it's own right. Everything had emotion coursing through it, and any song with lyrics had a deeper meaning to it than first looked over. In the end, when you hear the last two final songs, it was memorizing. The meaning of the songs, the feelings of the characters when they sing it, the feelings of all those around them, it becomes clear.You feel like you are in the moment when you listen to it.The characters were well thought out, different, and absolutely stunning. Instead of just having purely bad characters or purely good characters, there were characters from all places of the spectrum. You even had morally grey characters that made a large impact on the story. To see such a large variety of characters exist within the same universe, or as I would like to classify it, timeline, is something that feels similar to a breath of fresh air.

The anime have several flaw, but it is filled with good idea, with good songs and with love. For me, it is sufficient to have a 10/10.Lost song is, imho, very well writen, with many surprise and switch in the scenario (like in Steins;Gate or Madoka Magica for example) but more importantly every little details in the firsts episodes have a signification or are a metaphor, and after rewatching the anime I realized how well writen it is in its very little...details, down to the choice of the title.It is very surprising because Junpei to Morita (which seems to be a men duo of director) have not done a lot of thing in their career.Moreover, apart from the writing, it is important to note the genius inspiration that they had in the choice of the actors : The seiyuus chosen here are not really voice actress, but rather singers known for great songs in a lot of animes openings etc. The choice to construct the scenario and all the anime around those two women, are a great idea. The result is some of the most beautiful song of the animation, embedded in the hearth of the anime scenario. Great !Despite all this good points, the anime have some flaws : for example, there is some « naivité » in the beginning that could be repulsing and seems amateur, but truly, it is not.One other problem is that, like in Steins Gate, the beginning of the anime is more or less designed to be « classic » to enhance the contrast with the second part. So, by design, it could be difficult to watch in the beginning of the anime.But well, the very good points of the anime, from writing to songs are widely sufficient to put this away.I strongly recommend to watch Lost Song, it is a masterpiece. details, down to the choice of the title.It is very surprising because Junpei to Morita (which seems to be a men duo of director) have not done a lot of thing in their career.Moreover, apart from the writing, it is important to note the genius inspiration that they had in the choice of the actors : The seiyuus chosen here are not really voice actress, but rather singers known for great songs in a lot of animes openings etc. The choice to construct the scenario and all the anime around those two women, are a great idea.

It started off slow and, unfortunately, I dropped it in the middle of the third episode. I did, however, decide to pick it up the day before the final episode aired and I\'m glad that I went back to it.First off, as I said, the anime started off slow. If you\'re thinking of watching it, hang in there until episode 7. If you finish 7 and still think it\'s not worth your time, then go ahead and drop it. With episodes 7 and...8 your understanding of how things were happening is turned on its head. For that alone I loved it and, in the end, I decided to give the story a 10. It\'s not super unique, but unique enough that I think it stands out and I highly recommend it, even to people who aren\'t anime fans.The art is 9/10 for me. The animation is very clean for the most part, but there\'s small inconsistencies from time to time. The character designs are rather simple, but I think that it helps add charm to the anime in its own way. The lighting is done well and the 3D that is here and there meshes very well with the 2D The backgrounds are beautiful and the animation for the opening and ending songs are great. The ending even has subtle changes in it if you pay close attention!For the sound I give this anime a solid 10. This anime isn\'t a ""musical"" exactly, but it does have singing tied into it, obviously. There\'s a song sung about once or twice per episode, but nothing too overwhelming. The music and singing in this anime are top-notch-- even the minor characters that only join in on singing a few times have nice voices! If we manage to get the boxed set of Lost Song overseas with the OST, I\'m more than willing to spring for it.Characters I give a 9/10. They do typical tropes very well, but Finis was a great character and she\'s stuck with me as being rather unique. Some of the minor characters are even fun-- like an old man inventor with a parrot in a cage on his large backpack and a croissant on his walking cane that he randomly takes a bite off of while sitting in on a conversation.Enjoyment of this anime and overall, my score is definitely 10/10. I loved this anime so much and I hope that it gains popularity in the West so that we can see it released on BD/DVD. Everything meshes together so well and the plot twist that I didn\'t expect made me glad that I decided to go back and pick up the anime rather than dropping it altogether.TLDR: Give Lost Song a chance! Try to stick it through until the end of episode 7 and you\'ll be rewarded! 8 your understanding of how things were happening is turned on its head.

There were some flubs which made the writing come across poorly if not actually so, but overall it worked with what it was doing.There will be partial spoilers in my quick summaries for each rating. I\'ll try to be fairly vague with that stuff tho--STORY (9)I feel the story it was aiming for was implemented well through-out and, especially in hindsight, anything that felt off made a lot more sense. But it takes until a major event for this to begin making sense unless you already know about it or are just...that good at picking up the subtle hints.Tho there were some things that didn\'t work quite so well despite that, such as if something repeats itself then it should never have been so similar as if it were the original.And in regards to recanting memories after a big event, without them having to show everything, it was off-putting. Some serious liberties were taken to keep it interesting, concise, and simple. But the tone was off from the rest of the story and so I felt it wasn\'t done well and it still bugs me. I\'m also not a fan of memories in which stuff not actually experienced was shown so, again, it wasn\'t done well and is a big reason I\'d never give this a 10..ART (7)There were moments where there were some animation issues never corrected after broadcast, such as chunky hands for a bit and face markings disappearing for one scene where frames weren\'t reused. Overall tho there\'s nothing so distracting it can\'t be overlooked.Design-wise, I yawned far too frequently for. Some made sense given their character and their place in the story, but most I just didn\'t care for. It gave a nostalgic feel tho so it wasn\'t unbearable while watching. Just nothing I\'d have watched the series for, which is probably not a good thing in regard to marketing..SOUND (4)Honestly, for a story in which songs are so vital to the plot, they were seriously lackluster.

The plot was projected right down the step it had to be taken to say the least but this wasn\'t helped but the cliched characters, especially Prince Lood voiced by Yuto Suzuki being the jerkass prince towards one of the main characters and fiancee Finis voiced by Yukari Tamura and his rather stupid moments making him intentionally unlikable to every notion in the process. Character wise, the characters did as expected even down the simplest action at times and MANY TIMES LA predicted right what was happening. The character dynamic for the most part had a very black and white morality to it all, like Rin\'s growing company along with Finis and Henry Leobort were the good guys while EVERY ONE ELSE were evil and that just made the plot so obvious so much. Rin and Finis were the narrative focus and the main characters of the anime thus are good, Rin voiced by Konomi Suzuki was oblivious and was a glutton and loves to sing as her trait while Finis was the damsel in distress with no sense of direction. Henry Leobort voiced by Seiichirou Yamashita, Finis guard was the typical white knight and the perfect foil towards Lood. Rin\'s company, Al voiced by Misaki Kuno the gadgeteer genius, Pony Goodlight voiced by Chiaki Takahashi the alcoholic who doesn\'t want to be called old, and finally sisters Alyu and Monika Looks voiced by Asami Seto and Yuu Serizawa respectively as the genki talkative to the shy intorverted sleepy archetypal sisters.  The only character LA really liked was Finis\' maid Corte voiced by Ai Kayano, being Finis\' protector and helped WHENEVER she could and definitely deserved MVP during the first half not to mention she was so likable to a fault. So with all this being said, the second half changed EVERYTHING LA said about the first half to the point of redemption of the anime\'s story it had going for it.The second half by all means ""redeemed"" LA faith to Lost Song if anything it threw a curveball into the clicheness Lost Song had but even then with this LA would say because of the second half, the first half was the building block and setup to what the second half had going for it. LA will say talk potential spoilers right now, so look away or WATCH THIS SERIES NOW then come back!.Ok, so Lost Song incorporates ""time travel"" into the mix and this can either go in the way of Steins;Gate and bring in a good time travel story, or on the other hand, bring in one confusing plotline that can end badly but like LA said Lost Song\'s setup paid off for the most part and the anime thought through all the time travel hijinks leaving NO plot holes as far as LA knows as LA theorized and tried to get the story straight for a LONG time before LA concluded that the time traveling plotline had no plot holes. See from what LA could gather Lost Song incorporated converging timelines along with it\'s time loop in order to tell it\'s story and allowed the story to fit into itself properly, that and LA wasn\'t trying to be bias that ""just because this theory works, no plot holes, no problems"", LA thought through it from alternative timeline theories to in media res, or split segmented storylines, but it was for the most part the one theory that made sense to all this was the branching converged timeline theory (LA only say this as Lost Song NEVER properly say what kind of time travel shenanigans it did to the plot and expected us to follow through...see that how you will, this along with LA\'s branching converging timeline theory as LA won\'t contest this theory is definitive) and because of this HUGE revelations made the link to Rin in the process. In terms of characters, the majority of the cast had some stake in the plot or improved the character through some plot twists about them later, the only two LA really didn\'t see improving were the Look sisters, yes they helped out Rin\'s cause, but not much after that. The greatest character development would go to Finis mainly on what she went through and her degradation of her personality to where she got to, nonetheless from damsel in distress to a major factor and stake to the plot in which HER drive caused it all was a massive improvement from her first half counterpart and even though Finis was a heavily flawed character especially with her beliefs and plans she had going for it, Finis nabbed LA\'s favourite character overall, this is helped that she was the most fleshed out character from the entire cast.Ohh and the second half gave us a MUCH BETTER villain in the form of Bazra voiced by Tsuyoshi Koyama, though his motivations were alot more ambitious than Prince Lood, jerkass for the sake of being a jerkass, Lost Song\'s villain department nonetheless was cliche all around unfortunately as much as Bazra was an massive improvement in terms of villainy.The animation done by Dwango and LIDENFILMS was visually striking to the eye for the most part, from the great amount of backgrounding to the colorful character designs. The animation all around was consistent and this is especially with the character designs which for LA was the highlight of the series next to the beautiful backgrounding work it had. The the other side of the spectrum however, the CGI royal orchestra was annoyingly blatant to say the least, like LA will say this time and again but DON\'T PUT HUMAN CHARACTERS THROUGH FULL CGI UNLESS THE ENTIRE SERIES IS CGI, it just made them stand out even more is what LA is saying but the CGI on some of the mechanical structures gets a pass and was at least incorporated right.  Nonetheless, the animation was crisp, exotic and interesting to watch for the most part.Voice acting, well this is interesting to say the least, well you know Konomi Suzuki is voicing one of the main characters, you may know Konomi Suzuki as the singer of several OP\'s like Absolute Duo, Ange Veirge, Freezing Vibration, Madan no Ou to Vanadis, No Game, No Life, Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu and Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!. LA was a HUGE fan before her role in this anime and her first debut in voice acting...was decent all things considered and was a good decent debut role to be put in an anime that had elements of singing in it. Now as much as Konomi Suzuki was interesting to see in the voice cast, Yukari Tamura utterly steamrolled any other voice actor in this anime without a doubt, Yukari Tamura did her expected stuff and LA loved her portrayal as Finis and by all accounts Yukari Tamura had the most diverse range in voicing Finis throughout the anime, again expected of a veteran like Yukari Tamura. Misaki Kuno crossdressing as Al was interesting as well, though it had Misaki\'s typical high pitched vocals, LA was still fine with Misaki and had some oddly good chemistry with Konomi Suzuki. The only other voice actor LA would talk about would be Ai Kayano being the extremely supportive character of Mel and Corte and LA didn\'t even noticed Ai Kayano was pulling double duty not until LA saw the VA cast list. The singing portions for the most part was great, coming from singers in general of both Yukari Tamura and Konomi Suzuki, LA thinks this was expected to say the least. The voice cast is utterly amazing to say the least, even towards many of the minor characters and even the villains, this voice cast was exceptional with the tremendous help of Yukari Tamura keeping it all together (Can you tell LA is a fanboy of Yukari Tamura?).The finale, tied up many of the loose plotlines though the later half of anime was already doing that with Rin and Finis but nonetheless, the finale DID fill in the remaining plotlines and was bittersweet to say the least but with a good side to it all in some sense if the anime had anything to say about it. Lost Song IS an original anime thus had some decency to give us a full story and end it when it need to and it did just that.Lost Song is something of a hidden gem, hidden from the already cliched plot from the first half which detriments the anime even further but nonetheless the anime\'s second half redeemed itself quite well and effectively made the first half something of building block to the overall story as cliche as it is and no LA isn\'t saying it because LA was a fan of both Konomi Suzuki and Yukari Tamura thus gives a pass to the story, Lost Song\'s second half was where LA interest skyrocketed, theorizing and gotten into many of the main characters and what their plans or plot twists what were to come were in the process that was almost unpredictable  with the first half as predictable as that was, was made as a leverage in making itself better in the process as well. Sure Lost Song  isn\'t the best thing LA saw in the season of Spring 2018 but nonetheless it had a solid structure to itself and it KNEW what it wanted to tell as at first cliched then turn confusing and risky as it was at the end of it all. Lost Song is seriously a hidden gem of an anime and ambitious to a fault that LA at first discredited as cliche...as much as Lost Song has some clicheness to it, it DOES NOT take away the the latter half\'s success and intrigue that it followed through with vigor.Lost Song is one of the more ambitious yet risky animes LA had seen for the Spring 2018 that actually pulled through all it\'s ambitious and risk into making a fully fleshed out and satisfying story and characters and because of this, it definitely gets LA\'s hidden gem of Spring 2018. all hell and back and seeing plot twists coming from a mile away.

The plot revolves around Rin, a young girl who dreams to sing with the orchestra at the capital, and Finis, a naive and charming woman that simply enjoys singing, in times when the menace of war comes closer by the day. What is special about these women is the fact that their singing is magical, as it shows on the first episode, and it quickly becomes a tool to move the plot forwards.PLOT:The anime starts well enough: side characters are introduced and some difficulties...are overcome. At this stage, it feels just like a generic anime - there are some overused tropes and stereotypes thrown into the mix, which does not improve the experience. All in all, the art and the sound are pretty good, though the side characters feel a bit bland. Besides Rin and Finis, the main characters, I could only really care about Henry Leobold, a just, strong and courteous knight from a rich and honorable background. Regarding the antagonists, their motives are also cliché and predictable. I couldn\'t feel anything towards them (they were indeed quite generic), though they can make us react accordingly once in a while.Then, approaching 2/3 of the series, the plot twist happens. Mind you - it is not a plot twist, it is THE plot twist. It definitely is one of the best I have ever seen. It made me realize how well-executed the anime has been up until that point, which I was blind to due to the lack of knowledge. It instantly made me hooked to the show and, for that reason alone, I am inclined to eventually rewatch the series. After that point, the whole main plot does become more interesting. There is room for character growth during the end of the anime and it does happen to some of them.My main disapproval is that Lost Song remains with those same cringy tropes and some lackluster scenes that made me roll my eyes throughout the entire show. There was one specific scene that had some good tension built up only to end up in an infuriating ""I can\'t believe that is what happened"" shortly thereafter. I had to pause and take a deep breath at that moment. My feelings towards the ending are mixed, as there are some truly great moments, though it lacks in other parts.CONCLUSION:All in all, Lost Song has a fine story with a HUGE plot twist - and I mean it. Its art and sound direction are amazing, as it revolves around music and the special effects by them created. The main characters are interesting, though almost all the others suffer from the same things: they are lackluster and quite annoying, having some non-important subplots that just take screen time. I feel that Lost Song could have been a much, much better anime if only the side characters were more interesting and less focused on unnecessary drama. Still, it was an enjoyable show - if you are in doubt about it, it is worth watching due to the plot twist alone, although try not to expect much about the anime. are overcome.

You have abilities, you suffer a tragedy, you have an adventure, and you realize that there is more, much more to the world than you\'ve ever imagined. It reminded me of Terranigma, but with more singing.If you\'re looking for a fantasy/medieval anime and you got burned badly by Grancrest, I highly recommend Lost Song. It doesn\'t try to shove 10 volumes into 24 episodes (which is more like 4 volumes and change if you value quality, and A-1 or the production committee clearly didn\'t), there is believability in the plot and characters as...a result, and the thematic elements give the story a clear direction, but allow for the plot to take a sudden turn. Plus, there are bards. You can\'t have a proper fantasy/medieval anime without a bard somewhere. Honestly, I kinda wish that this was a 2-cour anime so that loose ends could be tied up, but evidently that wasn\'t in the budget.Visuals are, in my opinion, the show\'s weakness. Aside from Finis, the character designs are like a shonen manga artist designed all the women; From certain angles and using certain expressions, Rin\'s face looks almost like a guy with a wig. Then there\'s the designs for the supporting women... Uh, tone down the cleavage, guys. Those tops look insanely uncomfortable. It\'s like someone in the design team wanted to see breasts, but the studio forbade them from showing nudity. The show doesn\'t take a lot of wide shots early on for a very good reason that is revealed midway through the story. Once you start seeing them in the last couple of episodes, pause the playback and take a look around.It would be a travesty if a show about a ""lost song"" had mediocre music or vocals. Rin\'s voice actress has a superb singing voice, and Yukarin as always delivers a solid performance as Finis, and her ""Song of Endings"" is one of her best songs yet. Unfortunately the soundtrack isn\'t particularly memorable, but at least it\'s not as ridiculous as the Symphogear franchise.Solid 8. I wish the show were longer (the plot twist felt rushed and there are loose ends), and the character designs weren\'t that great overall; good singing and execution otherwise. a result, and the thematic elements give the story a clear direction, but allow for the plot to take a sudden turn.

The music and art is very nice and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it seemed like the anime played way too safe to the point they're not taking any risks.Story: This part is its weak point. The story felt like those generic original stories you find on Wattpad, Fictionpress or Quotev trying to be the next Disney movie. Because it is. It's very predictable to the point that you can just go in blind and able to make an accurate picture of what's going to happen next, plays way too safe...and the context of the story has been done a million times over every media you can imagine. Now, that doesn't mean they screwed up the most generic story a 5 year old can think of, which thankfully they didn't, and I do like to watch it when I get home from uni, there is this plot twist that kinda got me off guard and I thought this anime starts getting interesting, but other than that, it doesn't have anything that'll excite me.Art: I find the art style to be pretty good. The environment is pretty and the characters look nice. Although that chest on Pony is distracting and out of place for this anime. The animations, I had to say is alright. Most part, the animators did well, but there's some part that are choppy that my eyes snap to and I get distracted because of it. Like someone disappearing on a horse out of thin air. I didn't know how that happened since it's 2D.Sound: The music is pretty good. Konomi Suzuki's and Yukari Tamura's singing were pretty excellent and I do find the OP and ED catching and got me in. But compared to other animes of the season, the music is generic. As for the sound effects.... ehhh alright I guess.Characters: Just like the story: incredibly generic and you can predict their personalities just by face value. That glasses boy? An aspiring scientist and the smart guy of the group. The knight guy? Knight in Shining Armour that's always good and the princess falls to. That General? General Ripper. Hell, even the two main characters? Pretty much Anna and Elsa in anime. Hell, you could tell their personalities just by their attractiveness. If they look good, that's because they're good. If they look dark and/or ugly, expect them to be against you or dicks. That doesn't mean I don't like them (in fact I do like the glasses boy who wants to be a scientist and the smart guy of the group, and Anime!Anna), but nothing about them is any original. I've seen these tropes applied to these guys with slight variations.Enjoyment: While the genericness of the story and characters distract me a lot, I do enjoy the anime especially for the music and maybe the art. I've heard that this is Konomi Suzuki first take on being the MC of the anime and honestly, she did alright.Overall, this anime is generic and doesn't stand out in that season. It tries way too hard to be a family friendly Disney anime, but it comes off as a team of amateurs trying to write a story that's BEING a family friendly Disney anime. If I wanna watch something similar to this, I'd go and buy a ticket or stream some Disney movie like Frozen, or go to Wattpad, Fictionpress or Quotev and read their stories there. and the context of the story has been done a million times over every media you can imagine.

They started to get repetitive by near the end of the series but besides that they where all very good.Despite how much I enjoyed Lost Song it still has some very big issues and I wouldn't be surprised if someone dropped Lost Song by the 8-9th episode but I would recommend watching it one of the supporting cast which I could see someone drop the series because of that although that really isn't a flaw but it could be handled way better then it was and for anyone invested in that relationship it was pretty annoying but it did make sense on why they did that.And this is probably more of a personal preference kind of thing but I wish it had a bigger verity of songs instead of the 6 or so that we had.

It has a loveable cast of characters, all of whom have their own unique quirks and personality. The art style was unique and felt to me like a mix of Victorian and fantasy, which worked really well for the theme of the show. The name of the show, ""Lost Song"" tells you right away that music plays a very pivotal role in this anime, so you\'d expect the songs to be decent. I\'m very happy to say that the songs are the strongest part of this anime, seconded only by some of the characters. I\'ve listened...to the OST over six times since finishing the show and the songs are still just as breathtaking as when I first listened to them. So with all of the praise, why would I give it such a low rating?The main problem with this anime has to deal with the plot. It\'s completely predictable leading up to episode seven and even then; you know exactly what\'s going to happen between Finis and Henry. When your prediction inevitably proves to be right - the entire plot is turned on its head. The plot twist itself wasn\'t bad, but what comes after is completely nonsensical.We\'re lead to believe that Finis, the second main character, lived for over 60,000 years after destroying the country because she was tricked into burning her lover to death by a jealous and petty prince. I can absolutely believe that she\'d sing the song of mortality and doom the country to a fiery death. What I can\'t believe is what follows this act. Following her little bout of genocide, she\'s supposed to have lived for at least 60,000 years and in that frame of time; history has repeated itself the exact same way over and over. Finally, after those 60,000 long years have reached their conclusion, Finis will execute her plan to sing the song of Mortality one final time to destroy the entire world. But hold on a minute, Rin finally gets some screentime (after two episodes of obscurity) and she\'ll touch the sword that Finis held onto when she doomed the world to ruin 60,000 years (or more) ago.This leads to Rin learning what happened during those 60,000 years including the fact that Rin was born from the song of healing that Finis threw away. But wait... How could Rin have been born from the song of healing that Finis threw away if Rin wasn\'t born until after it was thrown away? Am I confusing you yet? Because the show will confuse the everloving hell out of you. Rin was adopted by a General of the capital who raised her as his own. Rin was present when Finis sang the song of mortality, but this makes no sense because Rin was born tens of thousands of years after Finis first sang the song of mortality. The show is filled to the brim with plotholes such as these.I almost forgot to bring this up, but the show is very much a victim of black and white morality. You have the good guys and the bad guys. The prince is a bad guy and the knight is a good guy. The only exception to this rule is Finis herself.In the end, I recommend that you watch the show for the adorable cast and the beautiful OST. Don\'t pay too much attention to the plot because it makes no sense. I feel like the writer meant to include time travel in the plot, but never got around to it or never bothered to do so. Even with the plot being as messed up as it is, the characters, the soundtrack, and the art more than makeup for these shortcomings. to the OST over six times since finishing the show and the songs are still just as breathtaking as when I first listened to them.

Beautifully crafted story, made me invested to the main characters. I wanted the villain to fall and I cheered for the main characters to succeed. And the twist is freaking divine. Everything perfectly fits and you could see that they're building towards it from the very beginning.Though, I think the primary plot itself is nothing special, and dare I say, rather weak towards the end. The ones who needed miracle and salvation the most laid unsaved and without miracle, and this perhaps highlights my own lacking more than...the anime, but the ending just...doesn't shake me enough.If you consider watching it, do it. You won't regret it. the anime, but the ending just...doesn't shake me enough.If you consider watching it, do it. You won't regret it."", ""Upon finishing Lost Song I had a hard time sorting out my thoughts about the show. I honestly could have landed anywhere between a 4 and a 6 on this series, and by this time next week I may have completely changed my mind on that ranking. In the end though - or at least for now - I settled on a 6 because there's clearly a lot of passion behind this show and in its best moments it does shine. In its worst though it is fumbling and almost laughable.It's always nicer to finish on a high note, so I'll start with where this...show falls down. Part of its problem is it suffers from an overabundance of earnestness. The result of this is that its fumbles end up far more noticeable, because they are treated with such drama and seriousness.Beyond this, the show struggles to really establish any particularly interesting characters, and most of them come across as recycled tropes and not particularly deeply evoked. As a protagonist Rin is fine, occasionally charming, but mostly nothing you wouldn't expect and haven't seen many times before. Finis starts off as almost painful to watch, but as the only character that actually gets significant development, becomes somewhat more interesting as the show goes on. Al barely warrants mentioning, Pony Goodlight's (what?) only remarkable trait is how she avoids wardrobe malfunctions.Of the two villains, Prince Rudo is the more interesting for how thoroughly unlikable he is made. The characterisation is not nearly as well done, but there's more than a little of Joffrey Baratheon about him. Other than that the other key antagonist is, like many of the other characters, an archetype that's far from original.The plot starts of wholly unremarkable, but gradually builds to something reasonably interesting around the halfway mark, before subsiding back into mediocrity for the series' end.So what did I like? Well this is a show about music and the music is excellent - or at least the big insert songs are. The OP and ED are forgettable (I literally can't think they sound like as I write this), but the two main spirit songs in particular are great. Which is good, because in a show like this, they really needed to be. The first of these is the Song of Healing, which features in the first episode and is every bit as stirring and uplifting as one might hope. The second comes around the midway point and represents the high point of the series. Indeed it almost makes you forget about the painful amounts of cringe that undercut what should have been a dramatic moment immediately prior to it.Ultimately this is a show that tries hard, and it managed to gain my attention at times, whilst utterly losing me at others. It did stick around in my mind though, so there's something to be said for that. It isn't particularly original or daring, but it has its charms. This isn't essential viewing, but it isn't a waste of time either. show falls down. Part of its problem is it suffers from an overabundance of earnestness.

The artwork was colourful and appealing to the eye and the voice acting was also quite good. The plot used for the series was interesting and did strike a curiosity to see how the story would play out. The anime opens up with the characters all standing around each other, then changes to focus on the build up to that moment. The story focuses on Rin and Finis who are accompanied by a lovable supporting cast. The second half of the anime (Episode 8 - 12) left a couple of unanswered questions. It would...have been nice to see why Bazra was so against the royals / wanted to achieve his goals. As well as it would have been nice to have seen a little more into Finis' and Henry's past as well as see into other characters lives a little more too, though with only 12 episodes, it does make sense why some of these questions may have been left unanswered.The ending was bittersweet and although it would be a lovely surprise to have a season 2 of this series, Lost Song was tied up nicely enough to also leave it as it is.

Koroshi Ai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/44516/Koroshi_Ai,"['I think it\'s really obvious this is not the end of story yet from what happen in last episode, so you can check the manga to know about the continuation. I thought they will adapt till next arc because it will put conclusion to Chateau past but they don\'t so I am pretty disappointed for that. They need 1-2 more episodes honestly. Other than that, it\'s not so bad adaptation. I will say this again and again that this is psychological manga but as usual MAL doesn\'t put the genre here. I ever put new psychological manga in MAL and they remove the psychological tag...so just check source like mangaupdates because it makes a huge difference if you see this as normal manga vs psychological. It\'s like this, in romance psychological it\'s normal if their romance is unusual, so people who read already prepare for it but if you think this is normal, maybe people who is not used to it will think, ""wtf is going on"" ""Why their relationship is weird"" ""They don\'t have chemistry"", so on. I will explain this more later.Story:The story will focus more on the character background and events surrounding them with a bit of action (It\'s rare for female demographic action manga to have a lot of action like shounen manga). Some people maybe found this story too slow, especially if you are used to watch anime with a lot of shit going on since episode 1 like Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan, Jujutsu Kaisen (Which I can\'t relate because I am used to slow paced story)About characters:What I like about this story is how the character is really mysterious but that\'s what draw me to them. And when the mystery revealed everything will make sense. (I know because I read the manga). If I may describe, it\'s kinda like exchange relationship, but they care about each other, there is mix of guilt, sense of salvation, etc. In other words, hard to describe. But their unusual relationship is the thing that make them interesting. But unfortunately they don\'t adapt next arc so not everything about Chateau revealed and Ryangha\'s past will be revealed more in the next next arc.Some people said they don\'t have chemistry. Well, their chemistry is uncommon for sure. Again, this is psychological romance, usually their chemistry is uncommon. For example: A manipulate B to love A, in the end B is really attached with A and B think he is in love with A. Do you think they have chemistry? Not at all, their love start through manipulation but that\'s just how psychological romance are. Their romance usually unusual because the way they behave depend on their personality, environment, their value, circumstance, etc etc. It\'s not as simple as I love you, you love me because they are usually more unique and more human.Sound:I really like the OP and ED, OP really match the atmosphere of the anime, ending match sad past of Ryangha and Chateau (which is maybe why the ED have Ryangha and Chateau there). The OST is also match with the anime.Enjoyment:I really enjoy the anime, just disappointed they cut the ending there.This is for people who often misunderstood this anime:Is this romance anime? Yeah but this is anime adapted from manga and even the manga haven\'t reach the romance part. There are many manga with slow romance that need to reach so many chapters for them to finally together. Do you know Akatsuki no Yona? Do you know when Yona finally realize Hak feeling despite the genre being romance? More than 150 chapters.Is this about a girl who fall in love with toxic man? Not really, we don\'t know yet. The manga is psychological, you can check mangaupdates, don\'t depend on MAL for genre. What usually happen in psychological romance manga? It\'s not rare for the relationship to be toxic or unusual to the point you don\'t even know if it\'s love or obsession or manipulation or they just need someone to cling. So maybe in the future this manga will be like that but what you need to know for sure is, this anime never try to make their relationship as if it\'s normal or a good romance. If people think their ""chemistry"" is a good romance, that\'s not the anime\'s fault, that\'s just depend on how each person think of something they see. Don\'t blame everything on the author. This anime acknowledge that Ryang-ha is dangerous person. If you don\'t like the male lead to be a bad person, you don\'t like psychological romance, then don\'t watch this but please, that\'s your own taste so don\'t leave weird comment pretend this is a bad story just because it\'s not your taste.""Some scenes are illogical""Before you said this, please check first if it really impossible or not. I have met a lot of people like this, they said this is impossible, this is illogical, but truth is, most of them just ignorant because when I search about it, immediately appear in internet that it ever happens. I found someone like this in forum Koroshi Ai. Please don\'t embarrass yourself by criticize something you don\'t even know. World is full of surprising things you maybe never heard.

By expression, Love of Kill seemed like a show that looked promising at first glance with its alluring premise. Yet, behind the story, characters, and overall ideas, we get one of the most lazy and lackluster shows of 2022.Based on the manga of the same name, the premise sounds alluring for its appeal of bounty hunting, assassination, espionage, and dealing with the criminal underworld. We really don't see these type of shows too often in an era dominated by isekai, rom-coms, and popular mainstream franchises....Keep in mind, Love of Kill is by no means a mainstream franchise yet did gain enough suppor and popularity for an anime adaptation. So why the disappointment? Why did Love of Kill flop?The truth is, this show is lackluster with one of the most lazy and forced relationships I've seen this year. Yes, I'm talking about two of the main characters: Chateau Dankworth and Song Ryang-ha. The first episode wastes no time with Song trying to woo Chateau into a date with her. The mysterious hitman offers his services in exchange for companionship. With a cold and stoic personality, you can practically imagine her reactions. It's a recurring gag in the show with Song constantly trying to please Chateau. However, it's also shown that Song is a dangerous individual who managed to exterminate many Hong Kong triads. He has a big target on his back and by being close with Chateau, she too comes into contact with danger. The show makes it clear that the two are targeted after a run-in with a powerful man named Donald. As the story progresses, we are told through background storytelling and narratives that reveals their pasts.Why do I call this show lazy? The answer is quite simple as the anime takes little effort to develop our main characters. Our two main protagonists' pasts may be important and have depth, but outside of that shows how bleak they really are. To call them mildly entertaining would even be an overstatement. Chateau is way too overfocused on her work while Son displays a pokerface persona to the point of being ridiculous. Their character chemistry appears to be cartoonish from the very start. It drags the overall mood of the show together. Because let's face it, how important is their relationship when there's much more mystery and suspense in the story? Even having the genre tag with 'romance' seems absurd. The romance we get out of this show is forced and feels scripted.There's one saving grace to this show and that is the adult cast and more mature themes. Dealing with the underworld and criminal organizations offers an refreshing look than a typical school life setting. Some story episodes also takes characters to more exotic places such as on a cruise. If there's one shining hope for this show, it would be for the age of the cast and some of the world settings. Of course, adults have repsonsibilities and that also translates to the supporting cast such as Euripedes, Jim, among others. However, you will be quite disappointed by their overall development for the story. It's a 12-episode adaptation and we're not getting a deep dive into their pasts like our main protagonists.Now, I admit that I'm not the target audience for this show. It's targeted more towards adult women, or more specifically the josei demographic. However, anyone can practically watch this show as it contains elements of mystery, suspense, and drama. I'm leaving romance out of that list since it's so lackluster, something that holds the anime back from day one. However, Studio Vision did their best to salvage the show by crafting mature looking characters. Almost every character in the show has a masculine look, into Chateau. There's no doubt that they wanted to give the impression of a more mature looking show from the start. Meanwhile, I do applaud some aspects of the show's chereography. It feels like a thriller and sometimes captures the suspenseful atmosphere of the story. Some episodes even feel like mini movies.After watching Love of Kill's 12 episodes adaptation, this show turned out to be a prime example of medicority. What could've been a stellar thriller turned into a forced relationship with little to no redeeming quality. It's too bad because the promotional material did entice me into accepting Love of Kill as a potential dark horse of 2022. But in the end, we got a show that was too good to be true. Keep in mind, Love of Kill is by no means a mainstream franchise yet did gain enough suppor and popularity for an anime adaptation. So why the disappointment?

It drags the overall mood of the show together. Because let's face it, how important is their relationship when there's much more mystery and suspense in the story? Even having the genre tag with 'romance' seems absurd. The romance we get out of this show is forced and feels scripted.There's one saving grace to this show and that is the adult cast and more mature themes. Dealing with the underworld and criminal organizations offers an refreshing look than a typical school life setting. Some story episodes also takes characters to more exotic places such as on a cruise. If there's one shining hope for this show, it would be for the age of the cast and some of the world settings. Of course, adults have repsonsibilities and that also translates to the supporting cast such as Euripedes, Jim, among others. However, you will be quite disappointed by their overall development for the story. It's a 12-episode adaptation and we're not getting a deep dive into their pasts like our main protagonists.Now, I admit that I'm not the target audience for this show. It's targeted more towards adult women, or more specifically the josei demographic. However, anyone can practically watch this show as it contains elements of mystery, suspense, and drama. I'm leaving romance out of that list since it's so lackluster, something that holds the anime back from day one. However, Studio Vision did their best to salvage the show by crafting mature looking characters. Almost every character in the show has a masculine look, into Chateau. There's no doubt that they wanted to give the impression of a more mature looking show from the start. Meanwhile, I do applaud some aspects of the show's chereography. It feels like a thriller and sometimes captures the suspenseful atmosphere of the story. Some episodes even feel like mini movies.After watching Love of Kill's 12 episodes adaptation, this show turned out to be a prime example of medicority. What could've been a stellar thriller turned into a forced relationship with little to no redeeming quality. It's too bad because the promotional material did entice me into accepting Love of Kill as a potential dark horse of 2022. But in the end, we got a show that was too good to be true."", 'I\'m not an English speaker, and I don\'t have a degree, so don\'t expect too much from here.Koroshi Ai is a Josei anime. What is a Josei anime? Josei (女性), also known as redīsu komikkusu (レディースコミックス lit. ""women\'s comics"") or redikomi (レディコミ) is a demographic of manga and anime aimed especially at adult women. ... In Japanese, the word josei means only ""feminine"" and has no sexual connotation.This according to Google.So is there a problem with this? The answer is no.Josei anime are mainly directed towards women because of the male character, but what man doesn\'t like a good male character (??????? bro??).I really like...these types of characters because for some reason, I only adore male characters (not sexually oriented), possibly because I identify with them more.Leaving the male character aside, which is possibly the best, it\'s time to talk about the other features of the series.The story would literally be a Love is War, because Ryang-ha Song (the boy) is constantly betting his life on the girl, because the story is this, the boy (a murderer) likes a girl who has tried to kill him (a bounty hunter I think it was).We also have the rare flashbacks, which tell us a bit of background about some part of his story with many unknowns.The animation looks nice and entertaining (I see it on Crunchyroll, possibly that\'s why), with a chill touch in the story as well as a dark one, because the story of a murderer isn\'t exactly pretty.It has its essence of relaxation, which makes you continue watching the chapters without bothering you about anything.In summary (after this bad, poorly organized and messy review), Koroshi Ai is an action romance story that will leave you attentive in all of its episodes, with the main participation of my dear Ryang-ha Song (I like , but not sexually, I repeat).At the moment it has 3 chapters so I don\'t think you\'ll lose much by giving this little gem a moment, which over time will gain a lot of history in her series.(If I end up liking the series more, I\'ll raise the grade, for now, to a 7 for these 3 episodes).As I always say, thank you very much if you have reached this part and thank you for your support, have a good day. these types of characters because for some reason, I only adore male characters (not sexually oriented), possibly because I identify with them more.Leaving the male character aside, which is possibly the best, it\'s time to talk about the other features of the series.The story would literally be a Love is War, because Ryang-ha Song (the boy) is constantly betting his life on the girl, because the story is this, the boy (a murderer) likes a girl who has tried to kill him (a bounty hunter I think it was).We also have the rare flashbacks, which tell us a bit of background about some part of his story with many unknowns.The animation looks nice and entertaining (I see it on Crunchyroll, possibly that\'s why), with a chill touch in the story as well as a dark one, because the story of a murderer isn\'t exactly pretty.It has its essence of relaxation, which makes you continue watching the chapters without bothering you about anything.In summary (after this bad, poorly organized and messy review), Koroshi Ai is an action romance story that will leave you attentive in all of its episodes, with the main participation of my dear Ryang-ha Song (I like , but not sexually, I repeat).At the moment it has 3 chapters so I don\'t think you\'ll lose much by giving this little gem a moment, which over time will gain a lot of history in her series.(If I end up liking the series more, I\'ll raise the grade, for now, to a 7 for these 3 episodes).As I always say, thank you very much if you have reached this part and thank you for your support, have a good day.', 'For an anime that’s supposedly about a romance between a pair of assassins, there is neither romance nor a pair of assassins. There is one assassin and a foreign woman who gets roped into trouble because of him.Chateau Dankworth is supposedly a professional bounty hunter. But not on screen. Instead, a random hitman beats her to her target more than once, leaving her to clear dead bodies and put up with the messes he makes. She acts like a tsundere on the outside but lacks a tsundere’s inner charm, making her a boring, non-functional character.But maybe that random hitman will be an interesting character, right?...Eh. Son Ryang-ha is that stereotypical closed-eyed character who acts goofy, but when he opens his eyes a crack, you know an Important Thing or Epic Feat is about to go down. It’s either one or the other and nothing in between, which makes him a bland, boring character.Maybe I’m being too critical about the romance aspect since it’s only been a few episodes. But it has been a few episodes, and Chateau and Ryang-ha have no chemistry. Their meetings are disasters, and not in a cute way. There’s too much of a power imbalance between them for their relationship to be compelling. I was interested in this anime because I thought it’d be a cute rivals-to-lovers between two equally capable assassins, but Ryang-ha is far stronger, faster, and overall more competent, making Chateau appear like a ditzy foreigner who fell into a mess leagues beyond her abilities.At least the anime gave a proper name to the secretary, though his lack of a mouth and his robotic accent are off-putting.

Just kidding, it isn’t like that… for now. The relationship between Chateau, the female bounty hunter, Ryang-Ha Song, the male hitman who somehow has a bounty on his head, is a whole lot mysterious and weird but still interesting. The story focuses on how a bounty hunter and hitman work together to complete their jobs.Ryang-Ha Song pointed out how rare it is to find women in his line of work, killing targets that get in his way. Most of them are from the underworld, so that may be a plus to society. His...easygoing nature with skills as a hitman makes him famously dangerous throughout the bounty hunter agencies and the underworld.Back to the topic, Ryang-Ha Song has a vast knowledge of how the underworld operates and is interested in Chateau even more because she took this job despite knowing the danger she is going to face. Seizing this chance, he decides to make a deal with her: locate and bag her targets in exchange to get close and knowing more about her in a romantic way.So basically, Love of Kill is placed between serious comedy and mystery. The focus lies on the relationship between Chateau and Ryang-Ha Song. A bounty hunter and a hitman. The anime won't reveal any of the details that we’re looking for, but hey, this is part of the mystery, right?

So far you can expect most action scenes to be skipped or reduced down to a short 2 second blip. That\'s the good part. The bad is when you notice things like how they take a still image of a car and slide it across the screen.

Well, it is just a soap opera josei stalking simulator.The story begins with a CRIMINAL, stalking a girl pretty PERSISTANTLY, Really? josei fans like that?Then comes the following supporting cast1)A character who fakes an accent like that one tryhard weeb in discord (also has no mouth)2)Nice guy employer who does cringe comedy bits with the above character and serves as sock factor/damsel in distress3)Main love interest whose only interesting aspect is she is not a morning person and always a damsel in distress who need saving but still remains Tsundere to a...man she owes her life to multiple times.4)The MC who is “Oh i just  stalk her against her will to protect her and also we have a history together”Then we get a teaser/flashback at a mystery in the making which does hit on the curiosity part of the brain a bit. The Unraveled mystery is quite good NGL but this payoff came rather late , since we keep moving in circles for the first 10 for apparently no good reason, just soap opera BS with nothing of note.The bad soundtrack is repeated constantly, Their is a recap for three minutes per episode, romance is none existent its mostly just stalking simulator with a bit of mystery and a bit of violence and ofc bishounen (josei anime).Do not bother with this one unless you have nothing else to watch , a bad production of what seems to be a mediocre source , which makes it even worse :/ man she owes her life to multiple times.4)The MC who is “Oh i just  stalk her against her will to protect her and also we have a history together”Then we get a teaser/flashback at a mystery in the making which does hit on the curiosity part of the brain a bit.

And come this Winter, mangaka Fe\'s Koroshi no Ai a.k.a Love of Kill (the Japanese title connotation pun for killing each other) is silently a low-key combination of ""Kaguya-sama: Love is War"" in terms of romance and more like Mr and Mrs. Smith\'s version of ""Spy X Family"" in terms of mystery and suspense in the making (before the actual thing coming next season) as a stopgap measure. And for better...or worse, the anime adaptation kinda faltered when compared to the manga of the same name.How Koroshi Ai was penned by mangaka Fe, it\'s actually quite a surprise to say the least. Originally published on Pixiv in October 2012 under a very long title (which is quite the mouthful), it gained a huge following so much as to spawn a sequel, then combine them both under Media Factory\'s Shoujo manga magazine Monthly Comic Gene for serialization, and that\'s how the series which depicted an assassin couple in love came about. And sure enough, it is the meeting between two assassins: a male and a female. Of course, who am I kidding.The bounty hunter Chateau Dankworth and professional hitman Song Ryang-ha, both meeting coincidentally due to the professions of their missions, and being assassins they attempt to erase the other in a swift and fast action, to which the latter won. But instead of killing her, he decides to have fun by tagging along with her, even to the point of bounty hunter assassintion missions just to get her attention, to which she constantly rejects his romantic advances. To add things into the mix, Chateau\'s agency, Ritzland Support, soon finds themselves tasked with taking down a hitman who\'s wanted across many organizations for single-handledly taking down the Hong Kong Triads, and this hitman is no other than Song Ryang-ha. This, at the very beginning, is where the ""show, don\'t tell"" practice comes into play, as we follow both Chateau and Ryang-ha seemingly delving into lots of the practical assassination plots, to only then pick up with the constant flashbacks where both man and woman\'s past reveal a hideous truth that changes the game\'s playing field and lets the viewers see how everything from their past comes to haunt them in their present day. It\'s a very slow burn for sure, and it\'ll take lots of romantic teasing and deaths by revenge and summons just to reach to that point. The real meat is in the details, and I\'m not gonna spoil it here as the central story is what makes Koroshi Ai such a good read from the manga, and the anime adaptation kept it very faithfully, albeit with the constant recaps just to fill in for padding the runtime, which is annoying to say the least.The female lead, Chateau Dankworth, feels simpler in design. She is somewhat similar to Saber from Fate visually, and being very quiet, stoic, cute, and all the more for not understanding it or caring about romance. But since this is a Josei work, the focus is squarely on the male lead, Song Ryang-ha. If you\'ve noticed a little about his character design, fox eyes are a rare, important feature, since they are essentially like a façade that hides their true colours. In case you didn\'t know, fox-like characters are impenetrably smiley most of the time, playful, socially adept, and seemingly eager to serve...until they show their eyes, and you know that shit has become real. And for a professional hitman-cum-romanticist, Song Ryang-ha fits the description to a T: he has a murderous identity, he is the nine-tailed fox in the room you have to ignore to appreciate this work, actually. Furthermore, Ryang-ha is like a small sadistic predator, serving tortured bodies as gifts to the female lead (Chateau) and resides in rundown buildings. He mellows pretty fast, always attracts the view, being smooth, sleek, functional, and ever so casually stylish. A low-key dangerous Ikemen because he is for the most part, very natural, and therefore classy as heck if he wants to be glamorous.The other characters do serve as plot movers, though of one particular interest is with Ritzland Support\'s secretary Indian, or Jim is as called in the anime. His real identity is a mystery, though he is an immigrant from India. And if you\'re thinking why doesn\'t Jim have a mouth, it\'s not because you\'re seeing it wrong, as the manga is also drawn this way, it\'s intentional. Most of the cast derives from Ryang-ha\'s past such as the spiderweb cheek tattoo Hou to the mastermind that is Donald ""Donny"" Bachman, and this syndicate forms the basis of the tumultuous downward spiral of which both Chateau and Ryang-ha are involved in. It\'s a deadly race of revenge and time, and time will only tell how these 2 are connected to one another as the series progresses, which amps the mystery and suspense quite decently.Some will have issues with the ways and styles of Platinum Vision\'s visuals as a studio, and this is a problem that I\'ve encountered in a similar show: Devil\'s Line, back in Spring 2018, also produced by the same studio as one of their first works. The premise and setting of the 2 are almost like one another: dark, gritty and almost at times, condescending. While it gives the sense of mute-ness, it isn\'t as quite polished as I would\'ve like, and the visuals are almost to the point of being a disappointing adaptation at best given its tense atmosphere. That said, if this was handled by a studio and staff team that understands the literacy of the work, then it could\'ve been better, but this is what we got, and it\'s frankly kinda mediocre.On the upside of things, the music really fits the tone and mood of the show, to a T, and yes, that includes the credit visuals. Seiyuu Toshiki Masuda may have a long and extensive discography of his works, but this is the first time that he\'s going solo, and his debut OP song ""Midnight Dancer"" is such a dance of a bop that really doesn\'t disappoint. The one that truly surprised me was Aika Kobayashi with her ED song ""Makoto Period"", because her past songs were all very cheerful, vibrant and uplifting, and this was a stark contrast with dark and dreary but melancholic tones that had the feels going for it. I might say that this song is really her best effort and foot forward so far, and at times, left me fearful in a claustrophobic manner for what\'s about to come, in a good way of course. One of the best EDs of the season IMO bar none, and props to sound director Hajime Takakuwa for laying down that atmosphere which has been an integral part of the moving plot.Even as a straight guy, I can say that Koroshi Ai is an interesting Josei work that you just don\'t hear quite a lot. Sadly with the somewhat subpar anime adaptation, and with a work like this that demands your fullest attention (because if you blink, you\'ll miss it), some will love it, others will hate it. But hey, in a niche demographic like this, I have to judge everything the same, and this is a fine (as in decent) adaptation when all is said and done.I think I will gear to the manga more to continue where the anime left off, and you might have a better experience that way as well. or worse, the anime adaptation kinda faltered when compared to the manga of the same name.How Koroshi Ai was penned by mangaka Fe, it\'s actually quite a surprise to say the least.

Now, I don't write review that much because it's a pain and the reason I'm writing this is let all of you people understand that this is not a trash anime. Have you ever seen this kind of anime before? I sure have but a different one. Have you ever heard of City Hunter? Yes, this anime reminds me of that and I like it very much.The story is simple but with a twist. I begin to love it after watching episode 1. It is something you don't...see everyday. The characters are awesome. I like the story and the development between Ryang and Chateau. I won't spoil too much but their interaction is quite funny and nice to watch. It's like a mix of bit of comedy in it which I believe is quite nice. I'm a huge fan of romance so seeing this was refreshing because I was too tired of the same romance I've been seeing lately. There aren't a lot of characters in this anime so if you expecting something like that then it's useless. If you also expecting a backstory of each character then better look else where. The focus is on two main characters which are Ryang and Chateau, obviously. Consider that when you decide to watch it. Don't start writing some sh*t how the anime is missing that or doesn't make sense on such event etc.. The ending ended good but not the end. You will understand once you watch it. Opening is good but I like the ending song better.In conclusion, I would have given a 9/10 but I decided that 8/10 would be more reasonable since the story is still incomplete. I hope there would be a second season because I want to see more. If you like crime, guns, blood, and some mystery vibe with some romance then give the anime a try or just try it.

I’m an avid shoujo/josei reader/watcher and if you’re the same I would say do give it a try. The plot is dark and mysterious, not exactly unusual but definitely not very common for josei’s. One of the things I like about this is that characters have different nationalities, you’ll see Koreans, Japanese, British etc…. it’s really fresh. Although I do think the manga would be a better read because idk the adaptation leaves too much behind, but I haven’t read it yet so I’m solely talking about the anime.There’s a lot of killing...going on, but the graphics aren’t too violent so unless you’re very sensitive it should be alright.The art is beautiful! The fl kind of reminds me of Violet from Violet evergarden due to her looks. The chemistry between the leads is actually really good, although there isn’t really anything going on explicitly…..However since it’s a criminal-detective pair-up, we really can’t expect a happy ending.

I really hope we can have more josei animes in future…So far I’m really enjoying it and that’s why I’m giving it a 8, might change later accordingly….(saw the other scores in here so it’s all mixed)….why 8? Well I actually really love this sort of vibe and I don’t really get much of these animes so maybe it’s due to my personal bias for the demographic as well…I’m really interested in the manga but I won’t read it until anime finishes so I don’t have any prior knowledge of the plot..Would definitely recommend this anime to shoujo/josei fans atleast :) going on, but the graphics aren’t too violent so unless you’re very sensitive it should be alright.The art is beautiful! The fl kind of reminds me of Violet from Violet evergarden due to her looks. The chemistry between the leads is actually really good, although there isn’t really anything going on explicitly…..However since it’s a criminal-detective pair-up, we really can’t expect a happy ending.

A bounty hunter becomes the target of affection from a professional assassin. He tries to win her over by “helping” her with her work. What’s not to love about something so crazy?Now that I mentioned the good parts of the show, let me tell You ne not so good parts - everything else. Boring cast, lacklustre plot, shitty pacing and fighting scenes so badly cut You have no idea how half of things happen,...you only get to see the end effect.The plot begins slowly, which I don’t really mind, after all I’m a fan of “Gungrave” and that show isn't exactly fast paced, but the main problem is that it’s a rollercoaster. Just when the plot picks up speed You are thrusted into a useless retrospective for a whole episode and when there are only 12 of those, that’s a problem.Now let me introduce You to the main cast:Ryang-ha Song - an obnoxious kid trapped in a skilled assassin's body. The way he acts most of the time should get him a court restraining order or even a bullet to the groin. On top of that there is very little that could be called interesting in him. Of course he has to have a tragic, mysterious backstory because of course he has. He’s a bland OP assassin with a fixation on the bounty hunter he, seemingly, wants to woo. Cool idea, terrible execution.Chateau Dankworth - our resident tsundere, the bounty hunter who was beaten by Song when she tried to apprehend him. She has a tragic backstory because why not? Let’s play tragic story bingo with the main cas. Now let’s not get too hyped, her backstory is only tragic because of plot conveniences and would not happen if the people in her vicinity weren't total idiots. She gives Ryang-ha the cold shoulder for the major part of the episodes only to show something that almost looks like dependency. Strong females lead my ass. She makes Sakura in the original Naruto look like a competent and well written heroine.Now… those two boring cutouts could still work but… there is absolutely no chemistry between them. Scenes where they interact with each other are painful to watch. The dialogues between them is probably written by a 12 year old. I don’t think I ever saw a less interesting couple ever in any medium.All in all I don’t recommend this to anyone who gives a damn about stellar writing. This show had so much potential it actually annoys me how bad it turned out. I guess if You turn it into a drinking game and take a sip everytime someone says or acts like an annoying kid You can have some fun with it. you only get to see the end effect.The plot begins slowly, which I don’t really mind, after all I’m a fan of “Gungrave” and that show isn't exactly fast paced, but the main problem is that it’s a rollercoaster.

It is different from the romance tropes that we are used to, since it has a little bit of psychological genre to it as well. But it's exciting at the same time. For me, I really loved this series.The interactions between the male and female MCs are a treat to watch. From how their relationship develops from hate to respect to how the story progresses giving emphasis to their individual yet connected backstories, no time did I question my judgment to binge this in one day.Also I liked that the...female MC could give some enemies a run for their money and that she wasn't completely head over heels or dependent on male MC from the get-go.The art is Ok but could have been a tiny bit better in some areas. But we would hardly feel it. The voice acting and music was good.Hoping for a Season 2 in the future. female MC could give some enemies a run for their money and that she wasn't completely head over heels or dependent on male MC from the get-go.The art is Ok but could have been a tiny bit better in some areas.

Warning: This review may contain a few Spoilers.StoryThe story is not a well-defined one and is set up like many other series of the genre, with mafias / gangs and bounty hunters (assassins) differing from this kind of fiction. It\'s a simple story. So the male leader, Ryang-Ha, starts as a kind of enemy for the female leader, Chateau. Despite this, they begin to work together in secret. Their relationship develops and they become stronger allies. Although love is not the main focus, they have many nice moments together, but it is not ""lovey-dovey"", only Ryang-Ha being cute and...Chateau being like "",: | Still cute * - *In addition, there is a lot of action, blood and also some mystery. And, of course, the background stories of the characters are revealed later. These were the greatest chapters, in my opinion. Interesting things. And despite the fact that there is action and blood, Koroshi Ai also offers you a few moments of comedy. However, the fact that Chateau frequently needs rescue bothers me a little. However, she gets her cool moments.CharactersOne of the few anime of this kind in which we have the action in the first step in which we do not have a weeping MCs as usual, those of some extremely good and attractive for people who like action and not sadness. From the first episode we realize that Song, Ryang-ha is a ""nice"" guy in quotes but also funny. I hope we have a fun adventure with him and Dankworth, Chateau. A strongly developed guy who appears in the life of a woman who has things more or less under control. Except that he\'s an assassin and somehow decides to pursue her and interfere with the bounty hunt as a way to sneak into her life. This allusion is hard because their lives are interconnected. Then no one but him saves her from trouble as he follows her and she begins to have feelings for him. Honestly, I\'m usually tough on character development, because for me, that\'s the most important thing you have to have in a good story. And here, it\'s good and I really like it.AnimationsThe animation is excellent and worth watching and appreciating, there are no jerky moments. They did well with the outline of the characters as well as their color, because in other anime they are not so well focused on the other supporting characters, so to speak, only the important ones. This is good to know from my point of view and it adds up. However, we also have a small flaw in the graphics and characters. Mr. Jim doesn\'t have much of a mouth, and I don\'t like that, and I don\'t think so.In conclusion, I recommend to all people who like this kind of action, blood and mystery. You should try to read anime manga if you get the chance. Because she\'s just as good. Chateau being like "",: | Still cute * - *In addition, there is a lot of action, blood and also some mystery.

The story has potential but that's the only good thing I can say about this. Apart from the quirky assassin dude, the rest of the characters are so boring and the guy who has no mouth (for no reason) has the most annoying voice I've ever heard in my life. But what really grinds my gears is the complete lack of research that was done while making this show. The amount of weird, illogical, stupid, completely unrealistic things that happen in...this show is inexcusable. I've watched only 4 episodes and I've found tons of mistakes. The thing that really popped my bubble was when some dude said that the stun gun doesn't affect him because his nerves were destroyed from drug use. I've never seen something so stupid in my entire life. I study biology and depending on what type of nerves he's talking about he should be either paralyzed or deceased. For context, stun guns affect motor neurons. Motor neurons are the ones who send commands to the effectors (muscles, glands). Muscles have also 2 types: somatic and visceral. If his somatic nervous system is destroyed, he should be paralyzed. If your visceral nervous system is destroyed, he should be dead. The fact that I wrote this much shows how much this show annoyed me. I can't believe it has a 4.5/5 on crunchyroll this show is inexcusable.

Having me constantly at the edge of my seat every episode wanting to know the outcome of their controversial actions and moves, Koroshi Ai manages to not only appeal to you with its climactic visuals and animation (which is also debatably poor at times), but also with its excellent displays of spite, trauma, and wit, coming together under two characters to bring the story of the world towards them and to not only be invested in the show but in the characters themselves. This about Koroshi Ai I love, as each of the characters decisions take me aback, and take my mind on a thought provoking journey recalling each action leading up to the present result of their actions and past happenings.Lastly, the character development, from such an unpopular story in manga you'd expect it to not be anything noteworthy or AT LEAST well executed, but what I got was yet again the opposite of this, leaving me astounded at each episode as the character Chateau progressed and became better as a human and coming to recognize who she is and accepting it, and coming to know and accept her past as it is, the same can also be said for Song, who went from very vibrant and easy-going, to recognizing the importance of other people’s lives and their repercussions, as the series progressed, we saw 2 characters go from as opposite as you can get, even in their careers, to slowly but surely becoming a like and recognizing each other for who they are and getting to know one another.This show is easily one of the single most underrated shows I have ever watched and I am proud to say that I can understand the appreciate the amazing writing within the show, portrayed in it's extremely well done developing and concept writing, and there most certainly is nothing worth speech that I can say is bad about the show, maybe I can at a later point, but right now I am happy staying ignorant about the show and to view it as character perfection. time you'll find that your mum isn't one of them, and this is normal throughout even the likes of Japan, rarely has there ever been any demand for older women's anime and therefore not much attention to the shows quality have been placed and have commonly been looked down upon as 'bound to be bad', which is the killing detail bringing down the ratings and viewership in Koroshi Ai, a show which I know damn well isn't getting a second season, so I bid my wallet a farewell and await the manga to arrive on my front doorstep.Koroshi Ai is one of the few shows which you can find that not only reach out further than its initial premise, but manages to do it in such an innovative and memorable way that as the story progresses, so does your attention progress further into the show as you slowly sink into the character's developments and turns, watching each characters decisions as though they were your own, and coming to know the characters as though they were your own friends.

Love story between professional killer and a bounty hunter whose life story we are discovering over these 12 episodes doesn't sound like much but it's definitely not yet another isekai or harem anime.Story is slow to develop but it's never tiring or taking shortcuts. Characters are emotional and well developed. World building is also good. Overall very satisfying viewing experience which for these exact reasons might not be for everyone.

She\'s too innocent to realize what she really has.Even though I could easily score this so much lower, I did enjoy it. And yet, this makes it even more frustrating because the manga must be so much better than this. Song felt too goofy in his portrayal in this adaptation. It feels like he should have come off as more sinister, and I am sure the manga does this.After a rough start, the mystery aspect starts to kick in, and this at least made it much more better and interesting.

A season 2 sounds like a mistake, but I\'d shamelessly watch it and continue supporting it.', 'Always a pleasure to see an anime that\'s a bit more unique in terms of concept and genre. Easy to overlook this one, but I thoroughly enjoyable from the start to the end :)Story - 9/10For some reason, this isn\'t tagged as being psychological-themed, which is a bit weird, as there are elements of psychology that play a significant role on the story and how it develops. The story itself a bit like an action-film of the late 00\'s/ early 10\'s, which was nice to see (thankfully, not too much like one), with mystery being tied in quite nicely. The storytelling order is a bit...chaotic but really good, in that the mysteries are kept alive long enough to be engaging.Art - 8/10Probably one of the weaker areas of Koroshi Ai, I\'ll be honest. Not that the art is bad, but it\'s quite inconsistent; having some impressively accurate depictions of weapons and vehicles and then at other times, similar things being anatomically strange. On balance though, the art is really good though; character designs are all distinct and memorable. On the art front, it\'s also worth noting that romance/ comedy elements are executed just as well as the action sequences (Jim and irritated Chateau for example XD). One neat thing that I appreciated about Koroshi Ai is the use artboards for intervals; they\'re always good to see.Sound - 10/10Score in this department is largely driven by, but not entirely limited to the soundtrack. In terms of SFX and sounds used during action sequences, Koroshi Ai does a good job of creating a believable atmosphere throughout.The areas that Koroshi Ai excelled with in terms of sound, were the music and musical accompaniments. The opening music is one of only a handful which you fall in love with within the first five seconds. Masuda\'s ""Midnight Dancer"" reflects the sophistication and energy of the anime and the world that the main characters live in, it also reflects Song\'s personality and situation perfectly as well. Aside from how well the piece works with the anime, it\'s also a really good salsa/ big band/ J-Pop piece away from the anime. The ending speaks more to elements of Chateua\'s personality and provides each episode with a soft and beautiful ending - one that I never really wanted to skip, thanks to Makoto Period.Character - 8/10A good range of characters here, including some of the more absurd individuals that one would expect from action media. While there\'s a healthy dose of organised criminals, they are still some sequences here and there, with interesting civilians, who play more to the romance elements of the story. Needless to say, the main characters are the main attraction of Koroshi Ai, both of whom are heavily shrouded in mystery. Psychology definitely plays a big factor in how Chateau develops throughout the story, which I felt was good to watch and see explained out and referenced as things went along. Song felt a bit like one particular, black-suit-wearing, seemingly un-killable character (Mr Wick) for a while, but the romance elements definitely give his character some unique flair, which I really liked. We also get a good selection of characters that contribute to comedy, drama and action, which is always good  to see.Enjoyment - 9/10Feels a bit like an action-thriller from yesteryear but does really well in being engaging through the use of drama, psychology and comedy throughout, to help keep things varied. While the action and drama sequences were the mainstay of Koroshi Ai, there were still some genuinely funny moments, even if they\'re mostly along the same line. I presume that the anime only covers a portion of the manga content, because the ending definitely leaves a feeling of suspense and a story still to be told.Overall - 9/10A breath of fresh air, blending a number of genres and themes and exploring them in an engaging way, with thrills, occasional laughter, great music and lovable characters at the heart of it all - well deserving of 9/10 rating in my humble opinion. chaotic but really good, in that the mysteries are kept alive long enough to be engaging.Art - 8/10Probably one of the weaker areas of Koroshi Ai, I\'ll be honest.

My expectations were that this would be some kind of lighthearted comedy set in a somewhat serious assassin plot. Now that i finished it, i'm not sure what this anime was trying to be.And that's the thing about expectation. It is...a powerful two-sided blade.

It is something the artist have to take in consideration, if the plan is to release a well received product.

Personally, I generally stick with fantasy genre anime, so this anime, which is a story that takes place in a modern world setting with conspiracies and assassins,  was a nice change of pace. The story is centered around the two main characters in a way that they get the majority of the dialogue and the supporting characters kind of get snubbed, both with how the story and how the main characters essentially ignore them. The antagonists have decent character and design, I...felt like the supporting protagonists could have had more thought put into them. My main problem with this anime is the ending. Nothing major went down in the anime, only small fries were taken out. The story did progress decently, but the anime just stops, without any motivating speech at the end or basically any cliffhanger for what happens next. It felt to me like the anime ended just before the climax and is offputting.

I didn't really care about Ryang-Ha and Chateau's relationship, and whilst I was initially intrigued about how they were connected in the past this wore on with the various flashbacks we got throughout the latter half of the season. For a series about two assassins, this also lacked the tension and excitement that I wanted from it.There was nothing inherently wrong with this that I can immediately pick up on - it just didn't click with me. I found it rather...dull, and my lack of interest in the main pairing meant that it did drag on a little. The narrative style didn't aid in keeping me interested either as things felt overly dragged out or were too confusing for me to follow completely. dull, and my lack of interest in the main pairing meant that it did drag on a little.

I don't understand how most of the details from the manga can be included, but the tension (sexual and otherwise) is totally lost.

Chateau is a bounty hunter who one day gets courted (by force) by a very lonely assassin named Ryang-ha and the story follows their very dysfunctional relationship.It’s a twisted take on the romcom formula with lots of action and drama thrown into the mix and it can be funny and entertaining. However, the overall presentation of the anime does not work in the shows favour. Bland visuals and strange animation choices makes the story hard follow as it directly...contradicts the tone it's trying to set. One of the worst aspects of the show is the character Jim who doesn’t have a mouth or any facial features which is enough to through anyone off, but the specific voice actor that they used makes him sound almost identical to Zach on Oneplays when he did that bit where he pretended to be an alien for the Mandalorian.

A useless guy who is a magician is suddenly surrounded by girls, items and friends of which he would of never imagined and never thought could happen to him in his lifetime, until he met Tanarotte, the stubborn yet obedient god/devil girl. Now, for the in-depth review.Story: 8At first when I was watching this series, i didn't think their was a story; but when you get further through you find that their is an emotional story which grabs you from start to finish. The power to create beings to destroy countries, how...it can go out of control and of course the harem side of it, being surrounded by beautiful characters which you learn about so easily and quickly while the story is commencing.Art: 6The art isn't too good, you can always see all the flaws and where it could of been majorly improved for this anime, I found the art to be surprising especially from what Media Factory and Zexcs have created before, this was the worst part of the anime.Sound: 9Every song used in this is very caring and fun, you want to start dancing and feel the rhythm every time you hear the OST and EST, but also with the songs in between the series. Macademi Wasshoi! has clearly put a lot of effort into how they wanted this anime to be seen for its viewers.Characters: 9Even though the art of the characters isn't very good; and just barely passable in my own opinion, they've attempted to overuse the chibi style and mix it with anime which didn't work well in my opinion, the characters development was extraordinary, you learn so much about each character, Tanarotte, Takuto, Suzuha, Falce and it's not just the mains you learn about, but also the supporting characters such as Sakuma Eitarou and Eneus.Enjoyment: 8I thoroughly enjoyed this series, it was very amusing keeping it's comedy parts intact and not overdoing it so it starts to get boring, while it's keeping all of it's fantasy and supernatural genes together and not using magic as an everyday thing which a lot of Fantasy's attempt to do, then run out of ideas of what could be next. The romance/school/ecchi is always good to see work well together along with the harem style which was adapted into the series with all the characters who surround Takuto.I rated this series as an 8 overall although it would of been improved if the art was better. But overall, this series was very amusing to watch and fun even though it is a lot of filler; its nice to see how it is put across to the fans, which I think Media Factory and Zexcs did extraordinarily well. it can go out of control and of course the harem side of it, being surrounded by beautiful characters which you learn about so easily and quickly while the story is commencing.Art: 6The art isn't too good, you can always see all the flaws and where it could of been majorly improved for this anime, I found the art to be surprising especially from what Media Factory and Zexcs have created before, this was the worst part of the anime.Sound: 9Every song used in this is very caring and fun, you want to start dancing and feel the rhythm every time you hear the OST and EST, but also with the songs in between the series.

This is contrasted by them then taking opposing missions, and having a conflict of interest. Lupin and Jigen always have a great dynamic, and there are some nice twists to it in this one.Goemon is great in this. We get to see a...duo of him and Lupin for a change, which is fun to see. We also get Goemon working with Fujiko and putting up with her entertaining shenanigans. Plenty of enjoyable comedy situations for Goemon here.Fujiko is fun and hot in this one, like usual, and she gets plenty of screen time. When she gets mad, things get entertaining.Inspector Zenigata is hilarious, always one step behind the Lupin gang, but he takes a bit of a back seat in this one.The presentation is top notch here. Very slick animation, attractive character designs (especially for Fujiko), and a great jazz soundtrack by Yuji Ohno.

Check this stylish anime out.', 'This is the story of what happens during one week while Lupin and Jigen are planning a heist.Whereas other Lupin specials have made an effort to stay up to date on technology and failed embarrassingly (I\'m looking at you, Green vs. Red), this one has a very tongue in cheek approach to Lupin\'s old school skills and techniques. In fact, a character of the week uses them to identify him, which I thought was clever.For some reason, at the time this anime special was out, it was a thing to put weird, CG puppets into anime (such as Level E). I don\'t get it,...but the puppet scene in this special was funny. Everything they do in Lupin is so specialized, so characterized, that it doesn\'t matter if it\'s cliche. It still manages to work. I realize that this was also a throw back to one of the Red Jacket series openings, but still...Another interesting thing about this special is that they make people actually look like they countries they\'re from. Americans? Not over the top, but a variety of blonde, brunette, with light eyes. Thailand? Dark skin and dark hair. Tourists? Not all in Hawaiian print. That\'s not really something you see in anime. Characters are usually pretty homogenous. And, wow!, there\'s only ONE cowboy out of all the Americans in the movie! (I\'m not even rolling my eyes here)There\'s always, always something in the specials/movies that really just makes them great for me. For this one, for me, it was this little bit where Goemon isn\'t happy with the job he has and really wants to use his sword. And when he does get the chance he complains that he cut something worthless again, but is cut off, and is giddy anyway that he got to do his normal thing. It seriously made me laugh out loud.There\'s a pun in the movie as well that\'s easy for English speakers to understand. Lupin is talking over and over about how he\'s picky about his ice, likes only certain brands of ice, etc. I can only assume that this is a pun and he\'s talking not only about frozen water, but his diamond preferences (This is later confirmed during the end credits). I mean, after all, the movie is about quite a bit of diamonds. I found it clever.THE CONS: My only issue with this special? It\'s ridiculously similar to Stolen Lupin in some aspects. The ""female of the week"" (you know, the new female that suddenly has business with Lupin) is almost a replication of the one in Stolen Lupin. And the same exact weapon is used (an enormous exploding diamond on a black choker).Overall? Great animation, great voice work as usual, clever character development (even with the female of the week who is more than a damsel in distress), and good music. Definitely a to watch show! but the puppet scene in this special was funny. Everything they do in Lupin is so specialized, so characterized, that it doesn\'t matter if it\'s cliche.

Wataru is brought there by a dragon called Ryujinmaru, who can also transform into a giant robot. His ultimate mission is to fully liberate Soukazain, which is currently occupied by Demon Lord Doakuda.Wataru is soon joined by naïve and energetic Ninja girl Himiko and samurai warrior Shibaraku, who often becomes the butt of many...jokes.Temporary guests are the shady birdman and know-it-all Kurama, Himiko’s ninja father and a rival type character called Toramaru. Although he’s clearly a fan favorite and often seen in promotional materials, he has a rather minor roll in the show until late episodes.Animation and artwork is decent for a 1988 show, with the quality fluctuating between episodes. The spiritual sequel Granzort, released just one year later, raised the bar quite high. Later Wataru shows objectively look better, although I personally prefer the chubby look of Wataru 1.The action is nicely animated but it has to be mentioned that Wataru also has its fair share of reused scenes for robot transformations and combat.Character designs are simple, effective and fairly unique. I haven’t seen any characters that resemble the main cast. Most characters are drawn in a half chibi style. The characters, especially Wataru and Himiko, are cute, but without feeling forcedly so.  Adult characters have chibi bodies with realistically drawn heads. It’s kind of gross at first but fits the tone of the series. I missed that by the time they largely dropped it in (Super Wataru, the 3rd Wataru series. The giant robots our heroes and villains use for combat share the giant head theme.Music is good, not too many themes aside from the main theme and ending theme though.  Sound effects are a standard affair, pretty much the same quality as in contemporary robot anime and up until the mid 90s.Voice acting is excellent, with the only criticism I have is certain enemy character’s actors were reused of the course of the show multiple times. Mayumi Tanaka does an excellent job as Wataru, younger viewers probably know her more from her work as Luffy in One Piece.The series creators seemingly enjoyed playing with Japanese language. Having a certain grip of Japanese language is not required to enjoy it, but certainly makes the experience better (e.g. many names are actually puns). What is required though is to kind of flow along with the action and gag oriented story. Real drama and thinking too much about real world rules ruins the enjoyment (e.g. most of Soukaizan should be dark as all the worlds are layered on top of each other)Knowledge of the toy series and videogames based on Wataru is not required.I recommend Wataru to anyone that enjoys gag based anime, cute characters (male and female alike), just a hint of shounen genre action and shows with an optimistic theme.8 out of 10 points jokes.Temporary guests are the shady birdman and know-it-all Kurama, Himiko’s ninja father and a rival type character called Toramaru.

Mask Danshi wa Koishitakunai noni,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54792/Mask_Danshi_wa_Koishitakunai_noni,"[""Quick note/TLRD: this review is based on someone who has read the manga so it's not as much of a review about plot more so a review about the adaptation. (by no means is the manga a master piece but it's an enjoyable BL)It is basically a fan service recap of the manga with erotica, some character development scenes, and the entire later half of the first volume removedThe manga has 2 more volumes which develops their relationship furtherThe animation isn't greatalso I recommend reading the manga over watching the anime as a substitute to the manga. it is not a good substitute.It's not a...bad watch if you have already read the manga thoughEdit: also they sorta changed Saikawas personality, he was a bit of an asshole to Sayama in the beginning and messed with him a lot.For one 30 min episode and presumably low budgets it's ok. The anime adapts just the first volume of the manga which feels incomplete not because it only adapts the first half of volume 1 but because of how short the anime is. Many scenes in the manga are either shortened or cut out altogether which makes everything feel a bit undeveloped and rushed. especially since there were more chapters in the first volume that show more of Saikawa's personality and how he views Sayama. If you want to enjoy this, the manga is better and after the first volume it goes further into their relationship as it develops.To go further in depth, the voice acting is really good especially with the A list voice casting being done by the voice of Loid from Spy Family and Senku from Dr. Stone. Though the animation is not great at all and leaves a lot to be desired. It is passible in some parts but in many others it's straight janky and hard to ignore. Some body movements and arm movements feel as if they just used a transform tool on a still image. By no means does an anime need amazing animation like Sasaki and Miyano or Blue Lock which both are mostly slide show anime's but with better art. But it needs good story telling and pacing to really carry it like in those two anime's which this adaptation has neither.Everything just feels rushed and moved too fast because the manga even though the manga isn't super long, the anime feels even shorter than the manga with the pacing being even faster than the manga. They outright shortened some dialogue interactions between the two and even parts where Sayama feels jealousy seeing Saikawa smile towards others or when he questions why Saikawa kissed him. It should have gotten 1-2 more episodes to help it full flesh out more of the first volume and to add in the rest of volume 1. Doing that would have helped it feel more as if the characters had time to develop their personalities and relationship with each other with more dialogue that is missing and adding back in the cut content in the later half of the first volume.The anime also cuts out all of the erotica content which usually is a pro than a con. It allows more people to be able to watch it but it is sort of a double edged sword in this case because they have some bit of alluding to more explicit content without really delving deeper into it and how it plays into the two leads romantic relationship. Since so many erotica BLs get adapted at this point they should have outright cut any sort of context instead of trying to meet the middle. This is more of a nit pick than anything since the manga is erotica after all.Altogether I'm mixed about this anime, the manga is much better since it has more interaction and hijinks instead of constantly jumping into them kissing and confessing in the next 5 minutes. It isn't good to watch if you haven't read the manga but if you have it's fun to see your favorite BL be animated even though it's a bit janky. It's more fan service or a recap than anything. definitely the manga is better, just read that instead.also if anyone wants to watch this anime it is on billi billi with english subs, you just need a vpn and to connect to a jp server to access it. bad watch if you have already read the manga thoughEdit: also they sorta changed Saikawas personality, he was a bit of an asshole to Sayama in the beginning and messed with him a lot.For one 30 min episode and presumably low budgets it's ok.

Even though the character designs appears comical, the show has a very serious tone.StoryIt story is not the best or ingenious  or any thing like that. But still its good enough and has its own appeal. It is more or less a good spooky ghost story in a shounen style. Better plot progression compared to previous season. The tone is surprisingly very serious.ArtIt has characters design very similar to soul eater (spooky and comical).

ED is also good.Character -I love the two protagonists. one is the silent and deadly overpowered type. while other is a crybaby who doubt his own abilities. He got a proper character development this season. Supporting characters are also fun to watch. Antagonists are mysterious and spooky.I enjoyed the series very much. Overall a good underrated series to watch if u have time it doesn't have slapstick comedy tone.SoundOP is fast and feels like it is played at 1.75x. But I love that kind of rhythm.

Overall a good underrated series to watch if u have time"", 'What a sharp decline of people watching this, and I don\'t blame you if this wasn\'t on your radar in the very first place.To be honest, giving a preface to Season 2 here is a rather lofty goal for Studio Deen to continue where the very old manga left off its traces in Season 1, and it\'s a shame to let this series continue its production run where most people just shrugged this series away from the very beginning. But for context, the sequels are measured better than their starting point, and in the case of Muhyo and Roji, this proves to be true.Continuing off...the big battle from Season 1 with the ""See you next time!"" image of Muhyo vs. Enchu (essentially the Magic Law Association vs. the Forbidden Magic Law), the one addition of another rival bureau gives both of our main characters ""a pain in the butt"" moments. While Muhyo progresses on his magic law skills, Roji however regresses and becomes a total cowardice and a burden towards Muhyo, so much so that he doesn\'t see Roji from the assistant POV, and pushes him back to magic school to regain his confidence. If that is character development, I\'d say it was decently done to showcase and solidify both boys\' relationship as Master and Apprentice. And Enchu strikes again, only more fearful and set in stone.I don\'t need a long phrasing to tell you of Studio Deen\'s lowly average production values, they\'ve basically kept it the same from Season 1, and it shows. Even with the heavy Shonen-like action sequences, it\'s clear that it isn\'t the priority, and keeping it low budget has always been the icing to the batter. At least the OST got somewhat of a decent upgrade, and while the OP/ED set may not set the world on magical fire, they\'re better than Season 1\'s (at least it is for me).I only have one thought to wrap up this series as a whole, and it has basically stayed the same from Season 1: go read the manga in its complete entirety instead. Season 1 was already not so kind enough to be passed up, so Season 2 here is kinda a redemption for the niche audience awaiting to see this series get any better. Here\'s hoping that Studio Deen does not make a Season 3 (because it kinda gets boring from time to time as well). the big battle from Season 1 with the ""See you next time!"" image of Muhyo vs. Enchu (essentially the Magic Law Association vs. the Forbidden Magic Law), the one addition of another rival bureau gives both of our main characters ""a pain in the butt"" moments.

Most of the characters are very dull and lack development which was the same problem as the first season. This is the kind of anime you watch when the season is still going but won\'t active seek to watch it after it is over.Story 5The story didn\'t really progress that much since they tried to focus on the characters more than they did in the first season I would say that was a bad choice since that wasn\'t great either. This season was about Rouji mostly and him growing. Rouji has a lot of respect for...our main protagonist Muhyo which make no sense since Rouji\'s backstory is that Muhyo gave him a job even though he was casual with him because of Muhyo\'s age and size. So Rouji is totally crushed when he is yelled at by Muhyo for accepting a challenge with some rando A-hole who is too cocky without achievements of any sort  named Goryo. Rouji is forced to train and grow stronger so he does and when he as told to stake his life on the life for Muhyo. He does in complete trust. It make no sense since they never show how Muhyo earned Rouji\'s trust so much that he would die for him. Is it because Muhyo gave Rouji a job so that is why he trust him so much? I mean I have a job and I wouldn\'t give up my life for my boss. Muhyo doesn\'t really even show emotions to  Rouji so when did intense bond happen? behind the scenes of each episode? Rouji\'s trust in Muhyo is unearned since they show didn\'t development for it at all in any season with a few like good job once in a blue moon but certainly not enough to be"" Die For Me"" Muhyo says.Art 5I don\'t really judge anime based on art much so I really can\'t say.Character 5The characters are dull since most of them are just cliche that you an find in any anime.  Even that main villain\'s motivations are forgettable since that was last season but also that he wasn\'t really in the anime this season. our main protagonist Muhyo which make no sense since Rouji\'s backstory is that Muhyo gave him a job even though he was casual with him because of Muhyo\'s age and size.

Japan just never ceases to amaze me.The concept of having an anime about a highly oversexualized fictional wrestling sport for girls where they can only use their breasts and ass to push each other out of the ring may have sounded somewhat distasteful on paper. But Keijo actually pulls it off a lot better than I initially expected, and turned out to be a surprisingly good ecchi/comedy/sports anime as a whole, albeit a rather a ridiculous one.However, its so-called ridiculousness is also exactly what makes it successful. Keijo is a prime example of an anime which does not take itself seriously *at all*. You will legitimately have a hard time finding many anime that are less serious than this. It is fully self-aware that its concept is incredibly stupid, but it just decides to roll with it as far as it can and tries to make everything as exaggerated as humanly possible, and the sheer absurdity of it all is what makes it entertaining to watch.The special fighting moves these girls quite literally pull out of their asses do not only have the silliest names imaginable, but they are generally not-so-subtle parodies of other series such as One Piece, Shingeki no Kyojin, Fate/Stay Night and more, and what they actually do is just as wacky. Supersonic hip swings, machine-gun-like butt missiles, titty hypnosis, nipple judo tosses, and many other shounen-like abilities, all neatly remade into something originating from a pair of breasts or an ass. It makes no sense at all and is silly in every meaning of the word, but that is also why it is funny. Not like rolling-on-the-floor Prison School-tier of funny, but more something that will make you constantly smile and giggle at the sheer wtf factor that the show brings.Now that said, I still have to mention that it does not *always* come across as funny. The silly nature of the show skirts a fine line between being humorous and just being weird or awkward, and sometimes I found myself facepalming rather than laughing. Statistically speaking though, I would still say that it manages to stay funny most of the time, so it is not a huge problem. However, I also realize that it is going to be very individual regarding which scenes you will find amusing and which ones you will only find cringey depending on your sense of humour, so it is worth taking into account at least, as it could be a pretty big make-or-break factor depending on who you ask.Comedy asides though, what else does Keijo have? Well for one, there is obviously the ecchi aspect of it. Now this is very closely tied to the comedy however so it is more or less the same thing, but basically the sexual elements of this show are not designed to be hot or romantic or anything along those lines, they are simply there to be as over-the-top and exaggerated as possible, which is what generates the comedy of the anime. In that sense, because of its absurd general feel I would honestly put Keijo closer to the likes of Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, Grand Blue, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka, Seitokai no Ichizon, Sakamoto desu ga or even Gintama rather than notorious lewd series like To LOVE-Ru or Kiss x Sis. I have even seen some people refer to it as a female version of Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure.Finally, there is also the sports side of Keijo. I should probably mention that I am not really a fan of sports anime in general as I find them to usually be rather predictable, and also the fact that the outcome of all the matches are scripted tends to kill most of the excitement for me. In order for me to enjoy a sports anime, it needs to do something a bit out of the ordinary. And well, Keijo sure as hell is about as out of the ordinary as it gets, so at least that part was not really a problem for me this time. I will say though that if it was not for the fact that the sport in question was so utterly ridiculous as a whole, then honestly Keijo would be a pretty typical sports anime. It still has the same general plot points like the optimistic and hardworking protagonist with a dream to be the best of the best within a particular sport, the close bonds that she forges with other hopefuls of similar interests, the constant training to improve themselves and the hurdles they have to overcome along the way, the new abilities they learn over time, the ""rival"" characters they have to compete with and one day surpass, the teams from other schools that they play against... etcetera, all of it can be found in Keijo as well. However, you do not tend to think of it as much because the silly and comedic elements of the show steal the spotlight far too much. As for whether that should be considered a good thing or a bad thing depends on personal preference, but at least for me personally I vastly prefer Keijo\'s absurd approach over the one of your average sports anime, no contest on that front.So, what can we make of all this in the end? Well, Keijo is an anime which on paper could and arguably perhaps should have been a complete trainwreck... but it is not. It is actually a quite decent comedy anime with plenty of creativity in it to boot. Admittedly it can get a bit repetitive over time since hysterical ass attacks can only remain funny for so long, but I think you should at least be able to make it to the end of the show whilst still having an awkward grin remaining on your face, and although the animation quality does have a bit of a hard time keeping up with the fast-paced nature of the action at times, it still does not feel like a huge problem. After all, those scenes are all about being as ridiculous and exaggerated as possible rather than ever trying to be anything photorealistic. And if nothing else, Keijo\'s mere existence was a massive middle finger to a large portion of the SJWs all over the internet, so at the very least it definitely deserves some bonus points for that.

If it's deep and thought provoking, whatever that means to them. These people tend to underrate everything light hearted and despise fan-service shows. Well this is hell for these snobs and elitists.Because what Keijo!!!!!!!! actually is? It is a fan-service show, but that's just a cover. It's a satire of the shounen sports genre. Those sport series, where the games are dominated by some legendary players with super powers. For that, we get an insanely stupid sport, a butt and breast wrestling. And this was the first catch. A fan-service heavy...show can easily go awkward from where the comedy doesn't work. There are a lot of shows like that. Keijo is not one of them, it manages to be consistently hilarious. The fan-service is incorporated into the plot so well that it's always feels natural.As for the story goes, it's basically a regular underdog tale. A bunch of freshmen starts attending this butt wrestling school, because everything has a dedicated high school in Japan. Our heroines start to sharpening their skills through a lot of mock matches and ridiculous training sessions, while every one of them discovers a special move. As for characters, we get the heroes of these kinds of stories, but even further exaggerated, with the same goal, they want to be professionals. And in context of the series, they are working splendidly.For the production quality, I have no complaints. There are some moments where they didn't get the CG right and the characters go off model, but over all, as far as design and technical quality goes, it's definitely strong in this season, and considering how flashy the matches are, it's amazing how they kept up the quality without inserting too much cheap budget saving scenes, like another sports series of this season did.In conclusion, this anime is not for everyone. This show is dumb, but it meant to be dumb, it wants to be dumb and it's proud of it. The ones who will appreciate it the most are the ones who're somewhat deep into the medium and seen some series this makes fun of and seen the biggest hits of the past few years, because Keijo is really heavy in references.

My other brothers can\'t deny."" -Sir Mix-a-Lot, 1992SJW\'s beware! The booty has called! Alright men (and ladies, if you\'re into that sort of thing), let\'s jump in to this pool of ass-ridden glory!*...I need a thesaurus*Well, the season is coming to an end soon, and so is this crazy ass year. We had our first orange president, the internet collectively got more PC than ever before, and best of all, we got Rogue One, the best movie of the year. So, what better way to end it than with the Jojo\'s Bizzzare Adventure of sports anime...but...with loads of crazy ass fan service. I may have a little but of bias towards this show. I AM just a filthy male! So, did this booty-licious romp pay off? Well, let\'s find out, shall we?STORY: 5/10Basically, this is an underdog sports story about 4 girls training to be accepted as elites and eventually, being true pride to their school: a school that teaches KEIJO!!!!!!!! You need a lot to truly make this kind of story stand out, and unfortunately, this is Keijo\'s (not very) fatal flaw. Despite all of the amounts of tits and ass in full, glorious display here, the story beats present don\'t necessarily come off as new, and since some things (like ass pull power-ups, how after almost a year in which part of the training regimen is sit-ups, very few of them have ass, the way our final opponent changes hair due to personality change despite that that\'s now how that works, how in the finale, Nozomi spams a dangerous attack multiple times but feels no pain, how they often forget that they can use their boobs to attack since the only two things you\'re allowed to use are the tits and dah bootay, etc) make no sense, even for the show\'s logic, I gotta put aside my manly urges and knock this story down a peg.That being said, some of the things that happen here are...unique. No only does this show have some puny ass arcs, but the powers can definitely be creative. I mean, Gate of Bootylan? Butt-tack on Titan ? This show makes more bouts of bad puns than Yang from RWBY, and that is saying a lot. Also, sometimes, just to mix things up, they make one of our protagonists lose in a way that feels downright unfair (Aoba in episode 10). Plus, the major tone-shift in the first half of episode 12 can give such a whiplash, that if it was directed at my ass, that booty would be red as hell. I also wish that there would\'ve been some buildup to the Ease and West War tournament that takes up the last 1/3 of the series. However, let it not be said that I like the sheer escalation of events. With each arc, the protagonists make it by the skin of their teeth, but each arc\'s obstacles are much more kickass and brutal than that of the previous one. Plus, as the series goes on, the absurdity of these crazy ass moves increases exponentially, and to glorious results in each of the battles in the last 4 episodes. It\'s ridiculous. It\'s absurd. It\'s...not enough to save the story all things considered, despite how tragic some of the characters\' pasts (like Maya) can be, and how nice the ending is. Now, off with that boring ass thing we call: reasonable criticism. This is KEIJO!!!!!!!!CHARACTERS: 8/10Nozomi is a hot-blooded protagonist that ends up having to work her butt off just to keep up with each new groundbreaking opponent, ad she is a total romp! I especially love the fact that instead of the classic protagonist motivations (I wanna be stronger, I wanna be the best), she just wants to be rich. Sayaka is a rival of hers who wants approval of her father while keeping up with her peers, no matter how much stress and offense she takes in the process. Aoba starts off really shy, but though her effed up powers and acceptance by her peers, she becomes much more confident. Plus, the lucky sod gets all the ass! Non is your cutely and clumsy big tittied gal, but instead of just hurting herself with her clumsiness, she puts everyone through hell, both through near-death accidents, or knocking coffee on a white bed. Then, she has the nerve to make all sorts of excuses justifications in an attempt at bravado. My favorite thing about these girls is the fact that they actually have dialects! How many times have you seen an anime that does that with its MCs.  It does this with Maya as well, but we\'ll get to that lovely lady in a bit.Mio is probably my favorite character. She is a total lech (have you SEEN how she gets around cute girls?!), more so than most men of this archethype, but she is also one of the ultimate badasses this this show. She is the crux of some pf the funniest moments of the show (like her few second of punishment in episode 5). Not to mention, that she is the most beautiful, and fight me IRL if you disagree! I would definitely want a piece of her ass in bed! Well, not really, but she is my favorite here. Then we have a few quirky characters like Kawai (sinister in battle, but a total romantic dork), Kotone (lover of gay hentai), Saya (swordsman-like beauty who shows up in episode 11 for a badass moment of awesome) Usagi (fangirl of Mio, and possibly lesbo for her), Yuko ( who, along with Aoba, has the curse of just never being able to win) Nagisa (our coach who was once a pro at this sport, as well as Nozomi\'s predator of the Butt Vacuum Wave technique), Kyoko (badass teacher and Kyoto\'s butt missile lady), and Rin (overconfident, but, umm, she doesn\'t have any real quirks). Some are more interesting than others, but (and they all have big butts) they are generally a very endearing cast with plenty of life in them.Maya is an interesting one. Undoubtedly the second most beautiful mistress here, she is originally mysterious (not without accidentally revealing her crazy dialect that pops up on occasion), and with a rushed yet harsh past. She fights for her mama (who coaches a rival school) due to said mama being the first to accept her, and she even has a harsher alternate personality hell-bent on protecting her and her ass, while being a bit more violent, shall we say. Unfortunately, none of her peers are nearly as interesting aside from their powers. Well, let it not be said that they made for some epic fights.ART: 8/10Xebec is famous for their work on the tit and ass filled romp known as To Love-RU. Well, they definitely brought their expertise to this show. It is loaded with that stuff! Plus, the action is pretty cool to look at, and the rough outlines make this show\'s look stick out, like a competitor\'s ass while wearing one of these swimsuits. It makes sure that the hits that connect are all hard-hitting, and full of impact. Unfortunately, the CGI in some moments (like the KEIJO lands in the first few episodes) is utter ass! That being said, this show truly embraces its insanity, with the art being no exception.SOUND: 7/10The OP, ""DREAM x SCRAMBLE"" by AIRI is energetic as hell, and with the proper amount of T&A to really set the tone for this series. We can\'t forget the song that takes up the rump of each episode, the ED. Today, we have ""Fantas/HIP Girlfriends!"" by the VA\'s of our main 4 ladies, and it is a delightfully cheery song to cool us off after the as(s)inine experience we just went through. Too bad literally none of the background OST was remotely memorable! Such a shame, too. The dub is pretty good here. The kept the dialect of these kooky characters, and with some mostly well-casted fresh new talent to take up the mains while standout veterans like Monica Rial (who plays Hitomi) pepper some of the supporting roles to help out with the quality just in case. It\'s a pretty solid dub, which is an absolute necessity for us foreigners who wanna hear our lovely ladies in a less foreign language.ENJOYMENT: 8/10Some of the jokes got a bit old, and I did have a few big questions, but, as I said, this show busted its rump to bring us a fun ol\' time here. It was a blast to see just how crazy each new event would get, reminding me of my time with Gurren Lagann, which is a good thing to be reminded of. The fights could get really freakin\' fun, and I found myself laughing my ass off at some of the jokes and weird sh*t that went on here (not always for the right reasons, but hey, it worked). Sure, it wasn\'t truly epic for me, and I could\'ve covered its ground a bit better so assholes like me would stop asking questions, but it was still a good time. Plus, the second half of the ending really put an endeared smile on my face. Then again, I am just a filthy male :PT&A: 10/10Nozomi, Mio ,and Maya alone brought this up to a 10. Their legendary selves are just, well, legendary. Kawai and Kyoko being up high up as well. Plus, each girl uses their tits and asses in creative ways and to crazy effects. It\'s captivating how well this anime mastered this art. Then again, this anime IS the pinnacle of class.OVERALL: 7/10    RAW SCORE: 72/100This anime is truly a romp of 2016 that will be remember for a long time. With its crazy moves, its absurd fan service, and its sheer tenASSity, all our gripes with the Fall 2016 season have been rendered superfluous. Besides, as Suave from AnimeAbandon puts it: ""The 13 year-old in me thinks this is hilarious and dumb, and at the end of the day, that\'s all we really asked for."" Well, with all that said, with this final word count, I bid you adieu.Word Count: I don\'t know. Somebody please be a diligent guy and deliver the number to my lazy ass, please?ASS Count (all synonyms included, not including the word in this count): 50Booty booty booty booty rockin\' everywhere, booty booty booty booty rockin\' everywhere, booty booty booty booty rockin\' everywhere, body booty-"" -Barney Stinson\'s booty call phone, 2012. with loads of crazy ass fan service. I may have a little but of bias towards this show. I AM just a filthy male! So, did this booty-licious romp pay off? Well, let\'s find out, shall we?STORY: 5/10Basically, this is an underdog sports story about 4 girls training to be accepted as elites and eventually, being true pride to their school: a school that teaches KEIJO!!!!!!!! You need a lot to truly make this kind of story stand out, and unfortunately, this is Keijo\'s (not very) fatal flaw. Despite all of the amounts of tits and ass in full, glorious display here, the story beats present don\'t necessarily come off as new, and since some things (like ass pull power-ups, how after almost a year in which part of the training regimen is sit-ups, very few of them have ass, the way our final opponent changes hair due to personality change despite that that\'s now how that works, how in the finale, Nozomi spams a dangerous attack multiple times but feels no pain, how they often forget that they can use their boobs to attack since the only two things you\'re allowed to use are the tits and dah bootay, etc) make no sense, even for the show\'s logic, I gotta put aside my manly urges and knock this story down a peg.That being said, some of the things that happen here are...unique. No only does this show have some puny ass arcs, but the powers can definitely be creative. I mean, Gate of Bootylan? Butt-tack on Titan ? This show makes more bouts of bad puns than Yang from RWBY, and that is saying a lot. Also, sometimes, just to mix things up, they make one of our protagonists lose in a way that feels downright unfair (Aoba in episode 10). Plus, the major tone-shift in the first half of episode 12 can give such a whiplash, that if it was directed at my ass, that booty would be red as hell. I also wish that there would\'ve been some buildup to the Ease and West War tournament that takes up the last 1/3 of the series. However, let it not be said that I like the sheer escalation of events. With each arc, the protagonists make it by the skin of their teeth, but each arc\'s obstacles are much more kickass and brutal than that of the previous one. Plus, as the series goes on, the absurdity of these crazy ass moves increases exponentially, and to glorious results in each of the battles in the last 4 episodes. It\'s ridiculous. It\'s absurd. It\'s...not enough to save the story all things considered, despite how tragic some of the characters\' pasts (like Maya) can be, and how nice the ending is. Now, off with that boring ass thing we call: reasonable criticism. This is KEIJO!!!!!!!!CHARACTERS: 8/10Nozomi is a hot-blooded protagonist that ends up having to work her butt off just to keep up with each new groundbreaking opponent, ad she is a total romp! I especially love the fact that instead of the classic protagonist motivations (I wanna be stronger, I wanna be the best), she just wants to be rich. Sayaka is a rival of hers who wants approval of her father while keeping up with her peers, no matter how much stress and offense she takes in the process. Aoba starts off really shy, but though her effed up powers and acceptance by her peers, she becomes much more confident. Plus, the lucky sod gets all the ass! Non is your cutely and clumsy big tittied gal, but instead of just hurting herself with her clumsiness, she puts everyone through hell, both through near-death accidents, or knocking coffee on a white bed. Then, she has the nerve to make all sorts of excuses justifications in an attempt at bravado. My favorite thing about these girls is the fact that they actually have dialects! How many times have you seen an anime that does that with its MCs.  It does this with Maya as well, but we\'ll get to that lovely lady in a bit.Mio is probably my favorite character. She is a total lech (have you SEEN how she gets around cute girls?!), more so than most men of this archethype, but she is also one of the ultimate badasses this this show. She is the crux of some pf the funniest moments of the show (like her few second of punishment in episode 5). Not to mention, that she is the most beautiful, and fight me IRL if you disagree! I would definitely want a piece of her ass in bed! Well, not really, but she is my favorite here. Then we have a few quirky characters like Kawai (sinister in battle, but a total romantic dork), Kotone (lover of gay hentai), Saya (swordsman-like beauty who shows up in episode 11 for a badass moment of awesome) Usagi (fangirl of Mio, and possibly lesbo for her), Yuko ( who, along with Aoba, has the curse of just never being able to win) Nagisa (our coach who was once a pro at this sport, as well as Nozomi\'s predator of the Butt Vacuum Wave technique), Kyoko (badass teacher and Kyoto\'s butt missile lady), and Rin (overconfident, but, umm, she doesn\'t have any real quirks). Some are more interesting than others, but (and they all have big butts) they are generally a very endearing cast with plenty of life in them.Maya is an interesting one. Undoubtedly the second most beautiful mistress here, she is originally mysterious (not without accidentally revealing her crazy dialect that pops up on occasion), and with a rushed yet harsh past. She fights for her mama (who coaches a rival school) due to said mama being the first to accept her, and she even has a harsher alternate personality hell-bent on protecting her and her ass, while being a bit more violent, shall we say. Unfortunately, none of her peers are nearly as interesting aside from their powers. Well, let it not be said that they made for some epic fights.ART: 8/10Xebec is famous for their work on the tit and ass filled romp known as To Love-RU. Well, they definitely brought their expertise to this show. It is loaded with that stuff! Plus, the action is pretty cool to look at, and the rough outlines make this show\'s look stick out, like a competitor\'s ass while wearing one of these swimsuits. It makes sure that the hits that connect are all hard-hitting, and full of impact. Unfortunately, the CGI in some moments (like the KEIJO lands in the first few episodes) is utter ass! That being said, this show truly embraces its insanity, with the art being no exception.SOUND: 7/10The OP, ""DREAM x SCRAMBLE"" by AIRI is energetic as hell, and with the proper amount of T&A to really set the tone for this series. We can\'t forget the song that takes up the rump of each episode, the ED. Today, we have ""Fantas/HIP Girlfriends!"" by the VA\'s of our main 4 ladies, and it is a delightfully cheery song to cool us off after the as(s)inine experience we just went through. Too bad literally none of the background OST was remotely memorable! Such a shame, too. The dub is pretty good here. The kept the dialect of these kooky characters, and with some mostly well-casted fresh new talent to take up the mains while standout veterans like Monica Rial (who plays Hitomi) pepper some of the supporting roles to help out with the quality just in case. It\'s a pretty solid dub, which is an absolute necessity for us foreigners who wanna hear our lovely ladies in a less foreign language.ENJOYMENT: 8/10Some of the jokes got a bit old, and I did have a few big questions, but, as I said, this show busted its rump to bring us a fun ol\' time here. It was a blast to see just how crazy each new event would get, reminding me of my time with Gurren Lagann, which is a good thing to be reminded of. The fights could get really freakin\' fun, and I found myself laughing my ass off at some of the jokes and weird sh*t that went on here (not always for the right reasons, but hey, it worked). Sure, it wasn\'t truly epic for me, and I could\'ve covered its ground a bit better so assholes like me would stop asking questions, but it was still a good time. Plus, the second half of the ending really put an endeared smile on my face. Then again, I am just a filthy male :PT&A: 10/10Nozomi, Mio ,and Maya alone brought this up to a 10. Their legendary selves are just, well, legendary. Kawai and Kyoko being up high up as well. Plus, each girl uses their tits and asses in creative ways and to crazy effects. It\'s captivating how well this anime mastered this art. Then again, this anime IS the pinnacle of class.OVERALL: 7/10    RAW SCORE: 72/100This anime is truly a romp of 2016 that will be remember for a long time. With its crazy moves, its absurd fan service, and its sheer tenASSity, all our gripes with the Fall 2016 season have been rendered superfluous. Besides, as Suave from AnimeAbandon puts it: ""The 13 year-old in me thinks this is hilarious and dumb, and at the end of the day, that\'s all we really asked for.""

You land your big boy job at a studio known for their terrible ecchi adaptations. Months of slavishly working late nights pass, drawing frames for trashy harem comedies after garbage light novel adaptations, and all the magic and wonder of animation has been replaced with a visceral hatred and complacency; because, face it, you can always quit and get a lower paying job drawing hentai.You get a promotion, all of a sudden you\'re key animating, and life gets a little better. The next day, the first thing that...drops on your brand new mahogany desk is a manilla folder. Your line director tells you that you need to draw frames for a dynamic action sequence where a swimsuit clad girl slams her cooch down into another scantily clad girl\'s face before performing a movie that would make Mortal Kombat cringe: an ""Ass Guillotine"". You\'re told that the show is called ""Keijo!!!!!!!!"", with 8 exclamation points.And people wonder why karoushi is particularly high among animators.""Keijo begins with the butt and ends with the buttAnd so did any possibility of this anime being anything other than pathetic, titillating fanservice with the utterance of that line.It seems like every year, right around Christmas time, we\'re given gifts. Some gifts are good, useful, and necessary in our lives- like when I got my bicycle. I was elated, it was useful, and I still cherish it, because it keeps my ass from having to walk!And then at the other end of the spectrum, that weirdo at work or school gets your name for secret santa and gives you some useless piece of crap like a duct taped ball of change, someone\'s Pottery 1001 class final project, an electric can opener, and some used deodorant. I mean, imagine waking up on Christmas morning to find you got a new computer, a new phone, a new car, and oh... a Keijo dvd... who gave me that?Unfortunately, much like herpes, Keijo was a gift that kept on giving this season, too. Boy, did it ever give- but mostly just what it stole from other anime. My biggest criticism of Keijo is certainly that it has not one original thought in its disgustingly voluptuous body. I just reviewed Akame and bashed it for misappropriating setpieces and scenes from other anime, and Keijo takes this to 11, with the least amount of tact and taste possible. Half the characters are just reincarnations of Jojo characters- down to the sound effects and power abilities (stop time, ORAORAORA, take your pick, it\'s in there), rips from Fist of the North Star, Fate Stay Night (replace GIlgamesh\'s noble fantasm with butts, how original), Attack on Titan, and a myriad other hamfisted ""references"" that you could file under fanservice as well.See, the problem with Keijo isn\'t that it\'s just a stupid tournament panty fighter like Ikkitousen, the problem is that it shows all of its cards way too early, dissolves tension, and gives all of its characters the Code Geass treatment of way too many fanservicey butt and boob shots to the detriment of the fight. Panty fighters can be funny and still have a semblance of a story, like Butt Attack Punisher Girl. Panty fighters can be narrow, shameless and tasteless displays of female sex objects too- which is what Keijo falls under.To the tension dissolving point- we see every character\'s ""SUPER ULTRA MEGA MONSTER"" move within the first few episodes. You know that they have the ability within them, and that they\'re only going to use it right at the climax of the battle when all looks lost- swoop in and save the day, ride off into the sunset, the end, everyone wins, power of friendship!Take for instance, Jotaro from Jojo part 3. In the beginning, his Star Platinum ability is barely controllable, and while still strong, beatable by many early opponents. The nefarious DIO shows that he has the power to stop time with ZA WARUDO right at the beginning- but his ability to do so also grows. When the final battle comes, not only has Jotaro learned new abilities, but he also pulls one out of the hat that we didn\'t expect, though it fits in perfectly with the show, enabling him to do what I said before- swoop in and claim victory from the jaws of defeat. Keijo? You learn the super move day 1, use it to win in every battle afterwards. That\'s neither interesting nor fun to watch, it\'s just a matter of taking bets on when it\'s coming.You know, if you rearrange the letters in Keijo, you can get another world that describes it better... Kojei: which means shit in Okinawan.Keijo is like a bad gag gift. Some gag gifts can be funny, because they put the recipient in a situationally funny or embarrassing position in front of a bunch of people, like getting some sexy underwear and a dildo. Except you\'re a guy. And the lingerie won\'t fit. So what do you do?

I\'ve viewed this line of thinking with a grain of salt, for the obvious reason that, well, anime can\'t be saved, it\'s irredeemable at this point.But what if it could be saved?What if we could end this cycle of bad karma?But what could do it? What could save anime?A new Trigger romp with experimental animation and another iteration on Gunbuster\'s coming of age...story? Noble effort, Imaishi, but you can only go so far. Panty&amp;Stocking was but a deflated life vest lost in the sea of moe-colored urine. Luluco, despite being anime of the year, also failed to resonate and return these Chinese cartoons to their original purity.A fresh romp from acclaimed director Cowboy ""Watanabe"" Bebop? Sadly no, Terror in Resonance offered less hope than Obama, while Space Dandy offered as much substance as our future emperor Donald J. Trump. (Editor\'s note: nailed it. )Maybe one of the murderers who killed anime could do it. Could Geass\' Taniguchi come back and deliver us something as good as his magnum opus, Scryed? No, we got Active Raid instead. Sunrise\'s Cross Ange was definitely saving anime for a while, but petered out in the end.All hope appeared to be lost. But. What if... What if a series went the opposite route? What if it took everything that killed anime, and went so far into it that it looped around on itself and became the cure? What if derivative, pandering trash like Angel Beats pandered so hard that it smashed right through its target audience of lowlifes and became High Art?Well, we\'re going to find out. You\'re 1000 words into this review (for the second fucking time thanks MAL) and now you\'re going to learn about~ * ~ KEIJO!!!!!!!! ~ * ~KEIJO!!!!!!!! is an action series about dedication and fighting spirit, but it\'s more than that: it\'s a story about one girl\'s dream to get fuckin\' paid. Yeah, the series is about this Blue Hair girl who graduated high school and wants to get paid by beating other girls\' faces in with her ass. She has a friend, White Hair, who is a judo master that can attack with her ass at supersonic speed. Another friend, Udders, has an ass so soft that it deflects oncoming trains, and the last friend, Hairtail, can judge an opponent\'s power level by feeling their ass.Also, the series is about some kind of sport where young martial artists and gymnasts fight with their hips or something. It\'s more or less just a device to push the narrative of ""hard works gets you mad dollars"", much like all those other sports anime out there.The show delivers this soft-hitting (editor\'s note: LOL) premise with great production values. Character animation and fight choreography are right out of goddamn Hajime no Ippo or Gurren Lagann. The animation uses varying line thicknesses for foreground and background during fights, giving the series a very hand-animated look at points, and the cinematography is phresh. The shots are dynamic and interesting to look at, along with great use of ON-SCREEN WORDS popularized by Panty&amp;Stocking/Kill la Kill, JoJo, etc. KEIJO!!!!!!!! carries great energy and timing into almost every scene, making it both not-boring, and funny.HOWEVER after the first 7-8 episodes the art and animation kind of falls off a cliff, which is a damn shame, since that\'s right around when the climactic final tournament starts. It\'s most evident in the final episode, which is easily the worst-looking in the series. Luckily, the usual absurdity of what\'s happening still saves the show and keeps it very compelling.The characters\' abilities and fighting styles are about as fleshed out (editor\'s note: LOL) as any fighting shounen series, but it\'s all presented with an amazing sense of facetiousness. You can tell the team behind this show was having a lot of fun putting a nearly uncalled for level of thought into the reasoning and presentation of the action sequences. Special techniques all have fabulous names with accompanying ~extreme on-screen text~ - it\'s very cool and creative. The source material was ridiculous, but more grounded, whereas is the anime goes full ham.The pacing is great. The anime skips the first half of the manga or so and settles right in on the meaty competition portion of the story, and moves along at great speed. Characters and concepts are introduced quickly, and even though you technically miss 40 chapter of content, you don\'t actually notice because the writers for the show were competent enough to know how to adapt the material to best fit the medium.I\'ve grown to really like the OST for this show. Opening is catchy, and the accompanying animation is very much amusing enough. There are some very hammy emotional/background tracks that stand out during climactic scenes. The sound design though: That\'s where this show shines. KEIJO!!!!!!!! uses sound in some pretty unique ways that are genuinely hilarious. You\'ll hear mechanical sounds, explosions, energy pulses and everything in between when various ass-centric attacks are used, and during combat every fight in this series is full of other varied and exaggerated impact sounds.So, is this how one saves anime?Does this series do what none before it could?Yes. story?

However, a side effect of the FUCKING massive load of testosterone this show will forcefully inject into your veins is that you will become so straight that merely looking at another male will force your body into a form of cryostasis that can only be counteracted by playing episode 4 from twelve minutes twenty-five seconds to twelve minutes fifty-five seconds (thank me later).

At first, this show sounds like it could be pretty fun and indeed it was for the first couple of episodes. The sheer insanity and silliness of it all certainly made for an entertaining watch especially since the show never took itself seriously in the slightest and each of these girls had their own super powered attack using their butts which kind of reminded me of JoJo of all things. However, just like the...anime Ben-to, it starts off pretty promising for a rule-of-cool anime with a lot of over-the-top action sequences but fails at this since it becomes repetitive and the characters are not interesting enough to hold it all together.For starters, the narrative is something that has been done a million times before to much better effect. It's a basic story of a girl who wants to become the best in her field, and in this context, the best ass and tit champion. She joins a school, makes new friends, proves herself in competitions, moves up the ranks, learns new moves and then fights stronger and stronger enemies. It's a very basic linear story that doesn't try to do anything new nor is all too memorable after you've finished watching the series. It's hard to find investment in the narrative and characters surrounding said story since the characters are hard to latch onto and remain one dimensional throughout the show. None of them really do all too much or do anything interesting nor go through any arcs as people. At the most, the only thing that does develop in terms of characters is the size of their assess (there's a sentence I never thought I would say). The fights, which can be entertaining in their own rights, lack any sort of investment or engagement since I never cared for a single character in the entire show. Everyone is a cardboard cut-out of an existing archetype and everyone is defined by the size of their breasts or the size of their butt. While some of the characterisations is okay and can lead into some genuinely fun moments these were still few and far between. There isn't all too much time invested in any character and whenever a new character is introduced they're normally pushed to the side after their initial introduction and left to remain stagnant.Now, I'm not expecting deep, groundbreaking themes in a show that is trying to be full of tits and ass with nothing else but I feel as if there were some things in the narrative which could have been expanded on and made into interesting ideas. One such example was in the case of Sayaka's father, a man who was new to this bizarre new sport. This could have provided us with a new perspective on this world and could have led into themes of sexualisation of women and the such but it is glossed over so quickly leading to no development in the slightest.Since the fan-service is such a big part of this show I think I will address this now. I have nothing against fan-service in shows, in fact, some of my favourite anime have fan-service elements but when that's all your show has it comes across as a desperate plea to be noticed and the show feels trashy since it can't stand on its own two feet without the inclusion of a boob shot every five minutes. Now, it's obvious that the show is only meant to be enjoyed as a guilty pleasure; a show in which you're supposed to switch your mind off and just laugh at the idea of seeing women in tight swimsuits beating the crap out of each other with their tits and this is fine of its own since I believe this show does achieve its aim of being a cheesy light-hearted fan-service show. In fact, there were many times in which I was generally having fun with the show with the insane logic and attacks these girls were able to throw out. However, while there were plenty of moments in which I was entertained, this is also met with many moments in which I was bored and uninterested in what was going on, in particular during the training segments and during some of the forced character backstories which felt more like a lazy way for the writer to create emotion rather than building it up slowly which would be more impactful. The show does start off pretty fun but slowly degenerates into a dull and uninteresting mess since the novelty of the show begins to wear off for me since there were no interesting characters to root for nor anything worthwhile in the narrative. Now, I'm sure there are people who were entertained from start to finish with this show, which is fine, but I was not. I found the entire experience to be more tiresome than fun by the end since it felt like a chore to watch each and every episode.The animation was pretty consistent and I liked some of the character designs too. As I've said, some of the killer attacks could be funny in their absurdity and the animation and art design do a good job at conveying this. It's clear that the staff put their sole attention into making every ass and pair of tits look as great as possible and for an ecchi oriented show, it does look pretty well done. The music was okay, and I did like the opening and ending tracks for this anime, albeit nothing amazing or too spectacular.Keijo (insert 8 exclamation points) is clearly a series that serves to the lowest common denominator and thinks that slapping a bunch of tits on the screen will be enough to warrant the show to be 'fun'. While there were a couple of times I was having fun, it wasn't a substantial amount of time to raise the bar and I can't even argue in favour the notion that I should see this show as nothing more than a guilty pleasure.In order for Keijo (insert 8 exclamation points) to work, it needed to have stronger and more interesting characters and to have done more with its premise; which it didn't. I can only recommend this to you if you're a hardcore ecchi fan since there are so many better shows out there for you to enjoy that actually take the time to develop characters while still having a lot of ass and tits.

It looked dumb.And that\'s really what Keijo has going for it. It is dumb. It is the stupidest idea I have ever heard. Girls have to compete only using their breasts and butts to attack other competitors. Nobody can tell me that that isn\'t the dumbest thing.Keijo is everything that is wrong with anime. And it is parody gold at its finest. I\'m not going to claim that this was the author\'s intent or that he\'s a genius for making this show. I couldn\'t care less what he thinks. The...show is played so painfully straight that it parodies itself.And that is why Keijo is such comedy gold. The competitors take this sport seriously. The audience takes it seriously. There are sports announcers covering it play-by-play and there is an instance where an instant replay is used to judge the outcome of the match.Girls shout out shounen based attacks that are based off video games and anime. Since they use nothing but their breasts and butts in the attacks, it just crescendos into the most lulzworthy moments where characters utilize attacks like the *shoryucans*.I really would have hated Keijo in any other context. I don\'t think the studio that picked it up really put that much thought into it either. The artwork suffers from what appears to be some anti-aliasing effect, which for a hand drawn show is just a ""da fuq"" moment. I\'m sure with their vast catalog of ecchi shows they simply saw something with tits and ass and figured, ""looks legit and right up our alley.""What they produced, however, was one of the best anime comedies of 2016. show is played so painfully straight that it parodies itself.And that is why Keijo is such comedy gold.

Do I need to say more?Keijo, an anime marketed as an ecchi sports shounen anime, didn’t need to rely on the usual “plot” to stay afloat as one of the top animes of 2016. The anime is outrageous. The best part is that the director knows it as well and doesn’t shy away from abusing that factor. Keijo is a sport about pushing people off floating platforms using your boobs or butts. How can a show like this keep the audience captivated for an entire season? If you think it was the typical “anime plot” that kept the audience hooked,...well you are partially right, but it was more so the originality and making mockery of previous shounen animes that kept everyone entertained.The story is simple and as straight forward as any other sport animes. You have a girl, Nozomi, who wants to be the very best that no one ever was. She will train harder than anyone and believe it she shall. Each adversaries she comes across, she faces with full determination and moves on. Through the power of friendship from her amigos, she will learn the OP Boob/Butt moves and have fun.The characters surprisingly stand out from each other. They have unique characteristics and each of the characters bring their own set of skills and OP moves (parody of anime attacks, most notable include Booty of Babylons and Buttocks on Titan) that just makes you laugh and appreciate a good mockery of the sports shounen genre. From one ridiculous OP villains to the next (much like Naruto) the battle never ends.The animation is a blend of CGI and hand-drawn characters that gives it vibrant feeling to the anime as a whole. The music score accompanying it does its job phenomenally. Both the OP & ED songs are energetic enough to reflect the mood of this anime. They knew how to reveal just the right amount but not too much, almost as if teasing the audience to keep coming back for more. And for more (fan service) you shall return, I guarantee.Jokes aside, when jumping into the world of Keijo, keep an open mind if you wish to really have fun with this anime. Do not take it seriously and just know that it’s an outrageous anime whose main purpose is to make the audience react to its absurdity. If you look at it critically it has several flaws like plot armour, lack of logic and jokes getting overused.  However, it will still wow you with sheer amounts of bizarre unpredictability.So if you want to watch an “ecchi” show but can still tell your friends that you watched a sports shounen with comedy vibes like OPM & MP100, definitely give it a shot.P.S. I’m always open to criticism and suggestions and I hope you found this short but supaishi review helpful. well you are partially right, but it was more so the originality and making mockery of previous shounen animes that kept everyone entertained.The story is simple and as straight forward as any other sport animes.

Bad English puns everybody, LeaderTGW (the greatest warriors) always provides them!Boobs & asses fighting it out on a small floating platform in water in a ridiculous game… well, sport that only the Japanese could possibly conceive. Keijo was definitely the transition anime needed this year. A break from those magical school battle harem titles, and the “original” (Sarcasm*) trapped in a fantasy world or video game titles. Keijo\'s story is simple, consistent, and most importantly it works. The plot is straight-forward and for the most part follows the original sources story. There are small...breaks in the story however, these are necessary sub plots filled with training, backstories, and fan service. All necessary in order to keep the story refreshing and engaging.What makes this story so unique? So appealing? That isn\'t related to boobs and asses. I\'d say that it\'s the pacing as well as the characters determination to be great at the tournaments. As many before me have already mentioned, the anime skips a few chapters of the manga, and this choice in direction improves the pacing. In addition to this change, I’ve also noticed that some dialogue is cut too. Perhaps a change needed to focus more on action. The intensity and determination of the characters keeps the show interesting. The girls have a goal, and they\'re willing to subject themselves to weird ""ass"" training methods in order to improve their skill.Moving on to the fan-service. Personally I didn\'t feel that the fan service was rewarding enough. I\'m not saying that it\'s bad; it\'s just that there was a lack of nudity, and sex appeal. I felt that the direction the fan-service leaned on was comedic rather than erotic. They had to force sexy moments rather than having them happen naturally, and honestly that took some of the pleasure away from the show.Lastly, what was it about Keijo’s story that made me happy? It was perhaps the most ""fun"" title that I\'ve seen in a long time. Over the top explosions and blast from asses that aren\'t fart related, the action was intense. Overall the story wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be. It provided enough entertainment and pleasure for an ecchi title.The art in Keijo… Oh boy. Character designs are awful! The character outlines to be more specific. They remind me of a bad vectoring job or rendering done in either Illustrator or Inkscape. The outlines look pixelated and the strokes are disgusting to see with their movements. This took away quality from the action scenes (Special moves) on platforms. A majority of the time, the outlines looked way too big! Hair on a majority of the girls was for the most part poorly done. Hair in anime is always unique and often times define a characters personality and appeal. While the personality part sticks with the character designs in Keijo, the appeal is appalling.I felt like they went overboard with hair designs. Nozomi\'s hair in particular reminds me of a cockroach with those hideous antennae. There are way too many character design flaws in keijo and that really hurt the 7/10 score I wanted to give it. As an artist who loves to do vectors and renders it was a complete eyesore looking at the designs.Background settings and the environment were surprisingly nice to look at. Water and waves would obviously be the eye catcher. Other things featured in the show like plantations and farms looked pretty nice too.Special effects were amazing. Over the top as I had mentioned earlier. What I enjoy most was that the effects were able to captivate me as well as the manga’s effects did. Special move were great despite the hideous character animation that often followed. Now the subtitles were bad in terms of localizing. I watched Keijo via CrunchyRoll and boy was that a mistake.  I’d say about 85% of the changes that were made, were incredibly cringe-worthy and hurt the quality. In all honesty though, it’s better than nothing. Overall I felt that the animation was vibrant and intense.In the sound department, I felt that the voice actors were able to do an excellent job making battles intense and exciting with all their yelling. To be honest, it seemed like with the way the new voice actors dropped their lines, it is as if they were told by the voice director to watch 90’s shounen anime to get an idea on how their character should yell out special moves! Needless to say, I am impressed. Sound effects were about a silver. For the most part I noticed that they were recycled like most are. Lastly, the opening and ending songs. I cannot say that I was impressed with them. They fit the theme of the show and unfortunately that’s about all I can add.Enjoyment and overall feelings for the show were low were I first started it. I expected nothing special to come of this series. It was only when I finally decided to read the reactions of others that I finally sat down and gave the show a watch. To my amazement the show is pretty solid and well-polished. As I said earlier there are various changes that could’ve been done to make the visuals look better however, despite how unhappy I was with the designs, the action and comedy is what eventually allowed me to accept Keijo as an 8/10 anime.

Overall I was very impressed with Keijo.', 'Keijo is an ecchi sports anime revolving around a girls-only fighting sport wherein the participants can only use their boobs and butts to knock each other into a pool. Did that premise catch your attention? If so, good. You\'re in for more than you bargained for.I actually didn\'t even watch this when it released. Around the time of the third episode, my girlfriend introduced me to the show. Since then, it became one of very few seasonal anime I watched as it released. As of writing this review, I have just viewed the final episode and can safely say this is one of my favorite...anime. If you want an in-depth look at why I feel this way, stick around.This show has been making considerable waves since its debut in late fall 2016, and has become one of the most polarizing shows in recent years. The fans rave about the show ""saving anime"", while others see it as nothing more than mindless fanservice trying too hard to take itself seriously. Let\'s take a look.Going along with the premise, Keijo follows 18-year-old Nozomi Kaminashi, a recent high school graduate who begins competing in the sport to support her poor family. Much like another Xebec-produced show, Zoids, Keijo is one big competition, with battles happening each episode for the sake of a competitive sport. It is a very faithful adaptation of the 2013 manga, which is something any anime fan can appreciate. Although the first episode skips a large portion of the story and does infact cut out some of the world building and character development (I own some of the physical manga, and the first four volumes are condensed in to episode one) the show very closely follows the manga after this.I could describe nearly every aspect of Keijo as ""a breath of fresh air"", but that would get redundant, so let\'s cover the individual categories instead.Story:The actual story is incredibly simple. Nozomi and her friend Miyata enroll in Setouchi Keijo Training School, compete in the sport, meet new friends and rivals along the way, and grow. Think of it like college football, if you will. This is arguably the weakest part of the show. The enjoyment comes from character development, the dynamics between said characters, and their interactions rather than storytelling.Still, we do get to explore the history of the sport a bit, and each individual character\'s story to an extent. I can understand why some of the early story was skipped in the manga, however. The way storytelling is executed in manga is considerably different than it is in anime, as you may realize if you do pick the Keijo manga up. The action scene you see in the first episode doesn\'t happen for a few volumes in the manga, and that was what drew most viewers in, so overall it was a smart move.Art:Earlier this year, I rediscovered my love of Zoids and had to rewatch the anime. To see one of my favorite studios, Xebec, handling this show put a smile on my face. Although they don\'t use as much CG as they do in other works (it was mostly the land platforms you see the girls fighting on), the character designs themselves are the best I\'ve seen since Gurren Lagann. Fans of To Love Ru will notice the distinct style here.Let me start by saying the body designs are absolute perfection. One issue I\'ve taken with all-girl shows in the past is their body types. More often than not, they all look like they could snap like twigs at the slightest breeze. Keijo offers something different. In line with the fact that a competitor\'s best asset is their rear end, no expense was spared here; these girls have it going on in the back. As someone who likes big butts (and he cannot lie), these designs definitely stood out. It doesn\'t stop there, either. Just about every girl has a different body type. You\'ve got the classic slender ladies (Miyata, Rin), to the more well-rounded curvy gals (Nozomi, Aoba), to downright thick (Hanabi, Non) and beyond. Muscular girls, statuesque, amazionian, BBWs, there\'s someone for everyone in Keijo.They\'re drawn in a sharp, thickly outlined style that unsurprisingly brought back memories of the Zoids cast. However, the art especially shines during the battle scenes. The show demonstrates an incredibly good understanding of anatomy and doesn\'t exaggerate itself too much. That is to say, the characters themselves. Cuz if we\'re talking about the moves they perform, Keijo doesn\'t know the meaning of ""exaggerated""! If I had to complain about one thing, the last episode seems to have spent its budget mostly on the big fight between Nozomi and Maya, as some of the characters look rough and low-detail compared to previous episodes.It\'s an absolute blast to watch the races. The backgrounds and environments are quite lovely as well, from the crystal clear waters of the pools and rivers, to the lovely view of nature seen from their bus. Overall it\'s everything I like about animation and character design; you can really feel the weight of every movement!Sound:No complaints here. The opening theme, DREAMxSCRAMBLE, became an instant favorite, which I even listened to in public a few times. It embodies the positive, passionate tone the show exudes. Then you have the end theme, Fantas/Hip Girlfriends, another light positive tune that sings about growing stronger together, set to a scene of the girls retrieving swimsuits. It\'s even performed by the Japanese cast of the show itself! The rest of the background music fits the mood to a T, especially the more action-oriented themes, which never fail to get me pumped for the next race. Each attack has tons of hard-hitting feedback, standard fare for the ecchi genre with smacking and rubbery stretch noises.The biggest compliment goes to the voice cast of BOTH the original Japanese and dub cast. Another issue I often take is that many female characters sound simply too young. Adult women that sound like lolis make a show hard to watch, but like many other all-girl shows (Madoka Magica, Love Live) the cast brings it home with unique voices fitting of a grown-ass woman. Japanese singer Lynn lends her voice as main character Nozomi, and puts a ton of energy and vibrant passion into the voice, especially during battles. Rena Maeda manages to strike a balance between cute and serious in her performance as Hanabi Kawai.Early into the show\'s airing, a dub was also produced. Amber Lee Connors, a former fan dubber working with TeamFourStar, was cast as Nozomi here and manages to capture her rough-around-the-edges attitude very well. Seasoned dub actress Alexis Tipton brings out Aoba\'s reserved personality, while newer voices keep things fresh, like Kristen McGuire adding some girlish charm to Hanabi. I strongly recommend both formats, although I think the sub wins here, if only for Hibiku Yamamura\'s performance as Mio Kukasai, although Michelle Rojas does a great job sounding almost orgasmic in the dub.Character:Like Zoids before it, this is (other than the over-the-top fight scenes) where Keijo shows its stuff. This is where I have to mention that the show utilizes its 12 episodes better than many other shows of a similar length, showcasing some amazing time management. There\'s a ""main"" cast of eight characters, and believe me when I say every last one of them gets their chance to shine, and even then some girls outside of that bunch get some great moments.I\'ll use my favorite character, Hanabi Kawai as an example. She\'s introduced as one of the strongest competitors and comes off as extremely competitive and borderline sadistic. Imagine my surprise when she developed into the most lighthearted and optimistic character in the show! After the first episode, she isn\'t shown fighting (one fight happens offscreen, granted) and takes the role of providing commentary and exposition in each race. Many fans consider Keijo the girl version of the ever-popular Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure, and I can definitely see the parallels peppered throughout the show, such as Hanabi essentially filling Speedwagon\'s role (there are infact direct references to Part 3 of the manga/anime, for the record). She becomes something of a friendly rival, believing in the others and later expressing her strong desire to use the fame she accrues from the sport to find a boyfriend. However, when she does return to the battlefield, she proves not only to be just as strong as ever, but instrumental in the victory of the final battle.Jobbing (a term used in pro wrestling to refer to a previously-established powerful character being defeated by a new character for the purpose of showing just how powerful they are) does not exist in Keijo as it does in most action-centric anime, and that\'s one of the show\'s strongest points. Outside of battle, character interactions are fun to watch and can range from heartwarming to oftentimes downright hilarious. Just about every character comes off as three-dimensional and fleshed out, as much as they could be in twelve episodes. This is more than a lot of longer shows can say for their cast.Enjoyment:There was very little about Keijo I didn\'t have fun with. After picking the show up three episodes in, it was quite the fun occasion to get to watch each episode Thursday night. In addition to watching the show both subbed and dubbed, I have watched this with three of my good friends, all of who enjoyed it. Being one of the few shows I watched as it released, Keijo instilled a childlike wonder in me that I have not felt since the days of old-school Toonami. I now know what it feels like when people anticipate a new episode of their favorite show, weird as that sounds. As of writing this, the dub has yet to finish, and you can bet I\'m going to follow it to the end just like the original. It\'s the very definition of a ""fun"" show.Overall:Even if you truly dislike Keijo, it\'s a show which is harmless at best. It\'s cute, fun, girly, positive, and lighthearted. It\'s more than just a sexy fanservice show. It promotes friendship, teamwork, personal growth, and especially good sportsmanship. I bet you didn\'t expect a show like this to have a good message, did you? Nagisa (one of the teachers) reminds the girls of the Keijo motto, ""Only Land"". This refers to the idea that players should treat each other with utmost respect, as equals when in normal social situations, and to save competition and rivalry for the races taking place on the Land itself. This is not my favorite anime of all time, but it earned its spot in my top five and managed to surprise me in more ways than one. I hope more people give this a chance despite the occasional detractor, because that joke about Keijo saving anime might hold more merit than you think! anime. If you want an in-depth look at why I feel this way, stick around.This show has been making considerable waves since its debut in late fall 2016, and has become one of the most polarizing shows in recent years. The fans rave about the show ""saving anime"", while others see it as nothing more than mindless fanservice trying too hard to take itself seriously. Let\'s take a look.Going along with the premise, Keijo follows 18-year-old Nozomi Kaminashi, a recent high school graduate who begins competing in the sport to support her poor family. Much like another Xebec-produced show, Zoids, Keijo is one big competition, with battles happening each episode for the sake of a competitive sport. It is a very faithful adaptation of the 2013 manga, which is something any anime fan can appreciate. Although the first episode skips a large portion of the story and does infact cut out some of the world building and character development (I own some of the physical manga, and the first four volumes are condensed in to episode one) the show very closely follows the manga after this.I could describe nearly every aspect of Keijo as ""a breath of fresh air"", but that would get redundant, so let\'s cover the individual categories instead.Story:The actual story is incredibly simple. Nozomi and her friend Miyata enroll in Setouchi Keijo Training School, compete in the sport, meet new friends and rivals along the way, and grow. Think of it like college football, if you will. This is arguably the weakest part of the show. The enjoyment comes from character development, the dynamics between said characters, and their interactions rather than storytelling.Still, we do get to explore the history of the sport a bit, and each individual character\'s story to an extent. I can understand why some of the early story was skipped in the manga, however. The way storytelling is executed in manga is considerably different than it is in anime, as you may realize if you do pick the Keijo manga up. The action scene you see in the first episode doesn\'t happen for a few volumes in the manga, and that was what drew most viewers in, so overall it was a smart move.Art:Earlier this year, I rediscovered my love of Zoids and had to rewatch the anime. To see one of my favorite studios, Xebec, handling this show put a smile on my face. Although they don\'t use as much CG as they do in other works (it was mostly the land platforms you see the girls fighting on), the character designs themselves are the best I\'ve seen since Gurren Lagann. Fans of To Love Ru will notice the distinct style here.Let me start by saying the body designs are absolute perfection. One issue I\'ve taken with all-girl shows in the past is their body types. More often than not, they all look like they could snap like twigs at the slightest breeze. Keijo offers something different. In line with the fact that a competitor\'s best asset is their rear end, no expense was spared here; these girls have it going on in the back. As someone who likes big butts (and he cannot lie), these designs definitely stood out. It doesn\'t stop there, either. Just about every girl has a different body type. You\'ve got the classic slender ladies (Miyata, Rin), to the more well-rounded curvy gals (Nozomi, Aoba), to downright thick (Hanabi, Non) and beyond. Muscular girls, statuesque, amazionian, BBWs, there\'s someone for everyone in Keijo.They\'re drawn in a sharp, thickly outlined style that unsurprisingly brought back memories of the Zoids cast. However, the art especially shines during the battle scenes. The show demonstrates an incredibly good understanding of anatomy and doesn\'t exaggerate itself too much.

This mixes the sport and ecchi genres together and I feel like the producers pulled this off perfectly. Keijo is an anime with great artwork and sound and I enjoyed every episode thoroughly. The development of the girls from room 309 was rather fast paced but helped set...up a perfect final ending to the series.

Now I can look forward to 2017, with newfound determination to live my life to the fullest. Just like Nozomi\'s full butt.In addition to the characters being phenomenal, the animation was also gorgeous. The fight choreography was stellar, and it felt just like I was watching a high-quality shounen. My friend and I...were also very impressed with the character design, since there\'s a lot of variety within the characters, and none of them seemed needlessly \'moe\'.The music was also spectacular, much to my surprise, and I will definitely be hunting down the OST so I can continue listening to it.The writing was also very fun, at times, Keijo!!!!!!! actually felt more like a shounen in disguise, instead of an ecchi. Keijo!!!!!!! was so over-the-top, it was nothing but enjoyable to watch.Overall, Keijo!!!!!!! was one of the biggest surprises for me in Fall 2016.

At the end of the review I'll put a 'should you watch this'.Story 5/10:Lets be honest here, I can't imagine anyone watching Keijo for the story because well simply, there isn't one, but it's got a solid premise. Keijo starts off like a sports anime, with a main female protagonist aiming to be the best in the sport but then branches off into more a shounen feel when she is put into an academy to train, goes against...other schools and then develops 'special attacks'. The only genre consistent in this anime is ecchi and comedy with every episode getting more ridiculous than the last- but don't let that stop you from watching it! I'm just saying that story telling isn't exactly Keijo's strong point, so don't watch the anime expecting some epic or heart wrenching tale. XDArt 8/10:As expected of an ecchi anime series, the art is pretty darn good. It's vibrant, clean and the girls all look super cute! I personally liked the way that they animated the attacks to look really impactful even though they're just hitting each other with their boobs and butts.Sound 6/10:No gonna lie, the sound wasn't really memorable for me. Like it wasn't bad or anything, but the ost didn't stand out alot in my opnion. The voice acting, however, was superb (if there was a seperate score for this, It'd give it a 9/10) and very expressive and smooth.Character 5/10:I had one major issue with the character design, but I'm honestly not sure whether or not this was on purpose, so I'm just basing it off the point that it wasn't. Let me get this straight, the character designs are beautiful and vivid, with each character's personality distinct. Theres only one tinsey problem though...I've seen all those characters somewhere else before.I wish I was joking to be honest. I personally don't like to compare one anime character to another either, but tbh I was naming characters similar to the ones in keijo off the top of my head and it was getting ridiculous. I don't want to name and shame in case I'm wrong, but let's just say I think the author really likes Rosario vampire.Enjoyment: 8/10Low scores aside, I really liked Keijo! There are alot of unique anime this season, and Keijo's definitely at the top of my list somewhere. I think Keijos strong point is it's level of enjoyment, not it's merits as an Anime production where several components are harshly critiqued.Should YOU watch Keijo?-Keijo is a show not meant to be taken seriously. I have seen *alot* of weird stuff on the internet, and Keijo still manages to amaze me.

To be honest with you though, you may need to overlook a few things in order to fully appreciate the fan service.-Please do not make this your first anime- both for the genre of ecchi and just anime in general. Keijo is an Anime that can only be recognized as fantastic from people who have been exposed to ecchi anime beforehand, and are comfortable with japan's 'weirdness'. other schools and then develops 'special attacks'.

Keijo is an Anime that can only be recognized as fantastic from people who have been exposed to ecchi anime beforehand, and are comfortable with japan's 'weirdness'."", 'With the sure-fire moneymaking genre of in-your-face ecchi anime that attempts to make guys wet their pants, combined with the trend of many sports anime that make girls wet their pants, the anime universe decided to fuse these 2 recipes of success into one. And thus, ‘’Keijoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!’’ was born. In this show, Tits and Ass (From now on will be known as T/A as I will be mentioning this a lot) go into a battle royale, pounding against each other in more than a hundred ways with the objective of knocking the bikini-clad girls off a platform to ultimately decide which female has the ultimate...‘assets’ that could win them a huge tonne of money.Since this show has a plot regarding ‘plots’, it naturally divides fans into two camps: The former who think that this show is just a generic borderline hentai that shoves T/A every 5 seconds and thus having a non-existent storyline and cardboard characters, and the latter who are unafraid to claim that they love the T/A so much that this show is a Godsend. Though I share the sentiments of both camps, as the show goes on I came to realize that I am surprisingly, sitting on the fence here. Without a doubt, the show’s concept of using T/A as a sport already springs up the many red flags resembling a money grabbing hentai show, but the way they execute the series is something that I would not dare label as ‘half hearted’ or ‘purely for the sake of money’. As each episode went by, I began to feel intrigued and look forward to each airing episode, not PURELY for the T/A (I can’t deny that I am not a pervert here), but for the likeable characters and acceptable story, and most importantly, the ‘WTF did I just watch’ expression and the laughter that comes along with it.Note: Surprise surprise, though this show has a shit tonne of fanservice, there is no nudity. In short : no explicit tits or butts, they are always conveniently covered) That is of course, the upcoming Blu-Ray comes and prove me otherwise.Without further ado, let us try to analyse this beast.Sound: Nothing much to be commented on here. It does not grind your ears like fingers against a blackboard nor is it something that you would call a masterpiece, Openings and Endings generic pop designed for the modern teen, and since I am a modern teen, I liked it. Music taste is pretty much subjective, so all I can say is that it’s not anything unique and could be easily forgotten once you stopped watching the show, but do give it a listen. Soundtracks are up to standards of a modern anime series, doing its job to create mood and nothing more, with cheerful music for comedic scenes, upbeat soundtracks for the action scenes etc. I could be nit-picky here and say that the variety of the soundtracks is a bit lacking, but hey, a show with T/A as the main highlight, even if Beethoven was playing the Moonlight Sonata in all its glory, I would still be absorbed by the flashy ‘action scenes’. Voice of the characters are adequate, with the clumsy girls having the annoying high pitched voices (as usual) and the Shounen-Powerup-MC having a loud and confident tone, they just get the job done. (If you are wondering about yelps and the ‘oohs’ and ‘ahhs’ whenever one’s T/A is getting smacked, yes, they are there for you as well). (6/10).Character: In this type of show which shows the almost bare figure of many females which the male populace would like to claim as waifu, the creators made a good move to make characters of different looks, personalities and T/A techniques (more on to this later). I could draw a simile to how this diverse pool of girls can ‘almost’ satisfy each and every fetish of the anime community to how customers of a buffet would always find that one dish to fulfil their stomach. You have the big boobed one that always falls down and shows her undergarments, the never give up MC who always fight till the death and wins, the Tsundere friend who always manages to embarrass herself when no one’s looking, the flat chest who is envy of other people’s chest size, the one with the cat ears, the senpai who loves to fondles the boobs of others, the quiet but smart one…. I could go on forever.Because of this variety, one could play the game ‘find the anime trope’ and could potentially be able to fill a whole Wikipedia page with them. This is not necessarily a thing needed to be criticised though, this show KNOWS that they are doing this trashy stuff, it is AWARE that it is predictable, and they are not shy to admit that, because this show doesn’t require complicated characters to run, it’s all about who uses their T/As the most effectively to achieve victory. You don’t need a brain for this, just your eyes. You wanna talk about character development? HA—HA—HA, that hardly exists here, many of them remain the same at episode 1 until episode 12. However, if one insists that there needs to be at least some, the anime creators comply by giving one or two flash backs here and there that lasts for 2 minutes at most for the sake of explaining why X character behaved differently from its cardboard personality and that’s about it. Aside from the MC, only 2-3 can be claimed to have their characters marginally fleshed out, in more ways than one. **coughs at bad pun**. (7/10 for character variety, 3.5/10 for character development).Art: This show is amazingly fluid in terms of animation, there are no glaring flaws that would become a highlight on Tumblr, and though one or two stand still frames are of poor quality ones, the action scenes are well done. In a show where T/A are swirling, vibrating, glowing, charging in super speed, and even shapeshifting, the animators really went all out to complete this show to the extent that although the T/A are already really attractive eye-candy by themselves, I can’t help but be in awe of the many flashy movements and flashy effects that were put together, and, for a moment or two, take my attention from the T/A, and instead focus on the effects of them. A notable highlight to show how the artists really put effort into the show is that during its action scenes when the girls pull out their T/A moves, the outlines of the characters are noticeably thickened which actually shares a similar drawing style to AOT. Not only that, when there is a notable move that makes a huge impact, the drawing style changes to one in which there are multiple drawn lines to show displacement, speed, or even power, as if the panels of the original manga were coming to life and colour. In terms of how the characters are drawn, as previously mentioned, they come in all shape and sizes, A to F cups, red heads to blonds to white hair to the usual black. The pony tail, the twin tail, the short cut, the ribbon, there’s no lacking of options, and most of them are attractive. This show isn’t one to have any noticeable backgrounds whatsoever, they aren’t ugly, but they are not really eye-catching unless you make it a point to notice them. But its fine, the show doesn’t need them, (the bodies of the characters cover half the screen half the time anyway). With T/A being main stars of the show, some might ask: are the ‘physics’ done well? Absolutely, as farfetched as this show is, things move the way that they are supposed to, unless of course, their special power permits them to defy it. (8/10)Story: The flow of the show is of the typical sports-shounen genre. The MC meets friends to partner up with, meet with overpowered mentors, work hard on training, finds new enemies, defeats them, become friends with said enemies, rinse and repeat. It is so generic that you could already tell the outcome of battles, thus rendering all cliffhangers and nervous moments irrelevant. For example: In a Keijo match, one could already predict that the side characters will lose no matter how powerful/strong they are all for the sake of making the MC crash in at the last moment to look good. Vice versa, one could also expect how the most powerful characters in the shows to do a 1v3 to make the whole development of certain characters unneeded since they would win without that development anyway. And lo and behold, the glorious MC making a huge comeback against presumably superior Keijoo players, leaving the characters who witnessed the match astonished, while leaving us stifling a yawn. It’s like the ‘power-levels’ of the characters are always altered to the liking of the writers, lacking a consistency. Comebacks are nice to see, but with ‘plot armour’ ever-present, the natural outcome, if following power levels, would be far more refreshing.So, the blueprint of the story sucks, but what about the details, that is, the world building of the show? They are magnificent! Never have I seen a fanservice show leave my jaw drop so hard, the nitbits of what makes the whole world of Keijo are absolutely insane, farfetched, that one could think that a prepubescent 12-year-old came up with it. From exercise /training regimes that include using your T/A to pull heavy objects to lectures regarding the anatomy of butts and boobs are all brushed upon. Almost every simple aspect of life from Ice cream, warm ups, ball sports are twisted into a wild Keijoo fashion, and my favourite: the special techniques of the T/A: (I would only name a few to avoid spoiling too much), but here are the cream of the crop, their names are pretty much self-explanatory to what they do.) :Vacuum Butt CanonButt GatlingTitty HypnosisWedgie AccelerationAnal Probe MissleDrill NipplesOther techniques involve having butts that can singe clothing, butts enchanted by fairy magic, boobs acting as a samurai sword, etc. Some technique names are even parodies of famous animes, and when you hear them shout out their techniques, all the more laughter ensues.(Plot: 3/10, World Building : 9/10).The genius mind of the anime creators thought that by combining two trendy genres of the anime medium into one, the show could become a huge cash-cow to be milked for years to come. However, this hugely backfired in more ways than one. The beauty of sports anime is that it is so shounen-esque that it could pump people up, and sometimes even building desire to actually try-out said sport, that happened in Haikyuu, and KnB, could one even dare to imagine whether Keijoo could replicate such an effect? No way in Hell. (If Keijoo becomes a sport in real life I would be moving to Japan immediately though) Besides that, the intense/ drama moments from the shounen anime are not just mundane and predictable, but they could never be taken seriously, EVER. Combining ecchi with sports-shounen negates the appeal of the genres, and thus the show became a jack-of-all trades, a mediocrity. A slight positive to note is that though this is ecchi, the girls hit HARD, it ain’t about the T/A bouncing in slow motion, once they come in contact with a person, they are definitely sent flying, each swing of the butt is like a strong sucker punch, and boy do you see them writhe in pain when they get hit.This show , in spite of all its mediocrity, is one of the most enjoyable shows that I have ever watched.Imagine this: ‘A Keijoo player is at the brink of being knocked out, but at the final moment, is protected by a partner, the partner then reveals that she enjoys playing with her friends and thus would always protect them’. One problem about this dialogue: As the character emotionally reveals her passion for her friends, we are given a shot where her ass and the ass of the enemies are pounding against each other at rapid rates, not to mention the sound of their springing/bouncing ass dwelling in the background. Sounds like a horrible attempt at trying to be serious doesn’t it? Don’t worry, it is exactly that, its the type of comedy that can be imagined as how one could depict  Martin Luther King giving his epic speech ‘I dreamed a dream’ in nothing but his underwear, it is THAT kind of funny. It reminds me of the times I laughed with my school friends over sex jokes when we just started  learning the reproduction system  in science class.This show never fails to deliver what it wants to. So even though it disappoints to be a serious sports-shounen due to poor execution and its never-to-be-taken-seriously concept, it shows the very limits of what anime can do in terms of imagination and creativity, never to be replicated in any other medium. (Enjoyment :10/10).You’re probably thinking, ‘what the fuck is this’, and that is exactly the appeal of this show, it doesn’t just escape the confinements of the box that is labelled in, it crushes it through its sheer capacity for craziness. Just as you think that this show couldn’t get any crazier, up comes another aspect of the show to blow your brains once again. I went in thinking that it’s just another To Love Ru/High School DXD that I can just stare at with lust, but out comes the laughter and table pounding that makes my parents think I’m insane. It’s not well thought out, and that is totally okay, the fact that it goes beyond the expectations of many, bringing up things that one could never consider putting onto a storyboard. The phrase ‘It’s so bad it’s good’ summarizes it perfectly.Therefore my dear readers who have made it this far, even if you zealously hate fanservice, or perhaps you’re the one that faps to hentai every day of the week, try this show out. It’s a polarizing one indeed, where one could either give it a 1/10 at a drop of the hat, or a 10/10 comparable to the second coming of Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, it is indeed one which will be brought up when you want to think of how crazy anime can be. ‘assets’ that could win them a huge tonne of money.Since this show has a plot regarding ‘plots’, it naturally divides fans into two camps: The former who think that this show is just a generic borderline hentai that shoves T/A every 5 seconds and thus having a non-existent storyline and cardboard characters, and the latter who are unafraid to claim that they love the T/A so much that this show is a Godsend. Though I share the sentiments of both camps, as the show goes on I came to realize that I am surprisingly, sitting on the fence here. Without a doubt, the show’s concept of using T/A as a sport already springs up the many red flags resembling a money grabbing hentai show, but the way they execute the series is something that I would not dare label as ‘half hearted’ or ‘purely for the sake of money’. As each episode went by, I began to feel intrigued and look forward to each airing episode, not PURELY for the T/A (I can’t deny that I am not a pervert here), but for the likeable characters and acceptable story, and most importantly, the ‘WTF did I just watch’ expression and the laughter that comes along with it.Note: Surprise surprise, though this show has a shit tonne of fanservice, there is no nudity. In short : no explicit tits or butts, they are always conveniently covered) That is of course, the upcoming Blu-Ray comes and prove me otherwise.Without further ado, let us try to analyse this beast.Sound: Nothing much to be commented on here. It does not grind your ears like fingers against a blackboard nor is it something that you would call a masterpiece, Openings and Endings generic pop designed for the modern teen, and since I am a modern teen, I liked it. Music taste is pretty much subjective, so all I can say is that it’s not anything unique and could be easily forgotten once you stopped watching the show, but do give it a listen. Soundtracks are up to standards of a modern anime series, doing its job to create mood and nothing more, with cheerful music for comedic scenes, upbeat soundtracks for the action scenes etc. I could be nit-picky here and say that the variety of the soundtracks is a bit lacking, but hey, a show with T/A as the main highlight, even if Beethoven was playing the Moonlight Sonata in all its glory, I would still be absorbed by the flashy ‘action scenes’. Voice of the characters are adequate, with the clumsy girls having the annoying high pitched voices (as usual) and the Shounen-Powerup-MC having a loud and confident tone, they just get the job done. (If you are wondering about yelps and the ‘oohs’ and ‘ahhs’ whenever one’s T/A is getting smacked, yes, they are there for you as well). (6/10).Character: In this type of show which shows the almost bare figure of many females which the male populace would like to claim as waifu, the creators made a good move to make characters of different looks, personalities and T/A techniques (more on to this later). I could draw a simile to how this diverse pool of girls can ‘almost’ satisfy each and every fetish of the anime community to how customers of a buffet would always find that one dish to fulfil their stomach. You have the big boobed one that always falls down and shows her undergarments, the never give up MC who always fight till the death and wins, the Tsundere friend who always manages to embarrass herself when no one’s looking, the flat chest who is envy of other people’s chest size, the one with the cat ears, the senpai who loves to fondles the boobs of others, the quiet but smart one…. I could go on forever.Because of this variety, one could play the game ‘find the anime trope’ and could potentially be able to fill a whole Wikipedia page with them. This is not necessarily a thing needed to be criticised though, this show KNOWS that they are doing this trashy stuff, it is AWARE that it is predictable, and they are not shy to admit that, because this show doesn’t require complicated characters to run, it’s all about who uses their T/As the most effectively to achieve victory. You don’t need a brain for this, just your eyes. You wanna talk about character development? HA—HA—HA, that hardly exists here, many of them remain the same at episode 1 until episode 12. However, if one insists that there needs to be at least some, the anime creators comply by giving one or two flash backs here and there that lasts for 2 minutes at most for the sake of explaining why X character behaved differently from its cardboard personality and that’s about it. Aside from the MC, only 2-3 can be claimed to have their characters marginally fleshed out, in more ways than one. **coughs at bad pun**. (7/10 for character variety, 3.5/10 for character development).Art: This show is amazingly fluid in terms of animation, there are no glaring flaws that would become a highlight on Tumblr, and though one or two stand still frames are of poor quality ones, the action scenes are well done. In a show where T/A are swirling, vibrating, glowing, charging in super speed, and even shapeshifting, the animators really went all out to complete this show to the extent that although the T/A are already really attractive eye-candy by themselves, I can’t help but be in awe of the many flashy movements and flashy effects that were put together, and, for a moment or two, take my attention from the T/A, and instead focus on the effects of them. A notable highlight to show how the artists really put effort into the show is that during its action scenes when the girls pull out their T/A moves, the outlines of the characters are noticeably thickened which actually shares a similar drawing style to AOT. Not only that, when there is a notable move that makes a huge impact, the drawing style changes to one in which there are multiple drawn lines to show displacement, speed, or even power, as if the panels of the original manga were coming to life and colour. In terms of how the characters are drawn, as previously mentioned, they come in all shape and sizes, A to F cups, red heads to blonds to white hair to the usual black. The pony tail, the twin tail, the short cut, the ribbon, there’s no lacking of options, and most of them are attractive. This show isn’t one to have any noticeable backgrounds whatsoever, they aren’t ugly, but they are not really eye-catching unless you make it a point to notice them. But its fine, the show doesn’t need them, (the bodies of the characters cover half the screen half the time anyway). With T/A being main stars of the show, some might ask: are the ‘physics’ done well? Absolutely, as farfetched as this show is, things move the way that they are supposed to, unless of course, their special power permits them to defy it. (8/10)Story: The flow of the show is of the typical sports-shounen genre. The MC meets friends to partner up with, meet with overpowered mentors, work hard on training, finds new enemies, defeats them, become friends with said enemies, rinse and repeat. It is so generic that you could already tell the outcome of battles, thus rendering all cliffhangers and nervous moments irrelevant. For example: In a Keijo match, one could already predict that the side characters will lose no matter how powerful/strong they are all for the sake of making the MC crash in at the last moment to look good. Vice versa, one could also expect how the most powerful characters in the shows to do a 1v3 to make the whole development of certain characters unneeded since they would win without that development anyway. And lo and behold, the glorious MC making a huge comeback against presumably superior Keijoo players, leaving the characters who witnessed the match astonished, while leaving us stifling a yawn. It’s like the ‘power-levels’ of the characters are always altered to the liking of the writers, lacking a consistency. Comebacks are nice to see, but with ‘plot armour’ ever-present, the natural outcome, if following power levels, would be far more refreshing.So, the blueprint of the story sucks, but what about the details, that is, the world building of the show? They are magnificent!

The physics were very realistic, and it really helped build the world and make me feel invested in the characters. The show features some of the greatest character designs, even giving birth to original architypes and creative moves like ""Titty Hypnosis"" and ""Buttack on Titan."" We got to see all the characters grow throughout the show and develop stronger butt muscles and thicker butts.

I\'m still a virgin, but even I know that this show is better than sex!Peace out,Ya boi, Skinny Penis', ""Keijo!!!!!!!!, with all 8 exclamation marks being absolutely necessary, is an outrageous show about swimsuit-clad women fighting each other with their butts and boobs in a kind of sumo-wrestling parody. Sounds outrageous, right?The most outrageous thing about Keijo!!!!!!!! is how touching it can be.Make no mistake, Keijo is bonkers. But instead of simply filling the screen with butts doing battle, a lot of work has been put into the little things. We follow Nozomi, a somewhat typical protagonist, that is, a ridiculously arrogant yet free-spirited soul, as she attends Setouji Keijo Training School, an academy specifically for Keijo. However, what I was not expecting at...all was how dedicated she is to improving - almost an entire episode was used to let her explore her weakness in the ring; pulling turnips with her hips to improve her speed.This aspiration is not unique to her character alone, however. Put into Room 309 with the other expected-drop-outs, the four girls of the room, Sayaka, Non and Kazane, come together to beat the low expectations of them. The group use Kazane’s smartness but must overcome her shyness first, and it’s surprisingly human how they become friends and allow her to come out of her shell. But, unlike some shows where character development is for nought, Kazane continues to use what she’s learned throughout the rest of the show, most notably when she teams up with and leads a couple of Keijoers she doesn’t know to attempt to beat the school’s number 1 Keijo player.The underlying use of subplots in this show is superb. Sayaka, who is undoubtedly the 2nd most important character of this show, is an ex-Judo champion, even having represented Japan. Quitting Judo to pursue Keijo, she has a lot of expectations to live up to, both internally and externally. Watching her overcome these was inspirational. Watching her father finally coming to understand her dreams conflict with his own and accepting that, was touching. Need I remind you this is a show about clashing butts?The battles themselves are exceptionally creative. In fact, the reason I started watching this show was seeing a picture of Kazane’s “GATE OF BOOTYLON” power and giggling so much I simply had to get some context. Power moves are crazy fun, such as Kotone’s Cerberus-butt and “Titty Hypnosis”, and allow for constant surprises in the the tense fights. The use of crazy sounds such as machine guns, explosions, rubber-bands and high-pitched cringing slaps makes you feel the prominence of every attack - and it hurts.Of the most impressive aspects of this show is the friendship. As each character of Setouji is pitted against each other, every time the will show veer you to root for a certain character, either through prior character development, underdog stories… you name it. But later, you will be rooting for the character you once wanted to see booted off the platform - simply because we’ve seen them change for the better. It’s inspiring, and a little awkward to have my heart tugged from side-to-side by the show’s strong writing, when it draws from women fighting with butts.The most surprising thing about Keijo!!!!!!!? The fanservice isn’t even that prominent. The character designs are varied - such as their overweight former-champion for a teacher, the body-builder shapes, the overly-defined-hourglass curves and the more regular straight bodies with varying sizes of prominent features. Though, I must say, if you don't like muscley girls, you won't like the girls of Keijo. Perhaps the show lingers for too long looking at a certain angle, but it never feels particularly like camera-angles are decided by a pervert. They feel more like a sports show.Because that's what it is. A ridiculously good sport show, with a crazy concept, a unique sense of friendship and a hilarious script that you're doing yourself a disservice not to watch.

Keijo is not simply fanservice. No. It is more than that. Keijo is about life itself. To understand this statement you must first understand the correct answer to the question “tits or ass”. While there does seem to be some debate that in itself is appalling. The answer, without a fucking doubt, should be ass. Why? A baby can live without sucking its mothers teat but can it exist without an ass? No. Of course it couldn’t....The ass is important to humanity because it is humanity. Without ass there is no you, no me, no anyone. And thus we arrive a the importance of ass. While ass represents life, tits represent nurture. Both are essential to successfully raise a child. So you are asking me if a show that features the power and beauty of the ass and tits is worth watching? I think you know the answer. The ass is important to humanity because it is humanity.

Just know that the VA is neat, the usual art and sound effect standards are also here for a 2016 anime. I'll give a plus for the butt fights which actually are understandable as the action is clearly depicted without imprecisions.Entering Keijo you might expect butts and tits and nothing else, and you'd be rather surprised at two things:Firstly, I think the anime is very coherent in its own world. The main character has this quality that most...anime MCs lack: she's not in for a noble cause or some great adventure, she's in it for the money. She's greedy and wants to get filthy rich and that's it. This simple and relatable position for most characters makes Keijo quite a lot of fun as nobody in it seems anything else than human. It is rather amazing how entertaining it gets just from that.Secondly, the makers are definitely self-aware and know that this cannot be taken fully seriously, but unlike some rather poor parody shows, they've managed to make a solid balance between what needs to be pictured as serious and what doesn't.The fights will be depicted seriously, as will character decisions and reactions, but at the same time they will invent all sorts of goofy butt techniques and extend the goofyness to the point Fate Stay Night's Unlimited Blade Works becomes Unlimited Butt Workings and Attack on Titan gets a rather interesting butt-oriented remix.The mix of relatable characters, understandable fights taken seriously, and very silly butt stuff, makes the entire show really fun.Lots of fanservice shows cater to the viewer's fantasies and ego. It's always about showing him what he wishes could exist. Keijo dodges that low-brow bullet gracefully and instead sits comfortably on the idea that you can make an anime about butts and still make it logical, entertaining and relatable. It's not here to praise your ego or celebrate your private parts, it's just a fun little fight anime with butts in it. Even the visual part of the fanservice is rather sheltered.On a small complaint note, as a tits man, I wish there'd be less butt techniques and more chest ones.But overall, I recommend Keijo as a simple, well-done action/humor anime with lots of asses in it. It's been far more entertaining than I'd have expected and everyone around me also seems to have been enjoying it just as greatly. anime MCs lack: she's not in for a noble cause or some great adventure, she's in it for the money.

Keijo dodges that low-brow bullet gracefully and instead sits comfortably on the idea that you can make an anime about butts and still make it logical, entertaining and relatable. It's not here to praise your ego or celebrate your private parts, it's just a fun little fight anime with butts in it. Even the visual part of the fanservice is rather sheltered.On a small complaint note, as a tits man, I wish there'd be less butt techniques and more chest ones.But overall, I recommend Keijo as a simple, well-done action/humor anime with lots of asses in it. It's been far more entertaining than I'd have expected and everyone around me also seems to have been enjoying it just as greatly."", 'This review may contain some spoilers.Story (1/10):The story tells of the journey of 4 girls in the world of Keijo, a sport that uses breasts and butts to fight, the objective is to throw their opponet out of the base, which is a platform that is like a giant float that floats in the water, there are two ways to win: when the opponent is thrown from the base and falls into the water, or when she loses by knockout.The story of keijo besides being ridiculous does not make any sense.Well, why does not that make any sense? Because who really are strong in...keijo are THE MAIN CHARACTERS, a sport anime is based on overcoming right? The main characters start at the lowest level and try to improve over time, right? Not with keijo. What is the point of having a certain potential, if this one is already overcome in the first challenge? The west school lost to the east school 10 times, but when the protagonists who were beginners arrived all of that changed, it does not make any sense, the east school was supposed to be one of the greatest challenges, something difficult to overcome by the size of the invincibility and talent that the competitors had, but the protagonists breaks this invincibility in the first attempt to overcome it, really the school east is invincible... Keijo demonstrates that it is not a sport anime, so what is left? The ecchi, that\'s what Keijo is, an anime totally focused on ecchi with an illusory premise of a sports anime, I do not even want to comment on the scenes of ""drama"" that Keijo has, trying to be serious with a premise of a fight using breasts And asses, are you kidding me? It was better to have done an anime totally focused on comedy, it would make more sense with a premise as stupid as that.Art/Animation (3/10):The design of the characters is poor, you notice heavy clothes, hair, face, badly pixelated, looks like it was 144p, horrible and strange, I do not know if it was due to lack of time, but it\'s no excuse to leave the finished art wrong , The animation of the ""fights"" is simple and sometimes strange, it focuses on the faces of the characters, you only hears the sound of ""blows"", The breasts of the characters get bigger than they really are, just like the ass, I found the color of the ""powers"" extraordinarily colorful, What saves is the ""fights"" that are at least decent to see, but nothing very impressive.Soundtrack (2/10):The OP is decent, at least it gives a little hype to the anime. ED is horrible, annoying and boring. The sound effects are horrible, it seems that popping sounds that sizzle, too annoying, is something that makes ""fight"" scenes worse than they already are.Characters (2/10):Kaminashi Nozomi: She loves Keijo, likes to face strong opponents (not that strong), has a very strong relationship with Miyata Sayaka and just that... This is the development of the main character of Keijo, exactly ZERO, backstory? Who cares? She\'s cute, has big boobs and a great ass, does not need a backstory or a decent reason to want to be professional in the sport, she wants money and strong people to face, this is the protagonist of Keijo.She cuts the wind with her ass...Miyata Sayaka: She loves Keijo, likes to face strong opponents (not that strong), wait? You already read this, right? She is basically the same thing, apart from having a backstory, she changed judo by Keijo, because she loves keijo. End of her´s backstory, that\'s all.She is fast and agile, when she puts her may glued to the butt gets more agile, that\'s her ability...Aoba Kazane: Has nothing to talk about her, apart from being smart and very strategic in ""fights"", and having a Gate of Babylon of butts, she is the shy of the 4 main characters and maybe the only one that I really found decent.Toyoguchi Non: She\'s stupid, boring, annoying, has no reason to exist. Her ability is to have a butt and soft breasts that recaptures the ""attacks"" of the opponents, she does absolutely nothing useful besides serving for fanservice and ecchi scenes.Enjoyment (2/10):Stupid comedy, drama that makes me laugh more than the anime comedy, fights up interesting to see, ecchis idiot scenes, well, already gave to realize that I did not have any enjoyment while watching.Overall (2/10):Keijo is just an anime made for ecchi and fanservice, an original but stupid plot, idiot characters that seem more sex dolls than at least decent, since it has no focus for me to be interested in them, horrible soundtrack, animation at least Descente in the ""fights"" and an stupid comedy.

Woman grew larger breasts to take the place of the buttocks. The original source of life is the buttocks! Boobs are just a substitute! Boobs are nothing more than a pale imitation of the buttocks!. If asked what you\'d rather have, a copy or an original, naturally, I would choose the original!"" - Kiyoshi from...Prison SchoolLA: Well if you say it like that Kiyoshi, Keijo!!!!!!!! must be like Citizen Kane to you.It is one of those animes where they have a crazy and all out weird premise (that being Keijo...think boob and butt wrestling) but take it to serious extremes with the characters taking it utterly seriously like an extreme sport atmosphere and that, LA just fell in love with it\'s seriousness to the insanely intentionally ridiculous premise, because seriously....ASSology and Booblogy lectures, Butt themed attacks like Butt Gatling and Vacuum Butt Cannon and a hierarchy class within the sport of Keijo itself, yes it\'s quite obvious this is blatantly LA\'s guiltiest pleasure of Fall 2016 and LA doesn\'t care what anybody says about it.Compounding how batshit crazy serious (and as the side effect ridiculous) Keijo takes itself, it\'s also because of how it takes this crazy fanservicey sport with how it takes the sport terminology to how the ""fighting types"" do, such as the main cast group of Nozomi Kaminashi, Sayaka Miyata, Kazane Aoba and Non Toyoguchi. Sayaka Miyata is the speedster type and has a pretty good rivalry towards Rin Rokudou voiced by Rie Takanashi, Kazane Aoba is the tactical group type and can easily tell their opponents fighting style by touching their butts (seriously) to Non Toyoguchi who is the literal softy...she-she-she she has a soft butt that\'s it but can reflect the more steel butt variants, finally we have the main protagonist Nozomi who uses a One-Hit Kill attacks, to evolving to balancing out to be both an agile tanker. As much as Keijo is just a crazy premise and ""might"" be fanservice overload, but with how they use this sport and actually talk about how the sport functions in a VERY serious yet ridiculously funny way and the fanservice isn\'t ""overload"" per say and sure fanservice is ABOUND in this anime, but the ""fanservice"" is ""integrated"" properly into Keijo to the point LA can see that Keijo just doesn\'t ""put"" fanservice there ""just because"", instead integrates the fanservice into the sport a la tactical butt attacks and fanservice isn\'t the SOLE focus of the series, it\'s the sport itself and it\'s variety of butt fighters and LA just LOVES how they prides itself in execution of the utter ridiculousness atmosphere and how serious it takes Keijo as a serious sport (to the point of having many of the major to minor characters to have differing and varying body types in which it affects their fighting style) and that meshes so well that brings out it\'s appeal, not just dollar store fanservice from typical fanservice anime. If anything it reminds LA of Prison School, but not under the extreme vers. of a highschool romance plot, but in a serious sport setting instead.Ok, taking all this in (if ya want to), let\'s change our focus to the characters themselves.Let\'s start with Kazane Aoba and Non Toyoguchi, they are both shy in some form, but with their Keijo powers, they more or less develop themselves as great players with their powers, Non with her soft butt, Kazane with her Gilgamesh ripoff mimicry attacks (no seriously) and even better as a duo (Kazane as the strategist and offensive player, Non as the defensive player tanking to protect Kazane), Kazane if anything gains her character development to both evolve her powers and open herself up to everyone, LA felt that Non was more or less having the same development plotline but as a support to Kazane. The more majorly defined main cast would go to both Sayaka Miyata and Nozomi Kaminashi. Sayaka Miyata has GREAT character investment, something LA NEARLY missed out on, nonetheless, Sayaka has parental issues with her leaving judo for Keijo and compounding this, she too is shy with her new friends (besides Nozomi). Her investment is well worth it considering what a way she goes out on a la Keijo battle bringing this issue into the forefront. Finally we\'ll go to Nozomi, who just wants to be the a Keijo Queen for the prize money. At first she\'s a hot-blooded, head first main protagonist and an underdog even on her own school, however like most shounen sports anime, she quickly becomes the ace, but not with some form of obstacles which comes from her own limited butt powers and her along with Sayaka (and by extension Kazane) quickly brings up her own character development in the form of trying to her improve herself by covering all grounds (too powerful in strength, then work on speed vice versa). LA\'s favoruite character would go to Nozomi and fine she\'s slightly bland in some respects but LA found her genkiness and seriousness endearing, second place would easily go to Sayaka. Come the East-West War arc, the opponents Nozomi\'s gang fought against to be in the Elite class, she and the gang and heck the entire Elite class gains a bit of camaraderie into being the best Keijo school in Japan and sure it\'s quite obvious that the opposing Keijo school has a slight bit of ""rivalry for rivalry sake"", nonetheless, the entire ""team battles"" the East-West War definitely gave the sense of camaraderie which gave not only the characters development as a group (and powers), but individually as well.Even outside the main characters and even their school, the opposing school does gets some bit of development if you count ""their powers are their personality"", though the only one that properly got ""what their powers is"", and ""their reasoning to win"" goes to Maya Sakashiro due to her essentially being the ""final boss"" in a ways and really her ""character development"" made her both a formidable opponent and an interesting character as to WHY she wants to win. But to backtrack a bit, during Nozomi\'s gang period of trying to become Elite class, their opponents get the same ""powers = personality"", though they get slightly more in-depth as to why they want to win or want to Keijo in the first place (it makes sense due to the East-West War later on, trying to develop them further), it\'s nice character development placement and helped characters who were once opponents to strong-willed allies to Nozomi and the gang.In terms of animation by Xebec, well from the batshit sensebility of the anime, LA will easily say during the ""races"" nearly EVERY SINGLE race were brilliantly animated and quite detailed like a shounen anime and because of that, it quite easily pumps adrenaline to the majority of the Keijo Races. Character designs are quite diverse as LA said at the beginning of the anime review, all with many body sizes, even to the over-exaggerated character ""accessories"" to the more obvious differing boobs and butts which makes the cast really lively. However where the greater detail goes to Keijo races, there were some instances quite rare ones where the facial animation to some of the ""butt animation"" felt like slightly off-model in some cases, but not to the point of being blatant about it, but it\'s a compromise for the greater detailed Keijo races for the most part so it can get an easy saving grace for LA. Xebec going full-shounen in a fanservicey anime is quite frankly a dream come true for fanservice fans and it quite frankly delivered in an animation standpoint even with it\'s discrepancies. Mind you as much as the fanservice is used in proper execution and there are some ass and boobs shots, the anime actually never shows the full breast or full ass and does some good improvisation on censorship when the attacks goes full crazy working to it\'s advantage for it\'s fanservice even further. Again, a focus on it\'s actionized-plot and it\'s characters than it\'s fanservice.LA really doesn\'t talk much about the ""sound"" in most reviews, but LA has to say when boobs clashes with butts or boobs, LA just loves how the impact is sooo ""satisying"" itself to even the static sonic boom sound effects, it really makes the sound department really going all out, just like the crazy and ridiculous Keijo battles themselves, but that in itself allows the battles to be amazingly done and just feels like a bomb just got released after ever battle. The sound effects in Keijo was just GREAT.In terms of voice acting, the voice cast was amazing in this anime, with Lynn who voiced Nozomi being LA\'s favourite voice actor just for her sheer genkiness and high-toned ""shouting"" vocals overall. Really the vocal cast for Keijo went their all with this one with everyone having a chance to shout at the top of thier lungs for the most part, but if there were any distinctions LA would point out, it would be M.A.O and Kaede Hondo as Sayaka and Kazane respectively along with Saori Oonishi as Non obviously due to them having main character statuses towards them, but nonetheless they have the same strengths that Lynn underwent, though under their archetypes like deadpan snarker and ""only normal one here"" Sayaka to the actual deadpan shy one Kazane to the Kansai shy vocals from Non. The Keijo opponents also gets needs to be taken into note for LA, from Shizuka Ishigami as Kotone Fujisaki due to her ""don\'t care"" to yaoi fangirling vocals, Rena Maeda as Hanabi Kawai due to her genki moe vocals turn full ax crazy vocals when on the land and finally Maya Sakashiro voiced by Ayako Kawasumi from her really shy vocals to her again more ax crazy vocals. Overall what can LA say but the vocal cast is AMAZING with no one seiyuu doing a dull performance.Having seen the English dub by Funimation and to be honest it was very well cast, with Amber Lee Connors as the every genki Nozomi Kaminashi and her having the ""Kansai accenting"" similar to Lynn had fit Amber\'s vocals quite well and to be frank, Amber Lee Connors was LA\'s favourite dub actor because of it. Felecia Angelle and Alexis Tipton as Sayaka and Kazane respectively did well with their wispy and ""pseudo-deadpan"" vocals but like Amber Lee Connors, they fit into their roles quite well, if Amber Lee Connors wasn\'t LA\'s favourite, Felecia Angelle would have easily taken it. Sarah Wiedenheft as Non along with Alex Moore as Rin Rokudou has a bit of the accenting that is somewhat there and a little bit distracting at times and LA knows in the Japanese that they got it too, but Non it was for comedic purposes although Sarah\'s Texan accenting was showing but that was the point, LA really didn\'t know what to think about Alex Moore\'s accenting, but it soon was ignorable and LA nitpicking to the point LA quite enjoyed Alex Moore as Rin even with her accenting. If anything LA could go through all the Funimation dub cast to this but even with all the nitpicks LA might take towards this dub, the dub cast is GREAT with the same extremities that the Japanese took considering the nature of this anime.LA gets it as much as this is LA\'s unabashed guiltiest anime for Fall 2016 heck 2016 in general, but LA gets it, this anime just might not be for everyone, from how batshit ""stupid"" this anime is and you could easily say this is exploiting fanservice. Nonetheless, for LA...LA just did not care, the batshit ""stupid"", rather for LA made the tone and atmosphere of the anime all the more focused, it\'s an anime where girls uses their boobs and butts...like another words, you ""DON\'T"" need to take it soooooo seriously and WOULD you take it sooo seriously if LA even said this statement?..you wouldn\'t, as for fanservice, well again for LA, it didn\'t feel exploited as it\'s intentionally and oddly enough the boob and ass shots didn\'t feel intentional, unless it was used for comedic moments. Agree or not, since this is LA\'s review, well these elements improved the anime instead of being a detriment.The ending or more or less the final race was just AMAZING, from the shounen-esque animation and great impactful sound effects, the final episode did kinda go into the uncanny valley slightly but still, making a final clash between Maya Sakashiro and Nozomi Kaminashi was an amazing way to go out on.Keijo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! is LA\'s most guiltiest anime for 2016 and was LA\'s second favourite anime for Fall 2016, but nonetheless, from the great animation in the Keijo races and colorful character designs and ""powers"" to the somewhat ok ""underdog main protagonist sports anime"" and using the fanservice in proper execution and not in your face and embraces it instead. LA wants a second season, no joke and considering what possibilities the ending gave us it could. LA haven\'t seen something this refreshing under the fanservice banner in quite some time and Keijo quite honestly delivered it and with LA honestly saying it\'s LA\'s guiltiest anime for 2016 AND LA\'s second favourite anime for Fall 2016 that\'s saying something. Prison SchoolLA: Well if you say it like that Kiyoshi, Keijo!!!!!!!! must be like Citizen Kane to you.It is one of those animes where they have a crazy and all out weird premise (that being Keijo...think boob and butt wrestling) but take it to serious extremes with the characters taking it utterly seriously like an extreme sport atmosphere and that, LA just fell in love with it\'s seriousness to the insanely intentionally ridiculous premise, because seriously....ASSology and Booblogy lectures, Butt themed attacks like Butt Gatling and Vacuum Butt Cannon and a hierarchy class within the sport of Keijo itself, yes it\'s quite obvious this is blatantly LA\'s guiltiest pleasure of Fall 2016 and LA doesn\'t care what anybody says about it.Compounding how batshit crazy serious (and as the side effect ridiculous) Keijo takes itself, it\'s also because of how it takes this crazy fanservicey sport with how it takes the sport terminology to how the ""fighting types"" do, such as the main cast group of Nozomi Kaminashi, Sayaka Miyata, Kazane Aoba and Non Toyoguchi.

The Keijo opponents also gets needs to be taken into note for LA, from Shizuka Ishigami as Kotone Fujisaki due to her ""don\'t care"" to yaoi fangirling vocals, Rena Maeda as Hanabi Kawai due to her genki moe vocals turn full ax crazy vocals when on the land and finally Maya Sakashiro voiced by Ayako Kawasumi from her really shy vocals to her again more ax crazy vocals. Overall what can LA say but the vocal cast is AMAZING with no one seiyuu doing a dull performance.Having seen the English dub by Funimation and to be honest it was very well cast, with Amber Lee Connors as the every genki Nozomi Kaminashi and her having the ""Kansai accenting"" similar to Lynn had fit Amber\'s vocals quite well and to be frank, Amber Lee Connors was LA\'s favourite dub actor because of it. Felecia Angelle and Alexis Tipton as Sayaka and Kazane respectively did well with their wispy and ""pseudo-deadpan"" vocals but like Amber Lee Connors, they fit into their roles quite well, if Amber Lee Connors wasn\'t LA\'s favourite, Felecia Angelle would have easily taken it. Sarah Wiedenheft as Non along with Alex Moore as Rin Rokudou has a bit of the accenting that is somewhat there and a little bit distracting at times and LA knows in the Japanese that they got it too, but Non it was for comedic purposes although Sarah\'s Texan accenting was showing but that was the point, LA really didn\'t know what to think about Alex Moore\'s accenting, but it soon was ignorable and LA nitpicking to the point LA quite enjoyed Alex Moore as Rin even with her accenting. If anything LA could go through all the Funimation dub cast to this but even with all the nitpicks LA might take towards this dub, the dub cast is GREAT with the same extremities that the Japanese took considering the nature of this anime.LA gets it as much as this is LA\'s unabashed guiltiest anime for Fall 2016 heck 2016 in general, but LA gets it, this anime just might not be for everyone, from how batshit ""stupid"" this anime is and you could easily say this is exploiting fanservice. Nonetheless, for LA...LA just did not care, the batshit ""stupid"", rather for LA made the tone and atmosphere of the anime all the more focused, it\'s an anime where girls uses their boobs and butts...like another words, you ""DON\'T"" need to take it soooooo seriously and WOULD you take it sooo seriously if LA even said this statement?..you wouldn\'t, as for fanservice, well again for LA, it didn\'t feel exploited as it\'s intentionally and oddly enough the boob and ass shots didn\'t feel intentional, unless it was used for comedic moments. Agree or not, since this is LA\'s review, well these elements improved the anime instead of being a detriment.The ending or more or less the final race was just AMAZING, from the shounen-esque animation and great impactful sound effects, the final episode did kinda go into the uncanny valley slightly but still, making a final clash between Maya Sakashiro and Nozomi Kaminashi was an amazing way to go out on.Keijo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! is LA\'s most guiltiest anime for 2016 and was LA\'s second favourite anime for Fall 2016, but nonetheless, from the great animation in the Keijo races and colorful character designs and ""powers"" to the somewhat ok ""underdog main protagonist sports anime"" and using the fanservice in proper execution and not in your face and embraces it instead. LA wants a second season, no joke and considering what possibilities the ending gave us it could. LA haven\'t seen something this refreshing under the fanservice banner in quite some time and Keijo quite honestly delivered it and with LA honestly saying it\'s LA\'s guiltiest anime for 2016 AND LA\'s second favourite anime for Fall 2016 that\'s saying something.', 'I will start out this review by saying I\'m not a huge fan of the Ecchi/Harem/Fanservice genre in general. I prefer a romcom over an ecchi anime 90% of the time.That being said, when I get ""plot,"" I like my ""plot"" with lots of plot, so that it\'s not all about boobs and there\'s actually some story involved. This anime did an EXCELLENT job of creating characters with stories, stories that mattered and that I cared about, not just filler backstory.The shows concept was absurd, (I mean really, boob/butt wrestling?!), but very well executed. Instances where clothing came off were very well censored. It was...obvious that it was censoring, yet not out of place (like the convenient light rays that we\'re all so familiar with.) The standard types of censoring were plasma ray type effects, and hair.There was an excellent amount of comedy, yet it wasn\'t a full fledged comedy, nor was it full of corny or overused jokes.Story: 9/10The story revolves around 4 girls who are roommates in ""room 309,"" aka ""the empty room."" It follows them as they progress from relative keijo scrubs to being elites. Each character has a backstory that is not absurdly long, nor unnecessarily convenient, and is actually quite plausible. In the later half of the story, the show shifts from being primarily random slice-of-life type events (training, slacking off, random conversations, etc.) to being a little more serious about the story, which revolves around training for a major event. (Event name withheld due to possible spoiler.)One thing I will deduct points from this for is the fact that it does have semi-frequent cliffhangers in the middle of battles, important conversations, game changing training, etc.While this is not a flaw per se, I\'m not a fan of cliffhangers in the slightest (It results in me binge watching things for hours), thus the point deduction. If you enjoy cliffhangers, you can go ahead and make the score 8.5/10.Characters: 9/10While not the MOST interesting characters I\'ve ever seen, (that would have to go to Durarara, dang every character was so complex like wtf), they did have interesting but subtle backstories that made you care about them. They also all had very unique personalities, some of which were perfect fits, some of which were entirely incompatible, and most of them had to work on teamwork to work well together, but once they did so were extremely effective as a team. Nozomi is a very ambitious girl, yet somehow does not fall under any ""dere"" category that I can think of. She has a tremendous amount of drive to do what she want\'s, while still being realistic. She is willing to bend the rules and pull strings as necessary to do her very best. Aoba is a strategic type of keijo player, acting relatively weak and unintelligent, then ambushing opposing players right when they think she\'s down. Rather than going in guns blazing and bragging about her ability, she keeps a fairly low profile until the time is right. Maybe I just like her because I have the same mindset, I don\'t know? Miyata is not really a dandere per se, but she\'s the closest fit to any ""dere"" category of anyone in this show. Seriously, talk about breaking stereotypes, this show exceeds at it. Non is the clumsy, slightly ditzy girl on the team, but she can be very effective when needs be, although most of the time that effectiveness is entirely accidental.Art: 9/10This anime\'s trace lines are very noticeable. While most anime trace lines are a single, consistent thickness, these trace lines vary in thickness depending on the angle of the stroke, almost as if they were illustrated with a fountain pen. It looks very good. It is up there with No Game No Life and Durarara in terms of excellent trace lines and art in general. Another thing I would mention is that this anime has very high frames per second. While most anime appears to be animated in 30 or 48 fps, giving it a sort of choppy, jumpy, old look, this appears to be animated in 60 fps. It is excellent quality, to the point where if you download an HQ version and import it into Adobe Premiere with 60fps settings, there is a difference in every frame, unlike some anime which have the same image 2 or 3 frames in a row.Sound: 8/10This anime has excellent sound. Not only are the OP and outro good, the mic quality for the voice over in general is awesome. Please keep in mind that I was watching the Japanese dub English sub version, (so I can\'t comment on the quality of the dub.) But on the sub anyway the sound is excellent, from the songs, to the character\'s voices, to the effects of boobs smashing into butts. (Never thought I\'d be saying or typing that lol.)Enjoyment: 10/10As stated at the beginning, I\'m not a huge fan of ecchi. I don\'t hate it, it\'s just that I don\'t watch pure ecchi shows. But this did have a few good fanservice moments that even I can\'t ignore. That, combined with the awesome story, the way that such a comical and absurd concept is played off so well, and the fact that no sh!ts were given about physics makes this a 420 out of 69 for me. (No, but for real, 10/10 would watch again.)Overall: 10/10 [Overall Decimal 9.65/10]I loved this show. Binged the whole thing in about 6 hours, and dayum it was a 6 hours well spent. And anytime I google ""{series name} season 2"" before I even mark it as finished on MAL, I know it\'s a keeper.This was a thoroughly entertaining show, with comedy, ecchi, story, suspense and buildup. Can\'t wait for a second season, if and when there is one; and without a shadow of a doubt this was one of the top anime of the season! obvious that it was censoring, yet not out of place (like the convenient light rays that we\'re all so familiar with.)

Can\'t wait for a second season, if and when there is one; and without a shadow of a doubt this was one of the top anime of the season!', 'Ok, so ""Keijo"" literally means ""Competitive Girl"" which is also known as \'Hip Whip Girl. a Japanese sports manga series by Daichi Sorayomi. It has been serialized in Shogakukan\'s shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Sunday since July 2013 and has been collected in fourteen tankōbon volumes. An anime television series adaptation produced by Xebec premiered on October 6, 2016 and was concluded just this week. Frankly according to sources both the manga and this anime isn\'t selling well, geeez what an ass-wipe kind of story that the asshole Daichi  Sorayomi thinking when he came up with this manga? Ok so  it isn\'t uncommon...that all Japanese manga or anime has that exaggeration of what a character can do to the point that what they do defines the laws of Physics, anatomy and body kinetics.....and in this anime, yes it was all about the  the girl\'s ass where we can say that Daichi Sorayomi is an ass-man, and what studio have the knack for it\'s lewd and shameless animes, well, it\'s Xebec the creators of the ""To Love Ru"" franchise, though I\'m one of those who simply watch this anime for the booty and the swim suit fanservice, I don\'t have any love for this anime, soooooo:Storywise, ok since this is one of studio Xebec\'s ecchi based anime, we can forget everything, the plot and the climax....they don\'t make it here, in fact , one would be more focus on the what the characters can do with their booty that how the story develops, so it was a Pathetic 1.Art, well, the attire is right for the occasion, I give them that, but, the it fell short on the fanservce, since we don\'t see any uncensored nipple service and some panty shot, but then again the maillot and the bikini does make up.....a bit for us guys to enjoy them eye candies, and that\'s as good as it gets, so it\'s a good 7 for me.Sound, all that whoosh, boom, thud and all that effects clearly doesn\'t make anything , all it does was to get the guys\' lust into overdrive, so clearly very poor 3.Characters , ahhhhhhh who the fuck cares about Nozomi wanting to be the riches Keijo pro, and  Sayaka Miyata who was a Jodo Champ, Kazane Aoba who can tell an ass by just touching it and btw it kinda makes us guys jealous especially if one is still yet to get laid,  Non Toyoguchi whose butt is soft that makes the guys wanna bury their face in to it and  Mio Kusakai\'s boobies where every guy wishes he can fondle. Now I don\'t know about them other reviews, but let\'s face it, the real star of this series be it in manga or anime were, the swim suit, bikini, asses, boobs and camel toe, so for the reviews to even give details the characters doesn\'t have any merits. No offends, but to me, the characters here were just a bunch of bimbos that creator Daichi Sorayomi fantasizes about and there is no doubt in my mind that , those characters represent the cutest girls that he lust about and somehow , he can never have them in real life and can only drool at them, poor guy, I feel sorry for the guy for his Pathetic (1) ideas about them bimbos (Characters).Enjoyment, watch this doesn\'t make it a chore, rather it is something that you can skim or have the choice to watch it all or skip some episode, bottom line there isn\'t anything despite of the final battle between Nozomi and Maya, one would not give a damn whether who wins or looses either way, it\'s all about the BUTT. So I\'m giving it a fair 6.Overall, Pathetic, even though sex sells, creator Daichi Sorayomi should be better off making something like hentai than something like this, cu\'z it ain\'t selling well.  But hey, if you wanna watch it then watch at your own discretion,  cu\'z frankly this anime/manga is created for us guys to lust our sexual fantasy, wishing that them bimbos do those things to us,season 2?????don\'t even think about it. Fool.Shady, Aftermath(Look at them bitch! Ha, yeah!)There they go shaking their ass on the poolBumpin\' and grindin\' that buttThe way they grindin\' their rackI think they\'re losing controlThey get buzzed, they get bump, they get crunked, they get fuuuucked upHit the pool don\'t forget ones get they\'re body rubbedThey got fucked, they get sucked, they get drained, shit poopedPasted, blasted, racked up, showen some pussyHit the changning room, show your bodyGit in your bikiniiii, got a routineKnowing still got a few chunks on your shoestringShowing I was sooo ready till the beat vibratedthey got revibrated as soon as them Bitch gyratedAnd hips and licked them lips and that was itThey had to get their ass some training.Shake that ass for us, shake that ass for usCome on girls, shake that ass for us, shake that ass for usOh girls, shake that ass for us, shake that ass for usCome on girl, shake that ass for us, shake that ass for us that all Japanese manga or anime has that exaggeration of what a character can do to the point that what they do defines the laws of Physics, anatomy and body kinetics.....and in this anime, yes it was all about the  the girl\'s ass where we can say that Daichi Sorayomi is an ass-man, and what studio have the knack for it\'s lewd and shameless animes, well, it\'s Xebec the creators of the ""To Love Ru"" franchise, though I\'m one of those who simply watch this anime for the booty and the swim suit fanservice, I don\'t have any love for this anime, soooooo:Storywise, ok since this is one of studio Xebec\'s ecchi based anime, we can forget everything, the plot and the climax....they don\'t make it here, in fact , one would be more focus on the what the characters can do with their booty that how the story develops, so it was a Pathetic 1.Art, well, the attire is right for the occasion, I give them that, but, the it fell short on the fanservce, since we don\'t see any uncensored nipple service and some panty shot, but then again the maillot and the bikini does make up.....a bit for us guys to enjoy them eye candies, and that\'s as good as it gets, so it\'s a good 7 for me.Sound, all that whoosh, boom, thud and all that effects clearly doesn\'t make anything , all it does was to get the guys\' lust into overdrive, so clearly very poor 3.Characters , ahhhhhhh who the fuck cares about Nozomi wanting to be the riches Keijo pro, and  Sayaka Miyata who was a Jodo Champ, Kazane Aoba who can tell an ass by just touching it and btw it kinda makes us guys jealous especially if one is still yet to get laid,  Non Toyoguchi whose butt is soft that makes the guys wanna bury their face in to it and  Mio Kusakai\'s boobies where every guy wishes he can fondle.

(2016)Wow-what a show and a very good one indeed.The show sounds crude in the premise of what it is and that is absolutely correct but we have some amazing characters and references. For example Gate of Bootylon and Buttack on Titan absolutely killed me since that was hilarious. You can tell by that when it came out as to what is popular at the time of release.In terms of girls, we have basically every personality you could ask for with the exception of any genuine hardcore Yandere. We have girls who are super cute like Aoba that have an odd fetish all...the way to the cute girl whose hair turns into ears like Rin. Rin for the record is my best girl 100% and all the girls are legal too so even better.The story actually gives me very much an American Pie vibe without the alcohol in terms of the show being basically college/university with a start and finish that leads into careers. This is very unusual for something to end so nicely. That said the story although very much fleshed out correctly is still just somewhat above average since it is simple.The art is amazing when it is amazing and awful when it is awful. The side view of characters out of combat as such is pretty downgraded at times. Also, unless they are fighting the girls tend to have very comedic art styles when they aren't in that comedic situation and you also get like in episode 12 swimsuits being magically repaired. Generally speaking, art is a very high standard just needed more refinement.The OP has a super American Pie feel to it. The ED has a very strong feminine let's all be happy vibe. The general sounds are pretty great especially the SFX in fight scenes.Characters, as said, are wide and varied and the MC Nozomi is actually very likeable something that is not always possible to be said for the MC. Technically there are 4 MC's but Nozomi is the primary in the end.Characters like Aoba whose hair often acts like a wagging tail from a dog or Rin with her hair ears are super cute. Generally, characters are all pretty great, to be honest.If you put aside the crazy sport that I honestly do not understand why it is not a real thing and just enjoy what feels like magic being used for sport in a perverted flashy way then you can love this show. The magic has an over the top feel to the moves the girls make I hope exists in all sports on this show's planet.In the end, it is a strong 8/10. The art let it down at points but also as good as the story is you cannot really connect to anyone. It ends in a really nice place that doesn't need more adaptation unless it is done correctly. the way to the cute girl whose hair turns into ears like Rin.

Just thinking about it makes my spine hurts but that\'s the point of ""Keijo!!!!!!!!"": it thrives in its own ridiculousness. With this show, you either like it or you don\'t. So I would suggest you to watch the first episode and what you see is what you get.For me, I thought this show was good and really enjoyable. The show lies between being a parody of sports and martial arts anime with all of the girls\' move being named every time they use it. The fight scenes are one of the best one...I have seen so far and the art work with their use of sexy, thick, black, border-outline is wonderful. The character designs are great; however, if you\'re looking for some kind of good character development then turn away from this show because it has little. It sometimes tries to add some depths to it\'s character by suddenly throwing flashbacks during the fight scenes I find kind of annoying; I watch Keijo!!!!!!!! because of the sport Keijo itself.

It is gambling. It is ECCHI! and the most important thing: It is the start of a beautiful, succesful, harsh and fun carreer!!!!!!Keijo absolutely contained what I expected. The goodlooking parts of the girls in a sport and bikini's. But it turned out to be more than just that. The story contains a lot of serious parts about the sport. In this anime you can absolutely see how people work hard to get to the top. Of course not as much as in a top serie like Haikyuu!!, but still I seea good slice of life inside this serie.This serie...was funny, ecchi and you can reflect yourself to the characters. The characters all had their own weaknesses and powers. They were all a one of a kind which i think is well done!!! Ilikedall of the characters personalities, so well done scriptmakers!The art was good of course, but you would expect that. A lot of time has been put in this serie by the artist and you can really recognise that.The music was good.

Second, I watched the whole anime while turning my brain off for maximum enjoyment, so my viewpoint is basically from a brain-dead guy who watches this anime for shit and giggles (or more accurately, for boobs and butts). Thirdly, this anime is not for everyone, so some might find it to be jarring. Forth, I might use a lot of words like boobs, breast, butts and asses, so bear with me. Now that we get that clear, let us have a review on Keijo,...a national treasure of anime.The anime had a relatively simple, plain plot. It\'s boobs and butts the sport, with characters fighting with each others to be the best throughout the whole story. As such, one does not have to use much brain cell that is left to understand the story because it is pretty much direct and self-explanatory. Most of the time it is predictable, but that does not hinder it from being entertaining. It is just absurdly fun because it\'s just plain ridiculous. Who would have thought that a sport using just butt and boobs will be so intense? The name and the way the tecniques were executed are just out of this world. Meteor Hip, Vacuum But canon, Gate of Bootylon? You name it. Also, in case you noticed, there are a lot of references from popular anime where they changed it to suite the Keijo theme, which is always a plus. The more the anime progress, the more ridiculous it become, to the point that it\'s just plain stupid. Yet since by the time you progress that far, you might not care anymore since the brain is already in an inactive state. In the end, the story itself become rather negligible, and all the anime is worth is its fancy action and creative way of executing it. Also, I haven\'t read any of the manga, but I\'ve been told that a lot of parts had been cut off just because the number of volumes the manga had. As such, I can\'t really make any comparison or elaborate much on that.As for the characters, Keijo features a huge array of cast with voluptuous, fit body shape of all kind. The main character, Kaminashi Nozomi is your generic ""I will become the best and very rich"" type who speak with a dialect, which is a nice touch. There aren\'t really other noteworthy traits from her but at the same time she is not bad character wise. Her other friend, Miyata Sayaka is more level-headed character with a bust complex. She is given enough development and decent enough to watch. There is also Aoba Kazane who is a more timid, smart girl and your usual klutz Toyoguchi Non with soft, squishy part, where all of them share the same room altogether. All the other characters are there just to support the main casts, and aren\'t given enough development which is understandable given how many the characters were in the anime and having to put all of them in a single cour.Keijo!!!!!!!! have a rather decent animation and art, which makes up for the poor storyline. The usage of sharp, flat colours with defined outline makes it pleasant to watch. All the action scene are very fluid and fun to watch as a whole.The damage inflicted each time the hit connects feels painful, and the way the body move is smooth and flow wonderfully. The usage of cinematic camera, as well as well placed camera is praiseworthy. The studio knows its priority, and that\'s always a good thing. The music is average to say the most. Most of the ost used fits well with the scene, while the OP and ED is fun to watch and listen to.Overall, Keijo!!!!!!!! is a really fun and enjoyable anime to watch, given that you denies all the logic and reason when watching it. It is a perfect anime for boobs and asses connoisseur who want to see what such magnificent body parts could achieve more. It is not an anime for everyone tho, people who despise fanservice might hate it to the core, dissing it for its ridiculous, poor story and absurd theme. But in the end of the day, it is a fanservice anime, and I can say it does its job well done. a national treasure of anime.The anime had a relatively simple, plain plot.

It doesn't try to push boundaries but rather embraces its unique premise wholeheartedly. The fighting style is undeniably interesting, using boobs and butts in a new way, blending athleticism with ridiculous tactics. The visuals of the series hold up decently, with the characters being well-defined, and the animation during the matches being the highlight of the series. However, where the series fails is its lack of character motivation and development. Without a compelling backstory or clear goals for the characters, it's difficult for the battles to carry...much weight beyond the spectacle. Moreover, the absence of a real antagonist further exacerbates this issue, as there is no one for the protagonists to truly strive against. Despite these shortcomings, Keijo!!!!!!!! still manages to leave a lasting impression, making it a guilty pleasure for fans who enjoy a healthy dose of ecchi comedy. much weight beyond the spectacle.

It feels like I am actually watching a Fighting Shonen like anime.There are even signature moves like the Vacuum Ass Cannon.There are one on one matches. There are allout fights and there are team battles. The abilities are sick each girl has (except a few but we don't talk about them).There is also a lot of strategy involved like when in a team battle someone uses her boobs to catch an opponent so another one can knock her out...with her ass.It sounds stupid but when you see it it looks hella badass, especially how they perform on various battle stages.The characters are also amazing.Nozomi is your average stupid main character with a good feeling for fighting like a shonen protagonist.Miyata is a proxy rival and has a struggle with what people expect from her and what she wants.Others don't have many deep struggles but they are still amazing to see in how they interact and fight alongside each other.My favorite character I didn't expect to like is Kusakai Mio. The beautiful lesbian who is horny for everyone and knows what girls like very much. This comes into play in fights too which is honestly sick explaining why she is such a prodigy.

I heard that this is good, but I did not expect it to be this good.Funny, happy, intense, lighthearted and entertaining.Basically, imagine that you take Azumanga or Yuyushiki. Then you turn it into sport anime. Then you add secret techniques with power comparable to one punch man. Then you add fanservice. Then you base the whole thing around butt and boob jokes. That\'ll be keijo.Based on ridiculous premise (there\'s girl-only sports with very unusual fighting rules), when you first hear about it, you\'d think it is another cheap attempt to cash in on fanservice, but when you actually watch it, you realize that...it is more than this.Detailed breakdown below:Story:Despite ridiculous premise, it loosk like a good sport + slice of life + comedy + fighting anime. Protagonist has a goal, and strives to reach that goal, and meets many colorful characters in the process of training. There are few references to some older anime, I\'ve caught at least two of them, but I suspect there may be more of them. Despite very fanservicey premise, anime looks almost innocent, because every single character in the series tae their sport seriously. That makes situations that happen funnier.Art:Nicely done modern anime, better than ""standard modern anime"". Characters animations looks great in motion, there are no ""budget cutting tricks"". Character style is somewhat simple, but they\'re all more or less unique and well drawn. Looks good.Sound:Music complements the story and events of the anime very well. Soundtrack is more or less standard cheerful type, but it matches the anime perfectly, pretty much at all occurrences.Characters:They are quite stereotypical, meaning everybody more or less correspond to some archetype, but they\'re very well done, and even if you recognize a stereotype, interactions between characters are very entertaining. To be honest, the atmosphere of inter-character communications strongly reminded me of Azumanga or Yuyushiku. Protagonist is a quite close to the ""simple/friendly/girl archetype"", but she\'s amusing to watch.Enjoyment:Havent\' had this amount of fun for quite some time, and pretty much watched last episodes on the edge of my seat.Overall:The only reason why someone would want to avoid it if they absolutely can\'t stand butt/boob jokes (there are a LOT of those) or has aversion to butts. Despite premise that looks like it was built for fanservice, the anime has fairly innocent feeling about it.Highly recommended.

Well, someone would say its bad, someone would say its good, to me its lots of fun,story is okay, but simply is short, it would be nice if its 24 episodes but well, what you get you get, art is good, no complains here, sound, i didn't pay attention on sound, but it was nicely done, characters were good, enjoyment and overall,...well if you love lots of boobs and butts around, this is anime for you, if you do not, watch it anyways. I hope there will be second season, but if its correct what it says that they use 90 of 95 volumes for this 12 episodes then its hardly that we will get more, but i hope we will, more bouncing and but kicking i hope in future, however even with all good things in this , i cannot give it 10. 8 is nice round number. well if you love lots of boobs and butts around, this is anime for you, if you do not, watch it anyways.

I used the 1-5 ""The Little Man"" Scale. For more information check out my profile.Story(4)Although some may not agree with me giving this show so much points for its story, still I think this is reasonable considering the original concept of the show and the lack of big flaws it has. The humor that comes with the concept is also quite good.For that concept we have the sport which is basically a form of Sumo on water, except the athletes can only use their Boobs and Butts.With that there comes the obvious fanservice. However,...unlike other shows Keijo!!!!!!!! does not use the fanservice as a tacked on feature with Keijo!!!!!!!! the fanservice is a core element of the story and without it the show would not make sense. In that aspect the show is surprisingly self-aware of what it is.It is also one of the few (other example would be Food Wars) shows that have a lot of fanservice but at the same time have no fantasy setting.The storytelling itself is still a basic Shounen Sports anime type. We have a school(because there always need to be schools in anime for everything), training and afterwards matches with rivals.Although the show has a lot of positives when it comes to storytelling, it also has some negatives for example, since the anime did not adapt the early chapters of the manga there is no real buildup for the relationship between Miyata and Nozomi.The worldbuilding also could have been better if we could have gotten more infos about the Pro-Scene.This adaptation is done by studio Xebecwhich also did the To Love Ru-Franchise and Love Hina, because of those they are  quite experienced when it comes to adapting Ecchi source material.Sound (2)This is the second time I mention the name Hayato Matuo in my reviews. The first time it was for Drifters and there I praised the overall Soundtrack, this time I need to be a bit harsher.First off the opening and the ending felt ok, but they were not memorable and that is also the biggest problem with the whole OST. There was not a single piece which I found outstanding. It was even worse, for most parts it not only was generic but it also felt too tame for a show like this. If it would have been more epic, it could have amplified the scale of the attacks a lot.For the Seiyuu\'s since this was a more comedy orianted show there was not the biggest range of emotions to be displayed to begin with. However since some of the characters were showcased having an accent there was a certain knowledge about those accents requiered.Animation(3):For the animation there is to say that the quality was rather inconsistent. There were some battle scenes that really looked fantastic. However, not all the battle scenes had a high level of quality. Most of the scenes looked good, but could have been done better. Some of the movements also looked a bit clunky. This is necessarily due to a high amount of animated movements. The more details you add to those scenes the higher the cost of the end product. Maybe the studio did not want to invest too much money in this series and so cut some of the budget here. Which leads me to my next point. The animation for not so important scenes was, to be fair not too good. There were some inconsistencies like in one scene the bikini top is torn and in the next it isn\'t anymore and then it is again smaller stuff like that. Also, when there were not so important scenes, characters in the background were not well animated. Besides that the backgrounds were for most parts boring and could have been better with some more colors.For my last point the character models looked good. They were standart and not to detailed, but I liked them.Also some details for the attack moves they used thicker lines to highlight them I thought that was quite neat.Characters(3):Here I need to state something in advance. Normally I would rather go and talk about character depth and layers of characterisation in this segment, but for this show I rated more on the fun that the different characters brought with them.The characters in this show are the typical kind of quirky people you come across in anime. With that being said, the main character is quite realistic when it comes to her goals and why she wants to play Keijo.For the other 3 characters of the main cast 2 of them felt in their own ways good, however the third was a bit to much of a comedic relief and had no other big function.The cast of the supporting characters was also rather big growing from episode to episode. Most of them had one or two things going for them, but those things were a bit over-the top stylised so that they stood out of the masses and felt unique. With their quirky personalities there also came their special moves or their own techniques. All of those things made the supporting cast really fun and I liked most of them. Sure they were as far away from being realistic as possible however that does not mean they were not entertaining.Enjoyment (4):Keijo is fun. That is the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about this show. It oozes with creativity in its setting it\'s specific over-the-top attacks it\'s diffrent lands and all types of strategic advantages they use.The cast and the storytelling were, on the other, side not the most original or layered examples in recent history, but both served it\'s purpose. The characters were for the most part likable, (some where even a bit memorable) and the story even though it was cliched was uplifted by the sheer ridiculousness of the concept. Overall I really enjoyed the show and would hope for a second season.(Eventhough they caught up to the source material and since the manga is a monthly release there will be no second season anytime soon.) unlike other shows Keijo!!!!!!!! does not use the fanservice as a tacked on feature with Keijo!!!!!!!! the fanservice is a core element of the story and without it the show would not make sense.

They were standart and not to detailed, but I liked them.Also some details for the attack moves they used thicker lines to highlight them I thought that was quite neat.Characters(3):Here I need to state something in advance. Normally I would rather go and talk about character depth and layers of characterisation in this segment, but for this show I rated more on the fun that the different characters brought with them.The characters in this show are the typical kind of quirky people you come across in anime. With that being said, the main character is quite realistic when it comes to her goals and why she wants to play Keijo.For the other 3 characters of the main cast 2 of them felt in their own ways good, however the third was a bit to much of a comedic relief and had no other big function.The cast of the supporting characters was also rather big growing from episode to episode. Most of them had one or two things going for them, but those things were a bit over-the top stylised so that they stood out of the masses and felt unique. With their quirky personalities there also came their special moves or their own techniques. All of those things made the supporting cast really fun and I liked most of them. Sure they were as far away from being realistic as possible however that does not mean they were not entertaining.Enjoyment (4):Keijo is fun. That is the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about this show. It oozes with creativity in its setting it\'s specific over-the-top attacks it\'s diffrent lands and all types of strategic advantages they use.The cast and the storytelling were, on the other, side not the most original or layered examples in recent history, but both served it\'s purpose. The characters were for the most part likable, (some where even a bit memorable) and the story even though it was cliched was uplifted by the sheer ridiculousness of the concept. Overall I really enjoyed the show and would hope for a second season.(Eventhough they caught up to the source material and since the manga is a monthly release there will be no second season anytime soon.)', 'First and foremost: what most people don\'t realize is that Keijo!!!!!!!! is a PARODY, and while at that - a HUGE PARODY. Anyone taking a show that uses terms such as BOOBology, ASStronomy and RACKupressure so seriously is going into this with the wrong mindset.> So why is Keijo!!!!!!!! a parody?-It presents more superpowers in 12 episodes than one can even dream of having in a superpower-shounen anime, and to add to the originality that the author needed to accomplish this - it\'s all driven by BUTTS and BOOBS.-The thing is: Keijo!!!!!!!! does all of that BUT involving female body parts...clashing... and...making sword sounds, exploding, serving as a shield or a gattling gun, all while making references to JoJo, Attack on Titan, Fate/Zero, etc. Do you still think this show isn\'t self-aware? Ok, moving on.-Many people backfire saying that it presents the most cliché tropes in sports anime, from mid-battle flashbacks to overthinking any situation in the middle of a match.-The thing is: Keijo!!!!!!!! does all of that BUT with all of the bery bery sad sad backstories being TRAGIC because of events involving... BUTTS AND TITS. Pretty touching and heartwarming, indeed. Moving on.You are not supposed to cry tears of sadness watching the characters\' lame backstories and you are certainly not supposed to feel like the characters\' powers make any sort of sense even in any way, shape or form, actually, you\'d be better off trying to imagine how bizzare it would be to have any sort of sexual experience with any of the cast of this anime... and I mean it.It\'s also worth mentioning that while Keijo!!!!!!!! (yeah you figured I love me  them exclamation marks!!!!!!!!) is not listed under the ""parody"" nor ""comedy"" genres, it got me (and 99% of the people who watched it) laughing out loud in every. single. episode. Oh, and add quite the healthy cringe to the mix - it happened.I want more Keijo!!!!!!!!, and I want it fast. making sword sounds, exploding, serving as a shield or a gattling gun, all while making references to JoJo, Attack on Titan, Fate/Zero, etc. Do you still think this show isn\'t self-aware?

(D\'Oh!)Story:This is a sports shounen anime like every other...BUTT with an all female cast. And not only that, it is full of fanservice, tons of it. Now the question is, is that all Keijo has to offer? Surprisingly not. The girls take this sport seriously, like they would do any other sport. Keijo never tries to cover up the fact, that it wants you to drool over the well-developed teenage girl bodies, but it also tries to make itself a serious sports story. On top of that, we have insane power...moves straight out of an over the top shounen, which (thanks to the nature of this anime) are the most hilarious thing about Keijo. I\'d say the story works as well as you allow it to.8/10Art:The fights (or as they call it, races) are full of energy and quite spectacular to watch. However, there are some noticeable animation flaws, which I personally don\'t mind very much, butt I know that many people have major issues with these. The character design is okay, the girls could look a bit more distinct, especially since they are mostly running around in uniform swimsuits.5/10Sound:The opening song is awesome. The ending isn\'t quite as good, but still solid. Voice acting was good in general, though nobody was really able to do a standout performance (and I\'m saying this as a fan of Rie Takahashi).7/10Characters:There are a lot of cute and/or badass girls in Keijo that you should have no hard time choosing your favourite. The cast as a whole is good enough to work, though I feel like this would\'ve worked even better with more unique characters. I\'ll exclude Nozomi from this though. She is your standard shounen main character, but female and willing to show off her body. Which leads me to another slight criticism I have: they don\'t seem to mind showing a stadium of thousands their titties if it means victory. That felt a little awkward (yes, I understand that this is an ecchi anime).7/10Enjoyment:All criticism aside, Keijo was an insane amount of fun to watch. I enjoyed the fanservice, I was rooting for my favourite girls to win and I laughed my ass off (hehe, ass) at all the over the topness. Keijo is the epitome of what some consider ""brainless fun"". This anime does not try to be the next Evangelion or Madoka or whatever, it wants to provide entertainment and goddammit, does it succeed. Absolute recommendation for everybody (unless you think female bodies are sexist, in which case you can go die for all I care).10/10Overass:7.4/10 moves straight out of an over the top shounen, which (thanks to the nature of this anime) are the most hilarious thing about Keijo.

In past months we’ve had  video games censor themselves to avoid outrage by a section of the population and anime is constantly being censored to allow for wider distribution. So it’s refreshing when a series parodies this censorship, as was the case with Shimoneta, or disregards it, as is the case with Keijo!!!!!!!![A ridiculous sport]Keijo!!!!!!!! Is an ecchi sports series adapted from a manga of the same name and brought to the screens by the animation studio Xebec. Xebec are also the studio behind...the popular comedy ecchi series, To LOVE-Ru and that experience comes through in Keijo!!!!!!!! The story is based on the sport of Keijo, a gambling sport in which battle against one another with their butt and breasts, and revolves around a group of girls who are training to become professional Keijo athletes. Kaminashi Nozomi is a brilliant and hardworking gymnast who’s attracted to the better paying sport of Keijo. But she must first climb the ranks of her school and region before she becomes a professional Keijo athlete.[Unbridled excitement with the occasional disgust]Keijo!!!!!!!! Was an immediate sensation when it started airing on the 6th of October, 2016; it was as if people had been waiting in earnest for a show like it. The warm reception was inspired by the show’s honesty; Keijo!!!!!!!! Was what it said it was. It didn’t try to hide its absurd premise behind some intricate reveal, its main characters were young women who were often seen in their swimsuits and weren’t shy about it, and best of all, there were no male-female romantic relationships involved. It was simply a show about athletes - no more. But Keijo!!!!!!!! Wasn’t without its critics.There were publications that loudly criticized the show for its depictions of women despite its keen focus on the sport alone and its diverse cast. There were fans who criticized its excessive use of fanservice and its furthering the poor perception of the anime medium by ‘outsiders’. That the show did damage to the anime medium is left to be seen but the criticism didn’t stop it from gaining popularity with each new episode.Audiences waited for each new episode because the show was sure to deliver; it rarely got boring. And like most sport anime, it didn’t need a deep plot to keep the audiences engaged.[A strong emphasis on teamwork]The plot of Keijo is a simple and common one: an enthusiastic youngster seeks to become the best at a particular sport. That’s the basis of almost all the sports shows; the better shows often weave personal relationships into the plot. The plot also has common elements: the lead character starts as an underdog and the story features energetic battles with epic swing turns, battle analysis and the lead overcoming huge odds through teamwork. These common elements not only help audiences identify the show’s genre but provide room for the greater shows to excel through their execution. And it is in the execution of the element of teamwork that Keijo shines.The sport of Keijo begins with the contestants being positioned on a platform, known as the ‘land’ in the middle of a pool. The goal is to have the contestants battle each other until all but one of them remains on the platform and is declared the winner. It’s easy to see how the mechanics of the sport encourage teamwork and the show emphasizes this as much as it can. For example, the girls of Setouchi, the school in which Nozomi trains, are taught to be aware of the positions of their teammates; the show culminates in a team-based battle and there’s a character that’s formidable within a team but average otherwise. This emphasis on teamwork is made more remarkable by the diverse cast of characters in the show.[Compelling lead cast but weak supporting characters]Each of the athletes in the show is an individual, designed with a particular trait in mind. Some are big and burly and possess moves that rely on strength; others are small and (not) dainty and possess speed-based moves. There are exceptions, of course, but the character designs are simple to understand. For some of the characters, it’s easy to tell what their special moves are just by looking at them. It’d be difficult to cite examples without spoiling anything. Yes, even though the show is hardly mysterious, there are beautiful moments when a character reveals their hidden strength and quickly becomes a fan favourite. Although there are a lot of characters to focus on, the show handles its leads excellently. All but one of the four main characters are compelling.Kaminashi Nozomi is the designated main character and deserving of the role. She’s bold, outspoken, brash and more powerful than the average Keijo athlete. But she’s also hardworking, surprisingly creative and an inspiring leader. Miyata Sayaka is one of the smaller characters but complements this with hard work and her experience as a professional judo athlete.  Toyoguchi Non is the archetypal clumsy teammate who’s a surprisingly powerful solo player and an oft invisible support. Aoba Kazane is shy and not as powerful as the other three in solo matchups but is an impressive team player. The main characters clearly fit the archetypes you’d expect from a sports show but they are provided with more depth as the show progresses. Aoba’s growth is one of the more notable developments.Unfortunately, the show doesn’t treat its supporting cast as well; only one of the other athletes gets as much screentime as the lead characters and she doesn’t change at all. Nonetheless, all the characters are designed to be unique and this is enhanced by the bright and sharp art of the show.[Impactful art]The art of Keijo is bright, colourful and mostly done in warm tones which evokes the cheery mood of the show. But a combination of its framing and use of light make the action more impactful; the framing of attacks focussed slowly on their point of impact. One of the most pronounced aspects of the art and animation was the highlight of a special ability, often before it hit, that also had the name of the ability in a flashy font. These scenes were also complemented with wild special effects and animation that took the form of the ability’s source model. For example, the move ‘Shoryucans’ has the character mimicking an uppercut with her breasts. But this pales in comparison to the most popular move in the show.The build-up and execution of the Vacuum Butt Cannon is the prime example of the excellent art direction of the show. The camera follows Kaminashi, keeping its frame solely on her as she twists and turns. The twists are further elaborated by threads of light that follow the movement of her butt. The camera then follows her as she flips and eventually jumps. Then it zooms into her butt, which is highlighted with a bright glow, and follows it as it makes impact with her opponent. But the scene is incomplete without the sound effects that accompany her twisting, flipping and the impact of her butt.[Booming sound effects]Keijo!!!!!!!! Is an action show that relies on its sound effects and they don’t disappoint. You can feel the impact of physical attacks from the sounds they make; they go so well with the special moves, especially when they’re revealed. From thunderous butt slams to whirling legs, you can tell what kind of move is being performed by listening to the sound effects alone. You can almost visualize an attack from the sounds it makes - even with your eyes closed. These sound effects sometimes accompany epic background music.Keijo’s ridiculous premise and it’s shameless characters make for a fun and exciting watch. However, it is not without its flaws; a major one being the dip in art and animation quality towards the end of the show. But these are forgiven for the bold brilliance that is Keijo!!!!!!!! the popular comedy ecchi series, To LOVE-Ru and that experience comes through in Keijo!!!!!!!! The story is based on the sport of Keijo, a gambling sport in which battle against one another with their butt and breasts, and revolves around a group of girls who are training to become professional Keijo athletes.

But these are forgiven for the bold brilliance that is Keijo!!!!!!!!', 'Imagine living in a world where the most popular sport is played by cute girls in bikini IN A WATER BATTLE ROAYLE....using only their butts and breasts. Yup, that\'s basically Keijo!!!!!!!! for you.As the 8 exclamation marks might suggest, its an over the top anime that mostly focuses on the sport or the echi in it. Speaking of which, this show is no  Haikyuu!! with its action intensity that will make you go out and play volleyball, nor Kiss x Sis with its lewd intensity that will make you go fu...never mind that.The show follows a girl with the name Kaminashi that starts...training at a camp to be the best at Keijo and achieve her dream of being a professional. Later on it is revealed that there\'s a rivalry between two schools, one of which is Nozomi\'s. She is set to defend her school\'s pride and show what she is capable of with the friends she has made throughout the way. As you can see, the plot isn\'t original at the very least (a plot that can be put on any sports anime and it will probably work), but that is not the strong side of the show.The show shines with how beautiful the sceneries and characters look. While having a lot of action scenes, which suggests a lot of frames needed for them to look good, none of the budget was spared in that aspect.While the music isn\'t something extraordinary and most of the time you could barely notice it, it does its job fine and doesn\'t distract you from the anime itself. One thing to note is the music in the opening. For the whole 12-episode run I was not able to make myself skip it even once because of how fitting it is and sets you in the mood of watching some girl-on-girl action on a water platform (yes, music is capable of such things).While the opening hypes you up, you start to wonder what the characters are like. And to your belief, they aren\'t as flat as you would guess from an ecchi that its sole purpose is to show girls bash their butts towards one another. Throughout the series, you sense that the characters have changed at least a bit after every battle they have and they learn a lot with the help of their friends. There\'s something unique in each character\'s design and personality that mixes well when we take into account their goals/past. For example Miyata, Kaminashi\'s first friend and rival, wants to prove to everyone that she has made the right choice of pursuing keijo after abandoning training judo under her father\'s guidance, but her complex about her bosom size is a hindrance, while simultaneously a boost when she decides to encourage that side of hers.Now, onto the most important part: the enjoyment you will/might receive whilst watching the show. As you could have guessed by now, keijo will not make you see the world through a new pair of eyes, it could certainly make you do that through laughter. To fully enjoy it, your brain should definitely be turned off and just expect anything to happen and a good time is promised. How will you not laugh or question what even is happening if quotes like ""...you must take your butt to the absolute limit"" or ""...she\'s called ass-eater Nanase at school!"" are thrown nonchalantly every possible moment? Another thing is the name of some of the attacks. I swear, the creative department should\'ve gotten a raise after inventing such classic techniques such as ""hypno tits"",""assteroid afterglow"",""tit-fang attack"" and most importantly ""vacuum butt cannon"".All in all, the anime is good enough for me to recommend it while having one thing in mind: don\'t overthink what is happening, just accept it at it is.While it is not a masterpiece by any stretch or would it be remember as a classic in the not so distant future, Keijo could definitely fill your spare time and have a great one.As for recommendations, there are three routes to take, each depending on what you liked in the anime:-sports route- if you liked what you saw but wondered what it would be like, but with boys and with less action, the same season that brought Keijo brings you Yuri on Ice as well.-over the top action route- There was no way to put this here after watching the last episode, but Kill la Kill. The final battle itself is a reference to Kill la Kill-ecchi- there are far more \'ecchier\' anime than Keijo, but I will give it props for not being the entire focus of the anime, just a way to catch the viewers eye. If you want \'true\' ecchi, try Highschool DxD on for size! training at a camp to be the best at Keijo and achieve her dream of being a professional.

In all seriousness this anime was actually very enjoyable in many ways one can not describe, for reasons.Story: A simple yet interesting story. You wont be lost as it clearly explains the objective of what Kejio is all about and the outcome.Characters: Easy to remember, each of them bloom with personalities that is not boring.Art: Almost a perfect score ! At times you will notice (areas) are not as detailed or deflate in some scenes.Sound: Epic, enough said.Personal Enjoyment: This anime is so great you will need to...pause just to get a grip on reality due to the creativity level that is packaged in each episode. Loved how they implemented humor in a serious and non so serious fashion.Overall: Highly recommend this anime to open minded individuals or watch it with an open minded friend, trust me your in for a blast ! pause just to get a grip on reality due to the creativity level that is packaged in each episode.

But you really gotta admit, no matter how fucking dumb, and fucking stupid this show is with its moves and random insertation of naming of their moves. The animation, artstyle, random epic sound effect that you usually hears in hollywood movie? (if you've watch it, you gonna hear it when the purple hair girl appears in ep 1), OST, and the fucking special effects on their butt, boobs, head, random glow of light on them, insane speed,...and da legitimately insane intensity of this show in this ecchi series. Well frankly speaking, no matter how great it was with the fight scene, i can't help but to literally laugh and grin like crazy when this show is so fucking ridiculous. I even fucking cringed when they make all of the character's cloth disappear, or just some perverted, horny ass lesbo grabbing each others boobs and butts. This anime would've been fairly good, but the fanservice tick me off so much i just have to give this shit a 6. But hey, the weirdness of this show and the seriousness that the voice acting, the glorification of the sport is definitely something that is a joke in itself. If you people takes this anime too seriously, you would only feel like this anime is an offend to women. However, this shit is riduculous in itself, who the fuck gonna takes this show seriously. And all em feminist complaining about how the media culture only represent women as slim and sexy. But this anime has a full complete packs of size and body shape, like fat, masculinity, slim, big butts, small butts, big boobs, small boobs, manlike face etc.But they acted out as if this was a completly normal thing too lmao. That's the comedy in it. Because the show is dumb, and they takes it so seriously as if it was a normal sport, or just like any serious shounen. This anime is literaly funny af lol. Some people's premise would go like this, sports with boobs and butts = dumb. That's true and they're not trying to pretend that the idea of it is not dumb. They seriousness is what makes this show so fucking hilarious and interesting to watch. Not for boobs and butts in particular. But for me it's the animation.I laugh when their butt and boobs crushes into one another. I laugh when a swimsuit was able to grab a hold of another person's swimsuit by using the power of grip (keep in mind how slippery a swimsuit is) that came from their boobies. I laugh when i thought boobs were butt. I laugh when i recognize all of the character's power or moves are a parody to other existing characters in the anime community. I laugh when a girl's pony tail works like a doggy tail, and I laugh when the anime is so stupid with its intense training that would cramp your butt and backs forever if you keep doing it in real life. It makes no sense but the shit is legitimately funny af, and that's the point of stupidity in any humorous show.But despite how low my rating is, the fights in this show is godly amazing. The animator and the staffs really did put their biggest effort into making this one. I barely see this much effort in an anime before, unless it's a very popular series in the manga/light novel community, but the quality of animation and art consistency was amazing. And if you guys notice on the intro or op, im pretty sure that's the gate of babylon that's controlled by Gilgamesh in the fate series lmao. What's this? Im i suppose to expect butts coming out of it? lmao. Like a spear or sword butts projectile maybe? But ofc, despite the clearly a fucking copied from other moves from other shows (like one piece, fate series, etc.), there are some originality in those too. Well that's the point of a parody show tbh. And the name of those moves are so risible that you can't have but to instinctively laugh at it.I wouldn't say that this anime isn't worth of your time to watch, the only reason that im still watching this show was purely, and mainly because of how the fight scene has drag me in. If you really hate this anime because of how stupid, dumb, and riduclous it's. I recommend that you should still check out all of its butt fights and boobs fight. Because the animation and OSt in those is just too sick. But if you're a 2016 feminist who change the word feminism to something else, or you just hate ecchi (either men or female) since it's just sound dumb and unrealistic. I would definitely agree on that point on basis, however, if you're not one of those people who can't accept everything that they sees, no matter how dumb it's. Then i wouldn't recommend this to you. And this would prolly be one of my first review where i spam the word boobs and butts everywhere lol and da legitimately insane intensity of this show in this ecchi series. Well frankly speaking, no matter how great it was with the fight scene, i can't help but to literally laugh and grin like crazy when this show is so fucking ridiculous. I even fucking cringed when they make all of the character's cloth disappear, or just some perverted, horny ass lesbo grabbing each others boobs and butts.

In Keijo!!!!!!!!, both fit very well together.This anime is a good experience, a lot of fun and a show that is worth getting back to. Will for sure rewatch it with my loved ones and ruin some of my potential friendships right after introducing this title in the future.I\'m not the biggest fan of the shounen genre, to put it mildly. Nevertheless, I have experience with many shounens and some of them still have a special place in my heart. This anime made it possible to me to feel...inspired and nostalgic just by the look of a giant ass-shaphed cloud at the end of each episode and I think it says a lot.Another genre that makes me frustrated is Ecchi. I dislike fanservice in anime and despite many years of contact with popular productions, I still can\'t stand the combination of forced sexual content with this medium. Well, so how is it possible that I have made my way through the opening of this anime, which right on the start aggresively attacks me with shaky asses and bouncing tits in tight swimsuits? How was I able to enjoy this production and have watched it at least three times in my life? Has alcohol and dozen layers of irony had anything to do with it (somewhat, yes)? Let\'s take a moment and see if there is anything worth paying attention to in Keijo!!!!!!!!.This anime\'s universe focuses on a sport with very simple rules. Girls in swimsuits fight each other on floating platforms, and the one who falls into the water loses. The catch? In combat, they can only use their breasts and buttocks. It sounds absurd, illogical and bizarre, but in this universe this sport has an enormous popularity and the contenders aspire to be the best. Therefore, while watching this anime, we hear characters talking about how much they have dreamed of becoming a professional contender for their whole lives and during fights contenders act ""ass"" it was the most important match in the world. We go through the process of their development and experience their creativeness at pushing their opponents out of the arena.Now let\'s put this anime alongside some other shounens where the characters save the world, want to help others, fight each other to death or give their lives for some important cause. Now let\'s take a look at all of them and see how our special needs child stands out, presenting characters that hit each other with asses fullfilled with overwhelming energy and parry powerful blows with pumped up tits. There is no way to take this anime seriously, but this is one of Keijo\'s biggest strengths - it doesn\'t take itself seriously.Asses flying around at torpedo\'s speed, asses possessed by a demon, asses peeking out from portals. Are you a boobs person? No problem - grappling with boobs, hypnotizing boobs, laser-shooting nipples. The absurdity of techniques never ends. If you\'ve watched a lot of shounens before, there is a good chance you\'d find some references to your favorite titles and recognize the techniques that made you shiver before (just in a more asstract form *wink*).The magic of this anime is that after a few starting episodes, during the fights, my brain was no longer able to see buttocks and breasts as intimate parts of the human body. They have become a weapon for me. A quick yet impactful strike with an ass suddenly started to be seen as an indicator of a talent, athletic prowess and stamina of a character. Katanas, punches, magic attacks, ninja techniques, superpowers - they were no different to me as asses hitting the opponent in the face. Chest became an effective protection against devastating hits. For a duration of the show I\'ve felt like I had become part of this universe, as if I lived in this world and all of this was absolutely natural for me. It was kinda like a fever dream ... Me, on a stage, cheering on my favorites contenders and watching them smash each other with their wonderfully animated butts.The thing that annoyed me the most was the unnecessary fanservice outside of the arena environment. I avoid ecchi with the same engagement as I avoid pyramid schemes and what I don\'t like in MY ANIME are girls teasing and groping each other. That\'s when it crosses the line. Hitting each other with butts, grappling an opponent with boobs and doing as many absurd techniques with your ass as you can - beautiful and brave. Yass, strong women, slay. Sensually touching, groping and teasing each other...? Ew, no. I\'ll pass, thank you. But you might say ""uhh this anime is incredibly pervy and considering your dislike in ecchi genre, how can you accept those filthy Full HD asses shots? *cleaning mouth out of saliva* It sounds to me like a stupid excuse."" Shut up. *Powerful slap to the face* I don\'t know, it\'s magical.To me, this anime is a parody of the shounen genre and I don\'t think it tries to be anything above that. The characters are generic, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out whatsoever, and the story is as linear as possible. However, anime is very well animated, is funny in it\'s own way, has some hype moments and has positively surprised me many times. If you can take this type of production not seriously, you will probably have fun, especially with your friends. You may even suprise yourself that your partner may enjoy it too (if not, break up is free and divorce papers are easy to google). inspired and nostalgic just by the look of a giant ass-shaphed cloud at the end of each episode and I think it says a lot.Another genre that makes me frustrated is Ecchi.

I have no idea how they made butt and boob fighting so epic!The story is pretty generic, but the execution is very concise and interesting throughout. Backstories of the characters are presented, and their lives are developed over the course of the show.Art and Music are really good. I even downloaded the ending song. It was really catchy. The opening is also decent.All in all, watch it if you want to watch something fun, this...is definitely a good anime. Just don't watch it in public, like me is definitely a good anime. Just don't watch it in public, like me"", 'Summary/Overall - 7This show is the ultimate guilty pleasure.  It succeeds as a parody of shonen fighting tropes, and as a comedy with a mostly straight-man style of humor.  Silly people are doing silly things--but with a completely straight face the whole time.  And it\'s hilarious.The show is actually pretty creative with its premise, and has moments of great animation.  There is some needless and tasteless fanservice in the show, but I\'d say that at least 85% of the sexy stuff actually serves a purpose and deserves to be in the show.  It\'s really easy to just laugh...at some of the ways the characters use their boobs and butts, rather than be put off by it.Story - 6The story is serviceable--nothing more than it needs to be to get the show running.  Girl enters a Keijo training academy, starts training, and faces off against strong rivals.  That\'s it.  That\'s all it needs to be, but it\'s also unambitious.  Because of this, the show can start to drag sometimes in the more ""serious"" scenes, due to the novelty of the premise wearing off after a while.Art - 8The fight scenes are animated surprisingly well.  The art does a good job of conveying what\'s going on at all times, and serves the humor well.  The main downside in this category is that the character designs are very plain and unmemorable.Sound - 7Nothing special.  The voice acting is pretty good and can sell comedic moments.  It\'s funny listening to the characters talk so seriously about their butt combat sport.  Sounds effects can make some of the impact moments funny as well, like when a character has a squishy butt or a butt of steel.  The opening and ending themes are basically forgettable.Character - 6The characters are mostly as plain as the character designs.  They are basically shonen fighter tropes and pretty one-note.  The creativity displayed in their individual powers, as well as the voice acting, is where all of the charm comes from, which is still fairly limited.Enjoyment - 8This show is funny, and not too bad to look at either.  There is genuine creativity in the execution of the completely silly premise.  I was impressed that they varied the platform in the middle of the pool between battles--they could have easily just kept it as a generic platform each time.  And the variety of attacks the girls hit each other with is also interesting and hilarious.  They even change up the swimsuits quite a bit.The writing of the jokes is really solid.  The typical shonen banter in the middle of fighting is usually a drag on fights in other shows, but in this one it\'s genuinely hilarious to hear characters say stuff like ""I\'m getting my butt kicked"" or ""you have yet to understand the true nature of my butt!"".The show starts pretty strong but can start to weaken in later episodes due to the novelty of the premise and the jokes starting to wear off.  I would imagine that this show was probably more fun to watch once per week while it was airing, rather than in a one-sitting binge session.  I also think the show probably doesn\'t have great re-watch value because of this. at some of the ways the characters use their boobs and butts, rather than be put off by it.Story - 6The story is serviceable--nothing more than it needs to be to get the show running.

I feel Keijo was meant to be a comedy with ecchi, but the ecchi not being too sexual and more comedic.StoryThe story is good. The story is not anything special. It’s simply about a girl trying to rise to the top and she goes to a Keijo training school in hopes of making her debut. In the training school, they go through many hurdles by the exercises and the elite class students. The terms for the special moves are rather funny. The training exercises they have to do...early on in the series are questionable (illogical).The characters elevate themselves to the East-West war, and you meet a new cast of characters from the rival training school. With the East-West war beginning, things get even more retarded (ex. a judo body slam with a nipple).CharactersThe characters have their archetypes, yet they are distinctly weird in their own way (ex. Aoba can analyze and copy an opponent’s moves by groping their butt.) The main characters aren’t too over powered, and it would be boring if they didn’t have to try. The production crew or the original manga artists could have made Nozomi, Miyata, Aoba and Non overpowered from the beginning, starting out in the elite class and being at the professional level standard already.SoundThe opening theme isn’t very memorable or catchy. It does amp one up for the upcoming events of the episode (as I think any sports anime should). The ending theme is simply a chill down song, but it’s not as good at the opening in my own opinion. The music as they battle is usually symphonic in a way to fit with the battles, but it really depends. I don’t remember the tracks that well.ArtThe art of Keijo has a nice style to it. It has sharp crisp varying linework and nice cel shade and airbrush coloring as well. In the last couple of episodes during the East-West war, the art gets a bit “rough”. What do I mean “rough”? Well, you can clearly see that mid ground characters have uneven faces, no toes and almost no detail. I will assume the deadlines were getting tight, and I hope they fix the problems in the DVD release.EnjoymentI really enjoyed Keijo for the comedy value of the ecchi. It is very weird and I like weird. I feel some of the dialogue could have been more interesting (in certain conversations with certain characters). Otherwise, the logic from my brain has been drained and turned into a butt.I recommend if you’re looking for something that makes sense, then you’re definitely in the wrong place. How did you even get here to this page? If you want an ecchi anime that the ecchi isn’t portrayed in an intensely sexual way, then this is for you.That’s all!-  plumapplejuice early on in the series are questionable (illogical).The characters elevate themselves to the East-West war, and you meet a new cast of characters from the rival training school.

So why we look down on Keijo if it has all of these elements and executes them extremely well?Oh right, the asses. But this is not exactly a parameter to badmouth something, especially when it's exactly a parody sports-esque anime, with a super exciting plot, great soundtrack and breathtaking battles that own nothing to anyone.The animation is great, the ascension story to master a technique, the exciting battles, it's everything a regular shounen anime should have and...they're executing it flawlessly.The ecchi is a little over the top, but why bother if everything else is so great?Don't be a prude, embrace a good booty and give Keijo a shot! they're executing it flawlessly.The ecchi is a little over the top, but why bother if everything else is so great?Don't be a prude, embrace a good booty and give Keijo a shot!"", ""Story wasn't very good or had much depth but I don't think the show aims at that. The whole sport of Keijo is cool, the rules are quite simple to understand and sounds like an sport that could actually work in real life. This is one of those animes based on tournaments and fights rather than developing any real story. We have the main character, no one notices her and everyone is looking at the cool and popular characters, but the mc is extremely positive and strong and slowly it becomes the strongest character. This show can be divided in 2, the parts where the...characters compete, and the parts where the characters train to learn new techniques and be stronger for the competition parts. Quite cliché but works well.Art was quite good, fights were very impactful, overall characters were well drawn and the sound effects during the fights were amazing and made everything more epic. The last episode's animation was aful and had so many quality drops, I assume it will get fixed on the blu ray versions. Opening and ending weren't very memorable, watched them once and skipped. OST was kinda generic, nothing memorable from it either but it fitted the scenes well.Characters were plain, but again I don't think the show was trying to make a complex background for each one, the only one that got some backstory was Maya, but wasn't very convincing, it looked more like a resource to make the main character look good helping her with her traumas, rather than trying to give any depth to the character (which considering finding images of her on Google thrown almost no results, shows it will probably be gone on the following chapters of the manga). The main cast of 4 friends were all clichés, we knew nothing about none of them and there wasn't anything unique about them at all. Again, I'm not saying this is required for every single show, but the characters are not the strongest point of this show.Overall it's a good show to watch if you are bored. The fights are well animated and entertaining, the attacks and moves get more and more ridiculous as episodes go by, and characters, although plain, are likeable and well designed. Don't hype this show because this is not the best show of the year, but it is definitively one of the most entertaining and fun to watch. characters compete, and the parts where the characters train to learn new techniques and be stronger for the competition parts.

If you removed the tits-and-ass gimmick and replaced it with any other activity, you would end up with a normal, and very mediocre sports anime.   This is the show\'s big weakness; it would have done well to accept is status as a completely stupid series and went full-on with it and tossed in some unpredictable gags; but no, it had to try and be ""cool"".As a ""serious sports anime"" it fails completely on every aspect :- No real build-up to the battles, so no...drama- No tension since you don\'t care who wins- You can predict the outcome of pretty much every fight- The animation isn\'t very appealing because no matter how fluid it is, swinging your ass around has few aesthetic qualitiesThe characters are incredibly weak, completely one dimensional and serve only as a vessel for their specialized tits-and-ass gimmick.  You won\'t care about or like any of them.  It\'s almost insulting how they try to include some 20 second flashbacks here and there as if to say ""HA! See we DID have backstories!"".  They are every bit as vapid as anything else in the series.Where the show succeeds is its comedic appeal.  The gimmick seems to inherently provide an endless supply of easy but functional gags.  Keijo has its moment of genuine brilliance, especially when it borrows a mechanic from other popular animes and parodies them.  But for the most part you will be laughing in exasperation at just how stupid everything is.  And that, i suppose, is entertainment.Visually, it\'s fan-service galore, as you expect.  But within one episode you will be complete desensitized to it.  It\'s never really erotic, just stupid and over-present.  Overall it has a little bit of value as eye-candy, but generally these girls do nothing for me.The biggest tragedy is that an apparently high quality orchestral soundtrack was wasted on such a mediocre piece.  At least i think it\'s good?  Since most of the time it\'s so quiet you can\'t hear it.  The staff really thinks that characters constantly shit-talking each other on the battlefield is more exciting than dramatic music.  Oh well, i\'m sure they know better than i do.For the most part, watching this was not a COMPLETE waste of time, but i will certainly not be watching any sequels.  I would rather recommend that you watch an excerpt or two of some of the battles and you will have seen everything there is to see without wasting 4 hours. drama- No tension since you don\'t care who wins- You can predict the outcome of pretty much every fight- The animation isn\'t very appealing because no matter how fluid it is, swinging your ass around has few aesthetic qualitiesThe characters are incredibly weak, completely one dimensional and serve only as a vessel for their specialized tits-and-ass gimmick.

Spoilers ahead!)Louis Réard is credited as the inventor of one of man’s greatest creations: the bikini.He apparently based the name for his unconventional clothing on the Bikini Atoll where nuclear testing occurred. And, when you think about it more closely, the dude’s a genius. He essentially invented public lingerie for women. They are less see-through and laced than their undergarment girlfriends, but they serve the same function of hoisting chests and concealing groins in a sexy manner.The bikini also serves another purpose: to give onlookers a wonderful view of the behind. Looking at butts is no...doubt swell, but Keijo!!!!!!!! (that’s eight exclamation points for those counting at home) proves that they can be used for more than just sitting and pleasure.STORYKeijo (dropping those exclamation points for the time being) stars Nozomi Kaminashi, a young woman hoping to make it big in the brand-new sport that has got everybody talking: keijo. Using her butt, boobs, and body, Nozomi, along with her best friend Sayaka Miyata and many other keijo-women-in-training, does what she can to make her dreams of wealth and fame become reality.Most people, before they begin the show, ask a fair question: “What the heck is keijo?” To answer this question, it’s best to look at another franchise that does something similar: the Dead or Alive video-game series. More specifically, Dead or Alive: Xtreme Beach Volleyball features a mini-game titled “Butt Battle.” In short, two women fight to push each other off their platform with nothing besides their backsides.In Keijo, take this concept and turn the dial up to eleven.Multiple competitors battle simultaneously. That platform morphs its properties and topographies. Boobs are added to each woman’s arsenal. Infighters, outfighters, and counters denote different fighting styles. Wealth, fame, and glory await those skilled and driven enough. The rules of keijo remain about the same – only feet can touch the ground, falling into the water indicates a loss – but to deem keijo as merely a “butt battle” doesn’t do the sport any justice.But these traits only get that dial to ten at most. To crank it beyond the limit, Keijo likewise breaks its own limits, bending reality and believability with the introduction of a key component: power moves.Every character has a signature ability or set of abilities that both defines them as a person and elevates keijo past just a bunch of women shifting their backsides at one another. Sayaka perfected her “W-Acceleration,” boosting her speed to immeasurable levels to cut through space-time without a second thought. Hanabi owns the “Butt Guillotine,” slamming her derriere from above with enough force to decapitate any unfortunate soul who meets her cheeks. And Nozomi, the main protagonist, obviously uses the strongest technique of them all, the “Vacuum Butt Cannon,” a rotating, whirling mass of energy that insanely endangers the user yet decimates any foes (and clothes) in its path.Altogether, from the rules to the structure to the powers, it all sounds silly, right?That’s because it is.What Keijo does well is taking this silliness and playing it straight. Beyond straight, what with its monologues on fighting to reach the top, the overly detailed explanations, and the seriousness in their approach to strategy. So straight in fact that, despite the stupidity of the sport, the anime likens itself to others in its given genres. The battles become intense bouts where special abilities collide, winning is the ultimate prize, and friendship among rivals remains as steadfast as ever. Just with less shots on net and more butts per shake.So, yes, Kazane using her “Gate of Bootylon”, a fatefully reminiscent and entirely absurd hidden power, atop interconnected floating planes is as ridiculous as it reads. But when Kazane doesn’t want to let down her teammates after all their support, and the prospect of becoming champions is on the line, her subsequent “Boob Dunk” against the opponent’s “Left Perky Pile Piper” turns this scene into a dramatic and important ordeal.With butts and boobs driving the narrative, the other sexual acts don’t feel out of place. Sayaka feeling up Nozomi’s buttocks is her physically detecting the progress she has made. And the figure-eight hip rotations the women perform are simply one piece to their training regimen. Ecchi content of this kind feels like a natural extension of the show itself, leading to lewd situations that make a surprising amount of sense in context (and more than arousing in perspective).That’s not to say the anime doesn’t include some extra ecchi events as appetizers and side dishes. Because it totally does. Kusukai feels up Nozomi on more than one occasion for the fun of it, and Sayaka standing in front of the mirror, playfully saying “Bounce, bounce!”, only exists to give her more sexy screen time (which should never be argued against).Similar thoughts can be said for the keijo bouts as well. For, no matter how dire the plot gets, it’s still hard to not laugh at the flying butts and the the silly names for the power moves. For example, the Suraga twins cause Murata to sing a butt-inspired variation of “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” after their “Assteroid Afterglow” distracts her.Even so, Keijo’s ability to deliver a “serious” narrative, built on a foundation formed from a ridiculous premise and booty for days, gets taken seriously. A feat in and of itself. One could even claim that the anime (and thus the mind behind the show) has some subtle commentary on what it believes is the best feature of the female body: nipples. After all, the three races in the East-West War were each decided by neither butts nor boobs but nipples.To be fair, the ending is a bit strange, how they all pretty much go their separate ways (save for Sayaka and Nozomi) as they crawl into the big leagues. Also, no deeper themes beyond the typical perseverance and sportsmanship ones are explored. And, truth be told, the novelty of the whole premise has waned after twelve episodes.Still, Nozomi says it best after her win in the East-West War. In some nice full-circle writing on the anime’s part, Nozomi drifts slowly deeper into the water, echoing the same words that shortly followed her first lost and that started this whole tale: “Keijo is amazin’!”And nobody else can phrase it better than that.ANIMATIONIn an ecchi anime like Keijo, it’s important to have attractive character designs and arousing moments. For the most part, the anime delivers the milk and the meat.Looking at the designs of the characters first, they don’t all have the same level of nuance, but many achieve that needed attractiveness. Varied hairdos and colors, different sizes for their assets, and hot bathing suits of the bikini and one-piece variety.Nozomi’s design is particularly interesting thanks to its parallels with her character. She has the Goldilocks physique – a bust and backside that are not overly big or unduly small but oh so right – that goes along with her main-protagonist status while her double ahoge atop her head indicates doubly her overall silliness.Unfortunately, the anime doesn’t have the most impressive visuals around. That’s because the setting itself doesn’t change too much, and a structure floating on some water is not exactly exciting. Plus, the actual animation worsens over time. It’s pretty fluid near the beginning of the season, but, by the end, it’s clear that the resources behind the scenes have dwindled. There’s even a moment in episode ten when Sanae’s mouth movements blatantly fail to synchronize with her voice.It also doesn’t help that the characters stand around a lot when not battling, explaining everything that is currently unfolding for the audience.Even so, the anime puts effort elsewhere to make up for the stale setting and the lacking movement. For instance, Keijo almost always goes overboard with the delivery of its power moves. Imaginative scenes often play out, huge words and letters dominate the screen, and a flurry of swinging hips and flashing colors further the pizzazz. The anime also includes, on occasion, a comedic style for the reactions and the moments that are clearly meant for laughter.Most importantly, Keijo emphasizes the women and their bodies. Frontal shots of their chests, low shots of their butts, and full profiles provide both sides of the goodness, giving the audience that arousal they have been looking for.CHARACTERSKeijo fills its space with as many butts and boobs as possible.No one’s assets are more important than those of Nozomi, the main protagonist. Nozomi loves keijo and money. Thus, to her, pursuing the top spot and becoming the so-called “prize queen” of the sport makes almost too much sense.From the very first episode, it’s clear that Nozomi has a lot of strength, a lot of passion, and a lot of heart. Her flips and momentum give her a spinning edge that, while not yet refined, proves her worth on the “battlefield.” Then, despite losing out on one of the coveted spots in the Elite Class, she reaffirms why she fell in love with keijo, experiencing the strength of other fellow fighters. And, all the while, her happy-go-lucky, energetic, and affable personality keeps her spirits high and attracts the friendship of those around her.After her, Sayaka, Kazane, and Non become a solid team and even better friends, Nozomi accidentally uses the monstrous “Vacuum Butt Cannon,” a move so powerful that it could potentially injure the user permanently. Wanting to harness this power to reach her goal, Nozomi wears a UTM – a rubberized suit that constricts the body – for a month straight, training her muscles and hips to handle the power of that move.She succeeds in using her newfound power against Kotone, the wielder of Cerberus. And, alongside her closest friends, she moves into the Elite Class. During their training camp, though, her instructor, a pro keijo player named Shirayuki, tells Nozomi that she has a weakness that she must correct if she ever wishes to fight professionally atop the land.One thousand turnips later, Nozomi controls the inertia of her hip swings, giving her thicker butt the “Butt Flash” into “Meteor Hip” combo and demonstrating once more the dedication she has towards honing her body and her craft. The culmination of her season-long efforts showcases itself in the final round of the East-West War. Marking her first spot in the history books, Nozomi defeats Maya and with her the unstoppable East. Nozomi not only claims the championship for her school but also proves to everyone that the pro scene is about to be shaken up by one of the best players of all time to grace its ranks.Nozomi’s climb is filled with tough obstacles and important self-realizations. She trains harder than anyone on her quest to be the best, and she proves that she is time and again. When taking a step back, though, her character arc cannot exactly be classified as exciting. She isn’t a woman with a personal conflict she must overcome, and she doesn’t start her journey from the absolute bottom. I.e., Nozomi is nice and dedicated but not much else.Yet she is, for she brings something vastly worthwhile: positivity.She’s obviously a positive person in nature with her happy smiles and general kindness. But such positivity goes further. Her lighthearted behavior alleviates the seriousness of keijo, letting others understand that the sport is as much about having fun as it is about winning. Her friendliness not only brings her closer with her “rivals” like Kotone and Usagi but also forms a tighter bond among the entire class. And her drive keeps the spirt of the sport alive, heralding in a new chapter in the world of butts and boobs and battles.In all, Nozomi is far from a well-written character, but her ability to embody what keijo is all about more than makes her fit as the star of this show.Similar thoughts can be applied to a couple of the other cast members. That is, they aren’t the epitome of writing thanks to Keijo injecting backstory only when it is necessary, but they bring their own flavor nonetheless.Sayaka abandons judo despite her father’s wishes. Her time with keijo gains her newfound friends and greater strength as she pursues her dream of stardom. And, in the end, her father comes to support his daughter. Sayaka represents the idea that choosing one’s own path in life is vital for leading a happy life.Maya never had anyone rely on her or look her way until she met her instructor. From then on, she refused to back down no matter what. Nozomi forces Maya’s second personality, Kaya, to emerge to protect herself from the pain of loss. Through Nozomi’s few choice words, though, Maya comes back to properly finish her duel. Maya represents the idea that losing isn’t the be all, end all that life may make it out to be.These characters and even the ones that don’t receive a whole ton of attention also arguably have their most important trait: the power moves. Once again, for many of the women, the parallels between their powers and their personalities indicates thoughtful construction.Non gives the gift of comedic relief with her clumsiness and falls (that “don’t really happen”). But, in keijo, her soft, pillowy bum acts as the ultimate supporting tool, defending those in need of assistance.Kusakai is obsessed with cute girls, and Hanabi is head over heels for hot guys. When they fight, though, Kusakai’s manipulative nature unfurls, and Hanabi’s killer instinct takes over, making themselves out to be anything but attractive.Keijo does make hefty mistakes despite the representations and parallels it develops. Shirayuki, the “Missile Lady of Kyoto,” gets forgotten about after their training camp. The villains in East-West War don’t have enough build-up to make them feel like worthy opponents. And Non arguably doesn’t get enough time or attention, considering her main-character status and her spot as one of the four friends in Nozomi’s group.The biggest oddity, though, is Kazane. She majorly loses not once but twice during the season. In both cases, the anime chalks it up to near misses – Kusukai is forced to use a forbidden move, and Sanae barely touched the water last. It wouldn’t be a problem except for the fact that the anime ends before she has a chance to officially win. Her losses without a follow-up win go against Keijo’s own mantras. How hard work and dedication eventually pay off in the long run. Apparently, not so for Kazane.However, Nozomi’s positive purpose and the show taking the time to establish other characters and connections keeps the cast from at least falling over.SOUNDKeijo, perhaps surprisingly, backs its scenes most often with strong orchestral scores. They not only up the seriousness of the anime but also provide those feelings of triumph and thrill that support both the sport and the entertainment.The show also doesn’t let up on its flurry of sound-effects. The butts and the boobs do smack into one another. But the explosions, drills, cartwheels, drops, and teleportations. All sounds with obscene weight that fit the over-the-top the premise and are perfectly at home amidst the ultra-powerful and super-serious abilities.Listening to the show’s opening track, it achieves the same fun and seriousness that defines the content it precedes. The on-beat referee whistle and the back-and-forth “Hey!” cheers in the background invite playfulness, and the scary, deliberate drop near the halfway mark spells out the fact that keijo isn’t always for laughs. The OP even has a catchy beat, vocal harmonies, a fuller second half, and a lyrically cute start and finish. It’s one butt that should be touched.The ending track, titled “Fantas/HIP Girlfriends,” goes all lighthearted, almost slice-of-life in its presentation. Techno beats and sounds create the foundation, the women (formerly) of room 309 all sing together, and the first half offers three-step lyrics that are simple yet fun. Not a stellar ED by any means, but it’s still worth a listen.And while the cast of Keijo is as large as the butts therein, not many notable voice-acting performances are provided. However, Lynn as Nozomi uses a dialect that adds charm to her character and thus ups her aura of positivity.ENJOYMENTIn the Great Debate of Butts Versus Boobs, I argue in favor of the buttocks.Yes, I am what society colloquially refers to as an “ass-man.”As such, the beautiful butts brought to this bountiful buffet were bootylicious. Never had I seen an anime place so much emphasis, so much importance on the round, plump backsides before me. The small waists. The big hips. The glorious thiccness. I was enraptured by these butts (to say the least).My top three butts were easy to choose (and they go in this order): Sayaka, Nozomi, and Shirayuki. Simply put, I couldn’t get enough of them.(Also, Sayaka’s maybe-possibly-implied yuri feelings for Nozomi were more than welcome.)That’s all the anime needed personally in my eyes, but it also delivered something crazy yet truly fun. All the power moves were hilarious and cool. The comedy was lighthearted and well-timed. The battles were intense and silly.As I wrote way earlier, the writing in the anime is not complex let alone thorough. In fact, it barely passes the competent line. But, to me, that doesn’t matter here. Instead, what this anime did was remind me how a show doesn’t always need amazing characters, dramatic plotlines, or profound themes to be worthwhile. With its premise, its comedy, and of course its butts, the anime was extremely entertaining, and that’s all it really had to be.Sadly, the anime will probably never see a continuation given how its source material met a premature end. Nevertheless, I walk away from this anime feeling more than content and wholly satisfied – and with a renewed vigor for the butts I love so much.Keijo!!!!!!!! is even wackier in anime form than it is on paper, but that leads it towards ever higher praise. The ridiculous sport played straight, the attractive designs, the positivity of Nozomi’s character, the orchestral score, and the massive amount of massive booty create something that deserves to be ogled just as much as any nuclear bikini.SUMMARYStory: Good, a wacky premise played straight makes the narrative as intense as any hockey gameAnimation: Fine, while the setting is visually uninteresting, and the characters stand around a lot, attractive designs, flashy power moves, comedic styling, and emphasis on the assets showcase thrills and arousalCharacters: Fine, Nozomi’s positivity encompasses the spirit of keijo, the other cast members highlight motivational mottos and parallel powers, but Kazane’s arc is treated rather poorlySound: Good, good OP, okay ED, good OST, okay VA performances, and nice sound effectsEnjoyment: Great, butts are better than boobsFinal Score: 7/10 doubt swell, but Keijo!!!!!!!! (that’s eight exclamation points for those counting at home) proves that they can be used for more than just sitting and pleasure.STORYKeijo (dropping those exclamation points for the time being) stars Nozomi Kaminashi, a young woman hoping to make it big in the brand-new sport that has got everybody talking: keijo.

When they fight, though, Kusakai’s manipulative nature unfurls, and Hanabi’s killer instinct takes over, making themselves out to be anything but attractive.Keijo does make hefty mistakes despite the representations and parallels it develops. Shirayuki, the “Missile Lady of Kyoto,” gets forgotten about after their training camp. The villains in East-West War don’t have enough build-up to make them feel like worthy opponents. And Non arguably doesn’t get enough time or attention, considering her main-character status and her spot as one of the four friends in Nozomi’s group.The biggest oddity, though, is Kazane. She majorly loses not once but twice during the season. In both cases, the anime chalks it up to near misses – Kusukai is forced to use a forbidden move, and Sanae barely touched the water last. It wouldn’t be a problem except for the fact that the anime ends before she has a chance to officially win. Her losses without a follow-up win go against Keijo’s own mantras. How hard work and dedication eventually pay off in the long run. Apparently, not so for Kazane.However, Nozomi’s positive purpose and the show taking the time to establish other characters and connections keeps the cast from at least falling over.SOUNDKeijo, perhaps surprisingly, backs its scenes most often with strong orchestral scores. They not only up the seriousness of the anime but also provide those feelings of triumph and thrill that support both the sport and the entertainment.The show also doesn’t let up on its flurry of sound-effects. The butts and the boobs do smack into one another. But the explosions, drills, cartwheels, drops, and teleportations. All sounds with obscene weight that fit the over-the-top the premise and are perfectly at home amidst the ultra-powerful and super-serious abilities.Listening to the show’s opening track, it achieves the same fun and seriousness that defines the content it precedes. The on-beat referee whistle and the back-and-forth “Hey!” cheers in the background invite playfulness, and the scary, deliberate drop near the halfway mark spells out the fact that keijo isn’t always for laughs. The OP even has a catchy beat, vocal harmonies, a fuller second half, and a lyrically cute start and finish. It’s one butt that should be touched.The ending track, titled “Fantas/HIP Girlfriends,” goes all lighthearted, almost slice-of-life in its presentation. Techno beats and sounds create the foundation, the women (formerly) of room 309 all sing together, and the first half offers three-step lyrics that are simple yet fun. Not a stellar ED by any means, but it’s still worth a listen.And while the cast of Keijo is as large as the butts therein, not many notable voice-acting performances are provided. However, Lynn as Nozomi uses a dialect that adds charm to her character and thus ups her aura of positivity.ENJOYMENTIn the Great Debate of Butts Versus Boobs, I argue in favor of the buttocks.Yes, I am what society colloquially refers to as an “ass-man.”As such, the beautiful butts brought to this bountiful buffet were bootylicious. Never had I seen an anime place so much emphasis, so much importance on the round, plump backsides before me. The small waists. The big hips. The glorious thiccness. I was enraptured by these butts (to say the least).My top three butts were easy to choose (and they go in this order): Sayaka, Nozomi, and Shirayuki. Simply put, I couldn’t get enough of them.(Also, Sayaka’s maybe-possibly-implied yuri feelings for Nozomi were more than welcome.)That’s all the anime needed personally in my eyes, but it also delivered something crazy yet truly fun. All the power moves were hilarious and cool. The comedy was lighthearted and well-timed. The battles were intense and silly.As I wrote way earlier, the writing in the anime is not complex let alone thorough. In fact, it barely passes the competent line. But, to me, that doesn’t matter here. Instead, what this anime did was remind me how a show doesn’t always need amazing characters, dramatic plotlines, or profound themes to be worthwhile. With its premise, its comedy, and of course its butts, the anime was extremely entertaining, and that’s all it really had to be.Sadly, the anime will probably never see a continuation given how its source material met a premature end. Nevertheless, I walk away from this anime feeling more than content and wholly satisfied – and with a renewed vigor for the butts I love so much.Keijo!!!!!!!! is even wackier in anime form than it is on paper, but that leads it towards ever higher praise. The ridiculous sport played straight, the attractive designs, the positivity of Nozomi’s character, the orchestral score, and the massive amount of massive booty create something that deserves to be ogled just as much as any nuclear bikini.SUMMARYStory: Good, a wacky premise played straight makes the narrative as intense as any hockey gameAnimation: Fine, while the setting is visually uninteresting, and the characters stand around a lot, attractive designs, flashy power moves, comedic styling, and emphasis on the assets showcase thrills and arousalCharacters: Fine, Nozomi’s positivity encompasses the spirit of keijo, the other cast members highlight motivational mottos and parallel powers, but Kazane’s arc is treated rather poorlySound: Good, good OP, okay ED, good OST, okay VA performances, and nice sound effectsEnjoyment: Great, butts are better than boobsFinal Score: 7/10', ""(Some spoilers, but eh, it is Keijo!!!!!!!!) I'm not what most of the reviewers seem to think the target audience is for this show; as a straight woman. HOWEVER, This is one of the most entertaining anime's I've seen this year. It is just so ridiculous and self-aware that I can't help but be entertained.The Keijo matches are very reminiscent of a big DBZ fight and are filled with every shonen trope under the sun, with Fate/stay and hunter x hunter references among others. Think of two glowing butts colliding and seeing which wins out, among some transformation sequences and other neat tricks (wedgies...make you go faster!) The fact that they're using their breasts and butts to do so just adds to the hilarity.I'm not really sure what to say about the accusations of no character development? I've seen plenty. I guess if you've only seen a few episode it might seem like the case, but they have to portray their characters first before the development can get started. Some **spoiler** examples: Nozomi finds a motivation for Keijo besides money, Sayaka learns the value of her friendship with Nozomi and copes with the judgment of her father for abandoning Judo, and Kazane overcomes her shyness,While the anime absolutely spends some time catering to the male gaze, the lack of any major male characters in the show really makes it easier for me to appreciate. They aren't all outshined by the generic male main character or trying to win over his approval/affection, which is refreshing in its own way. And I really appreciated that a show in which will attract a predominately straight male audience by its premise alone made its viewers watch two guys kiss (they know what they're doing).I encourage those who are unsure about watching Keijo to simply approach it with a sense of humor and an eye for references. Put is simply, Keijo!!!!!!!! is The Colbert Report of anime. make you go faster!)

Were you expecting some kind of third rate show? Perhaps something poorly animated? Or something that's outright crude? Well, surprise!Homing butt missiles, speed boosting wedgies, Unlimited Butt Works, and asses made hard like steel!Keijo!! plays less like a sports anime and more like a traditional battle shounen... only with butts being the weapon of choice, of course. A spunky main protagonist with promising talent is dead set on being the best of the best. They enter some sort of training ground and are swiftly enough dealt with by a stronger opponent that remind them where their place lies. Instead of being disheartened by...defeat, they get back up and train harder for the next encounter. They then continue pushing themselves to their limits and prepare themselves for the upcoming presumed tournament. A straight forward and simple setup, just like what you've seen before from the genre (tropes included). But what makes Keijo!! notable and quite sharply separates it from the rest of the usual schlock, is not necessarily what it does well, butt simply what it doesn't do wrong.There is no bait and switch tactic, no grandiose pretentious speeches to mask the lack of a substantive narrative, no infantilizing melodrama, ect. Certainly, the otherwise eye-rolling yet attention grabbing premise has the more cartoony aspect of it put to full use and steadily ramps up it's absurdity with each episode. All, surprisingly enough, with good pacing and a lack of streamlining of it's ideas. It does away with all the unnecessary contrivances precisely by sticking to a simple plot structure and thus creating a strong foundation. And while it pulls it's absurdity with a straight face, Keijo!! as a whole is not at all serious. Much like it's characters, it strays away from being mean in spirit. After the battles the characters all prove themselves to be amiable, always coming back to show their enjoyment of the sport. Along with it's outlandish butt and breast slapping glory, it is also splurged with ridiculous but totally engaging dialog. It maintains a consistent level of quality uncommon in shows within it's own genre. Plenty of episodes end on a perfect note, too, sincerely keeping you craving for more. This is indeed something even your average anime routinely fails to achieve. That aside, there a few dips in the quality of the animation itself, and the characters are largely animated with thin to thick sketchy outlines. Obviously, the limits of it's budget are in display, butt it more than makes up for it with the occasional savory anatomical precision of the gluteus maximus!Speaking of which, quite contrary to expectations, should you be an ecchi enthusiast, you might actually be disappointed to know that Keijo!! does not offer the kind of service you've become accustomed to.  It's fanservice is still ubiquitous, but quite tame especially when compared to it's lewder counterparts. In fact, it seems like the kind of show that should've aired at least half a decade ago. And even back then we had shows like Queen's Blade, Panty & Stocking with Garter-belt, as well as another show by the same studio like To Love-Ru, ect. All of which are raunchy-er than keijo!!! by several magnitudes.But Keijo!! doesn't care to fulfill your gratuitous-nipple quota, it launches it's menacing butts in your general direction with the sole intention to obliterate everything in it's path! Keijo!! is not fool's gold, it is a shining example of how ecchi should be done. If more ecchi followed Keijo!!'s example, perhaps the genre as a whole would at least receive less negative reception and not be treated with little more than passing apathy. You don't have to be an ecchi fan to submerge yourself in Keijo!!, it should prove itself to be a refreshing endeavor with the usual elements working harmoniously for once.It might just be an ever so small gem, but it is to be cherished.

The important distinction here being, of course, that it’s not a worthless harem and while the show is clearly fanservicey, it has a clear purpose in the rather, um, spectacular showings (including some pretty sweet action scenes) going on.That paragraph alone tells you whether you will or will not enjoy Keijo, which (suffice to say) is completely reliant on your...ability to suspend your disbelief enough to accept the, uh, internal logic of the show as well as the absolutely absurd premise and battles.The story works out fairly simply, with the various leads enrolling in a school/training facility to learn how to master the, ehem, sport in question and become professionals. There is nothing particularly striking or different about it once the battles subside; the show is fairly generic in its quiet moments and while that isn’t a bad thing, the action scenes are clearly the highlight of the show.Speaking of the action scenes, they’re an incredible amount of fun, extremely well choreographed (in more ways than one) and never felt anticlimactic or dull. The strategies are completely ridiculous, ranging from making a butt look like boobs to calling a butt Cerberus to literally parodying the ever so infamous gate of Babylon move to whip out infinite butts (a personal favorite). While the action scenes never look bad, there is a very noticeable drop in animation quality as the show goes on, and it clearly shows in the last few episodes, where it’s clear that the studio was saving budget for a spectacular final showing.The animation quality looks decent but nothing spectacular, only looking straight up great during the action scenes, where there is a lot of fluent movement and really nice looking CGI effects. The artwork looks distinct and nice, but is also nothing to write home about.Characters are generally likeable but very basic, which while isn’t a bad thing doesn’t leave much room for them to develop (which isn’t the purpose of the show, sure, but a review is a review). Their interactions are loads of fun and even had me chuckling from time to time, but mostly when about the absurd setting and not when they’re interacting with each other as characters.All in all, Keijo isn’t a show for everyone; those who do find the premise “interesting” will find an incredibly fun show and solid timewaster, while those who are unable to suspend their disbelief will not enjoy it.

This may sound strange, considering that the general consensus amongst heavy consumers of the medium is that most modern anime is rife with trite, overused tropes and overused storylines. Carbon copies of previous successes, duplicates of tried and tested formulas that end up feeling vapid, lifeless, and downright boring.But I insist, the anime medium is special and unique, and full of so many original ideas that have inspired a variety of award-winning, blockbuster hits in the west. From Satoshi Kon inspiring...the likes of Inception, to Mamoru Oshii inspiring the likes of the Matrix, regardless of the state of anime today, it’s undeniable that the medium is capable of ideas that may never be conceived in the west.And Keijo is one such idea.Honest with its absurdity and rife with boob and booty shots, Keijo is very entertaining. Despite what its Twitter page would like to persuade you to believe (>Keijo is a serious sports drama) the show’s first and foremost priority is nothing other than to entertain you. If you find the show boring then that’s fine, but it’s unfair to criticize the show for lacking ‘depth of character’ or impacting the ‘history of the medium’ when the show is not trying to do either of those things. I’m writing this seemingly conclusive denouement at the beginning of my review because Keijo’s honest simplicity makes it nonsensical to criticize the show for anything other than whether or not it was entertaining. If you found it entertaining, then the show did it’s job and nothing I or anyone writes in a review can change that.The same way Food Wars is practically One Piece disguised as cooking show, Keijo is also a battle shounen disguised as a… well, Keijo show. As Food Wars tends to abandon all logic as often as it wants, Keijo does the same (as if it’s premise is not illogical enough). Vacuum Butt Cannons, titty hypnosis, asses harder than steel, booby lasers, butt stands, whatever you can imagine this show will match that. It’s absolutely ridiculous. It’s utterly perverted. It’s also a ton of fun, and really, that is all that can be asked and expected from this show. As long as it delivers that much, then what’s the harm?The characters are as trite as they can get, but honestly what else would you expect? Color-coded archetypes peppered in at every corner of the show never challenge your expectations. A black-haired, outgoing and air-headed female protagonist; a white-haired, calm, collected and cool-headed supporting character; a brown-haired, talented but awfully conservative country girl; a blonde-haired, big-breasted overtly sexual upper echelon of the Keijo school… and so on so forth. The writers are incredibly transparent with their intentions and often shy away from offering you a character arc that shows any semblance of heart.Referring back to what their Twitter page would like you to believe (>Keijo is a serious sports drama), the drama aspect of the show is laughable, and should never once be taken seriously. As soon as you do so, you’ll lose out on enjoying the show. The drama facet of the story is shoehorned into the narrative in order to haphazardly construct a meaningful conflict, but you’ll be naive to buy into it and take it as seriously as the show wants you to.Since the show is already securing itself as the best fully-fledged out purely fan-service title, why not take the time parody other titles too? Attack on Buttitans, Gilgamesh’s Gate of Bootylon, Keijo leaves no show untouched and it’s hilarious! Drawing on meta-humour like that and parodying some of the most popular franchises in the medium only further drives home how entertaining Keijo is.The animation is rather memorable, I especially love the color palette as I find it quite appealing. The drawing of the cast’s booties and bosoms is also rather accurate, sans the occasional chest monstrosity present of course. A lot of thought was put into the sound design as well, when boobs cut the air and butts collide, the sounds are impactful, and do a great job of conveying the true, earth-shattering force in which their pudenda metaphorically cross. As far as the audiovisual experience goes, I didn’t notice any glaring problems and found it to be a smooth visual experience.All that really matters when watching Keijo is whether or not you enjoy yourself. Did you smile a bit? Did you get playfully aroused? Did it eventually force a chuckle out of you? Answered yes to any of these? Then the show is more than fine. I certainly wouldn’t recommend this to anyone excessively conservative and nor would I recommend this to anyone with negative preconceived notions of the anime medium, but to a field-tested, seasoned anime veteran who’s simply looking to enjoy their anime consumption, then Keijo couldn’t be more of a first choice.I hope this review was informative and helpful. the likes of Inception, to Mamoru Oshii inspiring the likes of the Matrix, regardless of the state of anime today, it’s undeniable that the medium is capable of ideas that may never be conceived in the west.And Keijo is one such idea.Honest with its absurdity and rife with boob and booty shots, Keijo is very entertaining.

You know the plot already, it's booby butt cheek combat. 10 out of 10 concept, but while watching I was drawn in by not only the anatomy aspect, they were well choreographed fights with different abilities that were interesting beyond the superficial sex appeal one would expect this show to be.It's a real shame poor management of the IP resulted in an early cancellation of the manga, hence the abrupt ending, I was indeered to these fights and these fighters and the competition its self. they earned my respect, and of course my erection. "", 'Navigating through any social media outlets during this anime season, you’d be hard-pressed to not find any gifs or screen-caps of anime girls in swimsuits strutting their stuff. No, everyone didn’t suddenly become obsessed with ecchi overnight. It turns out, girls clashing their booties and boobies makes for an explosively exciting sport. And this is exactly what Keijo!!!!!!!! is all about.Keijo is a professional sport where girls compete on a ring floating over water to push their opponent off with nothing but their butts or boobs. The competition is intense. For 18-year old Nozomi Kaminashi, she wants nothing more than to be the prize queen...of Keijo — a prestigious position of vast fortune and fame granted to only the very best player in the world.  Nozomi is hoping to use this wealth to help her struggling family out of poverty.Let’s be honest here. I don’t think anyone goes into Keijo expecting to be knee-deep (or ass-deep for my fellow pun lovers) in a thought-provoking narrative. What you see is what you get; fierce battles with over-the-top signature moves, an ambitiously overeager protagonist aiming for the stars, and ridiculously humorous training arcs all guised under butt-loads of fan-service. In that regard, it’s not for everyone. But if you can get past the fan-service, what you’ll find is an immensely entertaining and creative series that will have you rolling for hours. Seriously, you have a girl whose special ability entails hypnotizing you with their boobs to render their opponent useless. Or an ass vacuum that can rips a person (or their clothes, more likely) asunder with violent winds. Or even a wedgie that, the deeper it rides, the closer to the speed of light a person achieves. These outrageously random abilities make it so you have absolutely no idea what’s coming next. One thing is for sure, the writer for Keijo stretches the abilities of this show to the absolute limit.Even while Keijo is a satirical piece, there are still elements of the series that will take you pleasantly by surprise. For as prototypical as the cast seems, Nozomi and her friends are all fun characters. Throughout the course of the show, they show an immense amount of growth as they foster teamwork and and tackle personal issues to overcome their problems. Are you ever really surprised by the results of their matches? Not necessarily, but the series isn’t about that. It’s about the journey of this group of friends and the hilarious happenings along the way. Keijo is just the vehicle that drives it home. It helps that Nozomi is a surprisingly likable protagonist, as one cannot help but be sucked in by her drive to be the best and the compassion she has for the friends surrounding her.I think it’s also worth mentioning that the art in Keijo is nothing to sneeze at. While the character designs are very simple, the animation is rather fluid. The art style itself is nice to look at, incorporating thick bold lines to make the characters pop in a way that is arguably similar to that of Needless, except without the sharp angles. These bold lines come together with dynamic angles and speed lines to make battles explosive.  It almost feels like you’re playing Street Fighter when a signature move is freeze-framed with overlaying text.As a small aside, the bulletin boards used during battles remind me of those used in earlier Pokemon series, when Ashe visits the elite four.Overall, Keijo was surprisingly enjoyable. Is this series for everyone? No, absolutely not. But those who can see past the tropes and fan service will find a terribly entertaining show that’ll have you laughing until it hurts. What helps make Keijo stands out is that it doesn’t take itself too seriously and that’s precisely what makes it so darn funny. You have characters pulling off all these crazy antics that are so hard to believe and yet, they’re dead serious about their goals and aspirations. For a brief moment, it’s even possible to forget you’re watching a sport about butts and boobs. Well, at least until you see a girl use her hardened nipple to throw her opponent overhead. Then it becomes obvious that this series is a satire on Shounen through and through. Anyway, If you’re looking for something more along those lines this season, then perhaps a slower show such as March Comes in like a Lion or a light-hearted piece like Yuri!! on Ice is more up your alley.-- Palpable =DFor more reviews like this, you can visit my blog at palpableemotion.wordpress.com of Keijo — a prestigious position of vast fortune and fame granted to only the very best player in the world.

I am too choked up to say anything about this eromanga, so let's getting get this thing rolling by stating the obvious: the manga and 12-episode anime are pure, unapologetic fanservice done for the sake of fanservice, not for tying up some loose ends due to shit animation or manga chapter quality, albeit the art certainly won't win any awards. Also, this manga is a borderline hentai and is so wonderfully absurd that they even introduced a school, most notably shown in the anime, to study the art of unlocking your ten-assity in order to enter the pro scene. Briefly speaking of the anime,...through the course of its 12-episode run, I was stewing on how asinine it was; however, I quickly admitted to myself that that was my guilty pleasure of 2016. Shifting gears to the manga, I had a different experience with it entirely. I am fully aware that the mangaka faced some backlash from Shogakugan when he was asked to wind down the manga even as the anime aired and subsequently got his manga cancelled in the March-April 2017 time frame. Regardless of the circumstances, I see no reason for the mangaka to have rushed so much as to give us nearly cardboard cutouts of characters, like the Gouketsu (i.e. the Five Butts), each given superpowers with a hand wave and no real, relatable backstory. I read up to 156 chapters of the manga translated, but finished it up with the raw manga chapters since no one ever wants to translate as chapters are released and the characters were so shallow and predictable that I could nearly understand all of the dialogue from the visual context alone. After I finished the manga, I was stewing on how utterly insipid the ending was. The manga lacked a satisfactory sense of closure since there weren't any memorable, thoughtful exchanges between relevant characters we got to understand more in depth from earlier story arcs. My main gripe with the manga's ending is that it omits any plot points that show how the Gouketsu had any influence on Nozomi's CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. The anime at least had a development arc for Nozomi's character and how the power of teamwork and friendship influenced her win. This manga should have ended at the point the anime chose to end it; instead, it was dragged out and padded with a lame follow-up plotline that ultimately drove this manga into the ravine of cringeville. I think this mangaka didn't deserve to be treated so unfairly, but the manga getting cancelled was probably for the better, considering it took a crash-and-burn turn to the road to cringeville. I am disappointed as a fan of the anime that this manga having potential as a wonderfully absurd fanservice shanked itself by squandering its one strength: novelty. through the course of its 12-episode run, I was stewing on how asinine it was; however, I quickly admitted to myself that that was my guilty pleasure of 2016.

Yes, that's right, wholesome.What may first come across as a show that is catered to those that like overly ecchi turns out to be an anime that is funny and very shounen. Beneath all of the breast and ass, it is a heartwarming story about a girl trying to achieve the dream of becoming a professional sports player. Reading the description one would assume that the shows only ASSpect is that it is overly sexual to cover up for the lack of story or have likable character but this is not what Keijo is.Keijo is a comedy...that viewers will enjoy greatly for its over the top action that one has to recognize as irony. Yes, the show is in fact aware of how ridiculous it sounds and is able to pull it off surprisingly well. The fanservice never really seems like it is the main focus even with the whole show being about fighting in swimsuits. The anime contains girls having various unique techniques in fighting with their butts and breasts even containing many references to infamous moves in another animes such as the gate of Babylon from Fate.I personally enjoyed this anime greatly and found it to be hilarious that viewers will enjoy greatly for its over the top action that one has to recognize as irony.

But given Keijo!!!!!!!!'s trailer and synopsis, who would expect it to be serious? I believe I can safely assume that anyone who is attracted to this show expects it to be comedy. And yes, it is total comedy with some not so serious moments.Art: meh....not average, but not astounding. No unnecessary fanservice. Heck no fanservice at all, I say, except for that one episode with a 3 second tentacle scene. (Yes, there are boobs and asses, but most of the time the story will take your attention away from it)Character: deeply thought out characters,...but it's not the characters that draw me to the anime. It was the plot and comedy. And Yes, plot not 'Plot'Sound: Good enough I suppose. I watched both dub and sub. They were equally good. However in the dub they rephrase most lines to take out dirty jokes. If you watched the subbed, at one episode you would see the subtitle 'He came.....*not gonna give spoiler*....' The 'came' here given the context was a really dirty and *beep* joke.  (beep cause of spoiler alert)*To all you dub lovers, you don't have to stop your devotion.Enjoyment: 9.

While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!---------Positives---------- Unabashed and Full FrontalIt would be doing a disservice to the show to say that fanservice is ALL it is, as Keijo is so much more. Butt, you can\'t deny that this show...is not afraid to go above and beyond with their ""appreciation of the female form"". Look, Keijo is a show that focuses on boobs and butts. It uses them for comedy, characterization, special moves, you name it. If you can\'t handle that, steer clear. If you think that\'s hilarious/no problem (like myself), jump right in.- Surprisingly Competent ShounenKeijo is billed as a Shounen parody, which is accurate. However, I was extremely surprised to find that it still holds up as a very well made shounen on its own! Yes, there are some obvious parodic moments, butt there are legitimately compelling characters, abilities, and matching visual prowess to make for its own compelling show!- Compelling CharactersIt would be so easy for a show like this to cop out on its character design; Emphasizing bodily traits instead of evolving personalities and nurturing team-oriented relationships. Keijo does not cop out. Characters\' body types are brought up seldomly in conversation, often only used to contribute to that character\'s fighting style and techniques (which is relevant to the story, not the fanservice). I loved the cast of characters completely regardless of how they were portrayed physically, and was completely satisfied with the wide variety of fun, vibrant characters displayed.- Fearlessly Over-The-TopOne of the fun things about Keijo is that it doesn\'t do anything half-assed. Keijo goes full-ass, then charges that ass up to 1000% to unlock their hidden bloodline trait. Everything mentioned above is completely overblown and over the top, without feeling hokey or unnecessary. Whether it be its parody elements, its gratuitous close-ups, or its crazy shounen battle sequences, Keijo holds nothing back and will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions.- Bonus: Appropriate AgesJapan has an obsession with making characters 3-6 years younger than they act or should be. Keijo\'s characters are 17+, and they look and act accordingly. Thank god.---------Negatives---------- Unabashed and Full FrontalYou might have noticed that this is repeated from the ""Positives"" section. I want to preface this negative by saying that I am unashamed of watching over the top fanservice. Sexual humour, and sexuality as a whole (with or without comedic elements/purposes), is no problem for me. With that in mind, Keijo was sometimes a bit... much. There were a few legitimate moments where I felt taken aback at how far the show stretched the line between safe and adult. There are definitely a few scenes and shots that made me completely facepalm, or simply ask myself: ""Am I actually watching porn right now?""- Light on ParodyI might be wrong on this, but I didn\'t actually feel that this show did enough to parody the shounen genre. The fact it centres around bewbies and bewties certainly gives everything a bit of a ""silly"" feel regardless of how hard they try to do serious things, but I didn\'t feel like they were really trying to add other parody elements. There was one excellent bit of parody in the final fights with Rin (no spoilers, of course), but otherwise I find it hard pressed to call this anywhere near to an actual parody. It\'s way, way closer to just a ridiculous shounen, as opposed to a show parodying a genre.----------Conclusion----------Keijo is... complicated. It\'s a really hard show to review because it ultimately hinges on its biggest draw: its bodacious premise. It doesn\'t let up, it doesn\'t give in, and it is not afraid to shove its naughty bits in your face. If you can handle that, then this show is lots of fun! It\'s clever, ridiculous, hilarious, and legitimately well made. Its animation, sound, character design, and story arc are all put together well. I can\'t deny that it was very entertaining to watch, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.At the same time, I also can\'t deny that it is by far the most sexually charged shounen that I\'ve ever watched, and it can be intimidating in its forwardness at times (even for someone like myself who rarely minds that kind of thing). You don\'t have to be a prude to find the stuff that Keijo does off-putting, which makes this an incredibly polarizing show. Many, many people will pass on this show, and many more will drop it. But if you don\'t mind being a little bit of a perv for some good entertainment, then let me be the first to welcome you to pervy heaven. Your room is on the left, leave your shoes at the door. We\'re not animals, after all.------------Final Rating------------While it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: ""Would you recommend I watch this show?"". Specifically, I like to answer that question for both those familiar with the show\'s genre(s), and those new or interested in the genre(s). So,If you can handle gratuitous sexuality as a gateway to great shounen entertainment, you should absolutely watch this show. Leave your shame behind, and enjoy the ridiculousness.

What if we give them a show that\'\'s 100% fan service?I swear that\'s how ""Keijo!!!!!!!!"" was born...Now, don\'t get me wrong, even though that was probably the concept behind this show (and the original manga as well), it pays off. The anime community is used to big boobs, to cleavage shots, to big butts and not only using that experience but taking it to the next level was a very good idea. Because even though it creates a straight forward plot and avoids getting deep into the story, this way of doing stuff makes ""Keijo!!!!!!!!"" a...very enjoyable show to watch.The plot is weak, no doubt about that, and you probably won\'t enjoy this show if you\'re looking for something with a deeper story. Why? Because it\'s just not here. There are plenty of options if you\'re looking for that out there, but this show won\'t quite cut it for you. So why is it entertaining to watch? Because it\'s dumb. The concept, the way the characters deal with the challanges, the way they practice, the way they talk, and even the anime clichés that they implement. All of that makes for a show that lacks a deep plot but still gets a lot of views, simply because it is entertaining. If you take your mind off of your ""This has a deeper meaning, this action will be part of the bigger plot"" mode, you can (and you probably will) enjoy this show a lot, because that\'s the way it was meant to be watched.To me, this show is satire.It makes fun of how sexual anime shows can get and the clichés we as a community keep having to sit through show in show out. Do I mind these clichés? Absolutly not, for the most part. They\'re something that\'s unique to anime and I laugh whenever they show up again (and again, and again...). But I do know they exist, and ""Keijo!!!!!!!!"" takes that knowledge and makes fun of it by exaggerating it to the point of having hardcore anime fans clicking off saying it\'s too much.The key element here is: Fan service can be bad, it can hurt your show and it can get people to click off. But that fan service is the useless kind. It\'s the fan service that producers get into their shows to grab people\'s attention when they feel like the show could use something to grab the viewers other then the plot. But I feel like ""Keijo!!!!!!!!""\'s fan service is part of the satire, and because of that it is very important and absolutely needed. It\'s not too much fan service because, by definition, it\'s not even fan service. It\'s part of the story. The story itself IS fan service, and that\'s not only okay, it\'s amazing.Final thoughts: ""Keijo!!!!!!!!"" isn\'t the next big thing, or the best show in 2016, but I think it\'s a very enjoyable show to watch and I do recommend it if you\'re looking for something light on plot to just enjoy yourself and laugh a little.Story: 6Art: 7Sound: 7Character: 8Enjoyment: 9Overall: 7PS.: What\'s up with the EIGHT exclamation marks? very enjoyable show to watch.The plot is weak, no doubt about that, and you probably won\'t enjoy this show if you\'re looking for something with a deeper story.

The story itself IS fan service, and that\'s not only okay, it\'s amazing.Final thoughts: ""Keijo!!!!!!!!"" isn\'t the next big thing, or the best show in 2016, but I think it\'s a very enjoyable show to watch and I do recommend it if you\'re looking for something light on plot to just enjoy yourself and laugh a little.Story: 6Art: 7Sound: 7Character: 8Enjoyment: 9Overall: 7PS.: What\'s up with the EIGHT exclamation marks?', 'Keijo!!!!!!!! is a sports/fighting anime where girls get ahead using their behinds and knock their opponents around with their knockers.The art is good and generally clean. There are some issues in the later episodes with the animation, but it\'s only noticeable if you pause at certain points. The sound is fine. I can only remember that one sound clip they play at the episode title card; the rest is forgettable.The premise of Keijo!!!!!!!! is something I\'d like to say is stupid and ridiculous, but I love it. The girls must use their boobs and butts to either knock their opponents off their feet or overboard...into the water. As a man who is a fan of boobs and butts, there was no way I could dislike Keijo!!!!!!!! Well, the storyline is actually pretty cliche. We follow the journey of Nozomi through Keijo academy, where she learns to utilize her assets to their full potitial. Wait, I meant potentiass. F***. Anyways, she gets better, learns a signature move a la ""shadow clone jitsu,"" and is determined to be the very best, that no one ever was. The battles themselves are entertaining and creatively done.Ah, the characters of Keijo!!!!!!!! Of course, there\'s the main posse of Nozomi, Miyata, Toyoguchi, and Aoba. Though there are 50 or so students in the class, we only get in-depth background on a handful of them. The rest are defined by a single character trait. For example, Toyoguchi is clumsy, Mio Kusakai loves cute girls, Kotone Fujisaki loves BL, etc. Can\'t say there\'s much depth to most of the characters, but what Keijo!!!!!!!! lacks in quality, it makes up for with quantitty. Heck, we don\'t even learn much about the main girl Nozomi or her background, but we love her anyway. Right?All in all, if you\'re looking for inspiring life lessons, evolving plots, or introspective moments, Keijo!!!!!!!! is NOT for you. If you like cliche sports/fighting animes with training montages, powerful techniques, and cheesy motivational speeches, then Keijo!!!!!!!! is that plus all the boobs and butt you can ever want.Overall, I would rate Keijo!!!!!!!! a 7, but the hilarity and guilty pleasure factors raise it to a solid 8!!!!!!!! into the water.

to see what this anime would do and i was expecting it to be fanservice galore which it was, but it had other surprising thingsThe story concentrates on Nozomi Kaminashi who wants to become the next national champion of Keijo a game where women knock each other around with their breasts and butts.At first the story felt like the usual fanservice stuff that i have seen before, but the more it went on it got more interesting because there is actually more to Keijo than just women hitting each other with their breasts...and butts there's actually a kind of honor if that even is the right for it because these girls do take it very seriously and you actually want to support them throughout the show when their going up against their rivals, I'm also surprised that you could make Breast and butt battle moves sound epic however there were a few that were jokes of other animes.I did enjoy the main group of girls try to become good at Keijo since they started out as the worst because of their lack of teamwork then the more they try the more you want to back them up and want them to succeed.The characters were actually well developed, they can be funny, but serious as well especially when it comes to the keijo matches.Nozomi the MC was very positive, determined and whenever she made a mistake or tried to learn a new move that required a lot of training she never gave up until she had mastered it and she also cared about her friends too making her a very likeable MC.Sayaka who is Nozomi's best friend lacks in the breast department, but makes up for it in the butt area because she is a former Judo athlete and she uses this to her advantage when she fights her opponents, she's also a mixture of a Kuudere and a Tsundere which for her actually mixes well and there are a few moments where she is a pretty funny character.Kazane is the shy one of the group and hardly talks, but is probably at some point the most badass of the girls since her power of sorts is OP, but out of all the girls she is the one who gets the most losses so you feel sorry for her most of the time.Non is a girl from the country and is incredibly, there was a great where she accidentally puts one Sayaka's underwear instead of her own, but her soft backside helps her take any attack from her opponents making her a worthy opponent.There are other side characters and some did actually stand out for me like Mio, Hanabi, Rin and Kotone whose personalities were very fun or scary depending on their mood since these girls are very serious, but they provide a lot of laughs and seemed very well done supporting characters.The Artstyle was ok it was definitely bright at times, but the way the powers were shown in the anime was pretty damn good and looked epic which is surprising since these powers come from the strength of the girls Breasts or Butts.The Sport aspect which is Keijo itself was actually pretty good the matches were very entertaining and when the girls were training there was some pretty fun moments too when they trained with Kyoko Shirayuki who helped Nozomi and the others improve their techniques and fighting style.The teachers were pretty good and the one who stands out is Nagisa who was a former Keijo prize queen who injured herself from a move that Nozomi has learned and she helps her to master the move and use it properly so it doesn't destroy her chances of winning.And of course there is the fanservice now at first for like the first 3 episodes it felt pretty ridiculous, but as the series went on it improved and became less stupid and more enjoyable to watch.So overall this was a surprising anime I thought it was just gonna be pointless fanservice, but there was actually some good character development and was pretty entertaining so if you like women battle with each other using their breasts and butts then you might like this. and butts there's actually a kind of honor if that even is the right for it because these girls do take it very

The whole idea of the female bodypart fighting is absurd and bound to be controversial, therefore this was a difficult task to pull off for the Xebec studio. However, for what this show is, it is done as(s)toundingly well.Story (6/10):Imma be real with you, there isn\'t any. Just a group of girls who want to be involved in the Sport, thus joining an academy to climb the ranks of Keijo and to become the champion like in any other Sport, here referred to the term as the ""Prize Queen"". The...training these girls have to go through is both entertaining and ridiculous to the point of cringe. It\'s just one of those shows which is meant to be taken light-heartedly.Art/Animation (7/10):As a fanservice, thus this means being the most important factor, the studio almost nailed it.Assuming you are more of a magic/fantasy Shounen type of Anime consumer. Butt and Breast fighting seems pretty plain doesn\'t it?The show does a complete 180 and overexaggerates the fighting by adding the flashy effects and some times even references from other Anime appear to make it more appealing to eye, creating this magical feel making it NOT look plain and regular.On the character animation side of things, the girls are all cute possessing great qualities ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)Overall the show had a very bright and clear appeal to it.Sound (7/10):In my opinion, the sound was bomb.In the show, the attacks/moves names were all silly and ridiculous, example?: Vaccuum Butt Cannon. Therefore they had to back it up with something, as they did with animation, they included crazy sounds to hide the plainness, sounds like gun shots, sword sharpening and even explosions.Characters (7/10):Not all characters were incredible, nevertheless, a lot of them are likable and cheerful.This being a fanservice, they also included some lesbianic traits to please the viewers.There was some character development and backstories as to why each girl has a different battling approach to them. Reminding you this was only 12 episodes so neither did the studio have a lot of time. So enjoy the girls\' roundy qualities while you can.Enjoyment (8/10):It was fun while it lasted, the fanservice and the shounen battle approach made it worth it.A nice relaxing show to just turn off your brain and cringe for a while before you go back to the other deep and thought provoking animes.All in all it was so stupid that it actually made it good.Final Score? *drumroll* 8/10Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk. training these girls have to go through is both entertaining and ridiculous to the point of cringe.

The weird thing is that it kind of works.  The structure of the story isn\'t anything you haven\'t heard before but what\'s strange is how aggressively shonen this anime feels.  The special moves, the tournament arc, the main character with a natural affinity for a special forbidden move that could destroy them if they don\'t learn to harness its power properly.  If you ignore the anime butts and pretend they are using fists it\'s the most...standard shonen you could imagine.  Jury is still out on whether or not this is a good thing.Art 7/10:The art style is pretty standard but, as I stated, this is a shonen and part of that is having good fight scenes.  In that regard the fight scene animations are pretty good.  Nothing over the top but they weren\'t lazy in this regard either.Sound 6/10:Fairly average, not a whole lot to say about this one.Character 7/10:Fairly average diverse cast of different cute anime girls who you and your friends can debate that timeless question ""who is best girl"" with.  I will say that they aren\'t boring characters, just typical.  They are interesting enough.Enjoyment 9/10:If you are looking for a series anime with a plot or some sort of deep philosophy to push you will not enjoy this.  If you can shut your brain off for a a little bit and just enjoy the spectacle that this is I think you will be very surprised with the quality that is brought overall to this show.Overall 7/10:This is something that I like to call ""popcorn anime,"" not particularly filling but still good.

It's obviously full of fan service, which I'm usually not terribly fond of, but if you can get past that you'll find a legitimately hilarious sports anime that has some surprisingly heartwarming moments. Plus there's like, ass cannons which is hilarious.Honestly I would probably recommend this to most people. Just remember to keep your tongue squarely in your cheek. This is obviously not meant to be taken seriously, so make sure you've got a hearty sense of humor when you watch this.Overall, really cute so far. Mind you, I've only watched the first few episodes. "", 'This anime was a surprise, a good one.After I read the synopsis and saw some footage I thought to myself: ""Another series with High School DxD / Infinite Startos type of ecchi is being aired... BORING!!..."" and boy was I wrong.  I think the only reason Keijo was listed as ecchi is because girls fight with their ""natural weapons"" (boobs and booty), they don\'t even show nipples, not to mention almost sex scenes (you know what I mean), this reason raised my overall rating  of the anime.Now, the story was a pretty average one, a cliche, that\'s why I rated it with...(6). An average girl want\'s to become a pro keijo player and ""surprisingly"" has talent. With the power of firendship she is able to make everybody her allies.The art and the sound are both rated with (8). Here I can\'t say very much, they both complement each other pretty well. In the ""art"" department there are some flaws, for exapmle swiming suit which repairs itself from one scene to another. Other than that, I\'m pretty satisfied.The charcater design is rated with (9). Every character is well rounded, with one exception, Nozomi (she seems to be able to overcome everithing with the power of will, but she is not as overpowered as.. mhm Natsu or Naruto). As I stated above, the story is pretty cliche so I will let this one slide.In the end, my personal enjoyment (10). I have to admit I had lots of fun watching ""Keijo"", and I enjoyed it to its fullest. A laid-back, funny anime which presents a new sport playable only by girls.The overall rating I give to ""Keijo!!!!!!!!"" is (8) which marks this as a good anime, and I recommend watching this if you want to see a laid-back, with no emotional implication series.

That is where Keijo!!!!!!!! excels, in its complete absurdity. Every episode goes further than that which came before and it works incredibly well.The very presence of tits and asses is comedic rather than lewd.

Unfortunately this joke becomes boring rather quick. Besides this, you get a bad Shounen and a mediocre Ecchi.-----Besides the setting, Keijo is picking up so many overused Shounen stereotypes that it could have been a parody of the genre: Characters getting power-boosts mid-fight, semi-tragic character backgrounds getting explained mid-fights... You know the drill.Most characters (including the MC) are poorly written and/or have no real purpose except for giving you the feeling that this show has more than like 5 characters. The only real ""backstories"" (Sayakas and...Mayas) have been done millions of times before.Let\'s talk about the MC really quick: She wants to become the worlds best Keijo player. That\'s it. No background and no character progression except her learning new overpowered special-moves.The story is rather simple and many parts feel like there were revised over and over again. For example the anime introduces us the girls which share the dorm with the MC and it seems like they are about to form some kind of team against other competing students. A few episodes later all the former competitors are now friends and they\'re fighting together. Huh? The direction of the story doesn\'t make much sense and feels really rushed.Ok now, let\'s finally get to the point though:You are not watching this for the story, do you? You probably want some laughs about butts and breasts hitting each other and hope for some good fan-service.Let\'s talk about the comedy first: While there are some good gags, there are mostly (IMO not so) funny named special-moves. Think of ""super-titty-twister"" or something. The anime takes itself really serious, which is funny at first once you remind yourself that you are watching girls trying to push each other from a platform using only their breasts and butt. The joke however became boring to me. Why don\'t have some character(s) who is aware of how stupid the sport of Keijo is and point that out?The ecchi was okay-ish. My problem is, that there is so much ecchi on screen continuously that you can\'t really get excited about it. It\'s rather hard to find some scene without sexy bikini grills. Keijo is always trying to do something even more lewd than before and surprisingly doesn\'t even fail in doing so (looking at you, Shimoneta).So, would I watch it again? Hell no.

And that\'s honestly the only thing that really matters, is how enjoyable it is.A anime can have the worse story in the world with meh characters, and that doesn\'t matter if it ends up being enjoyable.The thing that made Keijo work for me is that while the concept of girls fighting only with their boobs and asses is absurd, it never felt to me that it had to rely on fan service.Keijo does have a story that is pretty simple to follow. The main character wants...to enter the professional world of Keijo and be the Prize Queen. As you watch it you see her go in the training academy for Keijo and learn about the sport which they actually have rules for.As you keep watching you can see that there is something to Keijo that is developed to the intricates of the fighting style that really isn\'t related to fan service at all.The techniques the girls use range from just parodies of other animes/culture to their own style that can make some sense if you are willing to acknowledge what it is and not disregard it cause ""boobs and ass"" fighting.The only problem I did have with the show is that I honestly could not remember the characters names at all, probably because they are too Japanese? Maybe done on purpose but who knows.Overall Keijo is honestly worth watching. 12 episodes only won\'t take your whole day and you may find it funny and enjoyable. to enter the professional world of Keijo and be the Prize Queen.

Review------I came into this series thinking it was just a pure fan service show, but i was surprised. Not only was i amazed, i was shock how good this series was. I got addicted to it and watched it all in days. I watched the dub version scrubs.Story: 8/10Story was good and Nozomi really stood out.

Not only that, her cheerful and perceiving attitude to become the best keijo player really was Outstanding.Art: 8/10Art was okay. The animation during the fight scenes were well drawn. THe whole anime was living with bright colors....I give them a plus for having such special effects on well drawn out moves. Those moments were really awesome to watch and see.Sound: 9/10The Sound was outstanding. Only reason its not a 10 its bcuz the soundtrack could have been better inside the anime, still though the action scenes pumped me up.. The OP and ED were addicting and unskippable.**Character: 8.5/10The characters were never forgetful. Every single one had the personalities and had their own special moves that fitted their personality. Favorite ones have to be Kozomi, Sayaka with her white hair self, Mio with her pervy self(really hilarious), and then Maya. Maya really surprised me and became a favorite of mine. Her development at the end of the series really was great and i have to commend the devs and im looking forward to her in s2.Enjoyment: 10/10Enjoyment was a 10. I couldnt stop watching and was addicted. Every episode was amazing. There was never a dull moment.Overall: 9/10Overall, this series combined ecchi and hyping fking characters in sports up really well. My first shounen sport series, and will continue to keep watching this genre. Not only was it a joy watching their gracious bodies, but IT ACTUALLY HAD PLOT! Loved everything about it.

Its unique storyline was what piqued my interest (ahem... mostly innocent) to watch such a show as it is getting much rarer to see a UNIQUE plotline in anime in recent years.Plot 7/10The main selling point about this show is all about the battles! The battles are nothing short of...interesting and every battle keeps you entertained from start to end, and never fails to deliver any satisfaction and excitement in any of the episodes shown. Every aspect of the battle is something to be admired. From the wide variety of interesting battle styles and move-sets (yes, battle styles) to the creative designs and ideas of Land (battleground name), all of them blew any expectations i had of the show out of bounds (get it? xD). The show transformed what would seem to be an ordinary butt shoving competition into something way more exciting, in every aspect of battle (battleground, moveset, battle type) and their never ending stream of suprise movesets keeps any audience on their toes and eager to see what comes next, making the show a hype stream from start to end.However, as entertaining as the battles go, that's about it, i'm afraid. Other than the interesting battles, there's not much going in in terms of plot. Sure, there's a specific goal in mind for the anime and it is a simple one indeed, to be the number 1 Keijo player in the world, and.... that's it. It presents nothing else to the story. Sure, there were some backstories here and there but the battles overshadow them so much they don't appear important at all and all the other plot lines excluding battle wise are nothing much to be said or... cared for that matter. But since the anime is all about battles anyway, it doesn't really stand out much.Art: 5/10To be REALLY honest, i gave it  5 partly because of my own inability to digest the inconsistencies of the character designs. Disregarding their bloated hairstyles (for me, it's just an art style to get used to), the part that really gets to me is how much a lot of the characters are different. No, not different in the sense they have different personalities but it mostly has to do with their body structure. Of course different girls have different body structures but some of the characters are so vastly different from the others that it's like they are from different anime shows. Example: Most of the girls are the same with slightly different bust and chests but some of them are so buffed and manly, they don't even look like they have butts. This concerns me because the difference in characters make me feel like they don't fit together at all, like they are drawn by 2 different authors and forcefully mashed together into a collab anime.Sound 7/10Nothing really stands out with the music. Battle music is pleasing, the opening and ending songs are standard.Character 6/10This ties in with what i mentioned in the plot subsection about the plot not being anything much other than battle fuelled. In my opinion, the reason that is is because of the character development. As i have said, the battle is what made the anime. And as such, there is a considerable lack of decent character development. Even though there isn't any flaws with any of the characters, there just isn't much going on with them that could make anyone sympathise with them or even care much. Even when they provided some of the character's backstory, it just doesn't welcome any affection for them because they just aren't well developed throughout the story, and feels like it is inserted through sheer force. But, other than that, there isn't any real flaws with any of the characters.Enjoyment: 8/10All that being said, i really enjoyed watching the show. Casual, simple and entertaining. Not to mention a unique storyline and lots of surprise attacks keeps me well satisfied throughout the show and doesn't feel boring. If you just feel like watching something casual, or are just here for the fan service, you should give it a try, couldn't hurt ;) interesting and every battle keeps you entertained from start to end, and never fails to deliver any satisfaction and excitement in any of the episodes shown.

When I first heard about this first thing that came to my mind was ""only in anime"" something like this would exist. Believe it or not but the sports genre on anime is one that I haven\'t gotten into. It\'s not that I was never interested but rather I never knew any notable one to watch. So ur probably asking why tf did I choose Keijo as my first sports anime. Well to be completely honest it\'s cuz it\'s short. I felt why not get this...series over with since finishing it wouldn\'t require a lot of time spent. It\'s important to keep in mind that the anime doesn\'t cover the entirety of its manga which probably explains its short length, so unfortunately we don\'t get the full story. So how does Keijo hold up does it handle its absurd concept well or does it abuse it ??***contains MINOR spoilers***Story:6/10A shameless concept that was pretty well handled. The story is very straightforward with a shonen like plot where the protagonist wants to be the richest Keijo player in the world. It isn\'t complex nor deep by any means as it mainly focuses on the sport itself. It explores themes that you would expect in a sports show such as teamwork and sportsmanship. The fan service here is emphasized to the extreme and it really dominates the tone of the series. But what I really appreciate is that its not subtle about it, it knows what it is and it weirdly makes the anime seem less sexual. Becuz of this it surprisingly gives it a refreshing approach. The sport itself kinda pokes fun at sports as it shows you how absurd sporting events can be and keep in mind the females really take this sport seriously despite the obvious absurdity of the sport which is pretty cool actually. The comedy is both over the top and satirical. Each player has their own special move and some are parodies off other anime. For example there are moves called ""Hip of Babylon"" and ""Buttack on Titan"" Im sure most of you can guess where those are from. Where the story really suffers is outside the sport. When the athletes aren\'t competing they\'re just training for their upcoming matches. The story mainly just focuses on the sport and some character backgrounds and it just isn\'t enough depth. It\'s basically a standard shonen tale that gets to the point and that\'s really it.Art:8/10Overall the animation was pretty impressive. It uses boldly colorful art direction that perfectly fits the tone. The race scenes were taken care of well by the animators and it\'s where the visuals truly shine. Also ofc there\'s a lot of breasts and booty shots and it does become a lil too much but then it\'s understandable since that was the primary focus of the show\'s visuals. Whenever the boobs and butts clashed there was some nice fluidity for the most part. It does a good job at staying faithful to the mangaka\'s artwork for sure. What really impressed me about the art was the variation of the female body types. You have girls who are slim, girls who are thicc, girls with heavyset appearances, and some who are muscular. A lot of characters look good and are pretty distinct and while fan service is the main focus they do a good job at making them appealing. I did notice some animation errors towards the latter half which is disappointing cuz for a very short series u would think avoiding this would be easy. When it came to the non race scenes there was a lack of attention to detail which proves that the races were where animators put more work into. Overall as a guy ur hormones can be very tested watching a series like this lol.Sound:7/10Overall this are was decent but nothing special. I have to be honest I didn\'t find the music to be great at all most of the background tracks were forgettable which is disappointing of course. However not all of the music was like that, the show\'s OP ""DREAMxSCRAMBLE!"" is a cute song that\'s full of energy and it was a perfect choice to fit the show. The ED ""Fantas/HIP Girlfriends"" was okay it was a pop song sang by a female group with nice voices but the lyrics were kinda dumb. As for voice acting both the English and Japanese versions were solid. A lot of the actresses brought charm to the characters although the dialogue can be a lil corny. I thought the Japanese version was slightly better due to the comedy. There was a scene where a character uses fourth wall humor that was funny but dub version changed it and wasn\'t as funny. In general both casts did good tho.Character:7/10As you can probably tell this anime uses a female dominate cast, They\'re rarely any males here with only a few exceptions(not that Im complaining.) The characters are very likable it\'s hard to find someone to dislike here cuz most of them are charming and committed to their sport. There are only a few characters however that get explored and it\'s the major characters. The main character Nozomi Kaminashi is energetic girl who has a generic great goal of becoming a rich Keijo player. She\'s not that memorable since she\'s very standard and has no complexity but due to her lively personality she was enjoyable and was involved in a lot of fun races. Nozomi\'s bestie Sayaka Miyata was imo the best character. She has a more composed personality but she has the most interesting backstory out of the cast. Overall her development was great and due to her smaller stature her battles were more strategic which led to creative battles. What bothered me was that there were tons of side characters that got zero attention which is a shame cuz some of them seemed interesting. A lot of the females really took these absurd sport seriously and it really makes want to learn about their love for the sport. The show\'s short length heavily effected this.Final VerdictPros+Overall a very fun series that handles its premise well+Has a likable cast that\'s fun to watch and has sweet moments+Uses satire humor that can be very funny+Fun matches that are creative and have good storytellingCons-Has absolute zero sense of shame-Nozomi isn\'t much of a memorable protagonist-Outside of the matches the story can be boring-Side characters weren\'t given enough depthPersonal FavoritesCharacters: Miyata, Kazane, and MayaArc: East-West WarRace: Miyata vs NanaseIn conclusion is a shameless series that makes you ask yourself, ""does an anime like this really exist?"" Despite the heavy fanservice and ridiculous premise I\'d be lying if I said this wasn\'t a fun series cuz it definitely was. It\'s a sports anime that put a lot of thought into the sport itself with a lot of creativity and tbh if it chose to add a lil more depth into the story this could\'ve had a lot of potential. It take place during the high school years of the players and I wish it was longer so that we can see how they would end up. Unfortunately the short length was due to the manga artist being forced to cancel the manga which is too bad ofc even so the anime didn\'t cover up the remaining chapters. It\'s one of those anime where if you wanna see more of the story you would have to go to its original material to see for yourself. As for recommendations I actually don\'t have a particular title in mind but if you love sports and tons of boobs and booty thrown at ya then this is DEFINITELY the perfect series.Sub or Dub Recommendation: Sub series over with since finishing it wouldn\'t require a lot of time spent.

Gave the 9 because it was a shockingly quality show that managed to make a fairly serious anime out of a sport using only your ass and tits. and there aren\'t really many filler moments imo, every episode is spent developing the characters and their stories to reach their aspirations as pro keijo players.I gave this a 9/10 but its more around a 7-9 rating.

Let's do this.StoryThere is no story.The End.I spent a good 6 episodes of Keijo searching for something that wasnt there. A plot....Keijo has no plot. Its basically about Kaminashi Nozomi, who wants to be the Pirate Ki....I mean, Prize Queen, which is apparently the title for a very good Keijo player, and she has no mentioned incentives for wanting this whatsoever, besides a mild mentioning in the first episode that it might be for the money.So what is Keijo? Keijo is a female-only sport  that requires player to knock each other off from a platform floating on a pool using only their breasts and butts. Only in Japan, right?Keijo should be watched as an unspoken parody. Did the studio mean to do this? Idk. But its best if you do.Story: 3/10AnimationThe animation was nice during the fight scenes. I liked how the censorship was in the form of DBZ like light energy. But during the conversation moments, there were a few places where it could have been done better. Good for the most part, but still choppy in some places.Animation: 5/10CharactersThe character designs were likeable for the most part. But 99% of the characters had no character development . They were mostly very 2 dimensional characters, and not easy to relate to, defined only by some quirks they had.However, among this there was one character  that received some special attention and stood out among the rest to become my favourite character of the show.Sayaka-chan best girl. Nuff Said #NoLoliCharacters: 4/10ExecutionThe pacing of the show was good. No races lasted for more than half an episode. The humour was a bit hit or miss. There was little forced humour and it was genuine. Its hard to make me laugh and the most it got outta me was a nose exhale, but i can see how it would be funny to a lot of people. If you still think its not funny, see how serious they're taking themselves and you'll be rolling on the floor in no time. I guarantee it.All the jokes were crude, but funny nonetheless. The person who named the moves should be given an award. Goddamit.Buttack on Titan? Gate of Bootylon? Shoryucans was my favourite. xDThere was no end the strange-ass techniques used by everyone.(No pun intended)Execution: 7/10EnjoymentRegardless of me shitting on this anime throughout this article, I actually enjoyed it.

But it wasn't. No, its not a masterpiece that will make you re-evauate your life (not even close bitch) but I believe its still worth a watch.

I think is the perfect fit for an anime format where no idea is too crazy, on top of that despite the sport being fictitious, I felt that the world created around the idea was well-fleshed out(tehehe flesh). Of course there were a lot of fan-service in the anime. On a show where girls in their swimsuits who used their butts and boobs to win a match, only a fool would think otherwise, and yet despite a myriad of these fan-services I think that what is in the center; a story about a group of girls who are busting their butts...out(tehehe) trying to overcome their shortcomings and believing and following their dreams of becoming a professional athlete, is a breath of fresh air from the usually male-dominated genre.The plot move along very nicely. Usually in animes where the battles are very intensive, the other part of the plot would feel tedious or get boring really fast, but when I was watching this show I didn't feel it at all.Now about the sound, there's not much to be said, the background music fit nicely with the scene being portrayed and at some parts I think they were using like a live orchestra type music which reminded me of Family Guy. Why did I give it a 10? Because the sound effects for the skills were hilarious! Seriously, it cracks me up to see a butt makes a sound similar to a firearm.As for the art, it's pretty much the same quality as other new anime out there, I didn't find any problem with it at all.Now, why I think this anime is a masterpiece (mASSterpiece, tehehehe) because it managed to combine several aspects which I like from other anime so harmoniously. That is from the sport genre and the fighting genre. You get that competitive vibe you would get from a sport genre anime from it and also that fighting vibe from the skills that the characters develop and how the arena where the characters fight kind of change, opening new types of strategy, unlike other sport anime where the arena is usually the same. Plus usually when it's a sport anime, the setting would probably be in an academic school so the sport would be like an extra activity in the lives of the characters, but in Keijo the sport itself is the main choice for the character instead of an additional option so it made a lot of sense why they are trying so hard.As for the characters, I kind of feel that the development feel somewhat lacking, they were pretty much archetypal but in a good sense. But I seriously think that the main character could do with some more elaboration because I feel that the supporting characters have more background than the main character and the focus kind of shifted on them instead.All in all, I enjoy Keijo thoroughly, it's an easy watch and you don't get too hung up on the characters too much, the story is light and you could just relax and let go when watching this anime, also the references in the show were pretty funny. out(tehehe) trying to overcome their shortcomings and believing and following their dreams of becoming a professional athlete, is a breath of fresh air from the usually male-dominated genre.The plot move along very nicely.

They even made me laugh pretty hard. The first episode I saw of Keijo was pretty funny, I will admit. But when I had to sit through 12 episodes of the same thing, it quickly reaches saturation point. There was a point - I’m not sure when - that I could no longer tell whether Keijo was trying to get me to laugh at it, or trying to get me...hard.I hope you’ll forgive me for being vulgar, but Keijo certainly doesn’t let up, either. I can no longer tell whether Keijo is a comedy show written in a dramatic way, or a drama show with comedic moments. I really do think that the majority of this show is meant to be taken seriously. Yes, Keijo, the anime where every character obnoxiously screams out their SUPER MOVE before they do something either so dumb it shouldn’t work, or so mundane it doesn’t deserve the name. It’s mostly the former.Half of this anime is a run-of-the-mill Shounen with way too many tournament arcs, and the other is a surprisingly decent Slice of Life that tries to give most characters the depth and attention they deserve. If it weren’t for how obviously this show cares about its characters, Keijo would feel exploitative. Hell, even then it feels exploitative. Butt you know what you’re getting into from the start anyway.Despite the characters being Keijo’s definitive strong point, the effort is lacking in the last arc. I also dislike how Mio Kusai - whatever her name is - is given a lot of build-up but no payoff. A symptom of the adaptation cutting the original story short, perhaps, but we never get to know her intimately as a character. This was one of my big disappointments with Keijo.Since this is as good a time as any, allow me to wrap up this review by dolling out the anime awards!Best Girl: Miyata-chanNozomi might hog the limelight, but Miyata deservedly gets almost as much, if not more screentime. And for good reason. Her arc is relatable, well-developed, well-written, and all-around the best thing in Keijo. Her dynamic with Nozomi is nice, too. Without spoiling anything, the drama in Miyata’s arc is the only drama in the anime I could take seriously. Butt all said and done, Miyata is also cute.Worst Girl: Maya-tanMaya-tan is the last significant character in Keijo, and she’s also the worst character in Keijo. Sorry to say it, but as soon as her backstory started unravelling, I couldn’t help but sigh and roll my eyes. Her drama is dumb. She is dumb. This anime is dumb. She took up so much time in the last arc, too. She’s not a great foil for Nozomi, either - she challenges nothing about Nozomi’s character and her only purpose is in reinforcing how kind Nozomi is. She’s boring, her drama is cliche, and she’s just unenjoyable to watch.Keijo was funny to begin with, but quickly got repetitive. Things suddenly became serious, but everything about Keijo is too goofy to take seriously. There is one good character in Keijo, but the rest are boring, one-note, or annoying to watch. Keijo has easily the most ecchi premise I’ve ever heard of in an anime, but it’s nowhere near as perverse as some more ostensibly moderate shows I can think of.I don’t think there’s anything to get really angry about in Keijo, and while there are a few things to laugh at, nothing beyond its premise is particularly memorable. Keijo just doesn’t do enough. It starts off well, but can’t follow through.Keijo doesn’t really end, either, and it’s not getting a second season. It’s pretty abrupt. hard.I hope you’ll forgive me for being vulgar, but Keijo certainly doesn’t let up, either.

This is not like most typical anime action/comedy/ecchi series were it falls to the category as unnecessary fan service.It when the creator are not confident about themselves or just there cause ""Funny I guess"", but if you take this show as it is, then you would surely enjoy...Keijo like me.Story/Plot- 8/10 (Compelling and Pretty Ridiculous) Keijo plot and drama wasn\'t too special, just your normal plot out there.

The opening music is really cool, silly, and edgy but I like it.Enjoyment- 10/10 (My eyes shaped hearts and excitement gets me off guard) Keijo is really entertainment, funny, and over the top ridiculous.I never been smiling for excitement or laughing so hard since ""Prison School"", but my head is spinning.Overall-9/10 (It the best fan-service anime, but not prefect)Best concept, Best MC, Best storyline (good), I didn\'t expect to be this super surprise or laughably breath taking for air.

Young woman using their large bosoms and dairy airs to knock people off a platform in the middle of a pool for sport. Utterly grotesque. Then one day I stumbled upon a promo video for the DVD on YouTube, and I became slightly intrigued. Though I still had my guard up, I watched episode one just to see what all the talk in the comments were about. To my surprise, it was actually pretty darn good, and I mean that in a...non sarcastic way. The plot isn\'t the best, but once the really awesome butt-fighting scenes and character development gets rolling, I wasn\'t even paying attention to the plot anymore (""I\'m talking about boobs""). The animation is top notch and the voice acting is decent as well (I watched the dub). If your thinking about watching this anime, one thing to keep in mind is, don\'t take it seriously. The butt-fighting moves are unrealistic (in a good way). I went into it like that, and soon found that it\'s more of a perverted action comedy than a slice of life sports anime. Overall, I enjoyed this anime, and I don\'t think you\'ll find one quiet like it. Thank you. non sarcastic way.

An anime about a water sport involving the usage of your butt? Unheard of. Me watching this kind of series? Also unheard of.So, while watching this anime, I made sure to shut off my brain and try to allow myself to find enjoyment in this show. Surprisingly, I left the series with some kind of fulfillment. Or maybe a loss?StoryThe story of Keijo has almost the same vibe as any typical sports anime - and...with this vibe it does not stop us from wanting to cheer on the main character: Nozomi Kaminashi, an aspiring Keijo player who is obviously going to be a skillful Keijo player (because who would want to watch a sports anime with a regularly skilled athlete?). The storyline of the series is very predicable, which makes it feel extremely dry and like you could probably just read an episode summary and be totally fine. Although the plot isn\'t very interesting, the normality of the crude sport is what makes it hilarious. You don\'t watch Keijo for a promising and deep story line, you watch it for the ""plot.""

Although containing a bland storyline that can just be googled, one chooses not to because experiencing the crazy art style and comedic boob/ass related Keijo techniques is the fun of the series.

A sport about knocking other young women off platforms, or to their knees, using parts of their bodies as long as it's not hands or feet.That it followed actual women doing this and not your regular teen girls was a huge bonus!  It's rare to find more risque (I use the term very lightly here) anime where the characters are of Legal age lolIt's fun and...entertaining.Yes I liked this anime and I'm giving it a fair ASSessment here by giving it a Solid 8 overall. entertaining.Yes I liked this anime and I'm giving it a fair ASSessment here by giving it a Solid 8 overall."", 'This show honestly defied all expectations I had of it, which is to say I absolutely expected nothing out of it from the start.  I am not a fan of fan service in anime since most times I want to enjoy a series for its story instead of its tits and ass.  When I first heard of Keijo i think my jaw almost dislocated with how fast it dropped.  A show where well endowed girls battle each other in skimpy bathing suits with their butts and breasts?  It might have been the most ultimate level of fan service I\'ve seen in...an anime that wasn\'t a hentai.  My curiosity got the better of me and I\'m honestly glad it did because I had so much fun watching this show.Let me start off by saying that not everyone will like Keijo for what it is and that is completely understandable.  Many will look at the trailer or read a summary, say ""this shit is stupid"" and then move on.  However, I believe that Keijo\'s overwhelmingly ridiculous concept is what makes it so enjoyable to watch.  It doesn\'t try to be a super serious show with a super serious plot it just simply wants to make you laugh and by god does it achieve that with flying colors.  The story and characters are good enough for you to pay attention to them but simple enough that you don\'t get too invested which is exactly what a show like this needs.  If a show about girls fighting with their tits and ass tried to make you care about the story and characters more than you know you should then you\'d honestly end up caring about the whole thing even less.The main story behind Keijo is that its a professional sport (like basketball or football) where a group of girls with large breasts and butts, stand on a shaky platform in the middle of a large pool and battle each other to be the last one standing.  Players can only attack others with their butts and breasts and will lose if they either fall into the water or fall onto the platform.  The main character is Nozomi Kaminashi, a very energetic 18 year old girl who wants to be the best Keijo player and thats it.  She has no sad backstory or any other complex reason, she plays Keijo because she likes it.  For a show like this that\'s honestly all we need from the main character because, lets be honest, we\'re not really here to know all that much about her.  Each character has their own personality, which helps you identify them, but they aren\'t too complex.  A few characters have backstories but they aren\'t too deep that it would complicate the story.  The fact that the characters are identifiable yet simple makes us not care too much nor too little about them.  It has us know who they are while still mainly focusing on the main part which is the ridiculousness of the sport itself.The funny thing about Keijo is that even though most of the techniques used in the sport will have you rolling on the floor in a fit of laughter, its not that bad of a battle shonen.  Seeing as the characters can only attack with their breasts and butts, I wasn\'t sure how engaging the fight scenes would be but I was shocked to find out that it was actually pretty good.  The animation is pretty great (probably better than a show like this deserves) and some of the techniques in the show, although heart stoppingly hilarious, are animated extremely well.  You also do want to see the main character succeed and its shown in the very beginning of the show that even though she is good at the sport she is nowhere near the best and still has a lot to learn.Of course people who love anime fan service will love the hell out of this show but if you\'re someone who loves to laugh at ridiculous things or someone who likes to watch ""so bad that its good"" movies because of the bizarre choices that the movie makes then I think you\'ll get a real kick out of Keijo. an anime that wasn\'t a hentai.

Female players compete to be the last person standing on the Land. The only catch is that they can only use their breasts and butt to knock each other off, because well, Japan.You’re probably thinking the same thing I was at first. How on Earth are they going to fill twelve episodes with this? No matter how much you love silly humor, twelve episodes of fanservice-fighting with moves that are getting more ridiculous by the minute will bore everyone eventually. I had serious doubts they would manage to fill up hours with something that sounds like it was thought...up one drunk night out. But those thoughts were quickly brushed aside as the series progressed.Keijo is smarter than you give them credit for at first. Although the general concept never changes and the outcome of all the fights is as predictable as it gets, there is more going on. We learn about the different types of fighters, anatomy, teamwork and different types of Lands. The boring circular ring is quickly left behind for special types ranging from a giant floating castle to two airplanes and even a jungle-type Land. Although the MC stays pretty much cardboard, many of the other characters transform along with the Lands. We learn what drives them to pick up this silly sport in the first place. For some it’s simple money, fame or attention from hot looking guys (although there are no male characters to be seen anywhere), but others have deeper reasons. They want to fight to prove themselves, to make their dad proud, to put their village on the map or just because they want to beat their rivals or even the demons within themselves. You never question who will rule the Land in the end, but the anime does a good job of making you care about the reasons that brought all of them there in the first place. And it’s always fun to see what crazy tactic they’ll pull out of their asses in next battle. And yes you can take that literally in some cases.Despite all that, Keijo is also a flawed story. Conflicts arise on paper-thin grounds and evaporate by shaking hands after battle. Clearly, they care a lot more about the inner conflicts of the characters than conflicts between them, because in the end, everyone is a happy girl who is friends with everyone. The MC is also pretty boring. Her whole reason to pick up Keijo is built on quicksand and that’s a shame. They could have really done more with this. But maybe it’s a good thing they didn’t take things too seriously.As an ecchi, this show really knocks the ball out of the park. I consider myself a bit of an expert on ecchi, so I was worried at first. I know only a few studios that can pull off ecchi well and Xebec is not one of them. Their only real ecchi show is the famous To Love Ru, which, although very popular, suffered the same problem most ecchi shows have: fundamentally unlikeable spineless MC who's about as dense as you can get and a plot that doesn’t really go anywhere. In ecchi, it’s very easy to burn yourself, so when Xebec announced a new ecchi show, I wasn’t about to watch it.However. IMS made Masou Gakuen HxH and Hundred around the same time and TNK was busy on the Seven Deadly Sins, but neither of these seemed to match the rather strange popularity of a silly sports anime about fighting with breasts and butts. So what was going on here?Did Xebec pull it off? The dream of every studio that makes ecchi? Did they make something that did not feel like another copy-paste exercise? No, that wasn’t possible.Except, it was.Keijo has thrown everything out of the window with the premise of the show. There is no need to find stupid excused for ecchi-scenes, it’s right there in the premise. Of course ecchi scenes will happen, they are fighting in bikinis with their breasts and butt. Not only that, but by the same logic, we can leave behind our stupid male MC, his tsundere girlfriend, his little sister and his childhood friend altogether. So while the ecchi stays pretty tame, it’s not a problem because we’ve never seen this before. We’ve seen the accidental boob-grope a million times before, but a girl using her breasts to bash someone in the head and knock them in the water, now that is a welcome change from traditional ecchi. So yes, it works. But it only works for twelve episodes because the story isn’t interesting enough to keep going beyond that, and the ‘new’ part of it only stays original for one season.So in the end, is Keijo worth picking up? Depends. It belongs to three genres (ecchi, comedy and sports) and all three are there to carry along the plot. Unless you hate fanservice, sport-animes, an inexplicable female-only cast or shounen-style fights with the power of friendship, I would say go for it. It will drag you along for twelve episodes with a permanent grin on your face. You can say whatever you want about it, but they sure did their best to make it as entertaining as possible without once slipping. up one drunk night out.

that some sport so ridiculous will become a lucrative sport enough that they have schools dedicated to it, it\'s just so ridiculous. of course with the sport there is swimsuits and with swimsuits there is fanservice, but it\'s never in your face about it because it\'s always there and never feels like it\'s trying to be sexual.  on top of all that is the insane powers and abilities  that each player brings to the table. not only are they hotting each other with their butts and breast, but they they are firing air cannons and smacking each other at the speed of sound, they are teleportation and hypnotizing each other all through the power of their butts and breast. this show obviously isn\'t one to be taken seriously, but the character do which only makes the story even more admirable to the show.  however in the long run the show is just about girls going through practices with a tournament at the end and that\'s pretty much it. 6.5/10characters-  the main character is Nozomi, with here main support characters and room mates being Sayaka, Kazane, and Non. there are also more side characters in the show from her schoolmates, mentors, and students from other schools. all characters in the show have very minimal amount a depth into them, but each character is given the right amount of screen time they deserve. you get enough time to know them before they overstay there welcome. there is some decent development from the main four characters such as Kazane going from a shy girl all they way to being able to give commands during the fight. all the characters interact will with each other and work and grow as a team.  6/10animation- the art and animation aren\'t anything great but are able to do the job well. this isn\'t some amazing animation spectacle but more of what you can find from a current shounen anime and it works well because this is a shounen. the character design look decent, all of the characters look cute for the most part,  and they all have a unique or mundane look depending on their character and that\'s just swell. the background is decent enough from the classroom, to training grounds, and the tournament arena with a little nitpick on the out of place CGI models.6.5/10sound- the voice acting is done very well, nothing to complain about from there. no character voice felt odd and it brought the right personality to the characters. the soundtrack i something to be left desired as it is mostly forgettable, but not bad for me to hate it6/10enjoyment- this anime was one hell of a show. it was so ridiculous and absurd that it is. i can find anything to hate about the show, but of course i have little to give great praises about as well. 6.5/10overall- everthing from story, characters, animation, and sound are above average, and was a decent joy to watch6.5/10\ufeff said;

I swear. Well maybe for a little bit of culture too...In my opinion this show is very underscored. From one point of view it's kind of understandable but on the other hand it's kind of undeserved. To be fair, because of the premise it's hard for this anime to be taken seriously. The show is about some kind of butt-sumo for females and it's quite easy to disregard it as a half-comedy half-ecchi material.Still, I consider this to be another sports anime with comedy\\ecchi elements. If you look past the butt-sumo part it's almost just as good...a sports anime as any, like Kuroko or Haikyu even. I mean they do take their battle aspect quite seriously;  the tactics, the strategizing, the battle tendencies and all the other idiocy so inherent with sports anime genre are definitely there. And if you don't concentrate your attention on the butt stuff -- the anime is quite epic sometimes.I don't know if the production taking the sports part this seriously was meant as an irony or an absurd.. but it can be strongly regarded as a sports anime none the less. I won't call it wholesome because of a butt-sumo part.. but it is quite good as both butt-anime and sports-anime.Final verdict -- its good. Better then the score presents it to be. a sports anime as any, like Kuroko or Haikyu even.

Had a clear personality as someone who just loves the sport as well as having her own unique way of talking made her stood out more.Overall:Recommend to people who enjoy other Ecchi anime and people who like Sports but don't mind ecchi or fan service type moments.Not recommended for people who dislike sports or ecchi anime and not recommended for people trying to get into those genres as a first time type of anime.Its an anime that kinda knows it is going over-the-top in most regards and enjoys itself doing so. Although not the saviour of anime as some people would say (for Fall season 2016), its certainly not one that should be hidden away and put out of its misery with a bullet. - Absolutely ridiculous names used for moves done by the characters (although some people will find it adds to the anime).- Matches are taking up less air time compared to other sports anime so there is less drama/cliffhangers during matches, which made it less exciting to watch for me.- Short season (12 episodes) left character development low for most characters.- The story, personally didn't care for it at all, but it works for what it is.Personal favourite character:Kaminashi, Nozomi.

Sure, I’ve watched anime that has bored me to tears (Ergo Proxy) or I just didn’t like (SAO) but never before had I watched an anime that made me physically angry and just frustrated at how low some shows would go for a quick cash grab. I mean I’ve watched fan service anime before for example High School DxD and Prison school. Sure DXD was pretty bad but it had a pretty good story and the characters were fleshed out. Prison school had a great story, great characters, was...extremely funny, and even though the fan service was ridiculous and repulsive at times (think of a high school anime directed by Sacha Baron Cohen) it wrapped things up nicely in the end and I was pulling for the main characters the entire story. Here there is none of that.Here the story is absolute trite. Some slut with a ridiculous accent named Nozomi Kaminashi wants to be the best Keijo player in the world. No background is given on said girl or motivation that’s the story. In this terrible anime there are no deep thought provoking questions that one might ask oneself such as “what is the meaning of my existence?” “What is the pursuit of one’s dream?” “Is man formed by nature or nurture?” You have none of that just fan service disguised as comedy. You have moves called ass guillotine and vacuum butt cannon. I mean yeah it was funny the first two times all the butt and tit jokes but after 100 times it just becomes annoying. There is a freaking school that actually teaches this absurd sport (in the show). Why hasn’t anybody in the anime actually questioned why such a dumb sport exists and why people are watching it? Also I wouldn’t hate this anime is the story wasn’t actually taken seriously. Everybody here takes this sport seriously I mean they have an academy for it. If someone would question the ridiculousness of this crap in the show I would actually have somewhat minor enjoyment of the anime possibly.Art and sound are good I’ll say. Animation is fluid during fight scenes and jiggle physics are good (can’t believe I’m saying that). The girls are pretty to look at; they all have different physiques and powers.Characters well they are just terrible. They’re good looking but none of them are fleshed out and none of their motivations are explained in anyway. The secondary character Sayaka Miyata was a once great judo fighter who decided to switch to Keijo. Her dad is disappointed by this switch and he’s seen as the bad guy what the fuck? Another character Mio Kusaki who’s really hot has a ridiculous fighting technique called titty hypnosis and no I’m not kidding sadly. I saw a YouTube clip where they’re having a Keijo match and this girl is getting attacked by tentacles what the serious fuck that makes no sense at all? It wasn’t some fan made parody or hentai it was actually in the show. It just came out of nowhere.  Also they have the nerve and audacity to make fun of real science like astronomy and call it asstronomy you get it? Also boobology is mentioned as well. The teacher in the academy was giving a lecture about such asinine subjects. How dare they insult a science that has brought us countless revelations and defecate on the work of greats like Aristotle, Einstein, Copernicus, and Galileo.Overall, this is one of the worst anime I have ever seen. It’s stupid, it’s vapid, it’s ridiculous, not funny at all, and the story goes nowhere. It is filled with stupid shounen clichés that have no originality and so much fan service that it will give you a headache. I would not recommend this to anybody at all maybe horny teenage boys. This was terrible and this show is one of the reasons that people cringe when you tell them you watch anime. Forget great shows like Bebop, Berserk, Monster, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Death Note this is what older people think when you tell them you watch anime. It displays every negative stereotype about it with absolutely no substance or character driven focus at all. I find it abhorrent that such material exists. Shows like this set the standards of anime back decades showing that almost anybody can make an anime. This show also sets back women’s fight for equality by decades displaying women as nothing but brainless sex objects for entertainment. I hope studio Xebec burns to the ground for this. After seeing their catalog it seems to me they have made nothing noteworthy or even good. The only okay show they have made was Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne which was still trashy as fuck in content (lesbianism, torture, meaningless religious symbolism). Everything else they made is terrible and repugnant on every level; worst animation studio in history.

Shame.Character: 10This is the most diverse cast of country butt tacticians. From the main character to the rival school cast. Each with a different way of that one mode in those DOA games fighting. My personal favorite, Mio Kusakai with the power of perverse hypnotism using all of her assets.Enjoyment: 10If you could turn your brain off and stop whining about whether The End of Eva was good or not you will definitely enjoy Keijo.

I still believe the show is worth watching, 100%. What has changed is my harshness around scores of shows. On a personal level the show is an absolute banger.

actually gave me exactly what I wanted.Story,6/10Over 100 years ago,...a sport was played With skill and honer, so many have playedOnly the mightiest of Warriors have played this sport.They risked there very lives and dreams in order to be the best,The fallen would be Crushed and forgotten,But the winners would have there names and deeds sung though the very halls of VALHALLA itself.But where not talking about that sport,We are talking about a sport that is way more important.The sport named kejio  where girls fight in a pool only using them tites and ass as weapons of battle.Basically a mix between dead or alive extreme and water polo.Join Nozomi Kaminashi a very talented gymnast who plans to fight her way to the top in order to get her family out of poverty,While making  new friends and meeting new rivals on her path to becoming a kejio master.So as a lot of you can guess this is probably one of the most ridiculous premises  for a story  I have ever heard of to date,And despite  all that it actually decent for a story which I have to turn off my Brain  for in order to watch it,Now I am also not saying that's its savor of anime or  it's the cancer of anime like a lot of people are saying it is,Although I feel that those take those stances are kind of loosening the point of it.But if I am being completely  honest the only thing this saved me from was my complete boredom because watching this anime season was draining.But the story for all intents and purposes kejio is of its self is just one giant  meme a joke.Which doesn't require much thought than the usual,oh look there dong something over the top with boobs and ass again.And there some sort of plot that keeps it going.Now One can  argue that it exploiting  woman and all that other p.c culture crap.Of course I feel that a very little nit pick.But I would like add a  counter point,That sex sells and that not going to change anytime soon,Unless all the sex drives just disappear all out of no where.Plus I would like to add that this show isn't always about fan service.it also about following your dreams and ambitions,While having fun on the way,And honestly that makes it more interesting and actually relatable.All though I was more  watching it for the pure abserdy of it all.I mean how can I not treat it was such.It's a story based around a spot with girls slamming there asses into each over.Now I have been mostly positive.It's time for the negatives.Now even I do find it extremely funny,I feel at times that it looses stream at times and the joke starts to become less funny as it goes along.I would also like to add    that the pacing is quite off  at times,Like there some parts like In the first few episodes which kind of went a bit to fast and there where other time where the pacing slows down because there trying to make up for a fast pace,It really find it hard to keep  to a steady pace.I also think that could toned down on the talking and info dumps,the first episode we where explained the basics and how the game was played,But than  later on in the same episode they repeat the exact same thing.Which is bother some when I came here to see crazy over the top bull shit.That other that that there really nothing much else to say.Characters 6/10The main character  Nozomi.I would probably say she a very fun led to follow.With her very I wouldn't say interesting,But very energetic personally  that kind of grows on you over time.And also very determined to follow her dreams which  makes her quite relatable to any one who trying to follow your dreams.The side characters.Are very fun and kinda over the top.And actually have some sort of personality.Which is always a plus.There not the most interesting cast,But are very fun to follow  and that's how they should be.But there really much else to them than that.Art,7/10The animation looks very polished and dynamic.It also has very nice flash to it.It had some really great boob and ass shots.It has a very over the top styleWhich adds to the fight scenes to any run of the mail activity.Which it makes over the top.The characters design are quite nice,Sound, 6/10The op and ending I actually quite like which actually shocking because I general very fussy when it comes to sougs I like.Other than the kick ass  op and nice ending the rest of the ost is pretty forgettable.The ost was done by matsuo hayato who has done the ost for drifters and cyborg 009.The dub and sub are both fine.Enjoyment,6/10I feel what really made me enjoy this anime.Was the fact that is show is so unapologetic about how sexual and over the top is about every thing,This show doesn't give a fuck and I found that aspect of it very endearing.And also the fact that is show feels like it was made to have fun.Overall, 6/10If your looking for something insane   and over the top then kejio is definitely what your looking for.If you are a SJW or someone that doesn't understand that this is just for fun.Or don't like fan service  or any of the elk then probably don't watch this a sport was played With skill and honer, so many have playedOnly the mightiest of Warriors have played this sport.They risked there very

which actually shocking because I general very fussy when it comes to sougs I like.Other than the kick ass  op and nice ending the rest of the ost is pretty forgettable.The ost was done by matsuo hayato who has done the ost for drifters and cyborg 009.The dub and sub are both fine.Enjoyment,6/10I feel what really made me enjoy this anime.Was the fact that is show is so unapologetic about how sexual and over the top is about every thing,This show doesn't give a fuck and I found that aspect of it very endearing.And also the fact that is show feels like it was made to have fun.Overall, 6/10If your looking for something insane   and over the top then kejio is definitely what your looking for.If you are a SJW or someone that doesn't understand that this is just for fun.Or don't like fan service  or any of the elk then probably don't watch this"", 'I Just completed ""KEIJO!!!!"" and man japan keeps impressing me everytime. I didnt knew much about this anime when It was released or even when it was announced. And I only felt the curiosity and urge to watch this because I saw a youtuber that mentioned this a couple of times and bet to another youtuber to watch it if he lost it. I thought it was funny and decided to give it a shot. I can describe this in 2 ways:1- ""TITS AND ASS!""2- ""BUTS AND BOOBS Z""Because the fights and action part of it its cool like ""Dragon Ball Z""....Of course the animation is well done cause 2016 its hilarious 2 just the concept that you only see asses colliding most of the time with a little boob action there and there. So if your Straight and a bonafide ASS-MAN like myself than you should give KEIJO!!!! a shot its good to pass the time. I advise anyone who read this to add this anime into there plan to watch this.NOTE: if your a BOOBS-MAN you still got some of the good stuff even though not as much as a ASS-MAN gets but theres a good amout of it there.

Because I couldn't stop laughing, :-D thinking how stupid this is.  This anime takes echi and absurd to a different level. Every time someone comes up with a new attack I start grinning.  If you don't worry about plot and just want to laugh at something stupid, like a cat shiting on a dog video, you've got to watch this anime. The concept behind this is so stupid that is it is good. Gate of Babylon of Gilgamesh you say???!! This has Gate of Bootylon. Literally!!!P.S. MAL, people should have the freedom to write...short reviews. Writing unnecessary long reviews makes no sense.

If you love butts, and I mean double cheeked up on a Thursday afternoon, you will love this anime. But that's not the only thing, it's a solid sports anime, funny one. That's the wonderful thing about it, it has a soul, it's not only about flying boobs and butts. If you're looking for a god-level plot though...eh well the plot is good for what the anime is trying to convey. But still an overall fun and unique experience that exceeded my expectation of being a mediocre ecchi anime with a lot of fan service. "", 'I never imagined to thoroughly enjoy any ecci series other than Monster Musume but Keijo!!!!!!!! proved me wrong. Now I have seen Keijo being included in a lot of ""so bad it\'s good"" or cringe lists, with the major complaint being how bad of a sports show it is. But who the hell watches a Boob-Butt-Boxing show as a serious sports show?? At what point during Nipple Twisters and Butt Kamikazes did you realize that this is not about sports? Not to spoil anything but one character literally orgasms two others into a knockout! And this is not even the weirdest thing that happens in...the show.But what makes Keijo stand out and why I recommend it is the fact that Keijo feels like it was written by a somewhat creative pervert than a plain old rapist. It involves no instances of guys creeping up on girls, or ""accidentally"" sexually abusing them. Ecci series are full of girls swooning over the MC and doing anything and everything to get his attention (including my favorite MonMusu). They repeatedly try to justify their molestations and fall for the creepiest cringiest and most pathetic of guys. Also, no Lolis can be seen anywhere (Yaaaayyyyy). In Keijo the girls aren\'t clumsy clueless dolts who fall on their boobs and need a guy to talk pseudo-philosophical bullcrap into them for them to function in life. Keijo comes as a welcome change from all the pedophilia, stalking, ""chivalry"" (read misogyny), abuse and plain sheer stupidity while delivering on the Fanservice. Sankarea also tries to cut down on the misogyny but it fails to deliver.In Keijo\'s weird world nothing seems out of place- girls have huge boobs and butts, well they train to make it that way; girls walking around in skimpy clothes, well its an all girls hostel; people pressing each others\' boobs and butts, well they do need to assess their developments; their boobs and butts always get highlighted and jiggle all the time, well they are fighting with them in conscious deliberate movements; the camera focuses excessively on the assets, well basketball or chess shows display the hands or eyes in slow motion don\'t they? The end product is a show that doesn\'t feel lechery, or creepy. It doesn\'t feel like that the girls\' private spaces are being invaded or that they are being misled or abused. No character in the show seem like she needs therapy (except Kaya maybe). The girls have real goals which has nothing to do with getting a guy\'s attention. They don\'t try to be ""good girls"" or models of ""femininity"". Not to mention it\'s real fun too (except the final episode which is typical Shounen). Keijo is proof that you can do effective Fanservice without being a total patriarchal asshole (and a closet rapist).

If you\'re coming in for the story, stop right now, you\'re in the wrong place. Keijo cannot and should not be judged as a normal anime, because it is 100% a GUILTY PLEASURE watch. And as a guilty pleasure watch, it does its job very well.The best way to look at it is as a parody and inside joke about the whole shounen sports genre, and of anime itself. The abundance of fan service, the absolutely ridiculous ways it goes about it, every cliche sports beat dialled to 1000%, the premise itself... Everything about it is a...joke, and Keijo knows it and has fun with it anyway. The 8 exclamation marks in the name are no accident. It\'s an indication of exactly what kind of anime it is.It kinda gave me Jojo vibes in how over the top it can get. Except all that energy is directed at ass and boob puns, and pulling out finisher moves like \'Gatling Butt Canon\' and \'Assteroid Afterglow\'. Believe me, these are the tamer ones. It gets far more batshit, excuse me, Butt-shit than that. The entire time I was watching it, I was thinking ""What the hell am I watching!?"", and laughing at what was on screen (and myself for enjoying it).And if that\'s not a good enough reason to watch it, then let me tell you, the characters are impossibly hot!And I\'m not saying that just because I\'m horny and have trash taste. I personally love the kind of art style that has thick, bold lines, like the kind in Assassination Classroom or Attack on Titan, and in Keijo it goes a long way to make the characters look really good. There\'s no question this anime\'s greatest strength is its visuals, and the production quality doesn\'t disappoint.Of course, there are some issues I have with it. Keijo is self-aware and a parody of shounen sports anime, but it\'s almost a beat-for-beat parody, so it gets predictable and the monologues get tiring. I found myself skipping past these points to enjoy the madness when the battles take place, but I wish it was a little less derivative and spent more time doing something original with its plot and characters. Naturally, the characters themselves are all likeable and have their own charm and appeal, but it\'d be more accurate to say that they have quirks rather than full-fledged personalities. I kinda expected this going in, considering what kind of anime this is, so it\'s not a dealbreaker for me, but if it had characters you could get invested in, I think this anime could have been brilliant.Overall, I hope this review gives you a clearer idea of what to expect going into this anime. If you\'re in the mood for some stupid, crazy fun this might be worth the watch. You should be able to tell if this is for you with the first 2 episodes. It\'s sad that the manga it was adapted from got dropped, so this is probably all we\'re going to get. If you want more, I read somewhere that it sparked an actual sport in Portugal, so I guess that\'s where you\'ll have to go. joke, and Keijo knows it and has fun with it anyway.

On the other hand it's the most bizarre and shameless things I've ever seen, let's not beat around the bush you're here for the ass and tits, I know this, you know this, Keijo knows this, however it has the decency to try some world building and character building to not make it completely boring but this creates issues in some cases where it's half assed (no pun intended) and just falls flat on it's face, for exampleOne of the main characters, Sayaka, whole gimmick...is that they are really fast and has quick ass attacks however she then get's a rival for a bit called Rin who's gimmick is that they're even faster than Sayaka. The way Sayaka beats Rin is by fucking wedging herself mid match which apparently makes her ass faster, the question is then later on why doesn't Rin fucking do that and become quicker than Sayaka, then the question is why doesn't every character fucking do it.Banter between character's is relatively enjoyable there's a few good lines in it but it's nothing that hasn't been done in the genre before.Honestly this is the perfect junk anime to binge in like an afternoon since it's quite short, is relatively entertaining and has some decent high production eye candy. is that they are really fast and has quick ass attacks however she then get's a rival for a bit called Rin who's gimmick is that they're even faster than Sayaka.

In fact, I’m not sure whether it is a parody or not. It reminds me of a comic book called Frankencastle in which the Punisher (who is usually portrayed in violent, down-to-Earth stories) dies and is turned into a Frankenstein-like monster. The comic goes all in on the outlandish premise and has fun with it. Keijo feels the same way. It is the definition of, “dumb but fun.” On the other hand, the plot was stock, the characters were undeveloped, and I thought the premise quickly wore thin. I think it would be better...if there were fewer episodes, maybe 6 to 10 instead of a full 12. I don’t know if I would recommend it or not, especially if I cared what the person thought of me. if there were fewer episodes, maybe 6 to 10 instead of a full 12.

Our journey follows Nozomi Kaminashi as she grows from a passionate but unremarkable collegiate athlete into an aspiring professional player. In addition to weaponizing their boobs and butts and using various thrusts and pushes to knock the other girls into the water, many of the competitors have learned special techniques, which for all intents and purposes in this show are basically just magic, and they have...names like ""vacuum butt cannon"", ""gate to bootylon"" and ""hypno-boobs"". Hypno-boobs isn\'t just a wild name- it is in fact a ""dangerous"" and ""forbidden"" technique in which a competitor swings her breasts back and forth like a pendulum (you know, like hypnosis...) and quite literally immobilizes and incapacitates their opponent.Based on the above short paragraph alone you should immediately have an idea one way or another as to whether or not this might be up your alley. The base premise here is, of course, ridiculous and the program is completely self-aware, which it absolutely needs to be or this would not work whatsoever. The short 12 episode runtime, strong pacing with lots of matches and ever-increasing stakes and continuously more powerful opponents and the variety of special techniques and styles utilized by various competitors makes this a pretty easy watch for those not put off by the core of what the show is. I smirked and rolled my eyes a lot throughout my viewing experience, which I feel was both a strength and a weakness of the program. On one hand, it\'s a feel good anime and the kind of thing you can watch to unwind and derive some cheap amusement from. On the other hand, what I really enjoyed about somewhat similar shows that I\'ve watched- High School of the Dead and Prison School coming to mind immediately- is that they went absolutely all in with their concept and made a point to make things as extreme, ridiculous and laughable as possible. Watching those shows I was often LAUGHING, sometimes even CACKLING, whereas watching this I was certainly smirking a lot but it never quite went beyond that for me. As weird as it sounds given the base premise, this show is actually pretty tame. In this case there\'s an actual sport and an actual plot and it just happens to have lots and lots and lots of fan service.Accents in anime are a tricky subject and certainly a subject I\'ve complained about in numerous other reviews (looking at you Baccano, Ghost Hunt and Vinland Saga) and this program will unfortunately join that list. Our main character in both the sub and the dub talks with what could easily be perceived as a US South~ accent, which is fine if the main character were to simply state that she is from ""abroad"" or ""I moved a lot as a kid"" or something to that effect, but instead when the main character and her roommates meet for the first time they all discuss where they\'re from and they all specifically make a point to state that they grew up in various parts of Japan. The accent used not only doesn\'t match the backstory but it also simply irks me and stands out in a bad way on numerous occasions. I was only able to hear ""changin\'"" rather than ""changing"" or ""comin\'"" rather than ""coming"" so many times before I was annoyed by it. This felt like a strange and unnecessary choice that didn\'t add anything to the anime.This show also suffers from the same problem that most battle anime do in that there are numerous occasions in which competitors would rather stop and chat or provide exposition dump than actually fight.  It\'s especially egregious in team battles where competitors cannot be bothered to do the logical thing of going over to help their teammates and achieve a knockout via a numbers advantage. Instead, they sit back and wait, or just have a conversation, while letting their teammate fight a competitor one on one. One battle seems to wait for another to finish or at least reach a stopping point before making progress even though they\'re all supposed to be happening at the same time.My wife enjoyed the opening song. Personal taste blah blah. I found the music generic and forgettable here. The soundtrack isn\'t a strong point of this anime, nor does it try to be.They\'re three minutes each and not worthy of their own review, but I\'d quickly mention if you enjoyed the base program the Keijo OVAs are worth a watch. They\'re quick, light-hearted and generally amusing. In some ways they have more creativity than the show itself. I wish the base program had gone as wacky and off the rails as some of these. If you do watch them, do so after watching the base program for maximum appreciation.At the end of the day I liked Keijo and derived enough amusement and entertainment from it to give it a thumbs up. I\'d happily watch a second season, which they absolutely set themselves up for and chose the correct stopping point to leave the door open for, but unfortunately as of the time of this review, early 2023, it\'s not looking overly likely that we\'ll ever see more of this. Circling back to where I began, however, ultimately you should be able to read only the opening paragraph and know whether or not this is something that might interest you, as I know this kind of show simply isn\'t for everyone. I personally liked it, but I marked it as ""mixed feelings"" rather than ""recommended"" because it\'ll surely be hit or miss and not something I\'d recommend for every anime watcher.OBJECTIVE RATING- 7-8PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 7.5 names like ""vacuum butt cannon"", ""gate to bootylon"" and ""hypno-boobs"".

We got our MC Nozomi Kaminashi who want to reach her dream, get money becoming famous. There were some backround Story on some Characters, but not on all.So i gave them a solid 6 because, on the one hand it was a normal motivation, you have the plot-twist with Sayaka Miyata and her Father and some other nice things. The Characters were neither flat or deep.The Story was continues and the Characters developed....and were...talking about battleling in a Swimsuit here^^Sound 7 Enjoyment 10What i really liked about this Anime were its Sound and enjoyment.

Nothing to complain about here.So overall, of course its a Fan-Service Show, but thats what i like about it. There is a Story. The Fan-Service, is part of this Story. Not like some other Animes, with random Pantie shots etc.... Keijo is played on the ""land"" around Water. The Story is more likely based on the fact they all nearly wear nothing ^^ And still it manages to find a balance, between the WTF moments and the Humourous, Funny lovely Moments.

So, does Keijo still hold up? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryThe best thing I can say about Keijo is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and just tries to have fun with its premise. Who would have thought that a sport in which competitors can only use their breasts and butts to hit each other could be so entertaining?

Like I said before, this show has no intention of taking itself seriously and just wants to have fun with its premise and this is best depicted when the characters use powers and techniques that wouldn't look out of place in more traditional shonen anime like Dragon Ball or Naruto.

(7/10)"", 'The average Keijo enjoyer is a true gentleman, able to appreciate stunning art, and masterful storytelling. You do not simply ""watch"" Keijo, but rather absorb it, infuse yourself with it, and merge with it. The director behind the anime truly understands the human psyche and how it works/functions, allowing for you to feel as though you too are within the show, right next to the characters. Any person who views this show will come out changed, and will become a much better person. I believe that any person that gives this show a miss does not only do a disservice to themselves, but to their...entire country, for it will mean that they cannot be a true intellectual, and that they cannot properly understand the hidden layers behind society.Also there is nice boobs and ass👍 entire country, for it will mean that they cannot be a true intellectual, and that they cannot properly understand the hidden layers behind society.Also there is nice boobs and ass👍', 'I came for the culture and stayed for the surprisingly well-executed portrayal of an undeniably absurd sport concept xDI\'ll get a few things out of the way;1. I\'d put watching Keijo off for ages, because the concept itself isn\'t something along the lines of what I\'d normally watch.2. I went into watching this with the preconception that it\'d be something funny and would basically require watching with my brain switched off.3. I am fully aware the anime defies the laws of physics, the laws of time and probably a few other laws that would normally negatively affect a rating, hehSo......Story - 6/10There isn\'t too much going on in terms of story content here, but in the context of Keijo mostly being a fanservice sports anime, I think it can be forgiven for not having too much story content. Obviously ""too much"" does imply that there is some story content, which mostly comes in the form of backstory and context , which I appreciate. I\'ll admit that the progression of events was a bit predictable towards the end, though was pleasantly surprised by the execution, which I applaud.Art - 7/10Nothing too special going on here, at least where the ordinary scenes are concerned. Pretty much everything takes place under bright light in the daytime, so I can\'t say much about the art-style beyond that it works well for what scenes there are and the comedic skits that often turn up.However, as is probably to be expected from an anime focused on fanservice, the detail thrown into character appearances, actions and costume design is understandably quite good.The area that the anime does the best, unsurprisingly, is the ""races"" (or matches/ battles as I\'ll call them), with very good animation for special moves used in combat by the characters, especially later on in the series, where the sense of intensity definitely gets ratcheted up thanks to the art-style.Sound - 9/10I\'m disappointed that the OST/ score was never released ;-;The voice acting throughout the season was generally pretty good, setting the scene for a variety of emotions and energy levels quite eloquently. Of course, the ecchi and yuri content gets pretty good service from the voice acting as well, which is always a good thing.The ED and OP are okay, but the score/ orchestral music that gets used throughout the season is definitely the centrepiece of the sound set. Using all of the instrument families very well, with brass, strings, woodwind and the drum kit being the most prominent, the training sequences and battles were made so much more enjoyable[/ engaging to watch, thanks to the beautifully arranged accompanying music.As stated earlier, it\'s a shame that the composed music was never released 💔Character - 7/10Accounting for the fact that this is a fanservice-driven sports anime, the characters are created very well, in relation to the concept ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)A very wide variety of moves and behaviours are displayed throughout the season. Each character having specific moves, which go hand-in-hand with their body-type, background and/ or personality, which I found surprisingly sophisticated. I\'ll be honest; I will likely forget the names of characters (there are quite a lot of them), but am pretty certain that I won\'t forget their appearance, fighting abilities or general behaviours...Enjoyment - 9/10Yes, it ignores a bunch of laws, yes it has a very simple concept and yes, there isn\'t much of a story, but let\'s be honest, did any of us come to watch Keijo thinking it would be anything more than endless fanservice? That said, I got more than I bargained for, with a large helping of good action sequences, pretty good ecchi content mixed in, a dash of yuri content, a sprinkling of references to other popular  anime/ culture and a pinch of wholesomeness as well, to make this one really fun anime to watch. Despite my reservations prior to watching Keijo, I\'m actually pretty happy I decided to give it a go.Overall - 8/10It\'s by no means perfect, but I respect and appreciate the utterly shameless manner in which this concept has been delivered.

This is most likely due to the fact that I can not trust the regular anime fan anymore thanks to very unfitting recommendations over the years. So colour me surprised then Keijo turns out to be a real gem of a show.This is mostly to both playing it’s absurd premise straight but also doing what in...many animes these days seem to be missing, basic character arcs. As weird as it sounds, a lot of shows just seem to only establish a character and then just leaving it there for 12 episodes (or more). This has struck me as odd. While character development is not required for a good story it is generally more interesting to have it as it makes stories more dynamic. It serves especially well in the sports anime genre as characters have to develop and grow not just physically but also mentally. Keijo does that with flying colours and while these arcs are not particularly outstanding for the genre, the fact that it has them at all is more praise I can give then to any of the million and one Isekai shows we seem to get every season now.Our 2 main characters get the most of the development but their opponents are not far behind(ha!). The characters themselves are well defined(no, not that kind(well yes, that kind too but you know what I mean)) but nothing out of the ordinary and this works in favor of the show, trying not to overcomplicate motivations and background less they run in that all too familiar wall of convolutedness plaguing so many shows.But the most impressive feat the show pulls in terms of characters is the final opponent Nozomi has to face: Maya Sakashiro. Rarely do we see an accurate or sensible depiction of Dissociative identity disorder (DID, previously known as multiple personality disorder) but it’s the show where they fight with their butts of all things that does it’s homework on that front. If for nothing else, watch the show for this alone.But we have to talk about the elephant in the room. The Ecchi nature of the show would usually be a deterrent but here it’s handled in a way which I feel a lot of shows could learn from quite a bit. Maybe it’s the sports nature of it that makes it not linger too much on shots or the sheer normalization of the female body this show has to engage in to make its premise work.Whatever it is it turns it from a horndog show into something more. Adding to that is the rather wholesome nature of the show. Nobody gets left behind, everyone gets a moment to shine and even the oddest characters get to have a place here. I bet we didn’t coin it but the term Hornsome(wholesome and horny) is absolutely fitting.Speaking of fitting, the soundscape created by the show is fantastic and is fitting like a glove. Whoever did the sound effects on this is a master and deserves all the praise you can give. I didn’t know how a sport like Keijo would sound like but now I can not imagen it sounding anything else like cracking whips, colossal collisions and sonic booms. I am glad this isn’t a real sport so the fantasy of sound it creates will stay untarnished by reality.And that’s all I really have to say I guess. It’s absolutely worth a watch and deserves a spot on our recommendation list.Personal Score: 8/10Zyggy:Bust or… Bust?The biggest shock about watching Keijo!! was fanservice. But, not in the way you'd expect, as so much of the show is suffused with a particular sort of earnestness and charm, that even while being horny and fanservice-y, it remained wholesome. Hornsome, if you will. The animation is more than acceptable, with particular detail (but not frustratingly so) being paid to the assets of our cast.And while that might seem obvious, given the show's subject matter, what isn't obvious is the fact that Keijo is a shockingly good sports anime. Characters learn and grow through their time in the training camp- both in skills and in personality. While actual character arcs begin and end in the first 3 episodes!I can give a Keijo a full chested recommendation, with the caveat that it might be a bit much for people not used to the usual anime bs.Personal Score: 8/10Sophia:I’d also heard a lot about Keijo!! before, from people whose opinions I don’t entirely disrespect but don’t necessarily trust either - so, going in, I was at least intrigued, if not excited, to discover whether it would live up to those recommendations.I ended up completely blown away.Keijo!! is a good show. Like, really good, and no, not in an ironic sense.The first thing that impressed me was how well-handled the fanservice was - not just in that, for once, all the girls are 18 or older, and the characters demonstrate a greater degree of body diversity than 90% of anime I’ve watched, but in that the show is remarkably self-aware. Not self-aware in the “ironically cracking jokes at its own expense to an insufferable degree” way that too many modern anime do (it actually plays itself mostly straight), but in a sense where the characters themselves are aware that they are sexualized, and are choosing to be so. Their actions rarely feel like contrivances to deliver fanservice, but fully in keeping with the progression of plot and character (that just happen to also deliver fanservice).Speaking of the characters - Keijo!!’s characters are surprisingly well-written, entertaining, and actually have better-realized character arcs than a lot of more “prestigious” anime manage to deliver - in particular, our protagonist, who lets us know from the beginning that she’s only in it for the money yet demonstrates as much hot-blooded determination to get that bread as any typical shounen protagonist does for their more “pure” motivations.Oh, and it has lesbians. Like, not just vaguely-lesbian titillation for fanservice purposes, but major, recurring female characters who are explicitly sexually attracted to women - and quite positively portrayed at that. As a lesbian myself, this was particularly appealing to me. And, genuinely surprisingly, one of the most genuinely accurate and respectful portrayals of Dissociative Identity Disorder (frequently known as “multiple personalities”) I’ve seen anywhere in fiction.All in all, for a show we were planning to watch mostly ironically, Keijo!! actually turned out to be one of the best shows we’ve watched.Personal Score: 9/10Few Ideas done right— by TitaniaI watched Keijo!!!!!!!! (競女!!!!!!!!), also known as Hip Whip Girl when it came out.As a fan of Sexy bodies (Male and Female)And sports stories especially in anime or manga style I was pretty excited about watching it, and before I say anything else I will say I liked the show it was very enjoyable. It doesn’t really do anything wrong and is serviceable. But overall it’s not anything special aside from its main “anime about fighting with butts and tits”First let me say the things I liked. The references this show makes to other anime with it’s special moves and how the world around the characters changes to express how epic each move is just brings a smile to your face. I really don’t want to spoil anything but any Fate fan will have moments where they want to applaud the screen.I also quite appreciate that it surprisingly does have more than one kind of body type present that isn’t just the same base model but with bigger boobs like so many anime of these kind do. It’s not much but it’s better than most.The Four Main characters are pretty good with the main character Nozomi being very likable and having a very understandable goal of getting rich but over the course of the anime learns to really love the sport of Keijo.The Secondary main character Sayaka is also likable although also comes across as self aggrandizement. In a Vacuum (Not the Butt cannon kind) her story is sweet and pretty progressive in some aspects but I can’t help but think how weird it is to write a story about a fake sport that is meant for fan service and have someone realize the sport is valid when the character is showing their glowing nipples on screen. Again in context everything makes sense and if Keijo was real I would probably sign up and would hope my family was supportive so if you can accept the absurdity and be pulled into the show her story is pretty good. (I know Keijo was played in real life but not to the level of sports like soccer and basketball, but who knows maybe in 20 years it will be that much of a big deal but for now these are my feelings)My third favorite of the main characters is Non she is a very good source of comic relief and my only disappointment is that she doesn’t get to do more and becomes fodder by the end. (It could also be my bias for appreciating fuller bodies)The first antagonists the Elite of the school are also quite good and each are perfect foils to the people they fight.Most media with “DID” often portrays them as violent monsters and Keijo didn’t, although I don’t know how much it stems from being a sports anime and not a fighting anime. Stills credit where credit is due.Now for my main criticism.Kazane the fourth Main character honestly for the amount of screen time she had and the hype around her abilities I wish she had been more powerful or rather had a bigger impact on the story.She felt like the most boring of the group and if it wasn’t for her final ability she would probably not even feel like a main character.She is not bad but felt like lost potential.The second part of the series is where most of the problems are present. First the second school just feels like a retread of the Elites but worse. You were made to think the main characters were in the best school but then it turns out there is an even better school and they haven’t won against them in forever. The Elites had a better life compared to the normal students but then suddenly they also become the poor underdogs and it’s the second school that has all the fancy social status. Now I like a good underdog and finance story but 1 it wasn’t resolved in the first instance and 2 it makes you feel like you were lied to in the beginning.Aside from that I will say the rest of the arc is pretty enjoyable until we come across the main and final villain. At the start they seemed cool but then the Dissociative Identity Disorder stuff and overshadowing of other characters just made it more boring for me.Now I don’t mind the Main villain Maya/Kaya being overpowered as I did like how all the girls combined their powers to have Nozomi even be able to fight her. But the way they showed it came at other characters expense. I was really looking forward to have other heavy set character fight who isn’t a teacher but they have them act as a jobber to show her powers but having not seen enough of them beforehand is just made the series more boring for me.I don’t know much about Dissociative Identity Disorder so I don’t know how accurate the portrayal was but I can say it felt cliched while watching it.These more unlikable parts of the story are probably a result of the medium and time constraints the people who made it were under causing them to rely on tired tropes or repeat plot lines. Keijo allegedly had even more pressure put on its creators but if you are interested I encourage you to do your own research.To end on a positive note I will say that:Overall Keijo is a series where you can really feel the love and thought the animators and the story tellers had when they made it with many surprises on how they would try to implement the silly premise of Keijo next and is very skilled at making likable characters for the most part. Had it been given more time it could have gone with the all time grades but it’s by no means a bad watch.Personal Score:6/10 unless you are really into buttsand or sport anime then it’s a 7/10.Winterprison: Surprisingly DeepWhen we first started watching Keijo, I had no idea the depths it would reach. When I heard about this show's premise, I expected shallow characters with no personality, but I was shocked and surprised to see entire character arcs occur in the first few episodes.The story that Keijo tells is weirdly inspiring and full of fanservice in a way that didn't totally creep me out as an audience member. This is a how very willing to show a great degree of body diversity in comparison to most anime/manga.The characters are also surprisingly well written for a series with such a ridiculous concept. There are character arcs for nearly everyone in the cast.This show is simply surprising with the depth it gives the ridiculous story and characters. It has a sense of fun that helps motivate the audience to watch more. The way it combines the horny elements with wholesome stuff is very interesting compared to the way fanservice elements are usually tackled.Personal Score 8/10 many animes these days seem to be missing, basic character arcs. As weird as it sounds, a lot of shows just seem to only establish a character and then just leaving it there for 12 episodes (or more). This has struck me as odd.

I was really looking forward to have other heavy set character fight who isn’t a teacher but they have them act as a jobber to show her powers but having not seen enough of them beforehand is just made the series more boring for me.I don’t know much about Dissociative Identity Disorder so I don’t know how accurate the portrayal was but I can say it felt cliched while watching it.These more unlikable parts of the story are probably a result of the medium and time constraints the people who made it were under causing them to rely on tired tropes or repeat plot lines. Keijo allegedly had even more pressure put on its creators but if you are interested I encourage you to do your own research.To end on a positive note I will say that:Overall Keijo is a series where you can really feel the love and thought the animators and the story tellers had when they made it with many surprises on how they would try to implement the silly premise of Keijo next and is very skilled at making likable characters for the most part. Had it been given more time it could have gone with the all time grades but it’s by no means a bad watch.Personal Score:6/10 unless you are really into buttsand or sport anime then it’s a 7/10.Winterprison: Surprisingly DeepWhen we first started watching Keijo, I had no idea the depths it would reach. When I heard about this show's premise, I expected shallow characters with no personality, but I was shocked and surprised to see entire character arcs occur in the first few episodes.The story that Keijo tells is weirdly inspiring and full of fanservice in a way that didn't totally creep me out as an audience member. This is a how very willing to show a great degree of body diversity in comparison to most anime/manga.The characters are also surprisingly well written for a series with such a ridiculous concept. There are character arcs for nearly everyone in the cast.This show is simply surprising with the depth it gives the ridiculous story and characters. It has a sense of fun that helps motivate the audience to watch more. The way it combines the horny elements with wholesome stuff is very interesting compared to the way fanservice elements are usually tackled.Personal Score 8/10"", 'Don\'t get me wrong, this show is terrible. Its complete smut. Actual trash anime. That said, its probably one of the few shows I\'ve seen in a long time that made me laugh hard. It\'s ridiculous and I love every minute of it. The sheer hilarity of the sport and the seriousness of the characters really is the cherry on top for me. The secret techniques are my favorite part. How the series tries it\'s hardest to play it straight and as unaware of its fanservice is a fine line and they really nailed it. Its ""fanservice the anime."" Tits & ass, need I say...more? more?', 'Story: 4/10There is honestly not a real story 😅. It\'s between a school anime and a sport anime, idk how to describe it better. The ""school parts"" are the one that makes the note be low, because the girls don\'t have a real personality (except Sayaka). The friendships are weird, like they become friend with no reason in 1hour. The sport part is really different, I usually don\'t like sport anime, but this one makes you so enthusiasts! When watching, I was so hipped by the game that I almost forgot it was an anime Xd.Characters: 8.5/10This is the good side of this anime:...the characters are so original!

It\'s really fluid and the game moments are well made, so you can feel the action.Fan service: 4.5/10Obviously, with this kind of story, you can\'t escape from HUGE fan service, but I was expecting something way harder.

On the other hand  you may enjoy because it brings a weird twist to sport and fantasy genre of anime. Sometimes you may find yourself getting annoyed with special moves you may see in this show and this show is also known for one of the most iconic memes. In my opinion I found it mediocre at most just because how plain weird it is. Other than that watch at your own will...and it's up to you if you love it or hate it and it's up to you if you love it or hate it"", 'Keijo, at first sight, appears to be little more than a fanservice show and to be honest, it is just that, fanservice. There is no hidden depth, no secret meaning or anything, just fanservice. However, Keijo is absolutely brilliant at it.  Keijo, roughly summarised is about girls (and only girls) who participate in a martial-art like sport called ""Keijo"" where participants have to knock each other off floating platforms in a pool called a “land” using only their breasts and backsides. And I must say, they make the most of the premise. In all conceivable ways. Everything from the characters to the action is...great. Now, I know I said there was no depth or complexity to this anime however it is a surprisingly good action show. It has the feel of an shounen tournament arc or a ""sport"" anime like Girls und Panzer. In fact, Girls und Panzer is a fairly decent comparison in that both shows have a team of plucky underdogs who go up against stronger opponents in a series of tournaments and use ingenious tactics to do so. And like Girls und Panzer, there are no hard feelings on either side. The antagonists are antagonists without being villains, which, to be honest I find refreshing. In fact the series has little to no ""evil"" or hateful characters. Its just a fun fanservice show with great (combat) action.This brings me on to my next point, the fights. The fights themselves are genuinely entertaining as fights. The show creates a surprisingly diverse and interesting array of combat techniques and tactics that create some very enjoyable fights. The fights themselves are never the same and the same can be said for the antagonists. Keijo, despite being a fanservice show, has a diverse range of character body types from the types you\'d expect, namely, voluptuous busty ladies to small cuter girls and even muscular and plump girls. And this adds to the diverse and imaginative nature of the fights- characters in Keijo use their body types to their advantage. In all, the fights are great and feel surprisingly well thought out for a fanservice show and the ""sport"" of Keijo feels quite intelligently designed for fanservice show.The characters themselves are enjoyable to watch, each with their own unique quirk. Protagonist Nozomi Kaminashi, Kazana Aoba, Sayaka Miyata and Mio Kusakai were particular favourites however the things I liked about them were their relatable goals- Nozomi for example not only enjoys Keijo but wants to become rich. In fact, she has a brief argument with Miyata over wealth. Miyata wanted to buy her parents a golden massage chair, then Nozomi copied the idea. These goals such as ""I want to become rich"" make its characters far more relatable in comparison to the more power of friendship and morality types we usually get. The protagonists of Keijo feel comparatively down to earth in comparison to others show\'s protagonists. Finally this show has some great references to other shows such as ""Gates of Bootylon"" (Fate/Stay Night References) and Buttack on Titan (Attack on Titan). Also, the shows fanservice premise is put to full use with both genuinely hilarious attack names, situations, dialogue and fights. Overall, Keijo is a great fanservice anime that is hilarious and has surprisingly good action. The fanservice itself is actually great and the show is enjoyable. That being said, if you don\'t like fanservice you won\'t like this show. great. Now, I know I said there was no depth or complexity to this anime however it is a surprisingly good action show.

I will admit the story and character development was a little lacking, it had a few things that were very cliche sports anime but regardless characters and the story were still up to the level of a mainstream anime. Then to finish...it off the show was very enjoyable I could barely keep myself from watching it until I finished it, truly an amazing show.

One episode led to me watching the entire season by myself.I watched the dub, and some of the actors all have the weirdest accents that could only be described as ""Southern Kawaii"".

It does not take itself seriously at all and goes all in terms of its absurdity. I think the series plays very well to its strengths and is therefore very enjoyable. If you want somethng serious, look elsewhere. The butt related attacks are so silly and hilarious, I cant help but laugh. The series is short and has great pacing, not many moments where things drag.ArtThe artwork and animation was defintiely better than expected. The animation is smooth and nice to look at. Very consistently good...art work and animation as well.SoundNot much to write home about in terms of sound. The sound effects for the attacks are pretty neat though.CharacterI think this was the biggest weakness of the series. The characters have limited depth to them. This is far more prevalent in the one shot rivals. The main cast feels like they belong as the supporting cast in another anime.  The motivations for their actions in the sport of keijo are not well developed.EnjoymentThe series exceeded expectations. The show goes all in in their devotion to be as silly and absurd as possible. The tone is very consistent throughout and there is a lot of creativity and entertainment in the special attacks.

Humor can be very toilet humor like with a lot of butt puns, but overall it works if you turn your brain off.OverallThis is an enjoyable silly series.

The way they took such a ridiculous concept so serious was hilarious.This anime is the perfect test for if you like shonen or not. This series proved that you can apply the shonen formula to anything and it will be hype. There is a manga where a girl turns into a spider but because they use the shonen formula it is not wierd at all.It also has a concept where...it makes you go ""I have to see this"" making it very easy to get into like some other anime.I found myself hyped up at their abilities and battles and that made it even funnier for me.I am a simple man if I enjoy something I give it a good score. 8/10 (maybe I will re-watch it one day and it will become a 9/10 but not yet) it makes you go ""I have to see this"" making it very easy to get into like some other anime.I found myself hyped up at their abilities and battles and that made it even funnier for me.I am a simple man if I enjoy something I give it a good score. 8/10 (maybe I will re-watch it one day and it will become a 9/10 but not yet)', 'Keijo is a fan service/ sports comedy anime focused on the titular competitive sport where the female players go against one another on a floating platform called a Land where they use either their breasts or butts to try either knocking their opponents off the Land or have them fall to the ground. The series mainly focuses on a skilled gymnast named Nozomi Kaminashi who wishes to enter the sport to become wealthy enough to get her family out of poverty and is trained in the ins and outs of the sport before she can go pro.As you might surmise from the anime’s premise, Keijo’s...gimmick is mostly an excuse to show off as many fan service shots as it can get out of its female cast and the series is certainly rife with enough of it. Close camera shots of boobs and butts, girls undressing, bathing scenes, skimpy bathing suits, and suggestive predicaments are pretty much the norm throughout Keijo’s 12-episode run. If there’s a plus to this though, Keijo is actually pretty tasteful for the most part with showing off its fan service as its female cast are drawn well enough to be pleasant on the eyes, having a variety of body types, and the series doesn’t resort to gross-out humor for its naughty moments.I suppose if there’s a positive to Keijo, it would be that the series knows how ridiculous its premise is and relishes in it. The Keijo matches are rather creative in showing some rather ridiculous attacks that the characters make use of with their butts and boobs against opponents. It milks sports anime tropes to show how overly enthusiastic some of the characters like Nozomi can be in their devotion to training and improving within the sport, including showing off the mentioned ridiculous attacks with their butts and boobs.Ultimately though in regards to depth, Keijo doesn’t have much beneath the surface. As mentioned, it is still milking sports anime tropes and its premise is still an excuse to milk fan service from its female cast. The female cast mostly follow anime character types you would find in one form or another, as any backstory on them is mostly window dressing in a superficial attempt to give them motive for their participation in Keijo.While I’ll give some kudos to Keijo for knowing not to take its premise too seriously and relishing in it, it is still a fan service title that doesn’t have much going for it in terms of depth beyond over-the-top sports action with boob and butt attacks coming from its mostly attractive female cast. Fan service anime fans are likely to give this a watch.

Just take your ""favorite shounen"" and swap out the power system for butts and boobs (including the attacks) and then you have Keijo. Everything is there, the training montages, the conversations about will and friendship, bizarre powers and the power of feelings.There is almost no creativity behind this concept, since it is an immensely simple shounen parody. Simple yes, but as soon as the characters start fighting with their asses, teleporting or doing judo with their nipples, you reach a limit...of ""insanity"" and that was... new.

Generally, I don\'t enjoy ecchi as a genre. I am an adult, after all, and if I want to watch porn, I\'ll just watch porn, not this half-assed(pun unintented) softcore fanservice stuff, but I will admit I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.I\'ve seen a lot of people compare this to Free! in the sense of fanservice, but unless the characters in Free! are hitting each other with only their butts and balls, I don\'t think that\'s a fair comparison.I also need to give the show some credit where credit is due, all of the characters, at least...in the translation I watched, were specified to be 18+, and it was strongly implied that they were attending some sort of college. Most shows I\'ve seen that contain some kind of fanservice element don\'t limit their fanservice to solely adult characters, which can make adult watchers like me who aren\'t particularly attracted to the panties of a 14 year old girl somewhat uncomfortable.My criticisms of the show aren\'t exclusive to it as a show, they are prevalent within the ecchi genre. There was hardly any character development, the plot could easily be summarized as ""softcore porn"", and the websites that host it don\'t seem to make any effort to stop minors from accessing said softcore porn. I can guarantee you at least half the watchers of this show are under 18.Story-2I\'m sorry, but the story was nonexistest. I think the enjoyment of the story here comes solely from how ridiculous the plot was. That being said, I enjoyed the story more than kill la kill, and as a concept the story was pretty goofy. I enjoyed the somewhat realistic aspect of, if this was a real sport, chances are the top players would probably be lesbians, as most heterosexual women I know don\'t particularly fancy rubbing their butts and boobs against other women. I doubt anyone would take this seriously as a real sport, so the fact that the characters were taking it so seriously was pretty funny too.Art-5The art style looked standard for what it was. I don\'t really have any comments about it, it wasn\'t overly cutesy or moe, but it wasn\'t super unique and notable either.Sound-6The sound was fine, I don\'t have much to say about it. I\'m not going to go out of my way to listen to the keijo!!!! soundtrack or anything, but it wasn\'t like it was making my ears bleed.Character-4In a true ecchi fashion, the show introduced characters, lewded them, and then completely forget they existed, and by the end of it there were so many I couldn\'t keep track of any of them. The problem with shows like this is that the only point of introducing characters is to objectify them, and once that\'s done the audience gets bored with them so they have to throw in more, and more, and more.Enjoyment-5As said, as a person who doesn\'t particularly enjoy the genre, I ended up enjoying the show more than I thought I would. What you see is what you get. There\'s no plot twists or big reveals, its just mindless boob and butt eye candy for a viewer who may be too young to look at anything more revealing. The concept being so ridiculous made it somewhat humorous, and it was well done for what it is.Overall-4I would never go out of my way to watch this again or recommend it to a friend, but it wasn\'t the worst thing in the world. I just wish adults would be more responsible with media like this. If softcore ecchi with no plot other than ""hehe boobie"" is your thing, then go for it. If that\'s not your taste, then I\'d stay away from this one. in the translation I watched, were specified to be 18+, and it was strongly implied that they were attending some sort of college.

I don\'t really have any comments about it, it wasn\'t overly cutesy or moe, but it wasn\'t super unique and notable either.Sound-6The sound was fine, I don\'t have much to say about it. I\'m not going to go out of my way to listen to the keijo!!!! soundtrack or anything, but it wasn\'t like it was making my ears bleed.Character-4In a true ecchi fashion, the show introduced characters, lewded them, and then completely forget they existed, and by the end of it there were so many I couldn\'t keep track of any of them. The problem with shows like this is that the only point of introducing characters is to objectify them, and once that\'s done the audience gets bored with them so they have to throw in more, and more, and more.Enjoyment-5As said, as a person who doesn\'t particularly enjoy the genre, I ended up enjoying the show more than I thought I would. What you see is what you get. There\'s no plot twists or big reveals, its just mindless boob and butt eye candy for a viewer who may be too young to look at anything more revealing. The concept being so ridiculous made it somewhat humorous, and it was well done for what it is.Overall-4I would never go out of my way to watch this again or recommend it to a friend, but it wasn\'t the worst thing in the world. I just wish adults would be more responsible with media like this. If softcore ecchi with no plot other than ""hehe boobie"" is your thing, then go for it. If that\'s not your taste, then I\'d stay away from this one.', ""Keijoo is sport ecchi anime that is basically a hentai without the penetration or seeing reproductive organs.Hey, if you want to see a hentai with a story and that leaves you with room of imagination, here it is. You got yourself the story of young adult women that have to struggle to get the best Keijoo player in Japan.Let's start with the positives, shall we?1) Great animation. Gotta admit, the action choreography is pretty cool; the character design is above average, nothing too remarkable but hey it looks good and the movement is very fluid.2) Creative? Hey, who would have thought...of a sport that you have to use your titties and butt to quick so ass (heh, pun intended?)3) Uh... Has some story going on? It's cliché in most of it, but makes sense and it's entretaining somewhat.That's it, that's all the positives.Negatives? Well, where to start. It's a sport that involves kickin' some ass with some ass or titties if you want yo get spicy, like it's supposed to be funny? Like if this was supposed to be funny well, that's the ONLY joke in the whole anime.Is this a action comedy? If so, where's the comedy? Seeing some pervy scenes is funny? The jokes are: oh no I strip naked to identify my weakness and my friend is shocked by it so she kicks me out of the room, haha; oh haha the girl got assed in the face, huhu; oh the name of this attack is called darude buttstorm because she throws sand with the butt and there's this song called darude sandstorm, guys please laugh!The action is well animated and the fights where somewhat interesting, if they didn't stripped or get horny because the butt is been rubbed... Like this hentai with extra steps.I'm not going to judge you if you jacked off to this, if your only purpouse is to cum, then do it but it doesn't mean the anime is good. Hentai stories are not good, you only see them to orgasm but the actual story is stupid. This is stupid, a waste of time. of a sport that you have to use your titties and butt to quick so ass (heh, pun intended?)3) Uh... Has some story going on?

Does one judge it as a completely entertainment-focused installment with the trade off of not thinking critically about the material? Does one go the exact opposite route, sticking to pure, cold, subjective criticism at the risk of completely overthinking the subject and losing the intended meaning. Either way, Keijo!!!!!! Is certainly unique in its subject matter, if not in its themes.Animation for a show focused solely around boobs and butts generally isn’t stellar,but Keijo defies that notion with a feel much more...focused on the guise of being a sports show. Plenty of scenes use colorful, flowing animation to show increases or levels of ability, more in line with an action series that one focused on ecchi pool battles. The effort put in to make signature moves unique and distinct between characters helped to emphasize there differences on a very obvious level that supported the overall progression of the show. As a sports series, the theme of growth and improvement actually went hand in hand with the increasingly intense coloring and animation techniques, giving a physical representation of the progress the main cast made.Like the animation, the sound design for Keijo felt pulled out of shonen battle series rather than a sports show. The whole series is filled with upbeat and intense themes to accent the many competitions that make up the bulk of the series events. There are a few notably normal background songs used for traveling and city exploration, but otherwise Keijo had a very particular soundtrack that kept ramping up as the stakes of the show increased.Character development and defining features was a large but welcome surprise. Each character is differentiated first in look and then in style of movement and mannerisms. It would have been easy to have each embody a single trait or simple personality, but the cast runs the entire spectrum of humble to arrogant, energetic to reserved, and capable to beginner in a fashion that allows for each one to have growth while also managing to hold their own unique style during Keijo competitions. Priorities for who gets the most development and screen time felt mixed based on those considered to be main or supporting characters, but more time for developing side characters ending up working out well in this case. A great degree of emphasis was placed on individual improvement, whether on or off camera, and it was refreshing to see victory come from hard work and dedication.And the great sticking point of the show comes from the plot. Yes, the characters are well rounded and learn new skills to improve themselves. Yes there are a great variety of situations overcome with improvisation and individual assessment in a very believable session. There is even time alloted to the competitors to the main cast to make them sympathetic and present competitions as a fair competition of will and skill rather than a battle of good and bad. There is just one factor that drags down the rest of the otherwise well-executed storyKeijo is, without reservation, completely, mind boggling, cringingly stupid from the outset. It's a beautiful thing to see the straight faced attempt to make the sport seem like a serious event when its little more than an excuse to have fanservice in every episode. The special moves characters use also have a slow power creep from merely being names for moves to full on super powers and occasionally making things into a “who can scream the loudest competition” as characters smash their butts together. The effect is amazingly entertaining, but almost too dumb to bear. Keijo is a special case of something so bad it’s good, and is certainly worth a watch for the sheer entertainment value and as a lover of spectacle. focused on the guise of being a sports show.

Over the course of the series Takurou meets more mythical creatures, all of which are drastically different to what he was expecting.The show is made up of 13 minute episodes, and this short length is definitely a good thing; it means that the pacing is fast and concise, which is perfect for the humour used. Additionally it means that the show cannot string out jokes so that they become dull and monotonous. With reduced time slot,...there is only an opening, which is catchy, energetic, and crazy.This is just as well, because it suits the show rather well. The humour is off the wall, Muromi herself is crazy, thoughtless and flirtatious. Most of the jokes revolve around ""Takkun"" dealing with Muromi and her friends. The humour is a mix of weird stories into Muromi\'s past, adult jokes, mythical creatures being rather different to expectations, and the bizarre actions of Muromi and those around her.The characters are lack the depth of the seas they reside in, being made up of a couple of distinct character traits, however this is enough to fulfil their comedic roles, and they are likable. Yeti is absolutely adorable, so be prepared to clutch your heart when she appears on screen.The character designs are very 90\'s; huge eyes on a big round face, thus it\'s rather unique amongst anime being released in this decade. It serves the humour well as it allows Muromi to pull a wide variety of faces, and it is pleasant enough to look at, so although it\'s unusual, it\'s appealing. The quality of animation is low, however the basics are done right and so it isn\'t appalling to look at. Regardless the series has no need of a high budget, and so it doesn\'t undermine the viewing experience.Muromi-san on the Shore is a comedy and nothing more, so everything rides on how funny the jokes are. Whilst there are a fair few misses, the show is consistently amusing throughout its run, which will be more than enough to keep a smile on your face. That said, whilst amusing, only occasionally was it hilarious enough to evoke laughter. The gags are solid, but for a show that needs to rely so heavily upon its comedy they weren\'t good enough to carry the show to higher heights.Also, there will be many people who will not agree with the humour at all, in which case the show will be torturous to watch. After watching the first episode I would strongly recommend dropping it if you did not like what you saw, because it\'ll only be more of the same style of humour. For most people though this will not be a problem, since the zany humour is incredibly accessible.Overall, Muromi on the Shore is a show that will keep you well entertained, having some incredibly funny moments that will catch you off guard. However since it isn\'t good enough to keep you laughing consistently, the show, whilst being entertaining, is nothing more than that.

Likable, especially if you like mermaids. It's pretty short, and is worth a try.[Ed: Oh- I guess I should mention one of the mermaids is an oppai-having masochist, so a few episodes are particularly... Um... yeah- use your imagination... Anyway, if you like that sort of thing, there ya go.]Detailed Review:Essentially a modern day mythological reboot of mostly nautical monsters as personable characters, this creative anime is a comical look at the 'real' monsters of old, some retelling of their history, and how they relate to an ordinary human. Hijinks ensue.Story: 7Although the meat of the story is...nothing spectacular (it's slice-of-life), between the creativity and humor I give it a higher rating than I normally would.Art: 6The art and animation are good, focusing on a simpler style, but being slightly inconsistent within that style. It does a good job for what it is, though.Sound: 7The voice acting is quite good, and the effects and music are good as well. No ambient sounds in most scenes even though they're usually outside.Character: 7Though the types of characters chosen is pretty boilerplate- the interactions and dynamics of each are used more creatively than most, and even the stereotypical types are given quite a bit of personality beyond each cliche.Enjoyment: 7I like it a lot more than I thought I would.Overall: 7As a mythological 'reboot' with a lot of clever innovation, it's pretty good. nothing spectacular (it's slice-of-life), between the creativity and humor I give it a higher rating than I normally would.Art: 6The art and animation are good, focusing on a simpler style, but being slightly inconsistent within that style.

So, my ratings:Story: Fair 6Frankly there isn't any, this more like your cliche pesky girl coming into boy's life and makes a mess out of it, but then again, the comedy genre was the one that makes up for this anime.Art: Dreadful 2The art form was simply too messy and it look like some wanna be mangaka did a lousy job....Sound: Good 7The rating is for the opening theme and the seiyuu's who did Takkun and Muromi's voice.Character: Good 7I'd say for a character were one might wanna give Muromi a karate chop one here head for being so immature was basically the most entertaining part of this 12 min omake, Takkun on the other hand was this character whom one would wish to Muromi that Karate chop but I got to hand it to him since he is that opposite that gives the laughs.Enjoyment and overall: Good 7It was enjoyable though, it would have been nice if this 12 min omake would have been aired in the winter season because of the last episode which New Year is still a couple of months away.

While some of the episodes build on each other, most are self contained. What you get in this anime is exactly what it does well; gag skits. Literally every episode is something leading up to a gag. While most of the content in the show pertains to Japanese common knowledge, most subs will provide tooltips for the things you might not understand.Overall the show is really funny and...enjoyable; there just isn’t anything overly interesting going on.Animation: 9.9/10The animation is fresh, unique, and oozing with quality. Every scene looks amazing due to the lighting effects and over exaggeration animation style. The character models look great and the amount of quality in the shots remains constant if not better as the show progresses.Sound: 8.5/10The soundtrack was pretty interesting and diverse for an anime of this style. The opening song was some sort of weird mix of heavy metal and pop rock but was pretty good regardless. The voice actors did a tremendous job in this anime; each character’s personality was brought out extremely well due to some quality voiceovers.Characters: 8.5/10While I gave the character score a pretty good number, it’s not because the characters themselves are good (they are quite average actually); what the anime excels at is how well the interactions play off. The anime is so funny because of how the characters present themselves around others. While we do have some of the typical characters (big boob airhead, Cute airhead, ext.), Takurou and Muromi are surprisingly interesting. When put together, their performance is quite good due to the chemistry that slowly forms over time.Overall: 8.1/10This was a real shocker; while I normally stray away from the shorter time format anime, I am so glad I followed this one. The amazing animation style coupled with the funny characters and comedic scenes makes this anime a must watch for those looking for a quick laugh.Enjoyment: 8/10Thanks for reading my review!

Along with second half not living up to first, it's not something I can easily recommend, other than maybe watching first 4 episodes for the kicks."", 'Namiuchigiwa no Muromi-san (Muromi-san)So one day I was talking with some great people when I happened to link an image to a super cute mermaid. I then followed it up saying I need more mega cute mermaid pictures when Cajun came out of nowhere and recommended Muromi-san! What a recommendation, what an anime, it’s absolutely crazy!Muromi-san is about mermaids who are nothing like you’d imagine. Muromi is the star of the show, she’s over a million years old, is super cute, hates birds (don’t all fish?!!) and loves the land! We also have Takka-kun, the young boy who happens to fish Muromi out...of the waters! This begins the anime and all the crazy things that happen! Each episode is around 13 minutes long, they are quite episodic, they make no sense at all, it’s super cute and it’s best to not try and make sense of things that are thrown your way!For the mermaids, we have Muromi, as stated above, then we have Levia-san (Leviathan), she’s also ridiculously cute, has an amazing mermaid body and can transform to an actual Leviathan when she chooses; she’s also responsible for destroying civilizations and all sorts of things! There is Fuji-san, she has super large oppai and Muromi-san can’t stand them at all; Muromi will grope, pull and use creatures of the ocean against Fuji-san’s large oppai; yes, it’s very very very ecchi/lewd. We also have Hii-chan, Muromi’s “imouto”, though not really. She likes dolphins and other aquatic animals and is also super cute. Sumida-san is the last mermaid, though honestly, she’s not in much of the anime to be remembered unfortunately =(. Aside from cute mermaids we also have a yeti (Trust me, you have no idea) and a Harpy (nothing like what the legends describe as). Yeti is a super small, super cute girl who rescued Harpy when she was caught in a trap and a friend of Muromi. Harpy…. Well she’s a harpy in only the cutest and most anime of sense; she’s a small “harpy” who forgets everything she just remembered every time she takes 3 steps…. Yeah it’s really funny, and because Harpy is a bird, she loves to try and eat Muromi any chance she can.The cast of characters are great, there are a few others that get some screen time as well, and the combination of Muromi and co. make watching Muromi-san incredibly fun. The entire anime is what I would call ecchi and lewd, though not in ways you would expect, I guess. It’s very much a comedy and slice of life though, so if you like that type of genre and you want to watch mermaids do things they probably shouldn’t or couldn’t do, this is right up your alley!The art style is incredibly simple, there is no detail in just about anything, aside from Takka-kun and the mermaids + support characters. Maaaaaybe because of a budget, maaaaybe because it’s a short, no idea why, but it’s noticeable. It’s also not entirely bad either, since Muromi-san somehow avoids the need for extra detailed environments and things of that nature. The colors are really vibrant and eye popping though; it looks really good and is very pleasant. Animation is another area in which I would have to say is…. Poor I guess. There are many repeated frames, either to prolong a scene or to give effect to something happening, it happens a lot more often in the latter half of the anime too; once again, I feel like it’s a budget thing or Muromi-san just wasn’t taken seriously or something… I don’t really know, but I doubt there is a good excuse for doing it on purpose; on that note, animation is not its strong suit.Music… Hmmm, good question. The OP starts off really well, but has these minor/quiet death growls that sort of just ruin it for me; I tend to skip the OP once that section comes on. The ED is fantastic though and totally worth listening through 100%. The rest of the BGM and ambient sounds are forgettable I guess. Honestly, I just got done watching the short and am having a hard time remembering a memorable piece of music or anything. Could be my fault or not, but it’s not that much of a strong suit.Overall, Muromi-san has super cute mermaids, it’s a short which only lasts 6 normal episodes of anime (13 short episodes), has some amazing and ridiculous scenes with Muromi and co., and is totally funny and very very cute. It’s also a bit on the ecchi side and that’s always fun too. I think it’s worth a watch, especially since it’s not very long at all. A solid 8/10. of the waters!

Yes, the whole point is ""holy moly! mermaids are real!"" but none of the mermaids are really that interesting, nor do they add anything to the (non-existent) plot of the show. The mermaids don\'t contrast each other well, even if acting slightly different they all share INCREDIBLY similar personalities, making a great majority of the main characters pointless other than having the watcher experience some ounce of shock...value and to add useless filler in an attempt to grow a connection. Not having very many tropes or ""dere"" present is usually fine, but it\'s honestly something this anime needed to excel the plot. Watching the mermaids interact with each other is how I imagine it would feel to watch a conversation between a boulder and a rock, they\'re practically the same character with slightly different traits.The sexualization and innuendos crammed into the second-to-last episode really is what ruined the show for me. The ""cucumber joke"", would\'ve been a kind of (not really) funny one-off joke, but instead it persisted for multiple episodes, the same type of ordeal happens with Fuji, one of the shows main characters, her whole shtick is that she\'s in one-sided love with Muromi, which could\'ve made for some interesting scenes, or even some type of storyline if her character actually did anything other than have gravity defying spheroids that move with more velocity than the ball during an intense game of Soccer. At first I thought the velocity of Fuji\'s breasts was a bit hysteric and assumed that it was meant to be a quick gag, just a brief ""haha look, she has big boobs"" then the story would continue but the already miniscule amount of comedy faded as I realized the breasts were animated like this in every single scene that has her, the small amount of comedic value that scene had given me instantly turned into what can only be described as tasting used deodorant and feeling a hair, an incredibly disgusting and uncomfortable experience, every time it happened I wanted it to be over as soon as possible. A grand majority of the points I brought up aren\'t in episodes 1-8 however, so if you\'re just looking for a show about mermaid girls, I highly recommend 2/3rds of this show.TL;DR: watch episodes 1-8 then either drop the show or brace yourself value and to add useless filler in an attempt to grow a connection.

Night Walker: Mayonaka no Tantei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/621/Night_Walker__Mayonaka_no_Tantei,"['I\'ve always been a huge fan of Gothic Horror. Dark, creepy, and bloody shows have been things that have always interested me. I also love a good vampire story. Now add to that the fact that I enjoy a good mystery or crime drama, and the reason I decided to review this next show should be a no brainer. As the back cover proudly exclaims this ""combines urban crime drama and horror motifs"". Ah, it\'s like a show made specifically for my tastes. But I also think this is the type of show that could have a much wider appeal. I ran into this title...at my local Blockbuster probally about a year ago now. It was so out of place among the more popular titles avaible for rent there, that I just had to check it out. They only had the second volume, which covers the second half of the 12 episode series, but I didn\'t mind. This series was easy to get into midway through. I was instantly hooked because episode 7, the first one I saw, is such a strong episode. Since then I\'ve of course bought both volumes, and watched the show a few times through.The anime series is based off of a PC game by the same name, created by TomBoy. The anime series was produced by AIC, and ran on TV from July to September in 1998. Shido is a vampire, and a private detective living in Japan. He\'s devoted himself to saving humans, not killing them or turning them to vampires, as the other vampires do. He rocks cool pink hair, and an interesting style of clothing, and hunts ""nightbreeds"". Nightbreeds are the name for lesser demons in the series, who need to feed on, or control human beings in order to survive. One of Shido\'s ""powers"" as a vampire, is he is able to turn his blood into a weapon that can kill or harm nightbreeds. Yayoi is a member of a secret organization designed to investigate cases involving nightbreeds, hunt them down, and destroy them and she often works with Shido to do this. Since he is a vampire, he is very powerful, and can use his many skills to accomplish their goals, and solve the many cases. And Riho Yamazaki is the high school girl who just so happens to work part time as a secretary at Shido\'s detective agency. At first Riho is blissfully unaware of the dark secrets that are hiding just beneath the surface at this particular detective agency. You see in their world, humans are unaware that vampires and demons exist for the most part. And the reason she ended up working for Shido has to do with him investigating her parents mysterious deaths. Riho starts to develop a bit of crush on Shido, and wishes to help him with his many cases. And although Shido does not want her to get involved in the nightbreed cases, she eventually does many times, and predictably enough she does learns the dark secrets of Shido in due time. And circumstances develop in which a powerful enemy fatally wounds Riho and she must be turned into a vampire, or left to die (I won\'t spoil how this happens). Of course she chooses the former. The rest of the series follows those three attempting to solve the many crimes involving nightbreeds within the city. Now there\'s a crap load of demons here for them to find, so we\'re ganna have to just assume their city has a gateway to hell in it or something, but whatever. I\'ll buy it. During each case these three (and of course their gremlin little mascot, Guni) must figure out who exactly is the nightbreed (nightbreeds can take control of human beings), or where the nightbreed is, or even if a nightbreed truly is the cause of the problems in the first place (nightbreeds are also sometimes just called ""breeds"" for short by the way). And this is where the mystery element comes in, as we don\'t know who or what is the nightbreed, and are guessing along with our friends here. Sure some episodes are not set up like this, and are instead pretty straight forward, in that there is a nightbreed, they know where it is, and must fight or chase after it. And these episodes are very good as well. There is also an overall story that develops involving Cain, the vampire who turned Shido into a vampire in the first place, and is the only one who knows Shido\'s true past. And Cain becomes the main ""bad guy"" of the series so to speak. He doesn\'t care about human beings, and kills many people to satisfy his thirst. Shido and Riho on the other hand drink blood donated by Yayoi, so no one has to die for their survival. And also the series deals with Riho struggling to come to terms with the recent loss of her humanity, her new thirst for blood and dislike for the sun, and the fact that she will outlive all of her friends, classmates at school, and everyone else she knows.Ok I\'ll admit there\'s a lot going on in this series. It even manages to touch on Shido and Riho\'s relationship (being more then friends, and maybe lovers?) a bit. It\'s difficult to explain all the different aspects of the show very well. But the series handles each part with expertise, and it\'s not nearly as complex as it sounds. Each and every episode is different enough as to not get repetitive, and main plot does move along at a great pace. The idea of Shido having to deal with his past with Cain (as his homosexual lover I may add), and also trying to cope with not knowing who he was before he was bitten is quite interesting. And this takes a toll on him, and you can notice this. It\'s also another stroke of genius to have the only person who has any idea who he was before he became a vampire be Cain himself. The transition of Riho from human to vampire, and her dealing with this is handled very well. It\'s not angsty or anything, because her one wish is to live forever with Shido, and it seems she can now do that, but it\'s not exactly ""yeah I\'m a vampire!! I\'m so happy!!"" either, and this middle of the road feeling makes a lot of sense. On the one hand she didn\'t really want to die, and she does want to live with Shido for all time. At yet she doesn\'t really want to be a vampire, and she misses being able to do many human things. This struggle with her loss of humanity and being a vampire is handled very well and is never forgetten about. She is of course aided by Shido, who tries to help her and guide her when he can. This of course parallels Shido\'s former relationship with Cain, only he felt humans were nothing but cattle to be used for vampires, while Shido thinks vampires should help humans. Cain made Shido a vampire, and was his mentor, and now Shido has made Riho a vampire, and became her mentor. This is a very interesting way for AIC to handle the series, and I really liked this aspect of the show. And character development for all the major characters, even the little mascot goblin guy, is really well done. They flesh out each and every one of the major characters, and somehow find the time to reveal each of their back stories, and show who Cain really is, all while hunting down nightbreeds or solving cases involving nightbreeds. Kinda amazing they fit all that in there. And many of the mysteries have great twists you won\'t see coming.(***small spoiler*** ) Hell they manage to reveal the entire back story of one character, and part of another WITHOUT you even noticing this until the very end the episode!! That was a great twist! (***end spoilers***)Even some of the minor characters who manage to stick around a little get some development, which I really liked. However the series probably did try and do a little too much. As some of the ""nightbreeds of the week"" have very little screen time, so they do seem a little generic. Few of them are really fleshed out. But this is a small problem. A bigger problem is that by the end of the series, the main plot is not really tied up. The series doesn\'t end with a cliffhanger or anything, but it feels like there\'s more to tell. It\'s not bad, but not very satisfying if you want real the main plot to actually come to an end. However I am not bothered much by this, mostly because the last episode is incredibly dramatic, suspenseful, and just very powerful. I know a few people will be bothered by what they do here, but I really loved the way the last episode was handled. Sure they never get to finishing up the main plot, but I\'ll be alright with that if that means we get an amazing episode like this. And it is a good episode to end the show on. Oh and I probably should mention the first four episode are very odd. Anime News Network notes that the series started as a 4 episode OVA, and then continued as a TV series were the OVA left off. I\'m also willing to bet there was a big change in staff between these episodes as well. As the overall tone, style, and content of the show changes significantly (and for the better I may add). While, sadly, the TV series toned down the blood, gore, and violence, the writing really moved up a few notches. The first 4 episodes were very uneven in terms of writing. One would be all right, the next would be kinda bad, and then another episode pretty good. And then we also have the completely uncalled for nudity in one of the episodes. Look I\'m not against nudity or anything, but in a series like this, and the way it\'s done, well it kind felt unneeded and stupid. Also I really liked the change in character design between the first 4 episodes and the rest. Perhaps it\'s because I started the series at episode 7, so that is what I was used to, but I really like the different character designs much more.As far as production values go, this is about average for 1998. The animation is pretty good. The artwork is detailed, although very reminiscent of early 90\'s or even 80\'s anime. I\'m pretty sure this was intentional, as it really goes with the music style which I\'ll get to in a bit. I really like the style though, and the second character designs are really nice looking. The original character designs manage to make Riho really ugly looking, and I don\'t like Yayoi\'s hair at all. But when it was an OVA it seemed to have the budget to really pay attention to what all the minor characters looked like, and so all of the earlier minor characters look a bit better. So it evens its self out I guess, although I\'d rather my main characters look good and not worry much about the minor cast. As for the music, it\'s exceptional. They went with a great jazz inspired background theme, and it really works. If you closed your eyes you\'d think you were watching some old crime drama from the 1970\'s or 1980\'s, and it\'s very fitting. The opening theme is distinctive, and the ending theme is very good too. But I really love the background themes! Some themes don\'t sound like that however, and instead sound like they are straight out of a 80\'s horror flick. So with the 80\'s inspired music, I think it\'s fitting why the art style looks a little 80\'s inspired. And it\'s not bad artwork either.The dub for this was produced at Bang Zoom, in late 1999 and early 2000. And it is a pretty good dub. While not amazing, and it does show it\'s age a bit, I really found myself enjoying it. The star of the dub is easily Richard Cansino, who plays Shido quite well. He gives that character a distinct feeling, and really understands where he is going with the dub. I should probably also mention that at times Shido narrates the story, filling us in on a few things here and there. And Cansino\'s narration gives the anime a film noir feeling that\'s definitely called for and adds to the overall atmosphere. Yayoi is played by Jane Alan. At times Alan does not seem like she\'s giving it her all; it\'s a little disappointing. She just didn\'t seem enthusiastic enough at certain times, and at others like she wasn\'t sure what she should be doing or how she should be saying it. Luckily for most of the anime she\'s not like this, and does a wonderful job. She fit her character very well. I probably shouldn\'t be so harsh on her. Riho is played by Dorothy Elias-Fahn who does a really good job. She gives her character just enough spunk, youthfulness, and playfulness to fit Riho. And she knows when to tone down the happy-go-lucky side of herself when needed. Also I MUST apploud her for her work in the final episode (don\'t worry no spoilers). As I already alluded to it\'s quite a dramatic episode, and I thought she handled it perfectly. She did a truly great job. Now why couldn\'t she be this good in Vampire Princess Miyu?? Cain is played by Lex Lang, and he\'s not bad. But I really thought he could have been better. Sandy Fox plays Guni, and I\'m assuming they pitched her voice up a bit here. I thought the way they made her sound fit Guni well, and that she was quite good as well. I liked how the main cast here was filled with lesser known actors, and on the whole I liked how different this dub sounded then many other LA dubs of the time. Many of the episidic characters are voiced by better known actors however, like Michelle Ruff, Mona Marshall, and Wendee Lee. And they of course do a good. job. But again many of the other minor characters are played by lesser-known actors, and they too go a good job. So in short, this is a dub worth checking out. Although it\'s not really too impressive or anything. It is however a rare LA dub from CPM, since they usually stuck to New York City, so I do find that interesting.This anime is very well done. It has a great fleshed out main cast, an interesting story, and decent dub. The production values are good, and it\'s an interesting mix of genres. If you plan on buying this on DVD, watch out for the dub-only release Central Park Media released (if you don\'t want that version that is). I own the 2 volume release from 2004, and it has both an English and Japanese track, along with one extra. The extra feature is a comparison of the storyboard to the finished product and it\'s on both DVDs. This was a nice little extra, that they really didn\'t need to add on. However I do wish there was something more, like a behind the scenes look at the dub, or a commentary or something. But hey I\'ll take whatever extra they throw at me. The small problems with the show, make me subtract a half a star from my rating, but I still highly recommend this title. It\'s an under watched gem that could really catch on in my opinion. at my local Blockbuster probally about a year ago now.

And this is where the mystery element comes in, as we don\'t know who or what is the nightbreed, and are guessing along with our friends here. Sure some episodes are not set up like this, and are instead pretty straight forward, in that there is a nightbreed, they know where it is, and must fight or chase after it. And these episodes are very good as well. There is also an overall story that develops involving Cain, the vampire who turned Shido into a vampire in the first place, and is the only one who knows Shido\'s true past. And Cain becomes the main ""bad guy"" of the series so to speak. He doesn\'t care about human beings, and kills many people to satisfy his thirst. Shido and Riho on the other hand drink blood donated by Yayoi, so no one has to die for their survival. And also the series deals with Riho struggling to come to terms with the recent loss of her humanity, her new thirst for blood and dislike for the sun, and the fact that she will outlive all of her friends, classmates at school, and everyone else she knows.Ok I\'ll admit there\'s a lot going on in this series. It even manages to touch on Shido and Riho\'s relationship (being more then friends, and maybe lovers?) a bit. It\'s difficult to explain all the different aspects of the show very well. But the series handles each part with expertise, and it\'s not nearly as complex as it sounds. Each and every episode is different enough as to not get repetitive, and main plot does move along at a great pace. The idea of Shido having to deal with his past with Cain (as his homosexual lover I may add), and also trying to cope with not knowing who he was before he was bitten is quite interesting. And this takes a toll on him, and you can notice this. It\'s also another stroke of genius to have the only person who has any idea who he was before he became a vampire be Cain himself. The transition of Riho from human to vampire, and her dealing with this is handled very well. It\'s not angsty or anything, because her one wish is to live forever with Shido, and it seems she can now do that, but it\'s not exactly ""yeah I\'m a vampire!! I\'m so happy!!"" either, and this middle of the road feeling makes a lot of sense. On the one hand she didn\'t really want to die, and she does want to live with Shido for all time. At yet she doesn\'t really want to be a vampire, and she misses being able to do many human things. This struggle with her loss of humanity and being a vampire is handled very well and is never forgetten about. She is of course aided by Shido, who tries to help her and guide her when he can. This of course parallels Shido\'s former relationship with Cain, only he felt humans were nothing but cattle to be used for vampires, while Shido thinks vampires should help humans. Cain made Shido a vampire, and was his mentor, and now Shido has made Riho a vampire, and became her mentor. This is a very interesting way for AIC to handle the series, and I really liked this aspect of the show. And character development for all the major characters, even the little mascot goblin guy, is really well done. They flesh out each and every one of the major characters, and somehow find the time to reveal each of their back stories, and show who Cain really is, all while hunting down nightbreeds or solving cases involving nightbreeds. Kinda amazing they fit all that in there. And many of the mysteries have great twists you won\'t see coming.(***small spoiler*** ) Hell they manage to reveal the entire back story of one character, and part of another WITHOUT you even noticing this until the very end the episode!! That was a great twist! (***end spoilers***)Even some of the minor characters who manage to stick around a little get some development, which I really liked. However the series probably did try and do a little too much. As some of the ""nightbreeds of the week"" have very little screen time, so they do seem a little generic. Few of them are really fleshed out. But this is a small problem. A bigger problem is that by the end of the series, the main plot is not really tied up. The series doesn\'t end with a cliffhanger or anything, but it feels like there\'s more to tell. It\'s not bad, but not very satisfying if you want real the main plot to actually come to an end. However I am not bothered much by this, mostly because the last episode is incredibly dramatic, suspenseful, and just very powerful. I know a few people will be bothered by what they do here, but I really loved the way the last episode was handled. Sure they never get to finishing up the main plot, but I\'ll be alright with that if that means we get an amazing episode like this. And it is a good episode to end the show on. Oh and I probably should mention the first four episode are very odd. Anime News Network notes that the series started as a 4 episode OVA, and then continued as a TV series were the OVA left off. I\'m also willing to bet there was a big change in staff between these episodes as well. As the overall tone, style, and content of the show changes significantly (and for the better I may add). While, sadly, the TV series toned down the blood, gore, and violence, the writing really moved up a few notches. The first 4 episodes were very uneven in terms of writing. One would be all right, the next would be kinda bad, and then another episode pretty good. And then we also have the completely uncalled for nudity in one of the episodes. Look I\'m not against nudity or anything, but in a series like this, and the way it\'s done, well it kind felt unneeded and stupid. Also I really liked the change in character design between the first 4 episodes and the rest. Perhaps it\'s because I started the series at episode 7, so that is what I was used to, but I really like the different character designs much more.As far as production values go, this is about average for 1998. The animation is pretty good. The artwork is detailed, although very reminiscent of early 90\'s or even 80\'s anime. I\'m pretty sure this was intentional, as it really goes with the music style which I\'ll get to in a bit. I really like the style though, and the second character designs are really nice looking. The original character designs manage to make Riho really ugly looking, and I don\'t like Yayoi\'s hair at all. But when it was an OVA it seemed to have the budget to really pay attention to what all the minor characters looked like, and so all of the earlier minor characters look a bit better. So it evens its self out I guess, although I\'d rather my main characters look good and not worry much about the minor cast. As for the music, it\'s exceptional. They went with a great jazz inspired background theme, and it really works. If you closed your eyes you\'d think you were watching some old crime drama from the 1970\'s or 1980\'s, and it\'s very fitting. The opening theme is distinctive, and the ending theme is very good too. But I really love the background themes! Some themes don\'t sound like that however, and instead sound like they are straight out of a 80\'s horror flick. So with the 80\'s inspired music, I think it\'s fitting why the art style looks a little 80\'s inspired. And it\'s not bad artwork either.The dub for this was produced at Bang Zoom, in late 1999 and early 2000. And it is a pretty good dub. While not amazing, and it does show it\'s age a bit, I really found myself enjoying it. The star of the dub is easily Richard Cansino, who plays Shido quite well. He gives that character a distinct feeling, and really understands where he is going with the dub. I should probably also mention that at times Shido narrates the story, filling us in on a few things here and there. And Cansino\'s narration gives the anime a film noir feeling that\'s definitely called for and adds to the overall atmosphere. Yayoi is played by Jane Alan. At times Alan does not seem like she\'s giving it her all; it\'s a little disappointing. She just didn\'t seem enthusiastic enough at certain times, and at others like she wasn\'t sure what she should be doing or how she should be saying it. Luckily for most of the anime she\'s not like this, and does a wonderful job. She fit her character very well. I probably shouldn\'t be so harsh on her. Riho is played by Dorothy Elias-Fahn who does a really good job. She gives her character just enough spunk, youthfulness, and playfulness to fit Riho. And she knows when to tone down the happy-go-lucky side of herself when needed. Also I MUST apploud her for her work in the final episode (don\'t worry no spoilers). As I already alluded to it\'s quite a dramatic episode, and I thought she handled it perfectly. She did a truly great job. Now why couldn\'t she be this good in Vampire Princess Miyu?? Cain is played by Lex Lang, and he\'s not bad. But I really thought he could have been better. Sandy Fox plays Guni, and I\'m assuming they pitched her voice up a bit here. I thought the way they made her sound fit Guni well, and that she was quite good as well. I liked how the main cast here was filled with lesser known actors, and on the whole I liked how different this dub sounded then many other LA dubs of the time. Many of the episidic characters are voiced by better known actors however, like Michelle Ruff, Mona Marshall, and Wendee Lee. And they of course do a good. job. But again many of the other minor characters are played by lesser-known actors, and they too go a good job. So in short, this is a dub worth checking out. Although it\'s not really too impressive or anything. It is however a rare LA dub from CPM, since they usually stuck to New York City, so I do find that interesting.This anime is very well done. It has a great fleshed out main cast, an interesting story, and decent dub. The production values are good, and it\'s an interesting mix of genres. If you plan on buying this on DVD, watch out for the dub-only release Central Park Media released (if you don\'t want that version that is). I own the 2 volume release from 2004, and it has both an English and Japanese track, along with one extra. The extra feature is a comparison of the storyboard to the finished product and it\'s on both DVDs. This was a nice little extra, that they really didn\'t need to add on. However I do wish there was something more, like a behind the scenes look at the dub, or a commentary or something. But hey I\'ll take whatever extra they throw at me. The small problems with the show, make me subtract a half a star from my rating, but I still highly recommend this title. It\'s an under watched gem that could really catch on in my opinion.', 'Alright, first off, this show is not one for those that want an answer right away. It doesn’t even have a rather good ending in my mind because it leaves as a cliff hanger. Some things in the story feel left out and just thrown in at the last minute as though they tried to stay to the game storyline but also change it for a monster by week style show.Tatsuhiko Shido is the perfect vampire in my mind. He is hunted by his past and looks to set things right though he can’t stop who he is. He drinks blood and can’t go...into the sunlight most of the time it seems (Sometimes it seems they forget that as we see him in the sun once in a while). Almost everything about a traditional vampire is in this and they add a few extra things. I love the idea that he can create a sword with his blood though he doesn’t do it all that much.Yayoi is a rather sexual little thing, and she and Shido have an interesting relationship. She gives him blood in exchange for help on nightbreed cases. Again, we don’t get much from her.His little fairy girl, Guni, is just a bit to much like Navi in how annoying she is. Most of the time, I just wish she was silent because she just doesn’t do anything for the story. She sits in his hair and barely comes out except to say something annoying.Riho is an interesting little girl. We really don’t get much of a story line except that she lost her parents in a nightbreed fight. She is turned into a vampire by Shido in one episode and then almost whenever we see her after, she is just trying to cope with the change. We rarely see her but when we do, we get a sad sort of loneliness about her. She loves Shido a lot and has a pretty big jealous streak when it comes to Yayoi.There isn’t much known about Cain except he seems to have a very sexual obsession with Shido. I guess it might be my yaoi fan girl thing, but it they do not hold back on the sexual lust this guy has for him. I really want to know why he changed Shido into a Vampire but they never really explain much about it.As you can see, we don’t get much about the characters and so sometimes it is hard to feel for them when they are hurt but I feel even more for Shido. He’s more the only character I connect to. Even the story doesn’t help much. We don’t get a lot about this ‘Golden Dawn’ or about the backgrounds of characters. It seems deep but then it is actually a bit shallow.The animation is pretty good, though the first 4 episodes are much better and not TV friendly because it was made to be an OVA. At some point, they decided to have a whole TV show of it and the quality dropped. I can somewhat understand since the first 4 don’t really don’t work as just a story, I just wish the animation didn’t suffer for it.The English voices are pretty good. Shido has this gentle gruff of his voice that’s perfect for a detective and yet also has an air about someone mysterious. It’s pretty much the same with Cain who is voiced with Lex Lang though he does not hand many lines. I really love the music in the opening. It is rather a hunting tune. The ending song is alright, though not the best. It just feels like a sappy love song when there isn’t really all that much love in the show.

Night Walker: Mayonaka no Tantei is a twelve episode anime from the late 90s, based on an eroge from the early 90s. It was brought to us by our old friends at AIC, which could be a good or a bad thing. They did bring us such treats as Sasameki Koto & Bubblegum Crisis. But they also sharted OreImo & Isekai no Seikishi no Monogatari at us.Story:Night Walker follows a vampire detective named Shidou. His personal mission is to protect humans from supernatural monsters called “breeds.” Shidou works with Yayoi, a woman who's part of a...special anti-breed unit, Guni, a green faerie of some variety and Riho, a high-school girl who tags along because why wouldn't they be okay with that? It's not like they're going into danger and she has no training. Okay, I'll be fair, she starts out mostly hanging out in the office and there's a reason they start letting her go along with them. The series follows them as they investigate various incidents involving supernatural beings and follows Shidou as he tries to unravel the mystery of his past. He came down with plot convenience amnesia at some point and can't remember his life before he was turned.Let's discuss the flaws of the series. The biggest problem is that the big climax comes far too early. It's really a waste since everything that comes after is less intense and important. However, it is understandable in this case. Why? Because the series was originally intended to be a four episode OVA and the other two-thirds was added later to make it a series. Still, they should have found something bigger and more dramatic to work towards in those eight episodes. There's also a problem with consistency. Basically, the fourth episode ends on a very specific note and the very next episode immediately contradicts it in two major ways with no explanation for what happened. It could have worked if there was more time between the events of the two episodes but all indications suggest that there's not much of a skip. Did this project have an editor? It also bothers me that Shidou gets all of his blood from Yayoi. While it is a nice touch that he takes blood from a willing donor, it really doesn't make sense for all of it to come from one person. The human body needs time to produce blood. Does he just not drink often or does a vampire feeding off of you make your blood production quadruple in this series? There's also a major cop-out at the end. I won't spoil it, but it's really bad.On a positive note, the idea of the series is pretty compelling. I like that people know what the breed are and there's a task force set up instead of the stereotype of having the supernatural elements being completely unknown by the populace and, somehow, covered up. A lot of the individual episodes are pretty interesting too, in spite of them being largely pretty simplistic. The series also does a good job of giving the audience snippets and hints about Shidou's past in a way that does add to the narrative.Characters:Overall, the characters are pretty generic. They aren't bad, but there's also not much to them. Riho is definitely the weakest since she's the most effected by the inconsistency problem and since her character is pretty much defined by being a tag along. Shidou is the strongest since he has the most going on in his back-story.Art:The art in this is pretty dated by today's standards. However, in the context of its time, it's pretty standard. There are some interesting looking monsters and the action sequences can be nicely done. The biggest issue is that the character designs shift after the first four episodes and I'm not blaming this one on those having been originally intended for an OVA. It's not like the staff couldn't have looked back on what they'd done and followed it. It's not like the second designs are any better.Sound:They got some pretty good actors. Yamazaki Takumi does really well in the leading role. We also get Shinohara Emi, hi Sailor Jupiter, Tanaka Hideyuki, Sakamoto Maaya and Ootani Ikue who doesn't over-act in this, unlike the role we heard her in last week. Overall, the acting isn't the best I've heard from any of the people involved but it's pretty decent. The music isn't bad. It's not anything special but it's passable.Ho-yay:There's a bit. It's clear that Shidou and Cain used to be involved, that their relationship was less than healthy and that Cain still has the hots for Shidou. Dude really needs to let his ex-boyfriends go.Final Thoughts:Night Walker: Mayonaka no Tantei isn't a bad series. It has some problems and some good things going for it. It's fairly simple and, in many ways, standard, but it isn't bad. If you're interested in seeing a vampire detective hunt monsters and don't really care about complexity, you'll probably like it. As for me, I'm calling it mediocre. Final rating is a 5/10. Next week I'm looking at Mars of Destruction because someone suggested it as a horror thing I could look at. special anti-breed unit, Guni, a green faerie of some variety and Riho, a high-school girl who tags along because why wouldn't they be okay with that?

But unfortunately, it got cancelled after only one season consisting of 12 episodes. But judging by that in the 90s, episodic anime weren’t popular in Japan at all (as shown by series such as Cowboy Bebop also being episodic and also failing to catch a wide audience in Japan.) but unlike Cowboy Bebop, the West has also forgotten this series*, which is a shame because it is one of the best anime of all time (and I DON’T say that lightly!)This series (due to its episodic nature and not having the crazy hijinks that anime tends to have (I.e. over exaggerated facial expressions and fan service that turn most people away from the medium) is one of the most accessible anime for those who are unfamiliar with the medium.

But unfortunately, it got cancelled after only one season consisting of 12 episodes. But judging by that in the 90s, episodic anime weren’t popular in Japan at all (as shown by series such as Cowboy Bebop also being episodic and also failing to catch a wide audience in Japan.) but unlike Cowboy Bebop, the West has also forgotten this series*, which is a shame because it is one of the best anime of all time (and I DON’T say that lightly!)This series (due to its episodic nature and not having the crazy hijinks that anime tends to have (I.e. over exaggerated facial expressions and fan service that turn most people away from the medium) is one of the most accessible anime for those who are unfamiliar with the medium.

Otogizoushi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/525/Otogizoushi,"['-INTRODUCTION-Someone told me that Otogizoushi has a very realistic portrayal of onmyoudo which was the main reason for my interest, along with the ancient Japan setting. Certain character designs caught my attention too, especially Mansairaku.-STORY- 8/10""Some day, I wish to dance only for Hikaru-dono...""Otogizoushi consists of two story arcs. They are very different, I would even say that in a way they contrast each other. Looking at the two arcs together, I developed some very mixed feelings about the overall anime.The Heian Arc was amazing. The first few minutes were enough to call it a masterpiece. War, epidemic, people are dying, the world is...filled with despair. And among all that chaos, a seemingly strong yet vulnerable Hikaru and a mysterious dancer Mansairaku fall in love with each other. The creators did a wonderful job in showing the two contrasting sides: cruel battlefield and people\'s misery versus the short peaceful moments that Hikaru and Mansairaku share with each other whenever they chance to meet. The way she plays flute for him while he dances for her, the way they comfort each other and complete each other\'s existence... that sad but gentle romance touch was truly beautiful and left me speechless. I would have given it a 10 without a second thought.But the story did not end on episode thirteen and instead moved on to the present time, the Kyoto Arc. The second part by itself was also quite interesting, and I found myself easily engaged in the mysteries surrounding the city. It felt somewhat slow paced at times, but overall it was good. There is one big problem though -- it\'s a completely different story. If it was an independent anime with unrelated characters, then I would not look at it so critically. But it was still Otogizoushi, yet it strayed too far away from the story that I initially fell in love with. True that eventually it started connecting to the Heian Arc, and by the end it even started looking like a sequel instead of a side story, and I won\'t deny that I still enjoyed it. But after finishing it, and after looking back at the Heian Arc, I realized how beautiful the original story was all by itself, and that the second story might as well not be there at all. It felt like at the end of episode thirteen the creators suddenly decided to make a sequel for the story that already ended and could not continue.-CHARACTERS- 10/10I found all main characters very lovable; I liked each one of them as soon as (s)he appeared. They had their flaws, and there were times I got rather angry at their decisions, but I developed a great deal of respect for each one of them. They all had their reasons for stepping (or not stepping) into the battlefield and for helping and loving each other. Portrayal of human bonds was probably the strongest point of Otogizoushi, between the main characters as well as between the antagonists. And as much as I wish the Kyoto Arc did not exist, I liked that the bond between the main characters did not change, even thought they were reborn as completely different people.Also, Otogizoushi showed the most interesting portrayal of Abe no Seimei I have ever seen in fiction; out of all, this character shocked me the most.-ART/ANIMATION- 8/10I loved the art in Heian Arc. The character designs were beautiful, especially the detail in eyes, and the animation was top quality. I was simply speechless at Mansairaku\'s dance scenes; the battles were great too. Some of the backgrounds looked like paintings, they were that stunning. There were also times when a certain moment would \'morph\' into a still image of a slightly different style, and it was such a nice touch.I honestly don\'t know anymore whether I am just biased against the Kyoto Arc, but I felt like after episode thirteen the artwork started lacking, along with animation. Maybe the fact that the characters wore different clothes and had different hairstyles threw me off, but in a way it felt like they became different people. I just wasn\'t as impressed at the art anymore, and there were a lot less moments that I wanted to screenshot. And lastly, I have to say my little personal rant, what on earth did they do to Mansairaku? =/ I do realize that the idea was to \'modernize\' the characters, but they didn\'t have to completely change his hair color and give him that cliche hairstyle that you see everywhere.-SOUND- 9/10The music in both arcs was great and fitting. Personally, I enjoyed the soundtrack of the Heian Arc a lot more; it was a lot more soothing and atmospheric. But it was something that would feel right only during that arc, and I do realize that the second arc\'s music had to be stylized completely differently. Also, I absolutely loved the Kyoto Arc\'s ending song, which is, interestingly enough, the same song (by the same performer) that Haruhi \'sings\' in one of Ouran High School Host Club episodes, but with different lyrics.I will spare you the seiyuu talk because I would end up writing a paragraph about each one, but I will mention one. Miki Shinichirou did an outstanding job in this anime, by playing both Mansairaku and Hikaru\'s bed-ridden older brother. I was especially impressed by the second role; his acting was so believable, and his slightly shaking voice sounded so natural, that you could really feel that Raikou was ill and that speaking was difficult for him.---As you can see, I have very mixed feelings about this anime and it was difficult putting them in words.My recommendation would be to watch the Heian Arc and the Kyoto Arc within a few years of each other and judge the second one as a \'what-if\' scenario instead of a sequel. But some people might enjoy both arcs equally, so I can\'t recommend that method to everyone. filled with despair.

The series is divided up into two different arcs with the first one taking place in Heian era Japan and the other set in Japan's modern era. The Heian arc was an enjoyable watch exploring the developments of Hikaru, under the guise of her brother Raikou, and her companions trying to gather up several magical magatama needed to halt the depraved conditions of many commoners throughout their kingdom. The arc offers solid developments on the challenges faced by Hikaru's group as they face life-threatening decisions, corruption involving those...who task them with their adventure and Hikaru finding herself faced by the pressure to use her brother's identity to complete their adventure while also finding possible love with a traveling performer named Mansairaku. The final episodes to the arc feature some shocking developments that hooked me to see how events would turn out with Hikaru's group. The arc believably depicts the harsh conditions and cultural norms of the time period, as well as making use of notable legendary figures in Japanese folklore for this engaging story. If the series simply ended with the Heian arc, Otogi Zoshi would be a definite addition to my anime collection.But with the addition of the modern era arc for another 13 episodes, the quality of Otogi Zoshi's storytelling takes a big hit. This arc focuses on the modern reincarnations of the adventurers from the Heian arc as Hikaru is the landlady of an apartment complex where she and several of her tenants get caught up in mysterious phenomena affecting Tokyo as the girl seeks out the whereabouts of her missing brother, Raikou. The whole premise is poorly implemented and contrived as the arc tries to go for some poor excuses to connect the mysterious phenomena to the events that took place in the Heian arc and it leaves a number of glaring plot holes concerning the events that Hikaru and her apartment tenants get dragged into, especially with the focus of one major character who makes a return from the earlier Heian arc.The visual presentation for Otogi Zoshi is a bit of a mixed bag. On the plus side, the series features realistic-looking character designs and has its moments of fluid animation shown during battle scenes and the destruction of towns/ cities during key events in the series. On the other end though, it felt like the series was on a bit of a tight animation budget at points as there were some low-quality background shots on a number of occasions in both arcs and animation shortcuts were apparent with still shots being used on a number of occasions. The modern arc also mixes in some live-action shots of various Tokyo locales in place of animated shots of said locations whenever the plot moves to another location, clashing quite badly with the animated footage following a scene change.Overall, Otogi Zoshi was worthwhile only for its Heian arc thanks to its solid storytelling and implementation of elements of traditional Japanese folklore and spiritualist beliefs while the modern arc was a messy premise that seemed tacked on just to drag the show out for another 13 episodes. If you share similar feelings as I do on the series and wish to get it on DVD, just buy the first three volumes containing the Heian arc if you live in America and dream that the modern arc was never even made. who task them with their adventure and Hikaru finding herself faced by the pressure to use her brother's identity to complete their adventure while also finding possible love with a traveling performer named Mansairaku.

Otogi Zoushi is actually split into two arcs - The Heian Arc and the Tokyo Arc. While the plot for the Heian arc is pretty simple to follow (to retrieve all 5 Magatama), it gets interesting towards the end.  The last episode of the Heian arc does affect, or rather, create the Tokyo arc's storyline. While it does have some supernatural theme in it, don't expect tons of action. Though it's fun to watch the reincarnation of the characters and how they live in the present time.Art - Just knowing...that Production I.G. is behind the animation for this anime gives you the idea that the animation will be top-notch. The art style however is different from most anime. The characters look a bit realistic, but if you're used to watching different art styles in anime, it shouldn't be that much of a problem. Still, the art for the background looks damn nice with water-painted art as the surroundings.Sound - Not much to say about the sound except that the music for the Heian arc is great when you hear Hikaru play her flute. Totally matches well for the first arc.Character - All I can say is that Kintarou (little boy that teams up with Hikaru's team) seems like he was just placed there for one purpose: Just watch the anime and you'll see =pEnjoyment - If action is what you only want, then stay away from this because it's not always about fighting (typical shounen..). If you want a unique storyline, interesting characters, and some..yes, some nice action scenes, then Otogi Zoushi is the right anime for you.Overall - I think most people will say the Heian arc was the better arc than the Tokyo arc simply because the Tokyo arc deals with the character's modern life and some supernatural mystery involved.

However, this anime is definitely original and interesting to watch."", 'Ok this is going to be a long review as this anime contains 2 very different volumes so I feel they need to be addressed separately.Volume 1:Volume 1 is the Heian Chapter and it is set in the Heian period of and it is by far the strongest of the volumes. Focusing on the story of Hikaru and her quest to retrieve the stolen Magatama beads to save the capital of this volume focuses heavily on action and suspense and contains a huge plot twist that I did not see coming and was one of the best plot twists that I have...seen in a long time. These days plot-twists can be seen coming a mile away but this one totally hit me for six and I love when a show/movie succeeds in doing that. Anyway the focus of the plot is the five Magatama beads which represent the 5 elements of earth, fire, wind, water, and metal (not Heart, lol) and it is believed that when the Magatamas are together and arranged in the order of Affinity that the capital will prosper. Currently 3 of the beads are missing and the capital is suffering with famine and death and the task to retrieve them falls on the Minamoto clan. The head of the clan Minamoto no Raiko is gravely ill and so his sister Hikaru impersonates him and takes his place on the quest. What I loved about this volume is that straight away it is apparent that there is more to the Magatamas and that Hikarus quest is about more than saving the capital. While Hikaru and her party believe in the quest to save the capital, we see the scheming politicians the Ministers of the left and right clearly have an agenda, as does the onmyoji Abe no Seimei. And the mysterious warrior Mansairaku clearly has a big role to play somewhere. Everyone seems to have an agenda so it was great to see the story unfold. As the Magatamas are retrieved we see them regarded as cursed objects that bring suffering to those around them so their destiny to save the capital comes into question. As for the characters I love how a new character came into Hikarus group every few episodes as it keeps things interesting. All the characters are fun to watch even if they do seem to fit the same classic staples. Watanabe no Tsuna is the proud warrior who would give his life to protect Hikaru. Usui Sadamitsu is the cocky warrior with an eye for the ladies. Kintaro is the energetic kid with a huge appetite. You get the picture but the characters do have some depth to them. Tsuna hides feelings for Hikaru and Sasamitsu is looking for redemption.The Animation and character designs are top-notch but my one complaint was how they drew the characters eyes. For the most part it looks fine but up close they just looked weird. The battles look great and being set in feudal you get what you expect but they are directed and animated well. As for sound the music is great and I really liked the opening for volume 1. Voice work is all around great and as usual I watched the dub. My one complaint on the voices is that Kintaro is voiced by Mona Marshall who has done a crapload of voiceovers in anime and video games and I felt Kintaro sounded too similar to other characters she has voiced.But overall the first volume of this anime is excellent. Great story with a quick pace so you are never bored. Great animation and sound and a killer plot twist at the end. I was all pumped up for a great second volume but alas I was let down.Volume 2Volume 2 is the chapter and it is set in modern day Tokyo and it features the descendants of the characters from the Heian chapter or to be more exact their reincarnations. So while all the characters are here they are very different people yet maintain some traits of their ancestors so they are believable reincarnations. Hikaru is now a landlady of an apartment building and all of her party from the previous volume are residents there. While everyone is different from their ancestors some of their traits are still present. Tsuna is still a very proud man and still wants to protect Hikaru, Sadamitsu still likes the ladies and Kintaro still eats anything in sight etc… The story here revolves around the disappearance of Hikarus brother Raiko a year ago and it does eventually tie into the events from the capital from the end of volume 1. My problem with this volume is that the story moves at a much slower pace and there is not really much action to speak of. The story evolves very slowly and how it all ties into volume 1 does not become clear until the very end. All of the episodes follow the same pattern. Hikaru and Tsuna investigate reports of paranormal activity mostly because Tsuna is a reporter/photographer and these are his assignments and other times it’s related to some photos that Raiko took before he vanished and Hikaru believes these are clues to finding him. Each time Hikaru witnesses some paranormal event like seeing a ghost train with her brother on board, or in another episode Hikaru and Sadamitsu witness Sadamitsus fathers’ last fight as a boxer on the night his mother died. Along the way Hikaru meets a strange man who turns out the Mansairaku and while it his clear he knows what is going on he just talks in riddles and warnings. My problem with this volume stems from the fact that all these paranormal events and the stories around them were just not interesting and while you always sensed it had something to do with the events at the end of volume 1 none of this becomes apparent until the last 2 episodes. Now it does all tie up nicely and at the end and we understand the significance of the paranormal activity and the plot from volumes 1 and 2 come together nicely. But the problem was that you knew this was inevitable and they just took too long to get there and what happened in between was just not interesting enough and was plain boring in parts. There are about 4-5 episodes in the middle that do nothing to move on the main story and while the story ends nicely I felt they could have stretched the finale over more episodes or at least developed the main story better along the way. The most interesting thing for me in this volume was trying to figure out how Mansairaku was connected to the paranormal activity and was he the cause or was he trying to stop them. My other main complaint was the Hikarus ing cast had very little to do in the second volume and compared to their ancestors in Volume 1 they came across as downright dull.Animation and voice acting is at the same high level as volume 1 and the opening and closing themes are different and they fit the less serious tone of Volume 2 quite well.Ok so overall this is an enjoyable show but I would be on the fence about recommending it on the basis that Volume 2 is nowhere near as strong as the first. But I think Volume 1 was just that good that I would suggest you check it out. seen in a long time.

For the most part it looks fine but up close they just looked weird. The battles look great and being set in feudal you get what you expect but they are directed and animated well. As for sound the music is great and I really liked the opening for volume 1. Voice work is all around great and as usual I watched the dub. My one complaint on the voices is that Kintaro is voiced by Mona Marshall who has done a crapload of voiceovers in anime and video games and I felt Kintaro sounded too similar to other characters she has voiced.But overall the first volume of this anime is excellent. Great story with a quick pace so you are never bored. Great animation and sound and a killer plot twist at the end. I was all pumped up for a great second volume but alas I was let down.Volume 2Volume 2 is the chapter and it is set in modern day Tokyo and it features the descendants of the characters from the Heian chapter or to be more exact their reincarnations. So while all the characters are here they are very different people yet maintain some traits of their ancestors so they are believable reincarnations. Hikaru is now a landlady of an apartment building and all of her party from the previous volume are residents there. While everyone is different from their ancestors some of their traits are still present. Tsuna is still a very proud man and still wants to protect Hikaru, Sadamitsu still likes the ladies and Kintaro still eats anything in sight etc… The story here revolves around the disappearance of Hikarus brother Raiko a year ago and it does eventually tie into the events from the capital from the end of volume 1. My problem with this volume is that the story moves at a much slower pace and there is not really much action to speak of. The story evolves very slowly and how it all ties into volume 1 does not become clear until the very end. All of the episodes follow the same pattern. Hikaru and Tsuna investigate reports of paranormal activity mostly because Tsuna is a reporter/photographer and these are his assignments and other times it’s related to some photos that Raiko took before he vanished and Hikaru believes these are clues to finding him. Each time Hikaru witnesses some paranormal event like seeing a ghost train with her brother on board, or in another episode Hikaru and Sadamitsu witness Sadamitsus fathers’ last fight as a boxer on the night his mother died. Along the way Hikaru meets a strange man who turns out the Mansairaku and while it his clear he knows what is going on he just talks in riddles and warnings. My problem with this volume stems from the fact that all these paranormal events and the stories around them were just not interesting and while you always sensed it had something to do with the events at the end of volume 1 none of this becomes apparent until the last 2 episodes. Now it does all tie up nicely and at the end and we understand the significance of the paranormal activity and the plot from volumes 1 and 2 come together nicely. But the problem was that you knew this was inevitable and they just took too long to get there and what happened in between was just not interesting enough and was plain boring in parts. There are about 4-5 episodes in the middle that do nothing to move on the main story and while the story ends nicely I felt they could have stretched the finale over more episodes or at least developed the main story better along the way. The most interesting thing for me in this volume was trying to figure out how Mansairaku was connected to the paranormal activity and was he the cause or was he trying to stop them. My other main complaint was the Hikarus ing cast had very little to do in the second volume and compared to their ancestors in Volume 1 they came across as downright dull.Animation and voice acting is at the same high level as volume 1 and the opening and closing themes are different and they fit the less serious tone of Volume 2 quite well.Ok so overall this is an enjoyable show but I would be on the fence about recommending it on the basis that Volume 2 is nowhere near as strong as the first. But I think Volume 1 was just that good that I would suggest you check it out.', ""Character: Out of all the series I've seen, Otogizoshi probably had the most potential. Right from the start, we're immersed in the plot and enthralled by the main character Hikaru, who must struggle to pose as her brother and fulfill a quest he cannot. While the dialogue is spare, each character's personality comes across clearly, and you come to like Hikaru and Tsuna, even while you wonder about the mysterious character of Mansairaku. They are real and subtle people, so we are more interested in their plight. Hikaru is clearly a noblewoman in every aspect, but she is not squeaky or shrill like most heroines...in anime today. Even while disguised as a man, she has an admirable, quiet dignity. If you're familiar with the Heian period, it's interesting to see it here, and if you're not, the story's easy enough to follow and it's fascinating to learn.Art: In fact, that describes this anime as a whole. Quiet, elegant, and dignified, the art follows suit. Subdued realism meets Heian backgrounds. The care taken to keep this anime historically accurate (in setting rather than events) is amazing. It's worthwhile to watch the extras, if you have the DVD, and listen to the producers explain the detail that went into this work.Sound: While the opening rock song is nice, it is not altogether suited to the series. All the same, the sound was not a detractor during the series. It didn't interfere with the story and it was atmospheric.Story: I left the story for last because I found that most disappointing. While the first 13 episodes were fascinating as we followed Hikaru on her journey, the second arc in the series, where we're transported into a modern setting, left a lot to be desired. This half of the series is very slow and vague and at times I even got the feeling the producers didn't know where to go with it. They seemed out of their element in moving to a modern story.Overall: While the second arc was disappointing, I would say that it's worth it to watch this series for part one of the story if you enjoy historical settings, subtle storylines, and realistic art. in anime today.

I knew going in that the show completely changes half way through and I was expecting the second half to be less to my liking. Turns out I found the modern urban ghost story approach far more entertaining than the rather stale feuda-eral first half.The animation is quite poor and it's very easy to spot the budget-saving moments of still backgrounds and stop animation scenes. The music is a lot more consistent though and I enjoyed the score for the first half. the sound in the second half is far more atmospheric.In terms of character I thought the first...half was very poor but the second half had some better characterization although it could have done with some stronger parallels with the first half.Overall I'd say it's worth a watch if only for the brave move in storytelling but I suspect most will love/hate each half making it hard for people to fully enjoy the whole. While I was less than impressed by the first half, I can still see how it enhance the second half of the show. half was very poor but the second half had some better characterization although it could have done with some stronger parallels with the first half.Overall I'd say it's worth a watch if only for the brave move in storytelling but I suspect most will love/hate each half making it hard for people to fully enjoy the whole.

Is it the protection of the land or the destruction of the land? There\'s a fine line between the two and the motivations for either goal are almost exactly the same. Otogi Zoshi explores the ideas of peace, loss, and the extent to which people will go to protect what is sacred to them. But, that wasn\'t why I bothered to watch this. I just love anything feudal Japan, so I had to see this anime for myself.Story----The story is split up into two parts: The Heian Arc (my personal favorite) and the continuation which...is The Tokyo Arc.The Heian Arc is set in ancient Japan. It is about a girl named Hikaru who takes the place of her brother as a warrior in order to retrieve the sacred Magatama, said to be able to bring peace to the capital (her home). She is accompanied initially by her brother\'s retained servant, Tsuna, but meets other companions along the way. Each place the team goes to find a Magatama, they encounter strange, usually power hungry opponents possessed into a rage of hatred and vengeance. It should be mentioned that, from time to time, Hikaru meets this strange dancer named Mansairaku who helps her out.Though a bit confusing for the first couple of episodes, you eventually understand the basic plot and are wowed by the plot twists if you continue to pay attention. This part was done exceptionally well and throws out many surprises along the way.The Tokyo Arc is set in modern day Japan. It is about a teenage landlord named Hikaru who is searching for her lost brother. Her brother\'s friend Tsuna is a paranormal writer who helps her. Strange happenings around Tokyo confuse them but also bring them closer to the truth. A strange man named Mansairaku helps her out sometimes. This part (sorry if this is considered a major spoiler) is the story about the reincarnation of the characters from the Heian arc. You aren\'t really told why until the end.I didn\'t like this part as much because the end seemed a bit messy and a few things didn\'t match up with the Heian Arc. Still, there are moments where you feel like you\'re in on some sort of inside joke when one of the characters exhibits something from their past life. Also, then end seemed a bit empty to me. I\'m a bit of a romantic and, though the romance wasn\'t an entirely big part of the story, I was disappointed at how it seemed to be discarded or switched around in the second part. But maybe this is just an obvious contrast between the two different eras (like how the ancient period was more romantic because of how life was fleeting versus modern times when everything seems so concrete and safe) but it just bugged me a little bit. The ending seemed abrupt, but satisfies most of the story. The last two episodes seem thrown in and pointless, the last episode just being really depressing.Art---Definitely not your run-of-the-mill anime artwork. It gives off a very mature feel which compliments the mature subject matters being addressed. The colors were toned down and bleak to match the mood. I like this style more than most other anime because you seldom see so much detail and realistic consideration in the character styles.Sound------The voice acting was great, but I found the music to be a tad bit annoying. I liked the opening theme of the Heian Arc but hated all of the music from the Tokyo Arc. Plus, Hikaru\'s repetitive flute song got to be annoying. Really, does she only know that one song? I know it was meant to be sentimental, but it got on my nerves a little bit.Character--------These characters actually develop or, at least, they do in the Heian Arc. You can feel Hikaru\'s apprehension but developing and unwavering resolve, despite not being completely aware of the truth of her situation. The other supporting characters develop as well, realizing things about life that they may have overlooked and building trust between their fellow companions.The Tokyo Arc is a little different. Hikaru is less serious and more teenager-y. She spends most of her time just questioning things and not really understanding the gravity of what she\'s dealing with. On top of that, she is a lot more impulsive, which complicates her journey to understanding even more.Enjoyment---------As you may have already noticed, I have more love for the Heian Arc. This is the better part of the story, I believe. In fact, I could go as far as saying that you should probably skip the Tokyo Arc completely if you are totally satisfied with the end of the Heian Arc. Sure, some things are more thoroughly explained in the second part but it isn\'t much and it isn\'t really that important. A lot of what happens is tragic, but both parts have a ""happy"" ending. Why quotation marks? Because its a very subjective happiness. In both endings, something is lost but something is regained.The last episode of the Tokyo Arc and, subsequently, the series isn\'t really much about the story but musings on life, death, human connection to land and the questioning of time. Unless you\'re into these deep topics, you might find the episode to be tedious or depressing.It makes me a little sad that I can\'t really up my rating of enjoyment because of the Tokyo Arc. Were I just reviewing the Heian Arc, I\'d give it a solid 10.Overall, this gets a 9 because I\'m perfectly happy with the Heian Arc. Even the Tokyo Arc had a beauty to it and is by no means horrible.

The first arc i ended up not liking very much and stopped watching two episodes before the end. All i remember now from it is that it was in the medieval war setting and they are on a quest to obtain a stone. when i came back and continued the series it didn't seem nearly as bad as i thought as lost as i was.The second arc felt less serious more of a slice of life, comedy, mystery. It was about Hikarus search for her missing brother while...helping her (tenant?) Tsuna with his work of odd jobs related to the occult that later on tied in, how i felt was loosely, with the overall plot-line. The characters were portrayed well enough to attract your interests and were developed fine.The character designs seemed rough and could have been better. What stuck out most were the faces. Their was a lot of features to their faces however most of the time they were motionless or when they weren't it wouldn't show it correctly like the kid Kintaros face while he was happy, it looked very creepy. The fight scenes on the other hand were fluid and not bad at all.Being i hardly remember the first arc i plan to re-watch it at some point. I feel like the show had a good story to it but didn't capture the potential with the abrupt arc switch leaving it on a cliffhanger, while the slow and almost unrelated second half resolved very little.

Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13659/Ore_no_Imouto_ga_Konnani_Kawaii_Wake_ga_Nai,"['OreImo has had something of a controversial history. And that\'s not too much of a surprise-- it pushes the notion that wanting to bone your (perhaps nonexistent) sister is perfectly fine. Mind you, there is nothing inherently wrong with incestuous themes when handled maturely. But OreImo is not mature. It had no intentions of being so.And yet, there was still more to OreImo than the incest appeal. The first season provided a social commentary on otaku culture and its perception in everyday society. It focused on characters that behave and react like human beings do, sometimes even at the cost of likability. When Kyousuke...expressed any interest in his sister around others, he was treated like a pervert and smacked upside the head. It almost wanted you to feel that there was something wrong with Kyousuke\'s and Kirino\'s growing relationship. Not entirely, perhaps, but there were always deeper, more intelligent themes than ""hey, this dude likes his sister"".OreImo\'s second season has none of this. There is no social commentary. There are no believable characters. Whatever the series had to set itself apart from any other ecchi or harem series is now gone.The characters are relentlessly crippled by this downfall and Ayase receives the full extent of it. She was characterized as being level-headed and diligent in the first season; the proverbial ""model student"", albeit with a tendency to berate anybody she sees as odd. Where is this in the second season? Apparently nowhere. Ayase has become victim to the \'yandere\' stereotype, cranked up to eleven, knife and crazy-eyes included. For no conceivable reason, she also develops (and acts on her) feelings for Kyousuke, entirely contradicting her belief that Kirino\'s happiness is most important. The most believable character in the series has been reduced to wrapping paper.Kirino is a love-or-hate character, and whichever side you lean towards, the second season is not going to do much to change your mind. There is plenty more of the rampant complaining that she was so known for in the first season, including an episode comprising of her lying to Kyousuke, insulting him and proceeding to slap him across the face. I could never really get myself to hate her, though, because while she embodies everything wrong with teenage girls, there are always signs that she has remorse for her actions. That and the fact that she\'s voiced by Ayana Taketatsu.You will likely develop a more positive opinion of Kuroneko, though. For the middle third of the story, she is made the principal character. A love interest, too. And unlike the rest of the female cast (Kirino excluded) whose feelings seem entirely forced and superficial, Kuroneko\'s feelings for Kyousuke are explored in detail. Her love is genuine. It doesn\'t feel shoehorned in to add an extra number to the harem, and that is perhaps the greatest compliment an anime like this can receive.But her story arc eventually blunders about. It is marred, like most things, by superfluous drama at the end. The end of Kuroneko\'s arc simply consists of Kirino screaming at Kuroneko for the entire episode. Worse, Kuroneko\'s motivations are not even established once the conflict is finally resolved. All we get are a few ambiguous statements which further contradict her actions. What an awful note to end it on.That\'s not to say that everything has gone wrong; a few of the episodes are legitimately good. Kuroneko\'s lighthearted episodes exemplify the good points of the series (and are wholly adorable), while Saori\'s backstory provides an interesting glimpse into the life of otaku while fleshing out her character in equal measure. The show is plenty capable of being fun; it just regularly chooses not to be.The ending will leave many scratching their heads. It might even be misleading to call it an ending, as it wraps up nothing and shamelessly expects the audience to follow up with the OVAs for answers. Still, it\'s a nice way to detail Kyousuke\'s and Kirino\'s relationship as children and shed some light as to why they act the way they do. Suddenly Kirino doesn\'t seem half as infuriating as she used to.Technicals considering, OreImo 2 is an impressive anime. It looks better than the previous season which was already impressive in itself. There are few scenes where the artwork manages to dip in quality, and the depth of field effect between character and scenery achieves in giving the show a more professional look. The facial expressions are also drawn and animated fluidly, which serves well to enhance the comedic scenes and portray the emotions of each character.The sound is nothing spectacular but does the job perfectly fine. Occasionally the soundtrack works to the story\'s advantage, and scenes that would otherwise feel hackneyed are instead able to stir up a few emotions. On the other hand, the opening is a generic J-Pop song that you will forget almost immediately as it ends. The ending sequences are pleasant, though perhaps not as much for the animation or songs as they are for the variety. It\'s hard to argue against a new ending for every episode.OreImo 2 is not a bad anime, but it is a bad sequel. Whatever you found appealing about the first season is likely to be gone here. It is made to be palatable solely to harem fans and incest fetishists, and those stuck somewhere in between are bound to find this season lacking any sort of cohesion.A good sequel aims to improve, not to throw away everything that made it unique in the first place.

OreImo 2 is a fundamentally broken anime.', ""This will be my review on Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai S2 (OreImo2), one of the more popular animes depicting sibling relationships in detail.OreImo2 takes place right after the events of the specials of season 1. In a fitting opening episode, the still-awkward relationship between Kirino and Kyousuke can be readily seen, demonstrating that the two of them still have a ways of bonding to go, until the girl's otaku habits bring the two of them together.There's a distinct change between this second season and the preceeding season. While the first season focused on Kirino's 'initiation' into otaku culture, and...her brother earnestly helping her with that transition... the second season delves into the relationship between the two of them, and their friends around them; particularly Kuroneko and Ayase.At first glance, OreImo2 may seem like it degraded to a harem rom-comedy, and that argument wouldn't be entirely false. However, seeing the relationships between Kyousuke and Kirino develop over the season's events, and how they deal with the reality that they someday might find a significant other was something that I particularly enjoyed. Of course, some scenes felt a little over the top at times, but the intentions and feelings were there. Kuroneko's arc was also a treat; her feelings for Kyousuke felt very real and sincere, and through her actions it's evident that she still cares for her best friend Kirino, regardless of her affections for her brother. Seeing these conflicting emotions is one of the selling points of this season.My only complaint would be Ayase's arc... while she's still an enjoyable character to watch, and though she might report me for saying this, her sudden attraction towards Kyousuke was a little unexplained and came off a little too... harem-esque... if you catch my drift.Other than those main caveats, the season is filled with episodes that were just nice to watch, such as Saori's past, and Kirino/Kyousuke's childhood. Regardless of their content, the main themes and feelings of OreImo are still there. The characters are still a blast to watch and the gags they make are funny. Never once did I feel that there was 'something wrong' with the second season.Those tired with the harem rom-com angle with animes may find this season lacking and disappointing, but for those who enjoyed the first season and don't mind the change of pace, will still find the new OreImo just as enjoyable as the old. her brother earnestly helping her with that transition... the second season delves into the relationship between the two of them, and their friends around them; particularly Kuroneko and Ayase.At first glance, OreImo2 may seem like it degraded to a harem rom-comedy, and that argument wouldn't be entirely false.

Kuroneko's arc was also a treat; her feelings for Kyousuke felt very real and sincere, and through her actions it's evident that she still cares for her best friend Kirino, regardless of her affections for her brother. Seeing these conflicting emotions is one of the selling points of this season.My only complaint would be Ayase's arc... while she's still an enjoyable character to watch, and though she might report me for saying this, her sudden attraction towards Kyousuke was a little unexplained and came off a little too... harem-esque... if you catch my drift.Other than those main caveats, the season is filled with episodes that were just nice to watch, such as Saori's past, and Kirino/Kyousuke's childhood. Regardless of their content, the main themes and feelings of OreImo are still there. The characters are still a blast to watch and the gags they make are funny. Never once did I feel that there was 'something wrong' with the second season.Those tired with the harem rom-com angle with animes may find this season lacking and disappointing, but for those who enjoyed the first season and don't mind the change of pace, will still find the new OreImo just as enjoyable as the old."", 'The idea of incest makes my stomach turn so as you can imagine the title “My Little Sister Can’t Be This Cute” (English translation) put me off big time. However, after watching the first season of this show by the recommendation of a friend, I found that not only was this show incest free, but also hugely entertaining and surprisingly deep just like “Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai”.The key word here is surprisingly deep.How so? Enter season 2 -The first, fourth, fifth and sixth episode of this season hint at what this show is really about: a guy who was outshined by his little...sister, the resentful little sister who lost the close bond she once shared with her older brother when they were young, the formerly close relationship that was ruined by the older brother’s resentment and their awkward attempts to rebuild their relationship as siblings after the little sister’s secret hobby comes to light.(My interpretation is based off of that dream Kyosuke had at the prologue of episode one, Kyosuke’s inner monologue in episode four, Kyosuke’s reaction to Kirino’s revelation in episode five and six and Kirino’s reactions to what Kyosuke says and does in episode 5…you know your agent wasn’t following you guys, Kirino…GTFO…also some stuff Kirino says involving Kyosuke’s childhood friend Manami in the first season)Through Kirino’s secret otaku hobby, both protagonists gain different things: Kirino slowly gets to spend time with the older brother she thought she lost again without having to lose the pride and hard façade she built up to mask her hurt feelings (if the dream sequence of episode one really happened).Kyosuke on the other hand gains friends, potential love interests, excitement in his life and most importantly the little sister he rejected when they were young, whose cold reaction to him (pre-secret-revelation and the misadventures they have together again post-secret-revelation) make him realize just how much he cares about her (if episode one sequence is foreshadowing and I’m not reading too much into this).Until this show, “Ben-To” and “Boku wa Tomodachi”, I’ve always hated Light Novel adaptations because they were too fantastical and obnoxious, a cramming of too many outrageous ideas that could potentially be amazing but didn’t go anywhere (The sharp object wielder in “Bakemonogatari”, the walking church character in “A Certain Magical Index” and that done to death Masou Shoujou joke of “Is This a Zombie” come to mind).If your mind isn’t already racing with this review let me add that this show is fantastic and inspiring, a concept that is deceptively simple, yet hides layers of touching depth.  Just like “Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai” (a show you should also check out and watch for what it is, a light read novel that has been animated)Watch it, you won’t regret it. sister, the resentful little sister who lost the close bond she once shared with her older brother when they were young, the formerly close relationship that was ruined by the older brother’s resentment and their awkward attempts to rebuild their relationship as siblings after the little sister’s secret hobby comes to light.(My interpretation is based off of that dream Kyosuke had at the prologue of episode one, Kyosuke’s inner monologue in episode four, Kyosuke’s reaction to Kirino’s revelation in episode five and six and Kirino’s reactions to what Kyosuke says and does in episode 5…you know your agent wasn’t following you guys, Kirino…GTFO…also some stuff Kirino says involving Kyosuke’s childhood friend Manami in the first season)Through Kirino’s secret otaku hobby, both protagonists gain different things: Kirino slowly gets to spend time with the older brother she thought she lost again without having to lose the pride and hard façade she built up to mask her hurt feelings (if the dream sequence of episode one really happened).Kyosuke on the other hand gains friends, potential love interests, excitement in his life and most importantly the little sister he rejected when they were young, whose cold reaction to him (pre-secret-revelation and the misadventures they have together again post-secret-revelation) make him realize just how much he cares about her (if episode one sequence is foreshadowing and I’m not reading too much into this).Until this show, “Ben-To” and “Boku wa Tomodachi”, I’ve always hated Light Novel adaptations because they were too fantastical and obnoxious, a cramming of too many outrageous ideas that could potentially be amazing but didn’t go anywhere (The sharp object wielder in “Bakemonogatari”, the walking church character in “A Certain Magical Index” and that done to death Masou Shoujou joke of “Is This a Zombie” come to mind).If your mind isn’t already racing with this review let me add that this show is fantastic and inspiring, a concept that is deceptively simple, yet hides layers of touching depth.

Well, it doesn\'t\' matter which choice you pick because either way, you will be stuck with your cute little sister with the undeniable fact that she is a closet otaku. In the end, you\'re just going to have to...deal with it and think ahead.Well, it\'s back. Ore no Imōto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai (My Little Sister Can\'t Be This Cute) is the direct sequel that aired from the Spring line up of 2013 that directly continues from the True End arc. Yes, it is actually required to watch those four episodes so if you haven\'t done so yet, do it now. There\'s nothing stopping you. At any rate, the series is back and with a title this long, it\'s hard to take it seriously right? Well, no but this sequel does have a lot of entertainment, some rubbed in the right and others in the wrong way. For the purpose of my laziness and ease of reading, I\'ll just simply refer to this sequel as Oreimo 2.I\'m not going to lie here. This was one of my most anticipated series from the Spring lineup. Going by the MAL statistics, I might not been the only one with the amount of hype surrounding this sequel. At any rate, Oreimo 2 is here! To do a little refreshment, we have the cute little sister Kirino who we know from the beginning is known as a closet otaku. Her tastes in games seems to be related to little sisters and the eroge genre. This seems to rub her brother Kyosuke the wrong way. In fact, the two does not get along at all. Kyousuke tries to be the supportive brother like a good sibling but Kirino sees him as the following: pervert, lolicon, and a brother who may have the sister complex. While not all of these may truly describe Kyousuke for who he is, there\'s certainly tension between the duo. Their relationship seems to not go along well most of the time. Kirino is the dominant of the duo and often ridicules Kyousuke at many occasions. It seems like Kyousuke has to deal with her tsundere tendencies, outbursts, and rather awkward accusations. At many times, there\'s the misunderstandings too that further implements problems. Long story short, Kirino and Kyousuke does not get along very well and in this sequel, it doesn\'t get off to a good start with that either.However, there are times in this season that does show a supportive side from both sides of the siblings. Although they both seem to deny it, it\'s quite obvious that both Kirino and Kyousuke are frustrated if either one of them gets a lover. In other words, there\'s something in their heart that seems to tell their brutal honest selves that they don\'t want the other side to enjoy a healthy relationship. I guess perhaps their relationship does have a loving side, in that sibling way. And speaking of love, there\'s more ways than just one.In Oreimo 2, love is in the air especially with our other characters. Well, it can come into many shapes and sizes such as the yandere Ayase. I\'m not a big fan of her\'s but her screen time was definitely appreciable for the way she seems to talk down Kyousuke but at the same time seems to enjoy their awkward relationship. Otherwise, there\'s my favorite cosplayer and arch-rival of Kirino from this series....the one and only one.....*drum roll*.....Ruri “Kuroneko” Goko!Voiced by the ultra talented voice actress Kana Hanazawa, Kuroneko gets quite the spotlight that she deserves in this sequel. Just like in season one, Kuroneko is like the opposite of Kirino and gets in her face at almost everything. Think of it this way. They are like oil and water, snake and mongoose, colors dyed red and blue. It\'s hate at first sight defined at its finest. Nonetheless, the two simply does not get along at all. The catch is in this sequel, there\'s even an new additional factor added in that causes Kyousuke to be part of the equation. And no it doesn\'t involve eroge. That\'s part of the 2D world.Among other things, Oreimo 2 seems to like to push drama forward between various characters. Well, there\'s more than just our can\'t-get-along-at all siblings. Rather, it also deals with other characters. For instance, we even have supporting characters who plays various roles in steaming up some awkward moments. This usually results in Kirino lashing out her tsundere tendencies at full force. The receiving side usually seems to be our poor Kyousuke who is accused of being a lolicon, sister-con, etc etc. Well, not everything rides on Kyousuke\'s bad side though. There are some nice girls such as Manami, Kuroneko\'s siblings, and even a track rival of Kirino\'s. Unfortunately, Kyousuke is too damn dense to ever notice anything most of the time. It doesn\'t help with the various misunderstandings either that often again puts Kyousuke on the wrong side of life such as drama in the club room. Get your popcorn out folks and watch those moments go fly in the air.As for the fan service goes, this sequel surprisingly doesn\'t have as much as I had thought. Well, it does have some though. While it omits the typical beach episode, the series has Kyosuke at edge of some awkward camera angles. Then, there\'s the outfit that Kirino wears that seems to either be for eye candy or even perhaps a foreshadowing. Either way, the fan service of this series is not as much as you may imagine. What Oreimo 2 does offer more though is doses of fun gags. It\'s not just those catchy end cards that some people might miss at the end of each episode. Rather, it\'s the dialogues such as the typical “I hate you” from Kirino that seems to have a completely opposite meaning. Then, there\'s also innocent talks with some dirty words mixed in spoken by kids too young. If “bitch brother” isn\'t part of that gag, I don\'t know what it is. Oh and let\'s not forget the rather indirect references to eroge games like sausage eating.The story structure of the series seems to be a bit loose although middle part seems to be the main dish of the meal. Some of the other episodes seems to be more as ingredients. By ingredients, I mean the supporting characters. With its blissful cast of side characters, there\'s a lot of screen time for many of them. Kirino though is still the main girl. Regardless, Kirino can barely stand Kyousuke while the latter has trouble dealing with her own love issues. In fact, Kyousuke becomes the sort of center of attention with the girls as he gets quite a lot of surprises in this sequel. Kirino on the other hand isn\'t happy by this but being the tsundere that she is, it\'s obvious how she responds. I found this a bit out of place and way out there. What deserved have been there though should be materials that were intact from the light novels. Perhaps the development of the story requires some cramming but it\'s something not too consistent enough for my liking.In technical terms of artwork, the series remains its similar style as the previous season. If artistic value is taken account, one could imply the adorable way some of the designs are drawn in particular the younger cast and Kuroneko. The way she cosplays is also quite catchy whether Kirino likes it or not. That gothic getup with the cat ears is just appealing and something most of us might not be able to take eyes off of. It\'s not too shabby either with the backgrounds too in terms of animation values. I would say that the overall artwork of season 2 is relatively the same as its prequel.As for soundtrack, the series continues the pattern of lighthearted pattern. To add to some extra gags, each of the ending episode concludes with a different song with different artwork. You might want to keep your hands on that print screen button because those end cards are something worth of a thousand words. Most of the seiyuu voices portrays their voices as well to fit their characters. Kirino remains a tsundere with her voice. Kyousuke\'s tone often reflects both supportive and frustration. Kuroneko\'s soft and touching voice gives off that feeling of adorableness. The OP song ""reunion"" by ClariS brings back indeed a reunion between many of the characters. There\'s also a bit of perhaps foreshadowing in the song as there seems to be a famous red string of fate at the finger tips of Kyousuke swining to one side but never reaching its target. Hmm.....By all means, Oreimo 2 is not a masterpiece. At least it did something right to get more people to watch this series from the first place with its unusual premise. Perhaps the drama can be seen differently from some to others. Then, there\'s those dialogues. Some of them are catchy while others tries too hard. What it did catch though is a burst of laughter at several occasions for me. With all set and done, this sequel awaits you but only if you finished season 1 and its true end. For fans of Oreimo, this is a continuation. After all, there\'s no way a series you\'ve finished season one and true end can be just dropped without giving at least the first episode a try. deal with it and think ahead.Well, it\'s back.

After all, there\'s no way a series you\'ve finished season one and true end can be just dropped without giving at least the first episode a try.', ""To be honest, I still don’t really understand Oreimo. Even after the second season, there’s still things that I’m unsure of. At a glance, the title suggests a story between a sister and a brother, but the thing is, looking back at two seasons of Oreimo, I really don’t think that definition fits all too well.Here’s the thing - yes, it is a story about a sister and her brother. But that’s not all - Oreimo isn’t just that. Oreimo doesn’t just explore the relationship between a brother and a sister, Oreimo divulges into everyday life, in this case I suppose, the everyday life of...an otaku schoolgirl struggling through her slightly different lifestyle. It’s also the story of a very average brother trying to do his best to protect his beloved sister - in which their relationship, has long fallen apart. And again, that’s not all. It’s also the story of friends, friends joined by a common interest, friends joined together to enjoy life, and solve each other's problems. That, is Oreimo. Daily life. Of an otaku, or rather, several otakus and their non-otaku friends.In that aspect, it’s not hard at all to call Oreimo simple. It really is, just the daily lives of a sister and her brother, and the people that surround them. There’s no intense magical girl fighting (at least, not *real* magical girl fighting), emotionally depressing family problems, no sword-wielding monster-slaying chicks that cross between worlds, no insane amount of unrealistic harem situations, no no, there’s none of that at all. Oreimo, is simple, yet enjoyable. Why? Because it speaks to it’s audience. I found myself divulged in Oreimo in the same way that Kirino was obsessed with Meruru. In the same way Kirino has her collection of Meruru figurines, I have my own personal collection of anime paraphernalia that I treasure and admire. Hell, even I want to go to Akihabara.I suppose such a pretense leads to a few issues - like the fact that Oreimo slightly lacks focus. Although it’s undoubtedly true that Oreimo spends a lot of time focused on the brother-sister relationship between Kyousuke and Kirino, it also spends a lot of time exploring things that are slightly random. It’s like every once in awhile, Oreimo simply benches the brother-sister relationship backstory, and focuses on other aspects of it’s story. Of course, I’m not really complaining, because if it had not done that, it really would have been solely a story of a brother and a sister, and nothing more. And I for one, believe that such a story probably wouldn’t have been all too interesting. Because it’s not like this lack of direction really affects the anime at all - it’s not like we’re lacking character or story development, every single “arc” within Oreimo, does develop both the cast and the story. Everything somehow ties back to one main idea in the end, and there are no useless episodes.In fact, if there was one thing about Oreimo that I really appreciated, was the cast. i don’t think I ever found myself in absolute hatred of a character after finishing the finale of Oreimo. In fact, I was pretty attached to the entire cast as a whole - they were fleshed out pretty well, and although in some places were underdeveloped, all in all, they were pretty well done. I suppose if I had to label a single problem to Oreimo, it would be that some of the characters, are slightly underdeveloped. If I were to label them, theres no doubt in my mind that I would have loved to see more of Kanako, the Akagi sister-brother pair, and a little more of Saori, although she was actually pretty well developed. I suppose to an extent, this lack of development is acceptable, since if Oreimo were to really develop all of these characters, the story really would have lost focus and became random to the point of being bad.But, I’m not really complaining, because realistically, not only were the characters fleshed out pretty well, they were also drawn pretty well. The animation is pretty well done, although something like that is to be expected of an anime produced in 2013.The other well-produced aspect of Oreimo, is more than likely the soundtrack. Like the animation, it’s to be expected that an anime produced in 2013 should have a good, acceptable soundtrack, and Oreimo is no exception, but to be honest, although it was well produced, there was nothing really special to it. The opening, on the other hand, is a great choice. It would have been bad for Oreimo to have broken the style of the opening theme from the original, first season of Oreimo. Although I do have to say that I’m not too sure about carrying over the concept of a different ending for EVERY episode from the first season of Oreimo was too good of an idea. I really think that it would have been better to just have another ClariS song as the ending. But then again, the ever-changing ending animation was pretty interesting, and I don’t doubt that a decent amount of work was put into it, because instead of pasting the same ending animation on every episode, Oreimo has a different ending animation, and song, for every episode, which I found mildly interesting.Realistically though, between Oreimo 1 and Oreimo 2, I can strongly say that nothing has really changed. For me, Oreimo 2 is only better because it’s a continuation, and I get to see more of the Kirino that I’ve enjoyed for two seasons straight, and get to explore more of the relationships and stories of friends surrounding Kirino and her brother.So, I suppose that Oreimo is one of those animes that never try to be overtly flashy. Oreimo didn’t try to provoke anything overtly powerful within it’s viewers. It merely set out to explore the lives of it’s cast, and in doing so, pleased it’s audience quite well. It’s the kind of anime that doesn’t need anything more other than more episodes to do the same thing it’s been doing for it’s entire life span. But the thing is, having said all that, Oreimo isn’t the kind of anime that you just bench once it’s done. Some would disagree with me, but I know for myself at the very least, Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai is the kind of anime that I probably wont forget, and given the choice to stick Kirino on my back windshield, or any other anime character, I’d probably pick Kirino.She’s just that cute. an otaku schoolgirl struggling through her slightly different lifestyle. It’s also the story of a very average brother trying to do his best to protect his beloved sister - in which their relationship, has long fallen apart. And again, that’s not all. It’s also the story of friends, friends joined by a common interest, friends joined together to enjoy life, and solve each other's problems. That, is Oreimo. Daily life.

Although I do have to say that I’m not too sure about carrying over the concept of a different ending for EVERY episode from the first season of Oreimo was too good of an idea. I really think that it would have been better to just have another ClariS song as the ending. But then again, the ever-changing ending animation was pretty interesting, and I don’t doubt that a decent amount of work was put into it, because instead of pasting the same ending animation on every episode, Oreimo has a different ending animation, and song, for every episode, which I found mildly interesting.Realistically though, between Oreimo 1 and Oreimo 2, I can strongly say that nothing has really changed. For me, Oreimo 2 is only better because it’s a continuation, and I get to see more of the Kirino that I’ve enjoyed for two seasons straight, and get to explore more of the relationships and stories of friends surrounding Kirino and her brother.So, I suppose that Oreimo is one of those animes that never try to be overtly flashy. Oreimo didn’t try to provoke anything overtly powerful within it’s viewers. It merely set out to explore the lives of it’s cast, and in doing so, pleased it’s audience quite well. It’s the kind of anime that doesn’t need anything more other than more episodes to do the same thing it’s been doing for it’s entire life span. But the thing is, having said all that, Oreimo isn’t the kind of anime that you just bench once it’s done. Some would disagree with me, but I know for myself at the very least, Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai is the kind of anime that I probably wont forget, and given the choice to stick Kirino on my back windshield, or any other anime character, I’d probably pick Kirino.She’s just that cute."", ""If you liked or even slightly appreciated this show at all don't read or comment or rate this review in anyway just get out.

You'll hate your life and it will make you beyond depressed. DON'T DO IT.Overall (after season 1) I had hope for this show. A lot of hope actually.

He chooses his annoying little sister, who he knows is annoying and doesn't even make it last. I really hope this writer is happy because I'm not. Pathetic writing. I get that it's different but you shouldn't write to just depress your audience. I can even do that, shit I could make the whole world cry from a story if i wanted to.

The anime that I couldn't figure out for the life of me is now more obvious than a vegetarian in a grocery shop and about as complex as a technical drawing of a hammer. It has stooped down to the level of your average harem and the studio didn't even do a good job at that.Now let's recap what made the first season fairly decent. First of all, it was realistic with a capital R and focused not only on the relationship between Kyosuke and Kirino but also on the Otaku community at large. The characters behaved naturally and in my opinion were as...close as any anime has gotten to simulating real human beings. Now bear this in mind as we describe what happens with that realism in the second season.First of all, the story takes Kyosuke and virtually all the girls in the cast, puts massive magnets on them and lets the pinball games begin. Some girls repel each other, some girls end up being pushed away but they're all eventually attracted to Kyosuke. The complexity and the realness set forth by the first season is brutally crushed, replaced with plot points and confessions that you could see coming from a mile away with both of your eyes covered.And just when the series begs for mercy a spectacular coup de grâce is delivered. Kyosuke, the martyr and defender of logic and reason from the first season turns more into your average perverted harem lead, welcoming this new found female attention hand over fist, without thinking about it too much. Shower spying, perverted fantasies, conversations about tits... fanservice? Yeah it's all here. OreImo2 is up to its knees with that.The female cast itself is a mixed bag as far as plot progression and character development goes. Kirino is as annoying as ever. First she hates her brother and wipes the floor with him, second she gets all lovey-dovey and clings to him like a bubble gum to a shoe sole... before proceeding to wipe the floor with the poor guy yet again. You'd wish she'd just give it to him straight. Nope. She loves, hates and is neutral towards him while he dances around her like a jester before a King in a castle courtyard.Kuroneko and Saori though receive considerable time and go through some much needed character development. Saori's background story deepens her character and shows us that not all things might be as they seem. Kuroneko on the other hand opens up more and we see the more shy and vulnerable side of her as well as her true feelings for Kyosuke. I have to say that out of all the characters, her story arc was the most satisfying and emotionally engaging. For a few episodes at least, you get to see a genuine romance.As for Manami, Ayase and Kanako - it's nothing short of a disaster. Manami gets royally shafted for the entire duration of this season. She's only there to provide advice once in a blue moon, appears in a flash back or two but don't hope for any development, not between her and Kyosuke or anyone else for that matter. Ayase, seemingly the only girl possessing common sense among her circle of friends becomes wholly shallow and is the first casualty, becoming nothing more than an addition to Kyouske's harem. Do not expect anything remotely interesting from her. Kanako ends up the same way as Ayase and though not confessing directly you can see what's going on because at this point the show becomes so predictable and un-realistic you might as well watch paint dry or play ping-pong with a can of soda.The final episode of OreImo2 is inconclusive and will leave you with a headache and a rash, both probably from anger and disappointment. Which means, yes flashbacks pertaining to Kyosuke and Kirino. While it gave us an insight as to why his sister disses him all the time, it was not a good way to end the anime.Many fans and casual watchers alike (myself among them) have been looking forward to the second installment in this series, hoping for a decent follow-up on the brother-sister relationship centered around the otaku culture. More than anything I think, everyone was hoping for some sort of a conclusion. However it is obvious now that the studio is intent on milking this series as much as possible and that means that the cast and the plot will be severely dumbed down.As for the visual and audio aspect - it stays exactly the same. Well drawn characters, attention paid to every detail and a decent OST. The opening and ending songs might seem a bit plain but personally I've never paid any attention to that and never include it as part of my grading criteria.All in all, OreImo2 is a failure. The story doesn't progress as much as I feel it should have given 13 episodes, though we are given a superb Kuroneko arc and Saori's own story was engaging too. Those two gems are surrounded by harem and a vast repository of bogus drama and Kirino's bipolarity.

Now with more fanservice and less fun!No but really, when I heard OreImo gets a second season I was pretty excited. I loved the first season, it was really entertaining and I had a blast with it. It wasn’t anything great but a good laugh and a lot of Otaku references.With season 2 though a lot of this changed. I’m not sure if it is me that changed or if A1 Pictures is at fault, or even if the source material is not that good. But season 2 was the biggest disappointment of the year so far.Story/ContentKyouske and his sister Kirino are...back, this time it revolved all around their relationship and more drama/romance as in contrast to the first season which had more comedy.It’s not that Season2 didn’t have any comedy, but just not as much.The start is slow and not very good, it gets scattered episodes that are actually enjoyable only to mix in the ones that are bad.It just doesn’t work. The romance part of the show should a) not be with Kirino and her Brother and b) not so dramatic.Everything is just really unrealistic and over the top, you cannot make real drama seem appropriate in a show that is so nonsensical. It harmed the overall feel of the show big time and I was mostly at the verge of dropping it.Thank goodness the last episode was actually good, so I’m not writing this with fury but rather a calm disappointed aftertaste of what the show was in general.CharactersWhile everyone was as they were in season 1, it kinda felt like a magical reset. I know they want you to get into it again, but the feeling of starting from 0 was still there.We got some insight on other characters this time but nothing that had any impact on the show overall.I mean what was the point of a backdrop for Saori if she is missing most of the time?I mean nice to know what other people have as backdrop but in the end the focus was on Kirino.Even the hoped for romance between Kuroneko and Kyousuke was disappointing and went nowhere.And the worst of it all was Kirino, as she was a worse TSUNdere than ever.The focus was weak this season, everyone got a tiny bit only to be sacrificed by Kirino which pissed a lot of people off.Art and AnimationThe original was done by studio AIC, this time A1 Picture did the job.Normally A1 has pretty good production values, and it’s not like OreImo looked bad, but an average looking show can’t be helped.What we did get though were a lot of asses.I mean A1 Pictures kinda needs to squeeze in a lot of Ass-Fanservice in every show they make, at least that’s what I see.It’s not really that it would ruin the show, since it is already not a serious show to begin with, so fanservice doesn’t ruin it. But the amount of it was definitely increased.The rest is the same, character designs look pretty bland, the sceneries are just as underwhelming, and animation is average stuff.Not the worst looking show of the season, but sure right in the middle of mediocre.SoundEven worse is the music in OreImo 2. I can’t quite remember what it sounded like in season one, but I guess it wasn’t much better.The opening is cheezy and the general BGM just fitting but not great.Voice actors are you normal to good modern presentation. I mean we have Kana Hanazawa and Yuuichi Nakamura. They are all talented so yeah it’s good.EnjoymentWell apart from a few episodes or scenes season 2 was a let down. I sometimes even hated it and just wanted to throw my computer out the window on how bad it was.While the enjoyable episodes were good enough to fill my sparse free time with some good moments.The last episode really helped the show not to leave behind this image of the worst thing ever in my memory.But I guess this is it for me. If a season 3 comes out, nope thank you. It’s not worth it anymore and it lost its magic.Scores:Content 4/10Premise and Setting 0 (same as before, also not great)Genre Execution -1 (compared to season 2 a failure)Dialogues and Cleverness 0 (not as funny as season 2 but had its moments)Interest keeping 0 (sometimes I thought I’d drop it, but then it saved it with a good episode)Characters 4/10Personality 0 (cliches but fun to watch)Behavior and Chemistry 0 (enjoyable from time to time)Development and Progression 0 (not really there)Motivation and Backdrop +1 (we actually got some backdrop for some of the characters)Likability 0 (while some of them are very likable, Kirino is not)Art and Animation 4/10Artstyle 0 (generic)Quality 0 (okay)Background 0 (unremarkable)Character Designs -1 (cheap looking)Visual Effects 0 (used not often)Sound 5/10Voice Acting +1 (many talented people)Opening and Ending -1 (waaaaay too cheesy)Soundtrack 0 (uninteresting)Sound Effects 0 (the usual)Enjoyment 4/10Art and Animation 0 (okay)Sound 0 (almost bad, but voice actors are good enough to enjoy it nonetheless)Story and Content -1 (too many annoying episodes)Characters 0 (a different focus would have made it better)Value 0 (unlike season 1 I will hopefully forget about this one)ConclusionOreImo2 is my disappointment of the year...

I have only this to say:I didn't do any research before starting this story so I had no idea what I was going into. First I read the short manga and then just had to see the anime how the story progresses. I really had high hopes that the tale wouldn't be about romantic relations with siblings. Of course I was wrong and wasted a lot of time to see incest romance unravel itself.Why did I keep watching? Because I honestly thought that this would be a nice tale about brother and sister who regain...their relationship as normal siblings. Oh how was I disappointed.Story is rubbish and even though it's a cliche: You see the rushed ending coming a mile away. Seriously don't waste your time. Learn from my mistakes. There isn't even any depth to the topic of incest. I wish I never watched this. their relationship as normal siblings. Oh how was I disappointed.Story is rubbish and even though it's a cliche: You see the rushed ending coming a mile away. Seriously don't waste your time. Learn from my mistakes. There isn't even any depth to the topic of incest. I wish I never watched this."", 'I\'d like to start this review off with my thoughts and opinions on the show\'s story.In my opinion, I thought the story was very relatable (Minus the harem). Will someone out  in the world  disagree with me? I think yes. Because not everyone will think this show is relatable. During the first season, you see Kirino as an Otaku who is simply trying to keep it a secrete that she plays little sister eroge games. I relate to that because in my society, anime watchers are simply classified as ""nerds"". The story really goes deep inside the life of not only a...high school student\'s life, (If Japanese student life includes harem and a lot of misunderstanding relationships between a brother and sister), and a life of an Otaku who is trying to live a normal life.For the art of this anime, I found it wonderful. In some episodes when two characters find themselves arguing, They end showing you this other world (an alternate dimension if you will) where they have these magical girl clothing on and they begin to fight. Which I found very cool. If I wasn\'t very descriptive I apologize. Basically the cool fighting stuff in Chuunibyou Demo Shikai, or Black Rock Shooter you see in those shows is what I was trying to explain. I found those scenes very amusing. When they aren\'t in those action scenes, the art was overall good and was goofy when something funny happens.For the soundtrack in this anime, I found both of the openings catchy because of it\'s upbeat rhythm. The endings how ever I tend to skip unless the ending credits were rolling as the episode was still playing its last few moments. I will tell you that each episode has a different song.Now for the characters, I can\'t say every character developed from start to finish. But at least the main characters such as Kyousuke, Kirino, Kuroneko, Saori (boy did she have a bug development in a non perverted way), and Ayase had development. I\'d say why and how but I can\'t do it without spoiling a lot of the story plot. You\'ll just have to watch and see. Also I say that these characters are the only ones with development because the other characters in the anime just didn\'t touch your heart unlike the characters mentioned aboveNow if you\'re going to ask me if I enjoyed this anime, I would have to say, I enjoyed it very much. It had lots of comedy that you will find extremely funny no matter who you are. You will find a lot of it\'s emotional scenes touching, and despite the development of some of the characters, you will eventually end up loving all of them.Overall yes I did enjoy this wonderful anime. It made me realize that siblings have an intense bond that can never be broken. No matter how much you THINK you hate them. Deep inside you know you love them as a family. I\'d definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for comedy, and a just a fun anime to watch.Now that this anime review is over, I bid you farewell ^o^~SuperNinja high school student\'s life, (If Japanese student life includes harem and a lot of misunderstanding relationships between a brother and sister), and a life of an Otaku who is trying to live a normal life.For the art of this anime, I found it wonderful.

If you want an anime with siblings of the opposite gender, along with love interests for the main male character, and very basic plot devices, then this is the anime for you. Plot devices in this anime are used in the most basic of forms, meaning an unexpected twist. To make the predictable unpredictable is one major gripes that I have with OreImo, and it just fails so miserably when the story steers itself back in the direction it came from. The twist just became absolutely unnecessary. It also doesn’t help when...side characters introduced from the previous season are completely eliminated just so the plot can better flow.At no point while watching this anime did I feel even remotely attached to any of the characters, and this is due to the fact that I’ve previously stated: The pandering of everyday events. It’s like watching a dog circle around a patch of grass, sniffing the ground for that sweet spot to lay a pile of dung, and then simply walk away once it had done its task. Not a care in the world even though it went through so much effort to find that sweet spot. This is what OreImo is. It panders the story around in a way that turns the characters into backdrops and reminding you that you should have some emotional attachment only when they implement their unnecessary plot twist. It tries to build the characters in a way that you would relate and find attachable, but the end result is meaningless, and again, this is attributed to the fact that the story manages to steer itself back into its predictable plot line even after a twist has occurred.While watching the characters develop their meaningless relationships, expect many moments of comic relief because this is about as funny as it’ll ever get. As a comedy, OreImo relies on short skits to make you have a quick laugh. Combined with the more serious tone of the plot, this is an anime that lacks a central focus.Once the main plot had run its course, the writers decide to re-introduce a love interest for the male protagonist. A character that they’ve neglected. And the story was so bad. It felt like they had to write and animate this short story just to appease the fans or simply meet the thirteen episode quota. A complete waste of time and money. side characters introduced from the previous season are completely eliminated just so the plot can better flow.At no point while watching this anime did I feel even remotely attached to any of the characters, and this is due to the fact that I’ve previously stated: The pandering of everyday events.

As a comedy, OreImo relies on short skits to make you have a quick laugh. Combined with the more serious tone of the plot, this is an anime that lacks a central focus.Once the main plot had run its course, the writers decide to re-introduce a love interest for the male protagonist. A character that they’ve neglected. And the story was so bad. It felt like they had to write and animate this short story just to appease the fans or simply meet the thirteen episode quota. A complete waste of time and money.', ""Season 1 was stellar. Every episode was outstanding.Season 2, Episode on episode got worse and worse, then all respect I had left for the little plot development dropped like a lead balloon on conclusion.After the first season, it was right up there as one of my top 5 animes, but dropped so hard and fast that by the end of season 2, I wanted to wipe all memory of it and claw my eyes out with a rake.Kuroneko was awesome, but I always saw Kyosuke with Manami, though I would have been happy with a conclusion with either.I never really liked Ayase, but heck, that...would have been better than what we got.This anime is a clear example of when you have a masterpiece of a series or film, despite wanting to see more of it, it's best to leave it well alone.If you've not seen this anime, then don't.Or watch Season one, then resist every temptation to see the world, plot and characters come crashing down to fanservice hell. would have been better than what we got.This anime is a clear example of when you have a masterpiece of a series or film, despite wanting to see more of it, it's best to leave it well alone.If you've not seen this anime, then don't.Or watch Season one, then resist every temptation to see the world, plot and characters come crashing down to fanservice hell."", '""Why are you in my way, pervert?""-Kirino KosakaThis poignant quote is just a sample of the masterpiece that is Oreimo. Oreimo pushed the boundaries of what we as humans define as ""good"" into a new genre altogether. But all in all, the main reason why this anime scored a perfect 10/10 was because it did something no anime has ever been able to achieve before: By actually fucking up a simple slice of life premise into oblivion.The story of Oreimo in itself is quite unique. So unique, in fact, that it can be classified as a whole new genre of anime. I like to call...this new genre ""shit in a bucket on a screen."" It took a simple premise such as love, put it in a food processor, and blended it into oblivion. In that sense, it is a lot like fate/zero because both start with a premise that soon gets deconstructed over the course of time.Art is perfect.

The first episode of the new series is fairly standard and is more about portraying the characters\' ""REUNION"" ( a very fitting opening theme right there).The real story makes progress as of episode 2 where Kirino is confronted by her best friend Ayase and about how kirino doesnt spend enough time with her and from then on each episode seems better than the previous one.

Anyway, let's start.I'll be honest, when I started watching the show, I didn't know what to expect about it. As I watched through the entire show, I learnt a lot of lessons. Screw the sibling love for a while and look at the other aspects. The series has really gone through many aspects of real-life scenarios that I have faced before, and it taught me to be strong in these situations. Which is why, I really found that most of the characters had something to take from.When I reached the final episode...of the show, excluding the specials, I felt that it ended quite abruptly, and there were plenty of loose ends. And thus, I watched the final three episodes of...controversy... And I enjoyed it. It was good, and I can only smile when I think of Kyousuke and Kirino, I'm not saying that we should learn everything we see from anime, this one for instance. I just think that it should be something looked upon as good. To break social norms just like that. What is stopping us? Judgement from public? There are no proper restrictions stopping us from doing anything. Love comes in many forms. This is just one example, and a good one at that. The last 3 episodes tied up many doubts the viewers had and ended without much haste.The other aspects like music was quite okay. I like the opening for both seasons. Quite catchy. xP The animation was good, a different style from shounen(duh), but the design was nice. There was no doubt that I laughed in every single episode. The humour is also something we can relate to I suppose.Anyway, the main point of this review was actually to tell those that haven't watched it yet to ignore anything you hear about this anime. Even if you've heard about its controversies. Screw it. Watch it for yourself and get your own opinion of it. See if you learnt a thing or two from the show, even if you didn't like it.For those that already finished it, good job. You survived. xD Honestly, I know it's tough seeing something so unexpected like that just appear on your screen. But if you don't like it, it's fine. Just don't impose your opinion on to others with different beliefs. It's nice to share opinions, but in this society, as seen from the anime, we can't really say that there's a 'right' decision, can we? be accepting to all kinds of people and thoughts. It'll be beneficial one day.With that, I think I've spent enough time. I hope it wasn't too...much...

Hearing there was a second season, I was a little mixed, because I had this feeling that if the show went on any longer it might actually lead to incest. I was fine with the Season 1 ending, but I watched Season 2 anyway. I'm here to say I made a huge mistake.Where Season 1 was funny, different, and just a joy to watch, Season 2 was boring, cliche, and...annoying to watch. The show got too serious for its own good, and it suffered because of it. It also doesn't help that this season had the same amount of time to adapt 2 extra light novels, so a lot of the books were taken out (more than what was taken out in Season 1 at least).I didn't like where they went with any of the characters. Kirino was even more of a bitch than she was last season, Kyousuke became really freaking weird (it was borderline creepy really), and nobody else was important. Aside from Kuroneko, who is cool. We learn more about Saori, which was a good thing, but that wasn't enough to save the rest of this show from being really bad.The production values in this show stayed the same from the previous season, which was another good thing. I will admit that I didn't find either of the jpop openings or ending particularly good, but they aren't bad either. But no amount of amazing openings and endings would make this shows story any better (and it isn't the kind of show you can watch just for how good it looks and sounds).Overall, I think you are better off just not watching Season 2, and letting the show end at Season 1 (after the 4 OVAs). A good ending might have changed my vote, but I got spoiled of the ending and all I'll say is this: it isn't good.Overall: 61/100 annoying to watch.

Minor spoilers included, read at your own risk. You may or may not like it. Provided that you do not like my review, feel free to vote it down. Or even better: write an own one.ForewordYou are looking for a funny and entertaining romcom? You might have found one - OreImo is quite funny and somewhat entertaining. But be aware: Do not expect too much, this show truly is about reckless, brave and yeah, pretty silly people.Story 5/10The core point of OreImo is a highly complicated (love?) relationship of two blood relatives....This anime shows us how a sister relearns to trust her brother, and how a brother is trying to get in touch with an odd culture.The story about siblings falling for each other is nothing new. However, the side stories (Otaku culture, Saori’s arc) are pretty interesting and well executed. I wish I could say the same about the main story: for the most part of the series there is no story at all, which is very disappointing and unsatisfying. Near the end of season two the main arc gets more intense and culminates in a fairly peculiar ending. While being a romcom, the show is not efficiently romantic or funny at all. But for all that, the part I disliked the most is the ridiculous attempt on a harem in the last episodes. Out of nowhere.Whatsoever, all those things fits the show pretty well. Even though the plot routes of OreImo might indeed seem strange and cloudy, again: the show is about silly, grotesque persons.Characters 5/10OreImo is a double edged sword at this point. The show has some really nice supporting characters like Kuroneko and Saori, who do have interesting backgrounds and their own personalities. On the other side there are characters like Ayase, whose nature is just absurd. Speaking of absurd things I can’t avoid mentioning the truly weakest point of OreImo: main characters. They act, again, highly absurd. Their actions and decisions feel borderline unreasonable, beyond any belief.  Oddly enough this fact fits the main arc pretty well, which may or may not be advantageous.Animation & Sound 7/10I love the animation of OreImo, it fits the whole show in a good manner. The colours are pretty deep and sharp, the scenes are colourful. However, in many scenes you can see some really sterile and lowly animated backgrounds, which is a pity.A couple of words about the music. The opening and ending themes are fine and consistent with the show. The sounds in the show itself are pretty good, but sadly I couldn’t notice any memorable compositions.Conclusion 6/10OreImo is not that bad. The sad part is: it’s not any good, either. Even though there are some funny and good parts, in the end you might feel highly cheated and disappointed. There are tons of much better romcoms out there, so don’t waste your time on mediocre shows like this one.If you are into siscon, try the great Koi Kaze, a mature and serious story about the forbidden love.

So far so good.But then comes season 2... And  more precisely the second half of season 2. Here the characters relationships start to run amok, make no sense and destroy everything good the series otherwise had built up. I have watched many animes where the ending had either been lacking or confusing. But OreImo takes the price. It leaves you with nothing but bad taste in your mouth.In short, do watch season...1. It's okay to good depending on your taste. But don't watch season 2. And should you decide to anyway, only watch the first half. But whatever you do, don't watch the 3 last episodes. It's like ending a good date being told your partner has cheated on you. 1. It's okay to good depending on your taste. But don't watch season 2.

An anime series has got on my nerves.Even though I don\'t do reviews for older shows I feel frenzied and obliged to write this just to get the load off me.This is late but it comes audacious and up to date, it\'s not just a review, these are my sentiments (unplugged) about this series,that have been collected right after I watched it so they are afresh, so much that I\'m not even able to think straight and am punching the keyboard buttons aggressively to type. I am going to give my emotions a voice and I am going to do...that by ranting here, now either you can just read it or sod off but I\'m doing it for my sake.Judgments can prevent us from seeing the good that lies beyond the appearances but my feelings are galvanizing my thoughts about this anime and framing a lot of them too.NOTE- If u have actually watched the prequel it\'ll help you in understanding my grievances better as my review draws heavy comparisons between both the seasons. My review also includes the specials (episodes 14-16)Also, I\'m giving HEAVY SPOILERS out on this review but nothing I say can wreck this anime more than it already is. The damage has been done.I am so mad because I feel I\'ve just been trolled? OreImo has disappointed me in more than one way.OreImo is the story between a brother & a sister and how their relationship as siblings\' changes and gets mend, given the time. I had read somewhere that beneath the simple-looking plot, OreImo is a gem for all anime fans (agreed)Though happy about a second season I was ascertain and my concerns weren\'t wholly nugatory. I had enjoyed watching the first 12 episodes of the first season but encouraging it to continue further would eventually lead to this road. Now, I am sure you\'ve heard from hither-tither that the second season leads towards incest. All the viewers who have previously watched OreImo have already killed the story by frivolously debating over OreImo\'s Incestual plot and have already broken this news to those who\'re yet to view the anime.They decided to specifically target all the qualities I cherished about this anime and turn it into something I incredibly detest. A ""BAD"" Rom-com Harem, I do not hate that genre but this is amateurish.How has Oreimo 2 failed? To answer that there is nothing ""Oreimo"" about Oreimo2 but apparently they claim it to be a sequel.-there\'s not much in it on the life of an Otaku-the life consults are gone-Kirino is bitchier.-There\'s too much blast from the past, clips from season 1 and Dejavu.-During every argument our harem Hero stands their gaping while the Heroines engross themselves in a fist-fight.-The idea of slapstick comedy, butt-kicking, bitch-slapping, screaming like kingkong and yelling words like ""baka,hentai"" is so hackneyed that it\'s not even funny anymore.Above stated are only few of the numerous things in the show that agitated me.All that gone, something else must be stirring? Mmm... Romance!The feelings that the show gives off changed, Well being 32 episodes long (first and second season combined) the plot had to feel like it was moving and going somewhere, so it followed behind the VN/Light novel and caught up with the manga.I\'m not going to dive deep into this stuff because the art,music,voice-acting has changed the least, mostly remained similar. I understand less about technicalities so my review is solely based on observations made by myself.Art (7/10) The art is precise & vibrant.Characters (8/10)Kyousuke, for once is not the weak kind of male protagonist who is torn between girls, he is a baka, liar, hentai, lolicon, masochist, lech but he is not a sissy and while Kirino keeps shouting at the top of her lungs that Kyousuke has a sis-fetish, Kirino\'s actions suggest that she has a brother complex MORE THAN ANYTHING.Our female characters are the perfect mix you might find in a harem and you\'ll grow fond of each of them independently, even if it takes a while.Music (6/10)The OP song is by ClariS again, very J~Poppy with catchy tunes it might not be remembered distinctly as all their songs sound the same but for as long as I was watching the series the OP song boomed in my head several times, it\'s very fitting for the title, The background music is primarily a guitar instrumental. Every episode has a new ED sung by the Seiyuus that I don\'t listen to before I move on to another episode.Voice Acting (8.5/10)The voice actors are chosen aptly for their roles, they\'re perfect and also popular (like Ayana Taketatsu and Kana Hanazawa)------x------So does OreImo get its fairytale ending?The second season ends at a cliffhanger without deducing anything and relies on the OVA to conclude the most important part and bring the series to a finish.I\'d be enraged if the series would end at a cliffhanger (Code Geass R1, Urggh) but then OVAs decided to make me angrier than I\'d imagined, I was angry they chose an incestuous path but I was filled with fury once they decided to cop out because I always knew OreImo couldn\'t handle incest. Mind you, I am not trying to act righteous here, Who\'re we to decide if Incest is wrong or right but did the execution have to be so poor? I\'ve seen ""Yosuga no Sora"" and liked it because it was able to place itself in that setting properly, What they do with OreImo is silly, it never sets the mood well for incest which is a way mature topic, It is manhandled jokingly like it\'s child\'s play. They, with their light-headedness take upon the idea, know they can\'t pull it off and then trash it. They take a whimsical on Incest and it\'s so terrorizing it\'s not even laughably bad, there\'s nothing gleeful or merriment about it just because the attempt is so chucklesome. It only provides distress to the watcher. OreImo feels like a half-hearted attempt of becoming extremely intense. With all that half-assed seriousness and half-baked emotions shoved into the show, OreImo was supposed to be a fun show with a message for siblings but they decided to go ahead and add bullscrap to it to make it deep, I don\'t know if Incest is morally right or wrong, it\'s arbitrary but it is morally wrong to go around spoiling if not polluting and corrupting a well-developed brother-sister relation,While their relationship as siblings is well-constructed and fleshed out. The love they both shared was familial and I never once sensed a romantic vibe.They had really matured in a relationship but not as lovers but as two siblings, Kyousuke is a protective, caring and reliable brother that Kirino admired, Kirino is his younger sister who Kyousuke adored. That never meant they had to fall in love with each other. Someone must be sick in the brain if they thought it\'s necessary to bring such a stupid,stupid plan to effect.I had to constantly keep my composure or else I really wanted to reach out and create a deep dent on the monitor screen. (Grr.. Makoto Itou, Shinji Matou) It\'s only the second time I\'ve so strongly reacted to an anime after ""School Days""""Let\'s just make them fall in and out of love because we can."" Ha Ha. Right? Like a hot knife sliding through butter.""Let\'s date for a few days and go back to being brother & sister"" *blech* like that could ever happen unless you were merrily infatuated and only wanted to try things out.The show doesn\'t take itself too seriously,you shouldn\'t either because if you do you\'ll be crestfallen by the end, like me. As it was a really special anime to me and to other Otakus who could relate to it so flee away if you were a huge fan of the past season and aren\'t just ready to be so overwhelmed yet. My enjoyment was actually at its peak (8/9) while watching OreImo and though I\'d give the previous season an overall score of 8 this season will have to be happy with a 5 or 6, I\'d have given it a 6 if it weren\'t the sequel to OreImo which really set the bar high, but I am settling for a  5/10 as it is a bad sequel to a good prequel, everything that set it apart from the other harems has been neglected, OreImo2 is just a meagre Rom-Com now and I hate to say it but even ""Twilight makes a better love story than this""My thoughts after watching OreImo2- "" Don\'t always go by the book "" (literally, do not) that by ranting here, now either you can just read it or sod off but I\'m doing it for my sake.Judgments can prevent us from seeing the good that lies beyond the appearances but my feelings are galvanizing my thoughts about this anime and framing a lot of them too.NOTE- If u have actually watched the prequel it\'ll help you in understanding my grievances better as my review draws heavy comparisons between both the seasons.

Every episode has a new ED sung by the Seiyuus that I don\'t listen to before I move on to another episode.Voice Acting (8.5/10)The voice actors are chosen aptly for their roles, they\'re perfect and also popular (like Ayana Taketatsu and Kana Hanazawa)------x------So does OreImo get its fairytale ending?The second season ends at a cliffhanger without deducing anything and relies on the OVA to conclude the most important part and bring the series to a finish.I\'d be enraged if the series would end at a cliffhanger (Code Geass R1, Urggh) but then OVAs decided to make me angrier than I\'d imagined, I was angry they chose an incestuous path but I was filled with fury once they decided to cop out because I always knew OreImo couldn\'t handle incest. Mind you, I am not trying to act righteous here, Who\'re we to decide if Incest is wrong or right but did the execution have to be so poor? I\'ve seen ""Yosuga no Sora"" and liked it because it was able to place itself in that setting properly, What they do with OreImo is silly, it never sets the mood well for incest which is a way mature topic, It is manhandled jokingly like it\'s child\'s play. They, with their light-headedness take upon the idea, know they can\'t pull it off and then trash it. They take a whimsical on Incest and it\'s so terrorizing it\'s not even laughably bad, there\'s nothing gleeful or merriment about it just because the attempt is so chucklesome. It only provides distress to the watcher. OreImo feels like a half-hearted attempt of becoming extremely intense. With all that half-assed seriousness and half-baked emotions shoved into the show, OreImo was supposed to be a fun show with a message for siblings but they decided to go ahead and add bullscrap to it to make it deep, I don\'t know if Incest is morally right or wrong, it\'s arbitrary but it is morally wrong to go around spoiling if not polluting and corrupting a well-developed brother-sister relation,While their relationship as siblings is well-constructed and fleshed out. The love they both shared was familial and I never once sensed a romantic vibe.They had really matured in a relationship but not as lovers but as two siblings, Kyousuke is a protective, caring and reliable brother that Kirino admired, Kirino is his younger sister who Kyousuke adored. That never meant they had to fall in love with each other. Someone must be sick in the brain if they thought it\'s necessary to bring such a stupid,stupid plan to effect.I had to constantly keep my composure or else I really wanted to reach out and create a deep dent on the monitor screen. (Grr.. Makoto Itou, Shinji Matou) It\'s only the second time I\'ve so strongly reacted to an anime after ""School Days""""Let\'s just make them fall in and out of love because we can."" Ha Ha. Right? Like a hot knife sliding through butter.""Let\'s date for a few days and go back to being brother & sister"" *blech* like that could ever happen unless you were merrily infatuated and only wanted to try things out.The show doesn\'t take itself too seriously,you shouldn\'t either because if you do you\'ll be crestfallen by the end, like me. As it was a really special anime to me and to other Otakus who could relate to it so flee away if you were a huge fan of the past season and aren\'t just ready to be so overwhelmed yet. My enjoyment was actually at its peak (8/9) while watching OreImo and though I\'d give the previous season an overall score of 8 this season will have to be happy with a 5 or 6, I\'d have given it a 6 if it weren\'t the sequel to OreImo which really set the bar high, but I am settling for a  5/10 as it is a bad sequel to a good prequel, everything that set it apart from the other harems has been neglected, OreImo2 is just a meagre Rom-Com now and I hate to say it but even ""Twilight makes a better love story than this""My thoughts after watching OreImo2- "" Don\'t always go by the book "" (literally, do not)', 'Quite possibly the most fan-dividing anime of the year, OreImo is a tough cookie to even begin to review. If you\'ve seen the first series, then the sudden u-turn in almost all aspects of the show will be shocking, to say the least. It might well go down in history as the anime which alienated the most fans, or it might even be the trendsetter for future harems, because what OreImo has to offer in controversy is matched by its brilliance.If we were to ignore the original series, let alone forget that there is even a light novel that precedes it, then you could...probably score OreImo a 9/10 and be done with it. There\'s delightful animation, hilarious romantic comedy, in depth characters, an insight into otaku culture, and an unique exploration of the once-taboo theme of incest. The problem is, this anime is a direct sequel to something far greater in almost every way.Story: 5/10Much to the disappointment of fans from season one, there are very few redeeming factors about the story of the second season. Gone is the eccentric plot revolving around the life advice sessions, with almost no sign of a story to replace it. There is next to no mention of Kirino\'s success with producing her own anime; Kirino\'s modelling and racing career is also sidelined but no replacement can be found. The only reliable plot that occurs involves Kyousuke and his new love interest in Kuroneko, which is probably one of the only bricks holding the fort together. It is relieving to know then that Kuroneko and Kyousuke\'s miniature plot-arc is possibly the best in the season. However, the rest of the series tries too hard to juggle the numerous characters in the harem without much in the way of linking them together. Overall, it would be wise to abandon hopes of a thrilling plot, as you will be better off focusing on the characters and comedy that will blow you away further than the story even travels.Art: 9/10There is no mistaking the beautiful art that OreImo manages to tease our eyes with. Rich, vibrant colours and a wide variety of settings provide eye candy that many other animation studios envy. The character animation is superb and the attention to detail is impressive, to say the least. It doesn\'t quite have a masterpiece touch to make it a 10/10, but it\'s not far off. In general, high performance once again from a high-quality studio - cute girls have rarely been cuter.Sound: 8/10Personally I have always found the soundtrack to this series entertaining in its own right, and whilst I slightly preferred the music from the first season, the quality is definitely the same across both. OP and ED are worth listening to in their own right, and you may find yourself occasionally humming a tune or two whilst doing the dishes. The voice acting is as per season one spot on, with believable accentuations and real emotion - particularly from the voice actor of Kuroneko (Hanazawa, Kana). As a whole, there is good reason to praise the sound artists, who are often undervalued for the factor they play in creating the atmosphere.Characters: 6/10This was undeniably a tough decision to make, because as far as a harem goes the two deciding factors for its worth are usually how funny it is and how good the characters and relationships are. Sadly, there are too many failures in OreImo for them to go unnoticed. Without wanting to spoil anything, my entire point can be summed up in one character: Asuna. Everything you knew about her has rapidly and inexplicably changed. It\'s no use arguing that ""it\'s explained in the light novels"" because the anime was designed to be watched alone and not to accompany its source. The script writers simply did a bad job of introducing the changes to her character. For reference, imagine taking Simon from Gurren Lagann in episode one, and then suddenly transition next episode to the Simon from the final episode. There is no impossibru face strong enough to describe how atrocious that would be, and yet the story decides it\'s appropriate with what used to be the anime\'s only grounded character. That being said, a few characters do escape the butcher\'s knife - the best being (luckily) the protagonists and Kuroneko. Kirino retains her enraging bitchiness whilst still managing to make you sympathetic towards her because of how (relatively) real she remains. Kyousuke actually feels more like the harem king this time around, as he becomes legitimately involved in the eroge games and shows his feelings about the other girls more acutely. A personal favourite of mine (and indeed of many) is Kuroneko, who cute factor aside, becomes possibly the deepest of all the characters explored in the entire anime. Her feelings are not an obsessive fad, or a confused bundle of emotions, but true and honest love. If you haven\'t yet seen the series, expect a treat amongst the waves of deplorably ignorant relationships. In conclusion, the characters probably won\'t meet your expectations - the controversy killing off many a fan - but there\'s probably a silver lining in there somewhere. You just need to look at it really hard.Enjoyment: 8/10Whilst there are many pitfalls and dangerous waters (especially ship lovers - I won\'t even begin to mention the OVAs), OreImo does contain a multitude of comedic moments, of which at least some will have you laughing. It might not be crying-tears-of-laughter hilarious, but you might wake up your next door neighbour with an untimely fit of giggles, on at least one occasion. Making up for where the show lacks in story and plugging a few of the character void-holes has helped to make season 2 more than bearable. Even when characters do something completely out of character, it\'s more than likely that two seconds later Kyousuke will mess up or act silly in such a way that you can\'t help but smile. And whilst this should probably go in the character or story section, the sheer enjoyment from the Saori backstory plot is enough to carry three or four episodes alone. To summise, be prepared for anything. No seriously, anything.Overall: 7/10There are too many problems with OreImo season 2 for me to completely wash over them with the entertainment banner, but that being said it is not a bad anime either. As I initially said, most of the disappointment comes from this being a sequel to a contender for greatest harem of all time. The verdict? If you have seen the first season and the first set of OVAs, then season 2 is still worth watching, just don\'t expect to end on the exact same note as before. If not, then why are you watching this when you could be watching the first season? What you should really be worrying about is preparing to replace your monitor; because if you don\'t punch a hole through it after watching the second season OVAs, you truly are a master of control. probably score OreImo a 9/10 and be done with it.

The characters really improve and there is a lot more emotion coming through. Every sub character compliments the main character Kyousuke in only one specific way whilst still having reasons for conflict with other characters.The story is a lot like the first season and I think there could have been some bigger changes in the plot, but I feel every character has improved so if you liked the first season definitely watch this. ', ""Oreimo S2. A series many wanted, and a series that was given. Did it live up to expectations?As sequel series go, this is better than the first. There are simple reasons behind this. Most would agree that character development was what made Oreimo S2 so much better than S1. The anime is very solid in the idea that it is quite simply, showing the lives of people who are slightly different to normal society. It shows the interests, the friendships, and the struggles of these people, which is something people relate to. When you can watch something that's making you feel like you relate...to emotions of a character, you get the real perspective. This is something people clearly enjoy, and I agree on this. The main element is a troubled sibling relationship, which is a typical theme, but this series seems to be very real in its ideas about the troubles between the two main characters. This element of real conflict is a great aspect to it.It is a thoroughly enjoyable series for it gives you surprises also. Developments happen suddenly, and also leave you on a knife edge. This is definitely a positively entertaining factor.I like the characters too. I think that each one demonstrates a type of person not thought about in the society. Kyousuke, the secretly protectivekirino, the aspirational and self motivatedkuroneko, the committed but unrecognisedSaori, distant and misunderstood yet strongI think when you see it this way, you can understand why Oreimo S2 is very firm on being something people relate to. It has strong values and feels very realistic. This is for me, something that makes it worth watching. However I struggle to see why people have a love for Kirino. Personally she drags the series down a little, I want to throw her off a building if I'm honest. I don't know why but that's what I think.In all, Oreimo S2 is unusual in that it is better than the first series. It makes it's improvement in showing the who the characters really are. However it isn't amazing. The story still feels a little like there's more to it, mainly due to the amount of sub plots to aid character development. If there is series 3 (which the last episode seemed to hint at) then maybe this can be forgiven. They had to either finish the story or develop characters, and I think they did the right thing in developing the characters. If they continue, then I can safely say combined, Oreimo is a must watch for anybody. to emotions of a character, you get the real perspective.

It played with a lot of anime tropes and aspects of anime culture in general in interesting ways and was thoroughly fun. It was the sort of show that surprised with how good it was. So, yes, a second season was definitely very much welcome... but while I still overall enjoyed the second season, it simply isn't quite as successful as the first. It fails to deliver in some important regards, and for that it is a bit of a disappointment.The production values are not where the show goes wrong....A-1 Pictures has proven themselves capable of producing very visually appealing, well made anime and this is no exception. It looks great and sounds great. The art is crisp, glossy and appealing, the music is good and the voice actors come across as quite comfortable in their roles.Oreimo has great characters. Kyosuke is a great male lead; relatable, fun, not weak. Kirino is an interesting if at times frustrating female lead, but overall works as a character for her infectious energy. Kuroneko is just adorable and awesome. The rest of the cast is all mostly very likable and they remain that way in the second season. Some of them are developed really well too. The episode Saori gets is one of the high points of the season and makes me wish they had done more with her character. Kuroneko's arc in the middle also has a lot of very sweet high points, even if the resolution is rather weak and infirm. Even Kirino gets some good development in places, especially in the final flashback episode.Some of the character development is not as good. Ayase is the biggest disaster. At the beginning of the second season she seemed right and in fact more likable and interesting than ever, but in her arc toward the end her characters was pretty close to ruined. I had never once thought she was supposed to have advanced feelings of any sort for Kyousuke. They don't have a chemistry that suggests that and never have, which just makes everything that suggests otherwise between them seem painfully forced. It's quite telling that minor character Kanako's tacked on late developing affections for Kyousuke are more believable. Which brings me to the point that the second season tries far too hard to draw up the harem situations. The characters naturally play off each other in interesting ways. Not every single one has to be in love with Kyousuke. It really cheapens things, especially since the core relationships, especially Kyousuke and Kuroneko remain so strong. As for Kyousuke and Kirino, most of the time it's as interesting a dynamic as it ever was... but it perhaps plays the incest card a little too strongly, making the characters harder to relate with. Really, Oreimo S2's biggest fault is that it makes things too complicated for their own good.All that said, if you really enjoy these characters and the way they interact with each other as I do, you will most likely still find a lot to love. It's not fully satisfying--it's not even fully completed, any kind of resolution being saved for the OVAs--but it's still Oreimo. I wish the approach had been slightly different and for it there were moments that were frustrating, but as a fan of the original, this second season still had more than enough high points to justify the lows.

There are so many reasons to not enjoy it, but it had the charisma to keep you watching and to care about the characters despite their fairly trite characteristics. Season two of Oreimo is enjoyable, to the extent that I'd still call it a good anime. It's not great, but it's perfectly enjoyable.Story - 7/10We follow on from the 'True Ending' of the first season, Kyousuke has brought Kirino back from America and everything is returning to an equilibrium.  The story of the second season...is not particularly strong; we're led through a few of the lesser seen characters' back stories and home lives which is fun enough but I found that the stories felt a little rushed, which was most likely a result of trying to push a lot of Light Novel material into only one or two episodes.Art - 8/10I can't really fault the art; it's nothing we haven't seen before in regard to distinctiveness but it's fluid, vivid and it doesn't distract us from what's actually happening in the story. There are plenty of cutesy character designs and most tastes appear to be catered to. Even introducing the 'Plain Girl' Manami, a character design which is rarely seen in any degree of spotlight.Sound - 8/10The OP and EDs are all very light and fun. Personally, I don't think the new OP is as enjoyable as the old one as the old one was weirdly enjoyable and the new one doesn't do much for me. The background sound is excellent for setting the appropriate mood for the scenes. The voice actors are all convincing in their roles and Kuroneko's VA (Hanazawa Kana) in particular deserves a mention as she has quite a large fanbase.Character - 7/10It's not as if the characters are bad, they aren't particularly original but they are pretty okay. We're shown a few back stories and there's a fair amount of character development seen in this season - some felt pretty rushed - and we see sides to some characters that we wouldn't have expected, which is often nice to see in an anime. The characters each have their own distinct sense of humour and they all carry it off very well.Enjoyment - 7/10Despite its flaws it is still an anime I genuinely enjoy. Provided that you don't expect it to be a masterpiece you should really enjoy it as well. The humour of Oreimo can be very good and I would say it's certainly one of the show's strong points.Overall - 7/10In conclusion, it's a good anime, it isn't as good as the first season but it's still worth watching.

It's stuck in my head for many days. I watched Toradora after this but I couldn't enjoy it enough because my head was full of OreImo's memories while watching Toradora.This may seems biased about the score because I like Kirino's characteristic very much.Kirino's tsundere part is always unwavering and that made the show enjoyable. It's like never-ending story like One Piece, Dragon Ball, where all characters' habit is constant. But there are also development in skills, feelings and looks.This anime is semi-harem because the main protagonist made all nearby girls love him. But it's love...with reasons not like most harem anime. That's why it's not boring. Love without reason is what you always found in harem anime but not this one. Anyhow, the main protagonist didn't accept the girls' love.

I started myself down a path I’m not too upset about, because I feel like the reward was every bit as satisfying as the ride itself. Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (or Oreimo [or My Little Sister Can’t Be This Cute]) is a series full of misconceptions and misdirection which would explain why people write it off as dumb, fetish-y, siscon garbage and they’d be right to anyone who accepts an opinion as fact before watching a series. Now I’m not saying that Oreimo’s second season does...any better to provide us with less incestuous undertones (I’ve just been on  roll with this incest shit lately), because it actually makes our impression of the Kousaka household worse (until a certain point).When series change studios between seasons (look at that alliteration huehuehue) there’s a certain level of difference that’s acceptable before it feels like a totally different show, but as far as artistic style is concerned there wasn’t too drastic a difference between AIC and A-1’s Oreimo so it gets a thumbs up in my book. Soundtrack remains the same, ClariS still handles the opening song (which is stupid catchy, by the way). You get much of the same with this season, but a little different. I see why this series is classified as harem (pardon my ignorance for not having read the light novel) and that was something that I just kind of suffered through to get to the end. This season hits lower points than the first, but it comes back way stronger than the first season ever did and honestly adds justification to all of Kirino and Kyousuke’s quirks.

It started off so strong, limped through the back half off of it\'s story, and then fell flat on it\'s face right before the end in one of the biggest ass pulls I\'ve seen in anime. I don\'t even have a metric for this because this is the literal worst endings I have seen, but I\'ll get to that.TL;DR: Overall I enjoyed this series, it had a lot to say about the perspective...of how people pursue their hobbies and frames the otaku culture as something that, while not without flaws, cannot be labeled as an immediate negative in someone\'s life. Even if this topic is constructed within a pretty vanilla harem series with only one male character worth mentioning, it explored the ideas of what makes someone who they are and the risk of losing their identity if even a small part of that was removed from their life. I actually enjoyed the whole ride along... until the end.My breakdown through MAL\'s separation of episodes are as follows:Season 1- Episodes 1-13: 6- Episodes 14-16: 7Season 2- Episodes 1-13: 3- Episodes 14-16: 1I have decided to put this all encompassing review in this part because it is last full season and not a part of MAL\'s classification of ""specials."" As per request of MAL\'s guidelines, I will attempt to voice my reasons for these scores without spoiling major plot points, but here is your official spoiler warning.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD***Story:This was by far the strongest part of this series as a whole. It was probably the only reason I watched the second season in it\'s entirety seeing as the major themes had been explored to an acceptable degree, the characters have all had ""their arc,"" and the ending (whichever one you prefer) had closure for the main arc. Season two just tried to milk all the goodwill that the series had earned through its first arc. I will say that it did not help that I was watching this through Crunchyroll which did not have the specials so upon watching the first episode of the second season I was confused about all this story that I missed. I was undoubtedly frustrated upon returning to this episode which may have colored my consumption of the first two episodes in a slightly more negative light than deserved. However, this was not earned back upon a rewatch of the first episodes of the second season.To me, this story appeals to me more as a study of the community aspect of otaku culture and self identity, and less so as a ""bed the sister tale."" I would be lying if I said that there weren\'t moments where the brother-sister relationship didn\'t speak to me as my sister and I went through a similar experience of being good friends as little kids, growing a part as I moved into high school, and becoming better siblings upon the realization that we were both into anime. I really enjoyed how their relationship developed from circumstance and blossomed into a believable, if a bit extreme, functional brother-sister relationship.I want to take a moment to address that the “bed the sister” part of the story did not really bother me from a storytelling point of view. I cannot shake that I am a bit bothered by the reality of incest and avoid it wherever I can, but did not distract me from the relationship that Kirino and Kyousuke developed. I thought it was something that developed over time instead of coming out of nowhere like some other characters in this show. Make no mistake that it is entirely possible to have a distaste for incest relationships and observe one develop.Getting back on track, I thought that the structure and pacing of the first season was on point. It established our characters, led them through a few trials and tribulations, and brought all the tension to a head right when the relationships between Kyousuke and his harem had been touched on. I was thoroughly crushed when I saw the bad ending for the first time. All that progress that he had made in mending his relationship just dropped like a rock with no pretenses, no warning. That stuck with me. I felt abandoned, but in a way that I didn’t feel betrayed by the story. If the series had ended there, it would have been a fairly average series that made its mark on the anime landscape with a small cast of intimate and likable characters that struggled through something together and all of them became better because of the experience.But no, the show must go on. How could we end with Kirino disappearing without telling anybody? Will Kyousuke bed his sister? What will become of Kuroneko and Saori? I’m sure fans that didn’t read the manga were left wanting to find out what happened to the group. I have to admit, I was one of those people. I wanted to see what the heck happened, and so I went onto season two… But not without detour since episodes 14-16 were not on Crunchyroll. I actually liked these specials even more because it answered some of these questions. Unfortunately, they also brought up more questions and left me wanting more.However, it was a trap! Oh my, did the story take a big dump on itself and devolve into a bait harem show. The writing was on the walls when I could tell that Manami was going to be a real contender for Kyousuke’s affection, but no it didn’t stop there. Every girl that was wasn’t Kyousuke’s mother (and the one girl from the computer club who was a yaoi fantasizer) had to have it, and they will not be denied. By the end, there were six girls fighting over him. I get it, it is supposed to be a male fantasy, but that was obnoxious at best and disgusting at worst. I will remind you that with the exception of Saori who’s age was not explicitly made clear to me (I may have missed it), all of these girls are in middle or high school, but all want to take care of him like a housewife would. Maybe I was just not aware of this in the first season, but the characters in the second season have the agency of adults. We only get a glimpse of the Kousaka family’s parental figures (Kuroneko’s parents are oddly missing from the picture), but Kyousuke had to sneak out in the middle of the night and lie to his parents to do some of the favors for Kirino, but in the second season, it seems like they can just do whatever they wanted without much consequence.Another thing I have to give the story credit for is that is atypical of harem shows is that, despite his indecisiveness, Kyousuke actually chose who he wanted to be with in the end and rejected all the other girls with absolute clarity. I have to applaud this because I’m so sick and tired of shows slogging through themselves and ultimately come to no conclusion because the main guy is indecisive or none of the girls will admit that they love him. This show had the balls to not only have all the girls state their affection and get rejected. This surely will come to a satisfying conclusion right?Baited and outsmarted. Not by episode 13, that one didn’t need to exist. It could have been put in the beginning of the series and made a heck of a lot more sense, or omitted entirely and the show would not have lost anything other than showing young Kyousuke, Kirino, and Manami. But, goddammit I have never been more pissed at an ending ever in my life. I don’t have the expansive knowledge of anime like some people, but I have wanted enough romantic comedies and harem shows to be thoroughly disappointed by how the main couple, or any of the relationships never take flight. It is almost a staple of the genre and I was ready for this story to take that chance and actually make an actual couple out of the characters that went for it and sacrificed everything in order to accomplish it. So, what did they do with it? The ending has no metric for disappointment, simply because it blows all the other unsatisfying and rage inducing endings out of the water. I’ve seen this ending compared to the ending of Berserk which has an infamous ending that angered a lot of the fanbase. However, from what I’ve heard from different reviews was that it was infuriating, but it made sense. The ending has no logic. No rhyme. No reason to go off of. Kyousuke and Kirino had nothing to gain from having that kind of relationship last for the time that it did. Even if you go to the extreme and say that they had sex (mission accomplished right?), it doesn’t make this logic any less broken and undercut the last 4+ episodes of cutting down possible relationships just to have this one. In the end, what did that get them? They went right back to being siblings. The only possible thing that I can think of that makes any amount of sense for myself is that they had sex, got over the appeal of it, and returned to their season one interactions, just without the incest undertones.A Quick Note:For the rest of this review I will be separating my critique between season one and season two. This is because the story, and to some extent its characters, can be mostly judged as a whole because it is a light novel adaptation and the high points and flaws can be attributed to the source material. Outside of the character development, the rest of the anime is left up to its adaptation. Season one was adapted by AIC Build and season two was adapted by A1 Pictures. While both of these studios are under Aniplex, I got the impression that the two seasons were treated VERY differently. I will make it clear that I hate A1 Pictures and what they have created for shows like this. Their apparent lack of effort towards some of their works is just horrific and most of it comes in the form of its art.ArtThe first season was nothing special. The character designs of the girls were all fairly cute, even if some of them were a bit generic. I was never blown away with any of the animation, but I was never distracted by it either. The settings and set pieces followed suit. The animation was fairly consistent and standard. It was solid. 5/10The second season was an abomination, mostly in the animation department. There were multiple times per episode where I would be distracted by background characters frozen in space in an expression that I was hard pressed to believe anybody would keep. The classroom scenes were the biggest offenders of this. There was also an over-reliance on panning shots on still images. While this is an acceptable, even if low effort, way to do establishing shots, but when there are times where characters would actually cover each others’ mouths in order to not show them talking. Now I don’t know the actual amount of frames that this actually saves, but this is just unacceptable in scenes where there is no need for it. Other times speaking characters would be on the wrong side of the shot, reverse shot camera technique to show the black expression. My biggest complaint was the overuse of previously animated footage that seemed to infect all parts of the second season after the first couple of episodes. Some of these were even shot for shot copies of previous part in the anime with different outfits. These techniques and more were pervasive throughout the second season and whether I just didn’t notice any of this in the first season or they did not bother me, this wasn’t abused to the extent it was in the second half.My main complaint of A1 Pictures as a whole is that their animation is garbage as a whole. That’s not to say that they cannot animate at all, there are some scenes and still images that are well designed, but when these shots make up maybe 10% of the runtime of the entire episode, I have to call them out somewhere. It is all that more apparent in a series like this where two different studios are in charge of two different seasons. I would have to say that the second season had about 10% of its animation on par or slightly above the first season as a whole, and the other 90% was drastically worse. This is most apparent in shots where the characters are in crowds of people. Rarely did I see these characters have any sort of attention to their movements outside of the Meruru concerts, and even then there were times where the concert would be in full swing and there would be people in the background standing still not doing anything. I do not understand that at all.I generally parse the bad from the good when I see a scene where extras are visible, but the focus is supposed to be on the main characters. Do these extras have any distinct features? Are they dressed appropriately for the weather and time of day? Are they moving? If they are standing still, are they standing still for a believable reason? Even if they look like a real person, if all these conditions aren’t met, it throws me off. If extras are going to be treated without much if any care, it has to be a conscious style choice. Good examples of this are Acchi Kocchi (where everyone outside of the cast is a white figure) and Kill La Kill (where all the extras have the exact same design because they are mindless drones). In both of these series, a significant less time was devoted to the design of the extras, but they communicate to the viewer that they are not relevant to the story and I don’t need to pay any attention to them. In season two, and other A1 Pictures shows, extras are given character designs, but they are given just enough detail to be distinct from one another, but not enough to be believable to me at least. I was so distracted by this, that anything new artwise (read not much considering they go a grand total of five new locations and 3 of them are rooms) totally flew under the radar of garbage that was the second season’s animation. 1/10As a side note, the decision to include random bits of A1 works like SAO into the show rubs me in a way that fuels the rage of a thousand nerds getting 360 no scoped in Call of Duty… It’s annoying, I hate it, and I wish A1 Pictures would stop doing it.Sound:The sound design was not to my taste. It didn’t so much convey an emotion, but rather pull one out of me. Scene that’s supposed to be funny? Better start the funny music! Have a heartfelt moment coming up? Queue the feels track! The tracks all fit the scenes they were in, but I am not sure if that is because I am or was conditioned to feel that way with the sounds. I found this annoying in the first season (3/10) and unbearable in the second season (2/10). The best scenes in this series where the music was either so quiet that the characters overpowered them, or there was none at all.Character:As a whole, I liked the cast of the show, but man were they generic as can be.  Kyousuke was a generic main character in a romance or harem series. He’s generally well mannered, extremely nice, reliable, etc. Everything that you want your main character to be for the rest of the harem. Kirino is a typical tsundere, but she has a reason to be initially abrasive towards her brother. She loved her brother in the past, but hates the person he’s become from her perspective. Kuroneko is a deadpan loli. She’s shy and tries to keep up this role player persona because she loves the show MASCHERA. Saori is a split between a rich girl and a generic otaku. I appreciate that the show explored why she was the way she is, but the execution in certain parts was odd to say the least.The rest of the supporting cast are one note characters. To complete the harem, there is Manami, Ayase, and Kanako who are as follows: childhood friend, tsundere (type B), and bitchy. Manami is the only one of the three who like the main character who is given any sort of explanation, but most of this boils down to “because childhood friend.” I still don’t know why Kanako confessed to Kyousuke. I guess it is because he was her first fan as an idol, I’m not sure but that’s my best guess. The mother is a generic loving mother and the father is a hardass.I admittedly liked the dad and Kuroneko the best, but that is more due to personal preference because they’re still fairly generic. Manami’s grandparents were amusing in their own right, but they weren’t very relevant other than to provide suggestions that Kyousuke and Manami were childhood friends who “should get married already.” At least they had the decency to serve their purpose and then never show up again, unlike many of the other supporting cast that just seemed to randomly appear because they appeared once. Even the girl who bought the first doujin randomly showed up in the line to the next event because why not. The biggest offender of this was Mikagami Kouki. Why did he join the computer club at a different school? Why was he there after Kyousuke’s graduation? He should have disappeared after the whole fake boyfriend arc was done.In the first season, all the generic characters of the show were given the agency of middle and high schoolers. As I previously stated, Kyousuke and Kouhei had to lie to their parents about where they were at night so they could sneak out and buy eroge for their little sisters. While this is a small detail, it made them believable high schoolers. This was done time and time again throughout the first season to show the audience that these were in fact teenagers with no real agency over their lives. Is it weird that Kirino is a successful model? A little bit, but they weave that into the story very well. Her friends are all models who happen to go to her school, she dresses very stylishly, she has to hide her otaku side from said friends, she uses her money from modeling to buy eroge, and she’s a knockout by middle school standards. I know if she went to my middle school, she would have been the asked out constantly and while this was never shown, it was mentioned more than once in the anime. The main cast all have fairly well knit characters before they even come together. This breaks down as the cast gets less and less relevant, but I believe that the characters were created with purpose and placed in a realistic world that would treat them as such. You know, minus the whole shouting in public that either nobody hears or cares about that seems to be pervasive of anime characters. (4/10)In the second season, all of this goes to shit. Parents questioning where Kirino and Kyousuke are going constantly together? Is this a restriction meant to convey that they are kids? Nope, it’s a plot device to see who gets to play housewife. Kuroneko moves without saying anything? Family trip, but she’s out wandering alone in an unfamiliar town. Also Kirino and Kyousuke just get there without any sort of parental supervision. Yes Kirino did this when she went to America, but she went to a track and field camp for kids her age where you can safely assume it would be run by adults. Kyousuke wants to have a hotel room for himself and a girl? No problem! Nevermind he doesn’t have a job unless that manager thing actually pays. The second season abandons the fact that these are still kids outside of maybe Saori, who in one episode can rent a hotel room, custom order cosplay, and manages at least one servant, but by the end of the season is trying to take Kyousuke for herself for no apparent reason. The fact that they’re all still generic and the supporting cast of girls are given little to no reason to like Kyousuke other than “They are girls… They have speaking lines… They’re in a light novel adaptation… What else could they be doing?” (Digibro, The Asterisk War Sucks series). It’s all just terrible and it abandoned the one thing anchoring the characters in reality. The only thing moment of characterization that saves this from being a 1 is Kuroneko. The emotion that was put into her actions towards the end deserve merit in isolation even if the show did nothing but hurt its characters with it. (2/10)Enjoyment:Despite the lengthy criticism of this show, especially the second season, I actually enjoyed watching it. Yes there are A LOT of things that could be better, but I found myself having a good time throughout the entire season save the last minutes of the last episode. I cannot stress how much that one situation ruined the last 3 episodes for me. I was prepared to rate that one the better of the second season with a 6 because it built up the idea that Kyousuke and Kirino were going to go through with their plan and do everything they could to accomplish it, but no. The show just had to backpedal on itself. If the show cut at a specific point, I would have given the last 3 episodes a 6 on principal alone. Not only at that point were all the storylines tied up, albit rushed sometimes, but they would have made a statement and done something that no other show has done. But then it all just fell apart. Ugh…Final Verdict:So overall I enjoyed the show, flaws in all. It could be a much better series, but it was a good one. The first one earned my respect, and the second one milked it for all it was worth. If I were to judge the show based on everything up until that one moment, I would give it a 5. Nothing groundbreaking, but it told a decent story. It dragged itself out a bit, but in a way that was more enjoyable for myself and different than shows of similar nature. The animation quality dipped drastically and in ways that bother me a lot. However, it was a decent ride all in all. If I were to include that moment and everything afterwards, I have to bump it down to a 3. That’s to say that the one moment in question was so bad and such an insult to its fanbase that it docks three points. Three points for what? Just so the show can have the incest relationship, but also keep its distance. It really is a tragedy that the second season, which did scratch that itch to see the characters develop their romances further, ultimately brought the show down so much in overall quality. It isn’t impossible to see all the harem business being dealt with in a series of OVA’s that show Kyousuke getting to know all the girls outside of Kuroneko and Kirino better, developing chemistry together, but end with him saying that he loves someone else. As much as I’m not a fan of the “bed the sister” shows that are cropping up, I hope that maybe one of them can be to the level of the first season of Oreimo. of how people pursue their hobbies and frames the otaku culture as something that, while not without flaws, cannot be labeled as an immediate negative in someone\'s life. Even if this topic is constructed within a pretty vanilla harem series with only one male character worth mentioning, it explored the ideas of what makes someone who they are and the risk of losing their identity if even a small part of that was removed from their life. I actually enjoyed the whole ride along... until the end.My breakdown through MAL\'s separation of episodes are as follows:Season 1- Episodes 1-13: 6- Episodes 14-16: 7Season 2- Episodes 1-13: 3- Episodes 14-16: 1I have decided to put this all encompassing review in this part because it is last full season and not a part of MAL\'s classification of ""specials.""

If the series had ended there, it would have been a fairly average series that made its mark on the anime landscape with a small cast of intimate and likable characters that struggled through something together and all of them became better because of the experience.But no, the show must go on. How could we end with Kirino disappearing without telling anybody? Will Kyousuke bed his sister? What will become of Kuroneko and Saori? I’m sure fans that didn’t read the manga were left wanting to find out what happened to the group. I have to admit, I was one of those people. I wanted to see what the heck happened, and so I went onto season two… But not without detour since episodes 14-16 were not on Crunchyroll. I actually liked these specials even more because it answered some of these questions. Unfortunately, they also brought up more questions and left me wanting more.However, it was a trap! Oh my, did the story take a big dump on itself and devolve into a bait harem show. The writing was on the walls when I could tell that Manami was going to be a real contender for Kyousuke’s affection, but no it didn’t stop there. Every girl that was wasn’t Kyousuke’s mother (and the one girl from the computer club who was a yaoi fantasizer) had to have it, and they will not be denied. By the end, there were six girls fighting over him. I get it, it is supposed to be a male fantasy, but that was obnoxious at best and disgusting at worst. I will remind you that with the exception of Saori who’s age was not explicitly made clear to me (I may have missed it), all of these girls are in middle or high school, but all want to take care of him like a housewife would. Maybe I was just not aware of this in the first season, but the characters in the second season have the agency of adults. We only get a glimpse of the Kousaka family’s parental figures (Kuroneko’s parents are oddly missing from the picture), but Kyousuke had to sneak out in the middle of the night and lie to his parents to do some of the favors for Kirino, but in the second season, it seems like they can just do whatever they wanted without much consequence.Another thing I have to give the story credit for is that is atypical of harem shows is that, despite his indecisiveness, Kyousuke actually chose who he wanted to be with in the end and rejected all the other girls with absolute clarity. I have to applaud this because I’m so sick and tired of shows slogging through themselves and ultimately come to no conclusion because the main guy is indecisive or none of the girls will admit that they love him. This show had the balls to not only have all the girls state their affection and get rejected. This surely will come to a satisfying conclusion right?Baited and outsmarted. Not by episode 13, that one didn’t need to exist. It could have been put in the beginning of the series and made a heck of a lot more sense, or omitted entirely and the show would not have lost anything other than showing young Kyousuke, Kirino, and Manami. But, goddammit I have never been more pissed at an ending ever in my life. I don’t have the expansive knowledge of anime like some people, but I have wanted enough romantic comedies and harem shows to be thoroughly disappointed by how the main couple, or any of the relationships never take flight. It is almost a staple of the genre and I was ready for this story to take that chance and actually make an actual couple out of the characters that went for it and sacrificed everything in order to accomplish it. So, what did they do with it? The ending has no metric for disappointment, simply because it blows all the other unsatisfying and rage inducing endings out of the water. I’ve seen this ending compared to the ending of Berserk which has an infamous ending that angered a lot of the fanbase. However, from what I’ve heard from different reviews was that it was infuriating, but it made sense. The ending has no logic. No rhyme. No reason to go off of. Kyousuke and Kirino had nothing to gain from having that kind of relationship last for the time that it did. Even if you go to the extreme and say that they had sex (mission accomplished right?), it doesn’t make this logic any less broken and undercut the last 4+ episodes of cutting down possible relationships just to have this one. In the end, what did that get them? They went right back to being siblings. The only possible thing that I can think of that makes any amount of sense for myself is that they had sex, got over the appeal of it, and returned to their season one interactions, just without the incest undertones.A Quick Note:For the rest of this review I will be separating my critique between season one and season two. This is because the story, and to some extent its characters, can be mostly judged as a whole because it is a light novel adaptation and the high points and flaws can be attributed to the source material. Outside of the character development, the rest of the anime is left up to its adaptation. Season one was adapted by AIC Build and season two was adapted by A1 Pictures. While both of these studios are under Aniplex, I got the impression that the two seasons were treated VERY differently. I will make it clear that I hate A1 Pictures and what they have created for shows like this. Their apparent lack of effort towards some of their works is just horrific and most of it comes in the form of its art.ArtThe first season was nothing special. The character designs of the girls were all fairly cute, even if some of them were a bit generic. I was never blown away with any of the animation, but I was never distracted by it either. The settings and set pieces followed suit. The animation was fairly consistent and standard. It was solid. 5/10The second season was an abomination, mostly in the animation department. There were multiple times per episode where I would be distracted by background characters frozen in space in an expression that I was hard pressed to believe anybody would keep. The classroom scenes were the biggest offenders of this. There was also an over-reliance on panning shots on still images. While this is an acceptable, even if low effort, way to do establishing shots, but when there are times where characters would actually cover each others’ mouths in order to not show them talking. Now I don’t know the actual amount of frames that this actually saves, but this is just unacceptable in scenes where there is no need for it. Other times speaking characters would be on the wrong side of the shot, reverse shot camera technique to show the black expression. My biggest complaint was the overuse of previously animated footage that seemed to infect all parts of the second season after the first couple of episodes. Some of these were even shot for shot copies of previous part in the anime with different outfits. These techniques and more were pervasive throughout the second season and whether I just didn’t notice any of this in the first season or they did not bother me, this wasn’t abused to the extent it was in the second half.My main complaint of A1 Pictures as a whole is that their animation is garbage as a whole. That’s not to say that they cannot animate at all, there are some scenes and still images that are well designed, but when these shots make up maybe 10% of the runtime of the entire episode, I have to call them out somewhere. It is all that more apparent in a series like this where two different studios are in charge of two different seasons. I would have to say that the second season had about 10% of its animation on par or slightly above the first season as a whole, and the other 90% was drastically worse. This is most apparent in shots where the characters are in crowds of people. Rarely did I see these characters have any sort of attention to their movements outside of the Meruru concerts, and even then there were times where the concert would be in full swing and there would be people in the background standing still not doing anything. I do not understand that at all.I generally parse the bad from the good when I see a scene where extras are visible, but the focus is supposed to be on the main characters. Do these extras have any distinct features? Are they dressed appropriately for the weather and time of day? Are they moving? If they are standing still, are they standing still for a believable reason? Even if they look like a real person, if all these conditions aren’t met, it throws me off. If extras are going to be treated without much if any care, it has to be a conscious style choice. Good examples of this are Acchi Kocchi (where everyone outside of the cast is a white figure) and Kill La Kill (where all the extras have the exact same design because they are mindless drones). In both of these series, a significant less time was devoted to the design of the extras, but they communicate to the viewer that they are not relevant to the story and I don’t need to pay any attention to them. In season two, and other A1 Pictures shows, extras are given character designs, but they are given just enough detail to be distinct from one another, but not enough to be believable to me at least. I was so distracted by this, that anything new artwise (read not much considering they go a grand total of five new locations and 3 of them are rooms) totally flew under the radar of garbage that was the second season’s animation. 1/10As a side note, the decision to include random bits of A1 works like SAO into the show rubs me in a way that fuels the rage of a thousand nerds getting 360 no scoped in Call of Duty… It’s annoying, I hate it, and I wish A1 Pictures would stop doing it.Sound:The sound design was not to my taste. It didn’t so much convey an emotion, but rather pull one out of me. Scene that’s supposed to be funny? Better start the funny music! Have a heartfelt moment coming up? Queue the feels track! The tracks all fit the scenes they were in, but I am not sure if that is because I am or was conditioned to feel that way with the sounds. I found this annoying in the first season (3/10) and unbearable in the second season (2/10). The best scenes in this series where the music was either so quiet that the characters overpowered them, or there was none at all.Character:As a whole, I liked the cast of the show, but man were they generic as can be.  Kyousuke was a generic main character in a romance or harem series. He’s generally well mannered, extremely nice, reliable, etc. Everything that you want your main character to be for the rest of the harem. Kirino is a typical tsundere, but she has a reason to be initially abrasive towards her brother. She loved her brother in the past, but hates the person he’s become from her perspective. Kuroneko is a deadpan loli. She’s shy and tries to keep up this role player persona because she loves the show MASCHERA. Saori is a split between a rich girl and a generic otaku. I appreciate that the show explored why she was the way she is, but the execution in certain parts was odd to say the least.The rest of the supporting cast are one note characters. To complete the harem, there is Manami, Ayase, and Kanako who are as follows: childhood friend, tsundere (type B), and bitchy. Manami is the only one of the three who like the main character who is given any sort of explanation, but most of this boils down to “because childhood friend.” I still don’t know why Kanako confessed to Kyousuke. I guess it is because he was her first fan as an idol, I’m not sure but that’s my best guess. The mother is a generic loving mother and the father is a hardass.I admittedly liked the dad and Kuroneko the best, but that is more due to personal preference because they’re still fairly generic. Manami’s grandparents were amusing in their own right, but they weren’t very relevant other than to provide suggestions that Kyousuke and Manami were childhood friends who “should get married already.” At least they had the decency to serve their purpose and then never show up again, unlike many of the other supporting cast that just seemed to randomly appear because they appeared once. Even the girl who bought the first doujin randomly showed up in the line to the next event because why not. The biggest offender of this was Mikagami Kouki. Why did he join the computer club at a different school? Why was he there after Kyousuke’s graduation? He should have disappeared after the whole fake boyfriend arc was done.In the first season, all the generic characters of the show were given the agency of middle and high schoolers. As I previously stated, Kyousuke and Kouhei had to lie to their parents about where they were at night so they could sneak out and buy eroge for their little sisters. While this is a small detail, it made them believable high schoolers. This was done time and time again throughout the first season to show the audience that these were in fact teenagers with no real agency over their lives. Is it weird that Kirino is a successful model? A little bit, but they weave that into the story very well. Her friends are all models who happen to go to her school, she dresses very stylishly, she has to hide her otaku side from said friends, she uses her money from modeling to buy eroge, and she’s a knockout by middle school standards. I know if she went to my middle school, she would have been the asked out constantly and while this was never shown, it was mentioned more than once in the anime. The main cast all have fairly well knit characters before they even come together. This breaks down as the cast gets less and less relevant, but I believe that the characters were created with purpose and placed in a realistic world that would treat them as such. You know, minus the whole shouting in public that either nobody hears or cares about that seems to be pervasive of anime characters. (4/10)In the second season, all of this goes to shit. Parents questioning where Kirino and Kyousuke are going constantly together? Is this a restriction meant to convey that they are kids? Nope, it’s a plot device to see who gets to play housewife. Kuroneko moves without saying anything? Family trip, but she’s out wandering alone in an unfamiliar town. Also Kirino and Kyousuke just get there without any sort of parental supervision. Yes Kirino did this when she went to America, but she went to a track and field camp for kids her age where you can safely assume it would be run by adults. Kyousuke wants to have a hotel room for himself and a girl? No problem! Nevermind he doesn’t have a job unless that manager thing actually pays. The second season abandons the fact that these are still kids outside of maybe Saori, who in one episode can rent a hotel room, custom order cosplay, and manages at least one servant, but by the end of the season is trying to take Kyousuke for herself for no apparent reason. The fact that they’re all still generic and the supporting cast of girls are given little to no reason to like Kyousuke other than “They are girls… They have speaking lines… They’re in a light novel adaptation… What else could they be doing?” (Digibro, The Asterisk War Sucks series). It’s all just terrible and it abandoned the one thing anchoring the characters in reality. The only thing moment of characterization that saves this from being a 1 is Kuroneko. The emotion that was put into her actions towards the end deserve merit in isolation even if the show did nothing but hurt its characters with it. (2/10)Enjoyment:Despite the lengthy criticism of this show, especially the second season, I actually enjoyed watching it. Yes there are A LOT of things that could be better, but I found myself having a good time throughout the entire season save the last minutes of the last episode. I cannot stress how much that one situation ruined the last 3 episodes for me. I was prepared to rate that one the better of the second season with a 6 because it built up the idea that Kyousuke and Kirino were going to go through with their plan and do everything they could to accomplish it, but no. The show just had to backpedal on itself. If the show cut at a specific point, I would have given the last 3 episodes a 6 on principal alone. Not only at that point were all the storylines tied up, albit rushed sometimes, but they would have made a statement and done something that no other show has done. But then it all just fell apart. Ugh…Final Verdict:So overall I enjoyed the show, flaws in all. It could be a much better series, but it was a good one. The first one earned my respect, and the second one milked it for all it was worth. If I were to judge the show based on everything up until that one moment, I would give it a 5. Nothing groundbreaking, but it told a decent story. It dragged itself out a bit, but in a way that was more enjoyable for myself and different than shows of similar nature. The animation quality dipped drastically and in ways that bother me a lot. However, it was a decent ride all in all. If I were to include that moment and everything afterwards, I have to bump it down to a 3. That’s to say that the one moment in question was so bad and such an insult to its fanbase that it docks three points. Three points for what? Just so the show can have the incest relationship, but also keep its distance. It really is a tragedy that the second season, which did scratch that itch to see the characters develop their romances further, ultimately brought the show down so much in overall quality. It isn’t impossible to see all the harem business being dealt with in a series of OVA’s that show Kyousuke getting to know all the girls outside of Kuroneko and Kirino better, developing chemistry together, but end with him saying that he loves someone else. As much as I’m not a fan of the “bed the sister” shows that are cropping up, I hope that maybe one of them can be to the level of the first season of Oreimo.', ""oreimo wow i expected it to be bold and change our perspective about incest ......but hell even if she was'nt your sister who the hell will date that trash .oreimo2 just throws down the bin whatever unbelievable tsundere crap season 1 had in store to try and replace it to an almost drool able love story between the two siblings . if you only one could easily forget the absolute jackshit  way the sister treats the brother in season 1 ( unless he is a M).you may say the character development  was the reason for this sudden lovey dovey nature but after...season 1 it just does not feel right .yes doting brother s exist but i would not date some one who goes full 180 after knowing her for like 15 years.the reason for her tsundere behaviour is laughable the childhood friend doing a full 180 as well is unfair .you want me to start hating the childhood friend and start loving the sisterso even  you must do a full 180 to love this anime xD. season 1 it just does not feel right .yes doting brother s exist but i would not date some one who goes full 180 after knowing her for like 15 years.the reason for her tsundere behaviour is laughable the childhood friend doing a full 180 as well is unfair .you want me to start hating the childhood friend and start loving the sisterso even  you must do a full 180 to love this anime xD."", 'I wanted to get my impressions off my chest before the special episodes air that should wrap up this storyline. Actually, I have deliberately postponed writing this review, because the second season of Oreimo left me feeling undecided about what it was trying to say.That seems like a very strange thing to say about a series titled ""There\'s No Way My Little Sister is this Cute!"", right? Because it seems so obvious that this story must be all about the taboo on relationships between siblings, especially given the amount of time spent on the phenomenon of \'little sister eroge\'. And yet, even after letting the...story of the second season sink in for a couple of weeks, I still feel that this is all a red herring. In my opinion, the eye-catching taboo of sibling relationships is used here to explore a more subtle theme. Then again, maybe I\'m reading too much into this, given all the comedy and harem elements present in this second season. Still, I could not help but feel that just like some anime have a ‘true route’, there can also be a ‘true theme’.True themeThe true theme of this series is meddling. Meddling with people’s lives based on the meddler’s selfish needs, or based on the meddler’s projections of their own fears or suspicions (or possibly even hidden desires?). Without spoiling any specific plot points, I feel that in Oreimo 2 the most prominent meddlers are Kuroneko and Manami. Just ask yourself when watching this series: (almost) every time the probability of a relationship between Kirino and Kyousuke increases, is this not due to the interference of other characters who feel that they have the right to shape the lives of Kirino and Kyousuke? I will even go so far as to say that if it had not been for all this meddling, then Kirino and Kyousuke would never have had any trouble being normal siblings. At this point, I have no idea if an actual relationship between these two will be the end result, but if this should occur then this series might as well have been titled “The Meddlers Made Me Realize Just How Cute My Little Sister Is!”. And that enormous irony would be the painful punishment for all this meddling aimed at preventing just such a relationship.All kidding aside, this theme is actually a lot more serious than the often rather light tone of this series suggests. Just ask yourself how you would feel if at some point in your life you realized that people close to you had been manipulating you for years, robbing you of the chance of having your life take its natural course? So many lies told, so many roads you might have wanted to take closed off, so much harm done.StoryThe build-up of the story is rather strange this season. For some reason, it was decided that the first few episodes should be personal epilogues for some of the secondary characters who then disappear from the series for quite some time. Both Saori and Ayase get this treatment, and although it was touching to learn more about them, I felt that their absence for much of the rest of the season hurt the show. I mean, they are two of the five central characters shown during the opening credits of each episode (excluding the episode with the Meruru opening), so why are they absent for so much of this season? Even stranger, it was decided to include an epilogue for a character who had only been referred to in the first season, but was never really shown: the roommate Kirino had when she was briefly staying in the US.The main part of the story does not get under way until about episode 4 or 5 and when it does the pacing is decent and the feeling of watching one unrelated short story after another abates. The feelings and interactions of Kirino and Kyousuke come across naturally and are very easy to empathize with. They once again made me care for these two characters.The final episode was a prequel and takes place earlier than any other episode before it in both seasons. Interestingly, it is told from Kirino’s point of view and as such is a much needed reminder that we as viewers have up to that point been forced to see things the way Kyousuke does. The reason for including this episode so late in this series is a little obscure to me, since it changes so much in retrospect.ArtThe art is decent, but after recent anime triumphs such as Haganai it did feel a little outdated. What’s more, during the early episodes of the season the characters of Kirino, Ayase and Saori look far too much alike, especially after Saori takes off her glasses and lets her hair down. Some effort might have been spent on making the character drawings more unique instead of tending toward the generic.SoundBoth the opening and ending theme are beautiful, dreamy songs. The background music is mostly the same as during the first season, but still a joy to listen to. Especially the somewhat reggea-style comedy theme is nice.The voice actors once again do a good job. Taketatsu Ayana really brings Kirino to life with a very specific voice she seems to have created just for her (compare this to her far more standard fare approach to her part in Date A Live). Also, she portrays the emotions Kirino experiences with an almost chilling realism. A perhaps more unexpected feat of voice acting is displayed here by Hayami Saori who gives Ayase such a lively, emotional voice. Compare this to her chilling rendition of ice queen Yukinoshita Yukino on ‘Yahari No Seishun’ this very same season and you know that you are listening to a rare talent. The ever adorable Hanazawa Kana portrays Ruri (Kuroneko) with effective seriousness. Would you believe that she portrays such a similar character on Haganai, but in a comical way (Kobato)?CharactersUnfortunately, the seriousness of this series’ theme is not reflected in the depth given to the characters. As mentioned, some of the secondary characters get their own epilogue episodes, but then rarely appear in this season anymore (Saori and to a lesser extent Ayase), while most of the others seem to serve little other function than comedy (Kanako, Kuroneko’s sisters). Kirino and Kyousuke are clearly the only characters that are supposed to be “real” here, i.e. have more than one or two dimensions. This makes it a little hard to take anyone except Kirino seriously as a potential partner for Kyousuke, which takes away some of the suspense the ‘who will start dating who?’ question might otherwise have.And then Kuroneko, or Gokou Ruri. I won’t spoil exactly what her role was this season (although I have categorized her as a Meddler), but I will say that I found her impossible to take seriously as someone Kyousuke would even talk to. Kuroneko is such an appalling case of ‘sixth grader syndrome’ that it’s just not funny anymore. She keeps dressing up as a Goth (and once as an angel), and it’s clear that this aspect of her personality that is so crucial to her, is completely lost on Kyousuke. The fact that he keeps calling her by her internet handle Kuroneko instead of by her real name Gokou Ruri painfully illustrates that Kyousuke never really saw her as a real person. Her treatment of him as outlined in her ‘Destiny Record’ would have warranted him never speaking to her again, I felt.EnjoymentThe real predicament Kirino and Kyousuke are in is one I found to be deeply moving: can they escape from the Meddlers and start leading their own lives, untainted by the manipulations of others? Whether this is as a couple or separately is secondary, although I share most people’s uneasiness at the idea of relationships between siblings.I think that the true theme of this series could appeal to just about any viewer, provided that they go into this series without any preconceptions about ‘little sister’ shows. (I was completely new to this genre when I started watching this after seeing it recommended somewhere.)I will definitely be re-watching this in order to further explore what the writers were trying to say with this story. In fact, I would very much like to own this on Blu-Ray with as much commentary and bonus material as possible. As long as it’s at least subtitled in English, that is, since my Japanese is far too basic.Verdict9/10. story of the second season sink in for a couple of weeks, I still feel that this is all a red herring.

Unlike my other reviews I won't chop it up into paragraphs about the story line, characters, animation or music. Instead, this'll probably be a huge rant and trying not to spoil anything.So, season 2 starts off with Kirino coming back from America and everyone is happy. We get the annoying little brat back, yay! Now season 2 isn't the number one thing that pissed me off, in fact this season wasn't...all that bad. But the specials that come afterwards are included in this season and that's what pissed me off. Now I won't talk about the specials because I'm going to do a separate review for that but, oh my god I want to scream!So, I wasn't a huge fan of this season because of many things. The one true thing I liked about this series was Kuroneko aka Ruri because she is seriously awesome. Her and Kyousuke's relationship had me fangirling hard core. I loved them so much and then, the specials came in and ruined my life forever.We finally figure out Saori and I loved that. We get more Asami and I loved that. There was a lot about this season we didn't get in season one which I loved.Truly I don't hate this anime, I really liked season one and I did like this season but the ending was just... no.Overall, if you have seen the first season watch this one, it won't be a waste. I give this season a 7/10 and 3 out of 5 stars. all that bad. But the specials that come afterwards are included in this season and that's what pissed me off.

In the second season I was literally overcome with emotion in two different places.I first wrote a review after watching the first season, and gave it 9/10. But after watching the second season, I completely fell in love with the show and now offer my rarely given 10/10 rating with no regrets.I will also mention the season 2 OVAs, episodes 14 - 16. I like that the story was wrapped up with deeper explanations about why the characters felt and acted the way they did. I must say that the problem with all romance...stories is that someone is going to get hurt in the end, and it really hits hard. It was truly hard to see this especially the way it was carried out with multiple girls in the story. But perhaps if a season 3 were to be contemplated, Kyosuke could attempt to repair his relationships with all the girls that loved him. I guess that\'s too much to ask though. Great fantasy story though, really leaves you wanting more.First off, I want to say that the animation itself was top notch, and all the characters were very well done. The voice acting was very emotive and the subtitles seemed well matched to the dialog. The girls were unbelievably cute, I can\'t think of another anime that had such deliciously adorable characters.The story is about the icy relationship between 17 year old brother Kyosuke and his younger sister 15 year old Kirino.  In the beginning, Kyosuke helps her to find a club to talk about her interests in the hopes of helping her develop healthy friendships.The story line is surprising in that you think that Kirino is going to be a polite and appreciative little sister, but instead she\'s pretty short tempered and kind of abusive to her brother. We can\'t quite understand what makes her tick -- she is totally immersed in anime that revolves around ""little-sister"" eroge, yet her own relationship with her brother is very conflicted. She tests her brother, asking him for one outrageous favor after another, and struggles to show any gratitude at all. The plot becomes more complex and you are rewarded with a lot of humorous drama which leads to a surprising, if not completely satisfying end. The music in the shows was great, a different closing theme song for each episode!In the second season, one of the girls becomes Kyosuke\'s official girlfriend. This sets up rivalries and lots of troubles which are worked through with a lot of drama to some pretty unsatisfying endings (unsatisfying to me anyway) -- ah yes, we cannot avoid the classic Japanese penchant for Train Wreck endings. I sure hope there will be another season.A little fan service here and there, but nothing too bold. Highly recommend if you enjoy anime depicting slice of life teenage drama and romance. stories is that someone is going to get hurt in the end, and it really hits hard.

So does this season have the potential to match that of its predecessor? Well then, let\'s find out.At the start of the season, I wasn\'t sure if the story was going to change much throughout the course of the anime after the first season but as I continued on, It turned out that I was wrong. There were major changes to...the whole story shortly after the beginning. The main theme of the first season was promoting otaku acceptance which it had did very well. But what I had surprisingly discovered is that the second season seems to stray away from that theme, especially halfway through to focus more on romantic relationships and the usual cliches of the slice-of-life genre. In other words, Kirino\'s anime and eroge obsession has been kept at a minimum to focus more on Kyousuke and his relationships with other girls. The whole change to the story was kind-of disappointing in my eyes because I was expecting much more from the success of the first season (much like anyone else). It felt like I was in a ""been there, done that"" territory of the entire genre. Although I do not think the story is terrible or a massive failure, I do feel that it has lost all of its potential due to the fact it was straying away from its original theme. To put it simply, the story itself had become one big cliche of slice-of-life.The artwork and character designs hasn\'t changed much from the first season, only this time it has far more crisper quality. But that doesn\'t change the fact that the art still wasn\'t as appealing as other anime art designs. As I mentioned in my previous review of the first season, the artwork by Hiro Kanzaki is not bad but nothing too impressive either because it has been trying to stay as much realistic as possible. What I mean by this is that although the characters are good to look at, they\'re to put it simply just plain. Nothing special about them to be honest. This was fixed however with the inclusion of varied art styles in the first season but because the story strayed away from its original theme, those varied art styles were almost completely absent throughout the season. To sum this up, the art designs hasn\'t changed much but it is still decent for this anime\'s standards. The animation pretty much mimics that of the first season but everything still runs smoothly to the frame rate. There are some scenes where the frame rate was a little off but that is hardly a major problem so the overall animation is still good.I\'m not going to say much for the background music as the second season reused a majority of soundtracks from the first season. The soundtracks are basic and average which is nothing too impressive but they do fit their scenarios quite well. The new opening theme by ClariS is very impressive and I can see the effort and potential put into it but in my honesty, it paled in comparison to the first season\'s opening theme which was done extremely well. It seems that ClariS was trying too hard to top their previous masterpiece but the theme is still good nonetheless. The wide variety of ending themes were also a nice touch but there were way too many of them for me to keep track and critique them properly. All I can say is that they are still nice ear-catching compositions. Now for the voice acting. Again, I\'m not going to say much as the second season reused all of the previous voice actors from the first. So far the quality of the characters\' voices hasn\'t slipped and they are still very decent and good to comprehend. Needless to say, the voice actors did a very good job with their characters.Now for the characters themselves. For the most part, some characters are likable but I\'ve noticed some major changes with the characters along with the story and I\'m not impressed with most of these changes. So now I\'m going to list them specifically. I felt that the character Saori was losing her spotlight as she appeared less times in the second season and had less of an impact. Sure there was an entire episode dedicated to Saori\'s backstory but that didn\'t make much of a shift in her spotlight and to see one of the original key characters of the first season reduced to a mere background character was depressing. Speaking of spotlights, Kuroneko has gained a large leap from her original status to become part of Kyousuke\'s developing relationships. Since when did the producers decide to make her the leading major character of the show? That was quite of an unexpected move considering that Kuroneko is my personal favorite of the bunch. As I mentioned before in the story, Kyousuke and Kirino had swapped roles so now that Kyousuke is the main centerpiece in order to focus more on developing relationships. Kirino\'s otaku hobbies are still present but they have been kept to a minimum and Kirino is still the ""annoying imouto"" as ever. As for Kyousuke, it looked like the producers had tried way too hard to transform him into a harem king which was far beyond his original personality. I had mixed feelings about Kyousuke in the first season but now I feel sorry for Kyousuke because the producers were exploiting too many perverted opportunities with him, making him sound like a total jerk. Lastly were Manami and Ayase. Ayase was unfortunately a victim to the whole Kyousuke relationship thing and it looked like they were somewhat making her the yandere type. Again, this was an unexpected change far from her original personality. As for Manami, there were no changes but one particular episode made me thought that she was a hypocrite to Kirino. Now that my rant about the characters is done, all I can say is that the changes in their spotlights and personalities has made a major dent in their previous reputations that made them likable in the first season. I hope the producers will learn from their mistakes and make sure they don\'t commit the same mistake again for another anime.Overall, although I do not think OreImo season 2 is terrible, there are some flaws with it that unfortunately doesn\'t make it the same level as its predecessor. To me, I would call this anime a hit-and-miss. I wouldn\'t recommend this anime to everyone but if you\'re the type that can bare with flaws and/or are a fan of the first season, then I would definitely recommend this to you. From there on, only you can decide the outcome of OreImo season 2 from your own experience.Final Evaluation: Flawed but still watchable. the whole story shortly after the beginning.

The protagonist and his tsundere-like little sister have a relationship that makes the viewers love them both and at other times feel so sorry for the MC for how he sometimes gets treated. I myself couldn't help myself at certain scenes of romance from tearing up and sobbing from how great the delivery was.The ART work as well was quite special as each character really had their own unique kind of appearance. That goes for almost any anime, but this one, in particular, was really enjoyable to watch, as each character's facial expression and the animation...was truly pleasant at almost all times.Along with the Story, the SOUND is what I'll remember the most in this anime. The voice acting is great of course, but what really had me was the music. Occasionally, the sad themed music would play and it was so well timed that it's as if that music became a trigger for the waterworks! And when the MC would be with various girls, of course including his sister, very happy, fun music will play that I absolutely loved listening to.

She is absolutely so cute with her blushes and cosplay is total HUNNGGGGG~~~ unfortunately the anime does total injustice to herKousaka, Kirino~~~ total tsundere and i absolutely love great tsunderes' written the right way, they totally make her out to be a great sister and they 100% hit the nail on the head with how a sister would act (not including the incesty relationship) she has a super great written character and i love itThey had the story perfect and how the story was rolling it looked like it was going to end with Ruri ending but then they took a very sharp turn towards Kirino that continues into the last 3 episodes that really makes no sense on how the they finish the anime it leaves a really sour taste in your mouth.They really progressed the character alot in the second season and i really love how they grew the characters, they gave a lot of background insight on saori and i love how Kyousuke's parents tried to split them up and how all the heroines' came to help and celebrate with Kyousuke and oh goodness Ayase became waifu for a short amount of time and they wrapped her end really great.

I giggled and laughed along with it the whole way and I grew very close to most of the characters. But, it was the ending that spoiled it for me. That ending left a sour taste in my mouth. The whole last episode, the only thing I was thinking was ""I hope they pull a \'it\'s just a dream\' thing"". They pulled something like it but it still wasn\'t good. The main character was so smart and great for almost the whole anime but the last bunch of episodes were, in my opinion, just plain stupid. I would have loved to...see what would have happened with many of the other girls. I also felt that in the end the two main characters weren\'t really acting like how they normal acted in the rest of the anime. To me it seemed like two entirely different people. I might watch this anime again but probably only the first season and the first couple episodes of the second. see what would have happened with many of the other girls.

Damn I love them! There are still a couple of situations that I frowned upon that I'll address in the spoilers section.Direction, art and animation, music and voice acting are all outstanding, and succeed in giving the show unique kind of charm and appeal. I heard people accusing this of shallowly pandering to unhealthy aspects of otaku culture. The second season, and especially last few episodes do an outstanding job at attacking and criticizing the said culture aspects, while still examining it from different viewpoints. However, the culture itself doesn't get presented in a way for...outsiders to it to really get it, granted this would be ridiculously hard to pull off. This is clearly targeted at the otaku culture itself. It goes without saying that the possibility of incest is a theme that gets most of attention, however it's infinitely less shallow than many other incest themed anime out there.SPOILERS AHEAD:I did not expect it would be emotionally satisfying to see my favorite girl break down while being rejected. But the feels were so intense, and so well articulated via direction, art and dialogue, that it was easy to experience it with her, and for her. Overwhelming emotions in art are always a great experience, be they positive or negative.Situations that I frowned upon: The way Manami was unphased by the Ruri/Kyousuke relationship, just for it to later turn out she was in love with him all along, as hinted much earlier on. The negative way Kirino first reacted to a confession made little sense considering how she intended to do it herself. And then she suddenly completely changes her mind just because Kyosuke worded it differently? A bit of a stretch. The support that they got from Kuroneko with the car speakers incident was a bit unthinkable. Considering how great her breakdown was, seeing her moving on that easily and helping her rival was strange. Why is she not pissed off? She was quite pissed off with her breakdown, when her plan both sinked and backfired, what exactly calmed her down and made her cooperative? That should have been addressed.I loved the Manami showdown in the last episode. Her critical and clever mind, coupled with nice and pleasant exterior really make her an outstanding character. Instead of character development, we get to see and understand what's behind her facade, peeling back the layers and taking peeks inside her psyche, until it all comes down crashing and pouring down in the last episode. In adapting the novel, anime fails at the end of episode 8. Ruri's thoughts and intentions were misrepresented, and knowing this on time made a world of difference to me, and made the show deeper. Similar problem happens with the very ending. Taken on it's own, it's the worst ending in any show ever. Reading between the lines, with the help from the note by author, it starts making sense, c/p from a reddit comment:''No. Not just that. It's clear from what he says, that ''1. I couldn't just write full retard incest end because editors''.''2. But I did what I could so that you get it anyway'', and ''3. If you still don't get what I'm saying, Kirino WINS FULL SCALE wink THEY HAVE A SHARED SECRET wink''Personally I find it sad to see artistic expression limited by this kind of censorship.I loved that the anime tried to make a point. And that point was that we don't choose who we love. And that this very fact can have brutal consequences. It also criticizes both incest, and social norms surrounding it.

A superb anime that will have you laughing, crying and surprised.( Also note this is a ROMANCE and focuses heavily on it.)My opinion might be biased but i hold you could bear through this review.STORY-10-This anime revolves around Kyousuke Kousaka your average high school guy, and his little sister Kirino (who happens to be an otaku),and friends. This is a continuation of the first season;(Watch the first season as it fleshes out the characters and sets up for some interesting events in the second season);and is about incest, a lot of different love confessions and ridiculous situations. (...Everything in this anime has some type of meaning to it.) You would think it is your average harem but it is not, it changes up the formula for some interesting things to happen,and brings you along for a journey with a bunch of surprises. The story is fresh not your typical story, it is a story of a brother and sister who try to bond together and what they go through. It kept me captivated and ends in an unexpected way than i thought it would.ART-9- The art complements the anime,it has a colorful palate that fits right in with the story telling. It also brings the characters that you will love or hate to life. Some people might say it is average, and that may be true, but it stays true to what it is meant for and that is to complement the story; kind of like the legs to a table, and is not meant for people to praise it but to support what it needs to.SOUND-9- I give the sound a 9 because this animes songs pertain to the story. Especially the ones sang in the episodes. Also the voices of all the characters were superb, fits the characters perfectly. Leaves nothing to be desired or wanted more of.CHARACTERS-10- All of the characters where wonderful and complemented the story very well. Sure it has your tsundere, childhood friend, and all, but the creators throw in some nice, and refreshing twists. Also if it were not for the characters the way they are, i do not think the story would have went anywhere.ENJOYMENT-10- I am a fan of Action comedies,but seeing this has made me rethink the romance genre. I wasn't expecting much of this anime but it completely surpassed my expectations. Also This anime has enough episodes (combined with first season) that i could really get into it and enjoy it.OVERALL-10- This anime took me on a fun journey that i will never forget. Also this anime leaves of on a good point and wraps up things pretty well in my opinion. It also leaves a bit of room for a possible third season, but is good where it ended. I highly recommend this anime, it is in my top 5, and thank you for reading. Everything in this anime has some type of meaning to it.)

At its best and most accessible, the viewer, like Kyousuke, is...treated to a whirlwind tour of eroge, cosplay, shopping in Akihabara, vending at Comiket, idols, fujoshi, figure collecting, and more. The way these desires are treated is almost loving in detail, shown in the great amount of detail put into everything from the changing OPs and Kirino's games to the R18 Meruru doujinshi being sold in some fantasy equivalent of Toranoana. The exploration of Kirino's interests mirrors the writer's (and many viewers') own wrestling with socially complicated desires, and her relationship with Kyousuke is one big imouto eroge fantasy, complete with route selections and chase scenes.All of this together provides what I think is some of the lasting charm of the series, and the second season compliments the first well in that respect. There's more eroge, more idol concerts, more comiket - all depicted in the show's decent-to-good art and sound quality. However, this comes with a greater focus on character relationships as the complications from the first season are developed in the second, with mixed results. Part of the strain comes from the general trouble of trying to adapt the books to screen - the relatively mild amount of cutting and rewriting they did in the first season is greatly upped here as they struggle to adapt the rest of the series to 12 episodes.As a result, the character relationships tend to feel a bit more cramped and their actions and personalities a bit more exaggerated than in the novels. Large portions of the story related to Ayase, Kanako, and Kyousuke himself were cut, leaving a still-enjoyable but heavily edited story that feels a little less massaged than the first season. There's also a distinct harem-y flavor to the whole thing for which your mileage may vary.Ultimately, the flattening of characters comes not only because of compromises in bringing this to screen but because, at the end of the day, the characters are written in part to illustrate various facets of otaku culture as stressed in season 1, and to compliment and complicate the relationship between Kirino and Kyousuke as stressed in season 2. They exist as it were as so many various routes in one of Kirino's eroge - the many tempting choices still revolving around the true sister route, and though who Kyousuke actually ends up with and how his relationship with Kirino and the rest works out is largely left up to the OVAs the work is faithful to one of the golden rules of sibling romances - there can be no sibling love story without suffering.Oreimo season 2 is a decent sequel to the first season.

The same unrealistic human behavior where most of us don't want to be attacked, humiliated, and where rifts would grow, of course, this anime ignores the common sense of it.We see less of the inhibitions of her Reki-jo hobby, with regular trips, no worries if she is seen and a growing co-dependency between our two main characters, as one relies generally on for advice, and to procure things, while the other just wants to keep his sister...in his life, whilst both develop some form of feelings, where they don't want to commit incest, but are desperate no one else has the other.   As much as I could expect this from the sister, due to the way she constantly tries to break her brother with insults, humiliation, and violence to make him more submissive and responsive is like a desperate need to have that childhood brother who was always there for him, where he is clueless on women, how they think and needs her advice.The co-dependency goes to a damaging level that makes them toxic especially her, as it affects surrounding friend groups, with even who she trusts most having feelings for her brother, where all her friends seem to thirst for him after seeing how much he will do for his sister, making her, her own worst enemy and she is told that, but doesn't change.The truth is though, as much as flashes of their childhood occur, is not much and not enough after years of not talking to have such codependency issues, is not realistic if you push some away they come back, and though friends realize what's going on, and try to strike relationships, is like he needs her approval to be with someone.   Where most people would escape from such a sister and in time family, as he has to move out, with them questioning his sexual status with his sister as if pushed by him, despite the family knowing she is the eroge lover of the two.The simple fact is it proves he is better without her, his grades improve without her around, he sleeps better and relates to others better.   Sadly is better than season 1, but still unrealistically stupid.   The same problems of cause and effect, the same problems of driving people away, and the same problems where friends are not driven away by lies, insults, etc as it repeats into a circle of hate at stages.People who like this sort of thing will watch it, people with half an ounce of common sense will get bored quick of so many episodes being the same and no moving forward.

It can be entertaining at times but overall its just another trashhy dumpster fire anime But like i said the one redeming factor was the music so i say if you like trashy anime this is for you and if you like eromanga sensei then oremo is for you . this in my mind is the mother of all the trashy anime out there. and the words sexualy harass are...used so often and perfectly its amazing how they don't lose all meaningwatching this anime may make you question your sanity you will ask your self why am i watching this am i that degenarate used so often and perfectly its amazing how they don't lose all meaningwatching this anime may make you question your sanity you will ask your self why am i watching this am i that degenarate"", 'well, after a lot of ""rolling"" I finally decided to write about this work, I will follow the classic division into topics:1-Story: I\'ll be very superficial: an anime that tells the story of two brothers who flirt with each other, as much as the plot is deeper, it doesn\'t leave this premise, it\'s not an anime that would impress me, it\'s not something that has a very well told story or teach you something (I mean, at least not reveal anything to me that I didn\'t know); in the first season the story was really better told, but the second was something I watched more...out of obligation, it breaks the original ""script"".I really don\'t like / I don\'t understand why they like this little sisters and incest thing so much (although I\'m Japanese), I can\'t say I have anything against it, at least not necessarily, but the problem is, it\'s not taken seriously;

Oreimo is an anime that will probably never be forgotten to a person who watches it. If you watch the first season you should know the story is about a little sister and her big brother falling in love with each other. The story isn't the greatest ever but it brings so much fun and enjoyment to other perverts and lolicons such as myself LOL. Okay but honestly it's really funny and dumb. The art is at a very high level. The characters are so well...drawn also there is so much detail in the eroge and the anime shops. The music is pretty good as well I love the first opening of Oreimo S2. The characters you should know if you watched season one are Kousaka Kyousuke the big brother and the protagonist of the story. He is kinda plain but a very uhhh emotional person when it comes to his little sister.  Kyousuke's little sister is the female main of the story who is tsudere to hell Kirino Kousaka. She is pretty damn cute... uh she's really tsudere and she brings a lot of innocence to the show (also takes away a lot). People might find this anime trash and all I know it is too. What makes this anime special is what you feel when you watch it. It makes you want to laugh it makes you want to cry also it makes you want to straight up punch something some times but if you are looking for a fun time you should watch Oreimo. drawn also there is so much detail in the eroge and the anime shops.

SPOILERS BTWOreimo, Oreimo. I knew it wasn\'t going to be an anime for me that is why I didn\'t watch it for so long but I decided to give it a chance and push forward to see if it had anything actually good that I might had been prejudiced about.Sigh. I kinda enjoyed season 1, it surprised me with some aspects, such as seeing Otaku culture and people getting into anime and how it feels to have it as a secret hobby or how it\'s percieved by outsiders. It was...interesting and a nice look. I also kinda liked the characters, their banter, interactions were fun. I especially liked Kirino and Kuroneko\'s arguing, it\'s just fun seeing people nerd out and get passionate over things.But.. as many other people have said, Season 2 drops the ball and hard. Season 1 wasn\'t amazing to begin with but it had its moments of nice insight and good fun. Season 2 on the other hand... it started off fun and interesting like how Season 1 was but then when it got to the ""drama"" parts it made me feel uncomfortable, like it felt forced, came outta left field. ""Did I miss an episode or something?"" ""Why are they doing this!? This is a weird way for a person to act"". I don\'t often question anime when I watch it but man, Oreimo is special. I felt like I was losing brain cells or like had a hangover and woke up with amnesia. Characters just suddenly changing or doing things that are so unncessary or like there isn\'t much focus, instead it\'s focused on forcing drama and harem elements.I quite like Kuroneko and Ayase. Kuroneko surprised me and I can see why people like her, she seemed like the most normal out of all the characters until she suddenly isn\'t. Same with Ayase, she takes a sudden 180. I do like episodic episodes or episodes focusing on 1 girl for the harem theme but the way it flows to the next or executes it is horrible! I just keep feeling lost as if I hadn\'t been paying attention, when I had been trying to.I like Ayase but I don\'t understand why she likes the main character, it just didn\'t process in the end and felt forced. 1 episode characters would start dating and then by the end they stop dating. Then it turns out it was all a ruse to expose someone\'s true feelings but then it just sorta doesn\'t go anywhere with that or ever focuses it properly. It then just decides to do more harem bait stuff!Tsk, I need to come to a conclusion. This anime was frustrating to watch and enjoy. I wanted to enjoy it in the end since season 1 was decent. But I didn\'t. Season 2 decides to take a horrible melodramatic turn and go full harem without any proper way to transition to those themes smoothly. It\'s forced, it\'s messy and it\'s frustrating to say the least. And I\'ve seen NISEKOI and I quite enjoyed it, sure it had its characters acting dumb and melodrama but Nisekoi also allows itself to be funny and entertaining for the most part. Oreimo, nope.And I haven\'t even said a single thing about Kirino\'s romance and how it goes down in the end. Of course the main character would pick his sister, it\'s the damn name of the show of course. What truly mattered is how we get there and the themes that get explored.

I\'m an otaku living outside of Japan so it was interesting to see some of the otaku stuff in Japan...how people react and such.That being said...I knew this was also an anime about incest between a brother and sister...at least to a degree (they don\'t get past kissing ffs.). I\'m not against incest in anime...I actually enjoy it (all be it in yaoi form), so I won\'t say I didn\'t enjoy it for that...This review is for the whole show...both seasons and the specials.Story:It was delightful. It took a spin on the typical ""gross"" otaku...stereotype and made it into a cute middle school girl. I love that. I also love how they depict the other otaku girls...showing off that just because your an otaku, doesn\'t mean your a gross 40 something year old man with a little girl fetish. And it\'s true. The news reports we hear about otaku killers are just slander against a very small community. It\'s disgusting the hate for otakus...but I don\'t see it changing any time soon. The major part of the story focuses on the two siblings and how they interact with each other...finally finding a somewhat happy medium.Art:I loved the artwork...lots of attention to detail with the figures, manga and anime in the stores...and the cosplay costumes were also really detailed.Sound:The Stardust Witch Meruru song that Kanako Kurusu sang was catchy as hell lol.Characters:And this is where the anime messed up. I felt that the sister was...way to tsundere. At times it was even off putting. But the worst character by far was Ayase Aragaki. The most annoying girl in the damn anime. All of season one I hated her...season two I hated her less but I still wanted her to get hit by a truck...I also thought her ""confession"" was complete BS.Overall:I did enjoy the anime, even if some the characters annoyed me to no end. But that ending was...it wasn\'t as bad as School Days but it was up there. They pushed the two siblings together through the whole damn anime, only for them to break it off after FINALLY kissing?! And yes I know that it\'s hinted at that they still have a relationship...I don\'t consider hints useful. The anime should have ended with them kissing. It would have been a great ending...but no they had to wuss out. stereotype and made it into a cute middle school girl. I love that.

The show is like saying to me “hey, let’s make a show about a person who is garbage who also has a brother complex and let’s see how it goes from there.” And that is actually what I got, after watching the show, unfortunately.Oreimo’s plot features Kirino, a middle schooler beauty and model and her ever patient older brother Kyosuke, whom she...has not been on good terms for as long as Kyosuke can remember. After Kyousuke learning about his sister’s secret of being an otaku,  he took it to himself on protecting his sibling from all sorts of predicaments caused by her hobby. Perhaps the author of the original material was already tired of seeing the usual traits found on most heroines that’s why the concept of this slice of life story was born when he decided to mess with the traditional formula on what kind of person should take the lead which for me, is a welcome breath of fresh air but my stars, this is already beyond my good expectations.I admit the show amused me to some extent like seeing some slapstick humor or Kyosuke eating his own pride in order to safeguard that bratty girl who is a horrible excuse for a human being which results to humorous moments but what I don’t get is the abuse the older brother is willing to endure just for her sake. I suppose that is how he shows his concern to his sibling but it is still painful to see that kind of self sacrifice, especially how his sister treats still treats him with little or no change at all. Season 1 is all about Kirino’s otaku hobbies and how his ever willing brother is there to lend a helping hand in order to get her out of sticky situations although that kind of formula is like a recurring theme for most of the episodes which is kind of predictable to know what will happen in the end. AND you get to see that a lot which is kind of tiring to view.But to my astonishment and joy, the “source” of all the chaos was actually removed for a couple of episodes near the end of the first season and her role was taken by Kuroneko, her other otaku friend whose personality is much better compared to our garbage heroine. Because of this another story took place which is kind of nice because we get to see the relationship of Kyosuke and Kuroneko somehow blossom a bit, although not moving forward aside from where they currently are. Season 2 unlike its predecessor brought in new stories which are funny but it feels more like fillers in order to make up numbers for the episodes needed for this sequel. The real meat and potatoes of the first half of this season is the part where garbage girl pulled a stunt pretending she has a boyfriend which not only threw her friends in disarray, but also shook the Kousaka household’s foundation causing his old man to go on a drunken frenzy and for older brother to do his “all time low” act just in order to put an end to their relationship. This finally made me realize that bratty girl will do anything in her power in order to claim her brother for her own no matter what. I can only hope it will never come into fruition.The other half of what I liked about this season is where Kyosuke and Kuroneko finally ended up being a couple which is kind of nice since he deserves to have his own happiness after all the things he had been through with his sister. That is where the story shifted to although briefly, it was memorable since it was time for this pair to shine in which it was portrayed with the things they did like a couple would do, although in an otaku way in some areas. However, trouble was brewing like a terrible storm seen from a mile away. Like all unfortunate relationships, theirs would end not because of things that would conflict with one another, but because of logic that Kuroneko dished out in which I never saw it coming- she broke up with that guy. Please here me out here… the reason she broke up with Kyosuke is because she wants confirm what Kirino really feels toward his older brother. I find this one of the dumbest things in order to figure out what is happening but also cruel at the same time since older brother becomes the guinea pig for this terrible experiment that involves someone’s heart. Isn’t love what drove Kuroneko to confess her feelings to Kyosuke? Couldn’t Kuroneko have used a different way other than breaking up in order to confirm her suspicions about Kirino’s feelings for her older brother?? Now I think everything Kuroneko did was just a hoax and all they’ve done for the short time when they were still a couple were just for naught.Because of this turn of events I sensed that garbage girl will get the upper hand and will triumph in the end but I kept ignoring the warnings that a tragedy of a sister-brother-lover relationship will not happen in the end. I was a presumptuous fool since imouto won the battle with Kyosuke delivering the worst heartbreak for poor Kuroneko near the end of the season. In a to little to late last resort, childhood friend Manami finally stepped in for a last ditch effort to bring the siblings back to reality since their relationship will not be seen normal by society and consequences will follow. And you know, She is right about everything she said albeit her motivation on doing so was purely selfish since we all know she also wants Kyosuke to herself but at least someone who is right on the head finally pointed that out right in the siblings’ faces. However, Kyosuke still persists he will still love her sister like a lover even if they will be cast aside by the same people which finds their connection abnormal which cemented his status to me as someone who has been morally corrupted by his dominating and aggressive sister.ConclusionOreimo to this day still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth because of that terrible ending which resembles the 4th story arc of the Yosuga no Sora anime (minus the sexual act) that it’s perfectly fine to go and have a romantic relationship with your siblings. But in reality, the picture what the series is trying to paint is very obvious because what is wrong in reality will still be the same thing no matter what kind of whitewashing you use, even in anime.First posted in https://myanimeroom.wordpress.com/ last 03/13/2018.

Less appalling, now it's only bad.I'll address the elephant in the room which is the incest. There is none. There's a brother and a sister who love each other and want to improve their relationship. Is the entire show a gigantic insinuation that they want to be romantically involved? Yes and it's perfectly fine because these are fictional characters and it's not the focus of the story.I can tell you why incest is objectively wrong besides the genetic risks - It's near impossible for it to be a consensual relationship due to the inherent trust...family members have in one another. It's also why master or teacher/student relationships (regardless of age) are a bad idea, because the student is essentially conditioned to trust everything said by that person.You don't think straight, you're prone to do a string of things that you would not be alright with under any other circumstance and it leaves you exceptionally vulnerable, sometimes for both people. It's just a bad recipe with too much risk that stunts your growth.The reason the first season was terrible was because it was a miserable experience and the second season is less so, but it has not just its own flaws, it also carries over the issues from the first season (and the first special, since this is a continuation of those episodes).Little sister Kirino resets to being an awful person (the show seems to be aware of how weird this is) and there's a painful couple of episodes that deliberately give you the content you want (or at least preferable to yet more miserable Kirino content) and then rips it away because everything, all the time, always is about Kirino.Lets start at the end. Kirino's reason for being an abhorrent abusive shit is exposition dumped in the very last episode and the reasoning is gossamer thin.There is no build up to this, there is no character development, there is just a pretense that people weren't always bad and that some magical hump has been overcome for everyone to behave differently now. The whole story could've been saved and gradually resolved, but instead the tone of the show shifts from being a confusing mess that doesn't know if it wants to be funny, a drama or slice of life and instead goes full on slapstick harem romcom, invalidating everything that's happened before then.Big brother Kyosuke is all of a sudden popular, to a ridiculous extent, culminating in a full on bishojo game with everyone suddenly wanting to be with him, completely out of left field. The character has not done much to deserve this, I write 'much' because the implication is that everyone sees what he's willing to do for someone he loves (his sister), but this is audience knowledge, not something every character knows.There is missing context. First off there's another special (which I have not watched as of yet), but the manga series is apparently a multiple ending story. Anime viewers don't know this and it's CRUCIAL to the second season to understand these bizarre developments, because the whole thing is essentially a joke that the audience isn't really let in on. There is no narrator to tell you that Kyosuke has to choose between girls and what his motivations for each one would be. They're not self evident either because he's overwhelmed by crazy girls and doesn't stand a chance to think things through.On the bright side the show isn't miserable anymore, it's actually funny, critical of itself and has plenty of endearing moments.

Is just bad. I got interested in this anime when YouTube recommended me one clip from this anime. I have written there on the video a comment ""I really should watch this anime already."" since I saw more clips of this anime. However, there was only answers advising me not to. ...And perhaps, there was only one reply saying I should. And now I understand all the hatred towards this anime.Oreimo 2 isn\'t overall a bad anime, but the...story is just f***** up. It\'s like the director(s) knew what people really don\'t want to happen and it makes no sense.The best idea probably is to end on episode 12, and not watching it any further, because it just gets worse in the specials.So pretty much, the anime will show you how good it is, and then it will show you how fast it can get ruined. story is just f***** up.

The fact the protagonist-kun actually hooked up with the girl who wasn't his sister was nice. People who write siscon stories have never had siblings, because if they did they'd be just as grossed out as the rest of us at the idea. If anybody has ever actually had a pervy attraction to their own siblings, blood-related or otherwise, they are the degenerate outlier in an otherwise civilized society.Well once he'd hooked up with the black hair kouhai girl I thought that'd be the end of...all the sibling shipping but this is anime so of course it has to be a forced love triangle and of course he ends up ruining his perfectly happy committed relationship so he could score some sweet sweet incest. I don't care how the show tries to paint it, it's weird and gross. Playing the brocon/siscon archetype for comedic effect can be very funny,  but when you try to dramatize it like this it becomes very yabai very fast.For as much as I didn't like the ending I think there were still okay moments in the show leading up to it so it's not the worst show ever. It's up there among the more degenerate anime content but if you can pretend it's all for laughs I guess you can still have an alright time with it. 7/10 all the sibling shipping but this is anime so of course it has to be a forced love triangle and of course he ends up ruining his perfectly happy committed relationship so he could score some sweet sweet incest.

(Even though she had this basic sad past that ive already forgotten about).Kirino was very annoying but the anime (and manga) kept describing her as perfect which kind of annoyed me because she has all these strange fetishes and she's very bitchy but idk that's perfect somehow--Pretty sure i just sounds salty rn so lets leave it at that.

Took a peek at the game endings and read about the production of the story.This is my personal experience with the show, that I think it\'s different from your usual take. Here\'s the context.I personally left the anime community years ago for many reasons (offline and online), and now I follow my own rules when I watch anime. Not to bore you with it, but what\'s important in this case is that I try to make my own opinion based on my personal entertainment with the show and know as little spoilers as possible.All...I knew about this show before I started it is that it has incest and that\'s why it\'s bad. Every1 was saying that last time I was in the community so that stuck with me. So I went in with that idea, looking for those specific clues to see how they reach that point.The story was way different that I imagined it. Nobody told me that upfront there\'s comedy and otaku slice of life, while under these there were layers of trauma for most characters. Kirino, the sister, had the most trauma out of them all, followed by her brother.What got me hooker to the show is seeing how they go past this trauma, and became loving sibling even if they hurt each other so much in the past. I never imagined that a certain character was the one that was kinda pulling the strings for them to fail and enabling certain things to happen.Overall I loved the ride, and my focus was finding all the clues that would explain this trauma or what happened in the past or what the characters actually think about each other and why.Now, to the ending. At first glance, it sucked, because it didn\'t make sense. I googled it and found out the author was forced by the publishing company to change his story, that\'s why it didn\'t make sense. So I found out what the real story would\'ve been and what the game ""real ending"" is. Even if ppl say it\'s not cannon, personally I will take it as cannon, as the story itself ended in an open manner, with hints from the author here and there saying ""this is the direction I wanted to go in but these publishers censored me"".What also didn\'t help is that they cut some content from the original novel when adapting the anime. Nothing ""major"", the plot still made sense where that part was missing, but the part adds so much context and depth to some characters and the decisions they make. I do recommend ppl read about what was cut, especially the Sakurai Arc, which in my opinion it should\'ve been adapted to better explain from where the trauma started.For me, I give this anime a 9 because of the trip it gave me, exploring the way the 2 characters interacted, cried, fought for each other, bickered, shared their passion (1 at least), helped each other and for all the loving moments they have. I would\'ve given it a 10 if it didn\'t have the production issues and censoring.I didn\'t care about the major thing people complained about, in my view, when mentioning this anime. Because it gave me something much deeper to enjoy and follow. I laughed, I cried, I rolled in my bed from the emotion it sparked in me.Sure, besides what I said the plot isn\'t perfect. The brother is kinda dull and can\'t read a room even if there\'s a flag in it. The sister is violent way more than necessary. Some characters repeat the same lines it becomes boring and some situations are so stereotypical of anime like accidental bumping into people and seeing girls naked.But for me all of this didn\'t matter because I knew from the first episodes and from the opening lyrics that something big is brewing under all of this. Rare lines that the characters say, something like ""Don\'t you dare start acting like a brother now"" carried a much deeper meaning than just insults in a meaningless fight. It payed off for me in the end.But this is just me. If the only thing you know about this anime is that there\'s incest and you don\'t like it, I\'d say either don\'t watch it then, or keep in mind that you got way more content that\'s better, that\'s not incest, in the actual story. And depending on what you consider cannon or not, you might assume the incest barely even happened.If you don\'t mind incest or you\'re not sure, I say give it a go. The anime will offer you banger openings, all with different animations and unique endings with different lyrics too that relate to the episode.And you\'ll get to explore a story about 2 siblings that got separated by sad circumstances where someone had something to do with it,  to keep them apart. But they overcome all their fears and insecurities to reach their ideal world.I cried when it ended and now got post-anime depression, but it is what it is.

Pokemon Sun & Moon,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34034/Pokemon_Sun___Moon,"['I remember seeing the first few episodes of pokemon Black and White on TV when they were first coming out over here and I was rather upset about them. My biggest gripe was with Ash’s character design, which was made to look younger. So I can totally understand the mindset behind the people who are upset about the change in art style the show has made, which is much bigger in contrast than it was in Black and White. Yet I’m not on their side this time. In fact I really love the new art style and how colourful and round it is. In fact...I love almost everything about the new Sun and Moon anime, so much so that it might be the most I’ve ever enjoyed pokemon. Even as a kid I wasn’t as entranced by pokemon as I am now; back then it was just day to day business. Yet despite how much I think it’s great, Pokemon Sun and Moon is very controversial amongst fans and there’s a lot of people who are very mad at it. Clearly these people, most of whom are certainly long term pokemon fans, have ideas about what a pokemon series should contain, that Sun and Moon isn’t living up to. So in this review I don’t just want to talk about all the things that I love about the anime, but I will occasionally also lightly touch up on some criticisms of the show and why I don’t share them. I’m hoping I can not only show people whether they fall into the group that would actually enjoy Sun and Moon or not, but also help some people to appreciate it, who didn’t already.Naturally there is one aspect of the Sun and Moon anime that is immediately obviously different from the earlier installments of the show: the art style. Gone are the spiky haired shounen character designs of the original series, as they’re replaced by these new round and colourful ones. The water colour (or at least water-colour-looking) backgrounds of the original series are replaced by digital ones, that are even greener. Though that is an earlier innovation from long before Sun and Moon. The animation, too, has changed considerably. The animation is much more fluid now, with the animators having incorporated a lot more smear frames to make it more expressive. Everything about the look of Sun and Moon is much more poppy and expressive, which adds to the much more lighthearted tone of the show.But why did Ash’s character design change so much? X and Y seemed to be going excellently, with lots of fans loving it and lots of people in the industry praising it. Why suddenly make such a big shift in such a big aspect of a show that’s going really well? Was it an evil scheme by the producers of the show to make pokemon look more like youkai watch so they can make more money? Well, no, not exactly. The thing you have to realize is that Ash’s character design has always been changing and it has always been changing too slowly. Even during the original series you saw his design slowly change and the makers of the show have always been very careful to implement new digital technology as gradually as possible, so that people wouldn’t notice. The difference here is that there is suddenly a big change, instead of a gradual one. An often noted fact about X and Y was that though the battle scenes were able to look really great due to all the innovations the team was already starting to make back then, Ash himself was rarely animated and the team even had a couple of stock animations of Ash throwing a pokeball, because no one wanted to animate him. The thing that pushed the team over the edge to change the character designs so drastically now, was that OLM was experimenting with more modern digital animation techniques and simpler, more rounded character designs are useful for that. The reason why pokemon now looks more like youkai watch, is because the character designs in youkai watch were also made to fit the same criteria. Though the fact that people unironically and without question put forth the idea that the character designs were made to match those of youkai watch, as if pokemon is some cheap cash grab that’s trying to leach off the popularity of that series, is some of the funniest stuff I’ve ever heard.Despite that, I’m not actually a huge fan of Ash’s redesign. His original design came from a time of spiky haired shounen protagonists, animated with coloured cells. His design was made for a different era of animation and so when adapting his design for modern animation techniques, it’s impossible not to lose something along the way, especially if the priority was to make him easy to animate, rather than nice to look at. If you try to play a game of spot the main character in Sun and Moon, you wouldn’t be spotting Ash, as he just doesn’t look as well designed as the other major characters in the show. Then again, that might have more to do with the fantastic character designs the other characters in Sun and Moon have.So what’s up with the rest of the Sun and Moon character designs? The original series started in the 90s, when it was very common for TV anime to make up for a lack of animation quantity, with beautiful and detailed character designs. And pokemon has always had great character designs, even if they didn’t always animate as well. Sun and Moon takes the opposite approach, using very simple character designs to have them animate better. What you have to consider, though, is that when you make a simple character design, you draw significantly fewer lines, and as such, every line becomes more important and has to be more carefully considered. As such, creating a simple character design, that’s also really good and very memorable, is a lot harder that it may seem at first. It’s incredible to see just how many unique and extremely memorable designs Sun and Moon manages to have and how many designs from the games were flawlessly adapted for 2d animation. And the games themselves had a different design focus as well, moving away from their more anime inspired character designs, giving them a much wider appeal. As a result, Pokemon Sun and Moon has a completely unique look within the wider anime landscape. What Sun and Moon has actually retained from older pokemon, however, is that the character designs of the girls tend to look better than that of the boys. Suiren is a very cute and unique looking tomboy and Moa looks very sweet, but Kaki and Maamane look pretty boring in comparison, though certainly not bad. On top of that, there’s the ever adorable Lillie, who seems to be the unanimous winner among all the Sun and Moon characters and has a genuine cult following behind her. Sure, not every design in Sun and Moon gets to be that unique, but there are a lot of great ones, even outside of the main characters, and I personally think this season of pokemon might have the largest quantity of great looking character designs yet.So what about this animation that I keep mentioning? A lot of people didn’t just lament the character designs and the “graphics” of the new pokemon anime, when Sun and Moon was just announced, they also called out the animation of the show for being bad. Now, many of these people were the type of people who would pause on a smear frame and call it bad animation, completely negligent of the fact that animation only happens when you have multiple frames, or of the fact that the usage of smear frames is an industry standard, so don’t take them too seriously. But what would someone who actually knows anything about animation think about Sun and Moon? Well, mostly that it is extremely impressively well animated. You have to note, pokemon is a long running anime, so every episode has to be made, on average, in about a week. So the fact that it has been consistently one of the most impressively well, if not the most impressively well, animated anime of every season it has been a part of, is ludicrous. In fact, Sun and Moon might be the most animated long running TV anime of all time. And that is no exaggeration.I think the big disconnect people have with Sun and Moon is in the animation style. The focus of previous seasons has always been on the pokemon. If you look at the pokemon from Sun and Moon and from the original show you can barely see the difference, where if you look at the character designs between those shows, or even between the original show and X and Y, you see a much bigger change. The pocketmonster designs have always remained relevant and animating them has always been easy. Or at least for the small ones. The reason why Ash’s pokemon rarely evolve might partially be caused by the fact that smaller pokemon are easier to animate. Though the more important reason is because those unevolved pokemon might simply have better designs than their evolved counterparts, and one of the main purposes of the pokemon anime has always been to sell merchandise. The fact that the people in pokemon were rarely animated in any interesting way was never a problem, because it was always about the pokemon, even (or maybe especially) in battle focused X and Y. But Sun and Moon puts a much larger focus on the characters and wants to express a lot more emotions and a lot fewer battles. As such, goofy faces and all kinds of expressions and animations that leave or bend the limitations of the original character models are everywhere. In a show like X and Y, the characters will rarely move much and will rarely go off model; and a lot of people are into that. I think a lot of people just want their anime characters to be on model all the time and be more serious, most of the time, like the characters in a show like Legend of the Galactic heroes. Sure, that’s a bit of an exaggeration, but you get what I mean. But as much as I like that show, and as much as I think that style works for it, I would usually much rather see creative, goofy animation, than stiff animation that’s unwilling to bend it’s character models(even if the show has fantastic visual directing that makes it work). I just love anything that’s goofy and creative. Goofy faces and smeary animation are my bread and butter. I can’t get enough of them.Naturally, if you have a lighthearted show like Sun and Moon, you need fun characters to populate that show. The main six at the pokemon school all have their goofs, at different levels. Ash himself is laid back at times, but easily excitable. Unlike Ash in the original show, he’s not very bratty and he seems to take life as it comes to him, not the other way around. He’s not as concerned about becoming a pokemon master, and really just wants to have fun and do a few island trials. I’ve seen a lot of people call him childish in comparison to his X and Y counterpart, but I think they might have the terms ‘serious’ and ‘mature’ confused. These two are not the same thing. I remember being a six year old, being annoyed at adults for acting in a goofy manner. Who do you think knew more about maturity? Six year old me, or actual adults, who thought it was perfectly fine to be an adult that still loves being silly? For the most part during the show Ash is understanding of people and pokemon and tries his best to make friends. This is a far cry from the stubborn Ash in season 1 who still has a lot of growth to do. If you compare Sun and Moon Ash to original Ash, he’s definitely grown a lot over the years and I personally even look up to his attitude. He’s really found his way and is enjoying the little things in life. He probably read all of “Á la recherche du temps perdu” on the boat over to Alola. And the way that he combines that attitude with him still being loud and funny and excitable is just really fun to watch.Then there’s all these side characters. Lillie is the most popular and the most developed. She is initially scared of pokemon and has a bad relationship with her mother, but works through that. She’s very reserved but it becomes increasingly clear as the show goes on that she does actually want to be a part of the main group and be goofy right along with them. And seeing her pulling goofy faces or trying to be brave is just so cute. She’s adorable. I can definitely see why she has such a strong cult following. My personal favourite side character might be Suiren, though. She’s a tomboy who loves fishing, but she’s much more than that. She’s one of the funniest characters in the show. Sometimes she just does really funny things out of nowhere, just to mess with people, and she’s always up for whatever cool things the guys are doing. She’s the most surprising character out of all and you just never know when she will do something completely insane out of nowhere. Though her tomboyish nature doesn’t mean she can’t be girly. She and Mao are best friends and she can be just as girly as Mao when she wants. It’s nice to see a tomboy in media who hasn’t completely rejected femininity altogether. I think that’s more  a stereotype than anything. The only downside to Suiren is that she isn’t always doing funny stuff or saying funny things. I think a more consolidated cast, where Suiren had more focus put on her, could have made her an incredibly fun character to watch. As she is right now she’s kind of inconsistent. Her friend Mao is a little more boring. She’s cute and fun, but not extremely memorable. She runs a restaurant with her dad and is overall a good, hardworking girl.On the guy’s side there’s Kaki who is one of Ash’s rivals this season, though not his main one. Most of the time he’s acting more serious, but when the situation calls for it he can be the goofiest one of them all. There are lots of funny jokes and cool animation moments involving him and he becomes adorable when anything involves his little sister. Just like Suiren, he’s somewhat of a mixed bag, but I love him anyways. These characters make up the heart of what makes Sun and Moon so enjoyable. I’ve heard people complain that the characters in Sun and Moon don’t get enough development, but I have to disagree on that one. I don’t think developing a character significantly is necessary to create a fun and engaging piece of media. The fact that these characters are still making me laugh over 140 episodes in is a testament to how well they work. Though, sure, any character can always be better. I’m saying that these characters are vastly more than sufficient to make me thoroughly enjoy the show. Oh, also there’s Maamane. He’s fat. Also he likes tech. I think we can all agree that Maamane kinda sucks. Luckily there are enough other side characters that are fun to watch to make up for him.Now it’s great and all that the show has so many fun characters, but what is the episode to episode experience of watching it like? What is it like structurally? What is the story about? Of course you likely have already noticed that this part isn’t as important to me, considering how much I’ve been gushing about all the other aspects of the show, but naturally the structure is important to any show. And it’s extremely interesting to look at what parts of the original show Sun and Moon decided to keep or emphasize and what parts to lessen. I’ve said that Sun and Moon has less battling and that’s true, but when it comes to important battles, like gym battles or league battles, it’s not actually that far behind it’s predecessors. What it does away with is actually mostly team rocket battles and battles between Ash and random people he encounters. There’s far less of that in Sun and Moon and I think that’s good. Even in the original show team Rocket’s spiel got tiresome pretty quickly, so seeing their episodes be replaced with creative episodic episodes and them being relegated to comedic relief is fantastic. And the fights that are still there, mostly island trial battles, rival battles or league battles, are generally pretty good. Though even in the original pokemon series it took until the Johto league, 270 episodes in, before I saw any battles that truly excited me, and Sun and Moon was a similar situation.Sun and Moon got a lot of flak for focusing more on slice of life, rather than adventure, but I think that, in actuality, it doesn’t really matter. I mean, the gang can still go adventuring out in the woods or on other islands and is that really much different from the gang in the original getting lost in similar looking woods all the time? Structurally, all it really changes is that the main characters don’t sleep in the same location as each other and that they don’t have to go out looking for a pokemon center, every time they find a pokemon that’s hurt, which constantly happened in the original show. Really, it’s not even that much of a structural difference to the show. If the writers want the gang to go into some cave they go into some cave. It may be a slice of life show, but that doesn’t mean it’s not an adventure show. The only real fear is of the aesthetic, the idea of them being on an adventure, being lost. But I don’t think that’s even a problem, considering Ash is already far away from home here and the geography on the island seems to be much more varied than all those similar looking woods and plains from the original show. X and Y emphasized the battling aspect of the original show and tried to make it more exciting, but Sun and Moon emphasizes the episodic adventures and makes them funnier and more creative. It does focus a lot more on people than the original, though, which focused largely on pokemon and their relationship to human society, but other that that, it’s not even like Sun and Moon does a lot the original didn’t already. Sun and Moon and X and Y just emphasize different aspects of what made the original great. In that sense I think they are both great successors to the original pokemon series and should both have the right to exist.Pokemon Sun and Moon puts a lot of emphasis on episodic episodes, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t any story to it at all. The overall  narrative is about Ash going to a new region and trying to beat all of this island’s versions of gym leaders with the new pokemon he’s caught over there. This is typical of pokemon series past the original, but there’s one key difference, which greatly affects the tone of the series. Ash rarely, mentions the idea of becoming a pokemon master, unlike his first season counterpart, who can’t shut up about becoming one. From the very beginning his journey to Alola is never about beating some pokemon league. It’s purely about experiencing local culture, meeting new people, catching new pokemon, and maybe challenging some tough trainers he meets along the way. Ash in Sun and Moon seems to have realized that the adventures he has and the people he meets along the way are much more important than the end goal of his journey itself. He’s excited about every new thing he gets to experience, and welcomes every distraction along the way. And the show itself is similar. The show wants to do as many different things as possible and will actively avoid the trap of centering an episode on team rocket stealing Pikachu or relegating a large chunk of almost every episode to that. But besides all kinds of creative episodes the show also has some story arcs that can get very exciting and emotional. The show does like to pack an emotional punch from time to time, which I appreciate, and it’s not scared to talk about death. Sun and Moon is a varied experience, and because of that, doesn’t get tiresome or monotonous very quickly.Now, though these arcs and individual episodes can get very serious, for the most part Sun and Moon is still very lighthearted and casual. From the very beginning, Ash just wants to have fun and beat some island challenges. Participating in the pokemon league was never a part of the plan, because at the start of the show the pokemon league didn’t exist yet in Alola. In the original show Ash explicitly wants to go to Johto to participate in the league there. Ash’s focus has clearly changed and so has the show’s. To previous seasons the pokemon league was the goal and beating it the ultimate test. But in Alola, the league is a casual experience among friends and neighbors, likely a remnant of the earlier island trial tradition. So when the League in Sun and Moon came around and didn’t take itself as seriously as it had in previous seasons a lot of fans were upset. But I think this is a case of wrong expectations. The battles in the Alola league were good, even if they weren’t that big. There were a few comedy fights or fights with funny moments in them, and I can understand that someone who takes the league very seriously might be bothered by that, but those fights were all fun to watch either way. A show doesn’t need massive stakes for it to be enjoyable. It can just be about the personal stakes of a couple characters you care about. Ash facing off against his rivals this season wasn’t really any less exciting than it was in previous seasons, because rival battles have always been about personal stakes. The fact that the Alola league didn’t feel as grandiose and official points to the fact that this season of pokemon has a different appeal, and that’s really too bad for people who simply want out of pokemon what they got from X and Y. But the appeal that Sun and Moon is going for it’s doing fantastically.And with that we finally reach the end. Ash has said that he wants to see the rest of the world, and the next pokemon series is going to be about him travelling the world. Team rocket finally answers the question “What even is this feeling?” with “what a great feeling”, yet they only realized this right as they had to leave. I’d love to see where these characters go next, however it seems that Sword and Shield might become a reboot instead of a sequel. Either way, it seems that Sword and shield is once again going for a slightly different appeal from the last two series, and I think it will be a little less controversial because the appeal might lie more in the middle and Ash’s design is more pleasing to look at. To someone who doesn’t like Sun and Moon it might seem that their nightmare is finally over. To me it’s just yet another opportunity for a unique, new pokemon anime. Though I am sad to have to say goodbye to my favourite season of pokemon and I’m unsure if the next season will truly live up to it, but considering I haven’t heard anything about significant staff changes, I’m not that scared.You didn’t need to read all the way through this review to understand whether Sun and Moon was going to be your thing or not. You’d have seen whether you were on one line with me a few paragraphs in. If all that goofy fun stuff and those goofy faces and all that creative animation sounds great to you, you’re probably someone who is much more open about the fact that you like media that can just be fun and doesn’t need to be anything more. Otherwise if you still lament the fact that Sun and Moon doesn’t have as many battles, or if you want it to be more ‘serious’ and ‘adult’ you’ll probably dislike it. There’s a middle ground of people who think it’s just okay, but either way you can probably tell. But I’m not actually expecting many people to be reading this review to try and understand whether they’d like it or not. Most people have probably already seen it and made up their minds a long time ago. If you loved the show you probably wanted someone to talk about what you loved about it, in an endless sea of haters. And if you dislike it, you’re probably reading this review to discredit me. You probably, by now, think I’m a dipshit and this review is probably just making you angry. I just hope I got you to understand my perspective just a little bit.If 4200 words of a glowing review didn’t already tell you, I love pokemon Sun and Moon. I just have so much fun watching it. And that one word, “fun” speaks to the core of the show for me. The animators and writers of the show turned pokemon into what it is because that would be fun. Industry professionals from all over the industry praise the hell out of the Sun and Moon anime, and considering the amount of anime references that are in it, you can clearly tell that the creators of Sun and Moon still have lots of passion for the medium of anime and still have lots of fun creating pokemon. And I still have lots of fun watching it. The older I get the more I realize that the main thing I’m looking to get out of anime is fun. I love media that gives me joy, because there is no feeling I’d rather feel than joy. Sun and Moon’s fun characters, their funny expressions, the expressive animation, the references to all kinds of anime I love and the occasional emotional punch the show still has the weight to throw around, I love it all so much. There are few things in life that give me so much joy as knowing that pokemon is still fun to watch, 15 years after I first started watching it. Sure it isn’t perfect. Every episodic show, even something as prolific as Bebop or space dandy, is going to have weaker episodes. In particular I’d say episode 26 is kinda trash, though I’ll forgive it for how great episode 28 is. Still, Sun and Moon might be the best kids anime I’ve ever seen, and that says a lot considering how much I love Ojamajo Doremi.On that topic, If you loved Sun and Moon and you want to watch stuff like it, I’d highly recommend Ojamajo Doremi, which also has simpler more expressive character designs, with every facial reaction under the sun. You’ll probably also love Heartcatch precure and Sailor moon and you might even be into 100% Pascal sensei(and be a part of an exclusive club of like 3 people who like that show), and you’ll definitely be into Mahoujin Guruguru(2017). If you prefer X and Y, you’ll be delighted to know there’s an entire genre of anime that has the same appeal of that show. It’s called the “Shounen action” genre. You might have heard of it; it’s fairly popular. Of course that includes stuff like Hunter x Hunter(2011) and Fullmetal alchemist, that most people have already seen, but it’s a vast genre that you’re not going to watch all of anytime soon. If you somehow don’t know how to find that stuff, you can always PM me for recommendations. Anyways, I hope that regardless of whether you like Sun and Moon or not, we can all come to one agreement: Let’s hope Sword and Shield is going to be the best pokemon anime yet. I love almost everything about the new Sun and Moon anime, so much so that it might be the most I’ve ever enjoyed pokemon. Even as a kid I wasn’t as entranced by pokemon as I am now; back then it was just day to day business. Yet despite how much I think it’s great, Pokemon Sun and Moon is very controversial amongst fans and there’s a lot of people who are very mad at it. Clearly these people, most of whom are certainly long term pokemon fans, have ideas about what a pokemon series should contain, that Sun and Moon isn’t living up to. So in this review I don’t just want to talk about all the things that I love about the anime, but I will occasionally also lightly touch up on some criticisms of the show and why I don’t share them. I’m hoping I can not only show people whether they fall into the group that would actually enjoy Sun and Moon or not, but also help some people to appreciate it, who didn’t already.Naturally there is one aspect of the Sun and Moon anime that is immediately obviously different from the earlier installments of the show: the art style. Gone are the spiky haired shounen character designs of the original series, as they’re replaced by these new round and colourful ones. The water colour (or at least water-colour-looking) backgrounds of the original series are replaced by digital ones, that are even greener. Though that is an earlier innovation from long before Sun and Moon. The animation, too, has changed considerably. The animation is much more fluid now, with the animators having incorporated a lot more smear frames to make it more expressive. Everything about the look of Sun and Moon is much more poppy and expressive, which adds to the much more lighthearted tone of the show.But why did Ash’s character design change so much? X and Y seemed to be going excellently, with lots of fans loving it and lots of people in the industry praising it. Why suddenly make such a big shift in such a big aspect of a show that’s going really well? Was it an evil scheme by the producers of the show to make pokemon look more like youkai watch so they can make more money? Well, no, not exactly. The thing you have to realize is that Ash’s character design has always been changing and it has always been changing too slowly. Even during the original series you saw his design slowly change and the makers of the show have always been very careful to implement new digital technology as gradually as possible, so that people wouldn’t notice. The difference here is that there is suddenly a big change, instead of a gradual one. An often noted fact about X and Y was that though the battle scenes were able to look really great due to all the innovations the team was already starting to make back then, Ash himself was rarely animated and the team even had a couple of stock animations of Ash throwing a pokeball, because no one wanted to animate him. The thing that pushed the team over the edge to change the character designs so drastically now, was that OLM was experimenting with more modern digital animation techniques and simpler, more rounded character designs are useful for that. The reason why pokemon now looks more like youkai watch, is because the character designs in youkai watch were also made to fit the same criteria. Though the fact that people unironically and without question put forth the idea that the character designs were made to match those of youkai watch, as if pokemon is some cheap cash grab that’s trying to leach off the popularity of that series, is some of the funniest stuff I’ve ever heard.Despite that, I’m not actually a huge fan of Ash’s redesign. His original design came from a time of spiky haired shounen protagonists, animated with coloured cells. His design was made for a different era of animation and so when adapting his design for modern animation techniques, it’s impossible not to lose something along the way, especially if the priority was to make him easy to animate, rather than nice to look at. If you try to play a game of spot the main character in Sun and Moon, you wouldn’t be spotting Ash, as he just doesn’t look as well designed as the other major characters in the show. Then again, that might have more to do with the fantastic character designs the other characters in Sun and Moon have.So what’s up with the rest of the Sun and Moon character designs? The original series started in the 90s, when it was very common for TV anime to make up for a lack of animation quantity, with beautiful and detailed character designs. And pokemon has always had great character designs, even if they didn’t always animate as well. Sun and Moon takes the opposite approach, using very simple character designs to have them animate better. What you have to consider, though, is that when you make a simple character design, you draw significantly fewer lines, and as such, every line becomes more important and has to be more carefully considered. As such, creating a simple character design, that’s also really good and very memorable, is a lot harder that it may seem at first. It’s incredible to see just how many unique and extremely memorable designs Sun and Moon manages to have and how many designs from the games were flawlessly adapted for 2d animation. And the games themselves had a different design focus as well, moving away from their more anime inspired character designs, giving them a much wider appeal. As a result, Pokemon Sun and Moon has a completely unique look within the wider anime landscape. What Sun and Moon has actually retained from older pokemon, however, is that the character designs of the girls tend to look better than that of the boys. Suiren is a very cute and unique looking tomboy and Moa looks very sweet, but Kaki and Maamane look pretty boring in comparison, though certainly not bad. On top of that, there’s the ever adorable Lillie, who seems to be the unanimous winner among all the Sun and Moon characters and has a genuine cult following behind her. Sure, not every design in Sun and Moon gets to be that unique, but there are a lot of great ones, even outside of the main characters, and I personally think this season of pokemon might have the largest quantity of great looking character designs yet.So what about this animation that I keep mentioning? A lot of people didn’t just lament the character designs and the “graphics” of the new pokemon anime, when Sun and Moon was just announced, they also called out the animation of the show for being bad. Now, many of these people were the type of people who would pause on a smear frame and call it bad animation, completely negligent of the fact that animation only happens when you have multiple frames, or of the fact that the usage of smear frames is an industry standard, so don’t take them too seriously.

So the fact that it has been consistently one of the most impressively well, if not the most impressively well, animated anime of every season it has been a part of, is ludicrous.

I’ve seen a lot of people call him childish in comparison to his X and Y counterpart, but I think they might have the terms ‘serious’ and ‘mature’ confused. These two are not the same thing. I remember being a six year old, being annoyed at adults for acting in a goofy manner. Who do you think knew more about maturity? Six year old me, or actual adults, who thought it was perfectly fine to be an adult that still loves being silly?

And the way that he combines that attitude with him still being loud and funny and excitable is just really fun to watch.Then there’s all these side characters. Lillie is the most popular and the most developed. She is initially scared of pokemon and has a bad relationship with her mother, but works through that.

I’ve said that Sun and Moon has less battling and that’s true, but when it comes to important battles, like gym battles or league battles, it’s not actually that far behind it’s predecessors. What it does away with is actually mostly team rocket battles and battles between Ash and random people he encounters. There’s far less of that in Sun and Moon and I think that’s good. Even in the original show team Rocket’s spiel got tiresome pretty quickly, so seeing their episodes be replaced with creative episodic episodes and them being relegated to comedic relief is fantastic. And the fights that are still there, mostly island trial battles, rival battles or league battles, are generally pretty good.

It may be a slice of life show, but that doesn’t mean it’s not an adventure show. The only real fear is of the aesthetic, the idea of them being on an adventure, being lost. But I don’t think that’s even a problem, considering Ash is already far away from home here and the geography on the island seems to be much more varied than all those similar looking woods and plains from the original show. X and Y emphasized the battling aspect of the original show and tried to make it more exciting, but Sun and Moon emphasizes the episodic adventures and makes them funnier and more creative. It does focus a lot more on people than the original, though, which focused largely on pokemon and their relationship to human society, but other that that, it’s not even like Sun and Moon does a lot the original didn’t already. Sun and Moon and X and Y just emphasize different aspects of what made the original great. In that sense I think they are both great successors to the original pokemon series and should both have the right to exist.Pokemon Sun and Moon puts a lot of emphasis on episodic episodes, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t any story to it at all. The overall  narrative is about Ash going to a new region and trying to beat all of this island’s versions of gym leaders with the new pokemon he’s caught over there. This is typical of pokemon series past the original, but there’s one key difference, which greatly affects the tone of the series. Ash rarely, mentions the idea of becoming a pokemon master, unlike his first season counterpart, who can’t shut up about becoming one. From the very beginning his journey to Alola is never about beating some pokemon league. It’s purely about experiencing local culture, meeting new people, catching new pokemon, and maybe challenging some tough trainers he meets along the way. Ash in Sun and Moon seems to have realized that the adventures he has and the people he meets along the way are much more important than the end goal of his journey itself. He’s excited about every new thing he gets to experience, and welcomes every distraction along the way. And the show itself is similar. The show wants to do as many different things as possible and will actively avoid the trap of centering an episode on team rocket stealing Pikachu or relegating a large chunk of almost every episode to that. But besides all kinds of creative episodes the show also has some story arcs that can get very exciting and emotional. The show does like to pack an emotional punch from time to time, which I appreciate, and it’s not scared to talk about death. Sun and Moon is a varied experience, and because of that, doesn’t get tiresome or monotonous very quickly.Now, though these arcs and individual episodes can get very serious, for the most part Sun and Moon is still very lighthearted and casual. From the very beginning, Ash just wants to have fun and beat some island challenges. Participating in the pokemon league was never a part of the plan, because at the start of the show the pokemon league didn’t exist yet in Alola. In the original show Ash explicitly wants to go to Johto to participate in the league there. Ash’s focus has clearly changed and so has the show’s. To previous seasons the pokemon league was the goal and beating it the ultimate test. But in Alola, the league is a casual experience among friends and neighbors, likely a remnant of the earlier island trial tradition. So when the League in Sun and Moon came around and didn’t take itself as seriously as it had in previous seasons a lot of fans were upset. But I think this is a case of wrong expectations. The battles in the Alola league were good, even if they weren’t that big. There were a few comedy fights or fights with funny moments in them, and I can understand that someone who takes the league very seriously might be bothered by that, but those fights were all fun to watch either way. A show doesn’t need massive stakes for it to be enjoyable. It can just be about the personal stakes of a couple characters you care about. Ash facing off against his rivals this season wasn’t really any less exciting than it was in previous seasons, because rival battles have always been about personal stakes. The fact that the Alola league didn’t feel as grandiose and official points to the fact that this season of pokemon has a different appeal, and that’s really too bad for people who simply want out of pokemon what they got from X and Y. But the appeal that Sun and Moon is going for it’s doing fantastically.And with that we finally reach the end. Ash has said that he wants to see the rest of the world, and the next pokemon series is going to be about him travelling the world. Team rocket finally answers the question “What even is this feeling?” with “what a great feeling”, yet they only realized this right as they had to leave. I’d love to see where these characters go next, however it seems that Sword and Shield might become a reboot instead of a sequel. Either way, it seems that Sword and shield is once again going for a slightly different appeal from the last two series, and I think it will be a little less controversial because the appeal might lie more in the middle and Ash’s design is more pleasing to look at. To someone who doesn’t like Sun and Moon it might seem that their nightmare is finally over. To me it’s just yet another opportunity for a unique, new pokemon anime. Though I am sad to have to say goodbye to my favourite season of pokemon and I’m unsure if the next season will truly live up to it, but considering I haven’t heard anything about significant staff changes, I’m not that scared.You didn’t need to read all the way through this review to understand whether Sun and Moon was going to be your thing or not. You’d have seen whether you were on one line with me a few paragraphs in. If all that goofy fun stuff and those goofy faces and all that creative animation sounds great to you, you’re probably someone who is much more open about the fact that you like media that can just be fun and doesn’t need to be anything more. Otherwise if you still lament the fact that Sun and Moon doesn’t have as many battles, or if you want it to be more ‘serious’ and ‘adult’ you’ll probably dislike it. There’s a middle ground of people who think it’s just okay, but either way you can probably tell. But I’m not actually expecting many people to be reading this review to try and understand whether they’d like it or not. Most people have probably already seen it and made up their minds a long time ago. If you loved the show you probably wanted someone to talk about what you loved about it, in an endless sea of haters. And if you dislike it, you’re probably reading this review to discredit me. You probably, by now, think I’m a dipshit and this review is probably just making you angry. I just hope I got you to understand my perspective just a little bit.If 4200 words of a glowing review didn’t already tell you, I love pokemon Sun and Moon. I just have so much fun watching it. And that one word, “fun” speaks to the core of the show for me. The animators and writers of the show turned pokemon into what it is because that would be fun. Industry professionals from all over the industry praise the hell out of the Sun and Moon anime, and considering the amount of anime references that are in it, you can clearly tell that the creators of Sun and Moon still have lots of passion for the medium of anime and still have lots of fun creating pokemon. And I still have lots of fun watching it. The older I get the more I realize that the main thing I’m looking to get out of anime is fun. I love media that gives me joy, because there is no feeling I’d rather feel than joy. Sun and Moon’s fun characters, their funny expressions, the expressive animation, the references to all kinds of anime I love and the occasional emotional punch the show still has the weight to throw around, I love it all so much. There are few things in life that give me so much joy as knowing that pokemon is still fun to watch, 15 years after I first started watching it. Sure it isn’t perfect. Every episodic show, even something as prolific as Bebop or space dandy, is going to have weaker episodes. In particular I’d say episode 26 is kinda trash, though I’ll forgive it for how great episode 28 is. Still, Sun and Moon might be the best kids anime I’ve ever seen, and that says a lot considering how much I love Ojamajo Doremi.On that topic, If you loved Sun and Moon and you want to watch stuff like it, I’d highly recommend Ojamajo Doremi, which also has simpler more expressive character designs, with every facial reaction under the sun. You’ll probably also love Heartcatch precure and Sailor moon and you might even be into 100% Pascal sensei(and be a part of an exclusive club of like 3 people who like that show), and you’ll definitely be into Mahoujin Guruguru(2017). If you prefer X and Y, you’ll be delighted to know there’s an entire genre of anime that has the same appeal of that show. It’s called the “Shounen action” genre. You might have heard of it; it’s fairly popular. Of course that includes stuff like Hunter x Hunter(2011) and Fullmetal alchemist, that most people have already seen, but it’s a vast genre that you’re not going to watch all of anytime soon. If you somehow don’t know how to find that stuff, you can always PM me for recommendations. Anyways, I hope that regardless of whether you like Sun and Moon or not, we can all come to one agreement: Let’s hope Sword and Shield is going to be the best pokemon anime yet.', 'If what you value in anime is a tightly written plot, fleshed out and well-developed characters, or strong, resonant themes, than I am sorry to say that the Sun and Moon anime will likely disappoint you.The plot is generally episodic, with the ""main"" story only advancing sporadically, often seemingly at random, and sometimes, you may question what the plot\'s even supposed to be.The characters are used inconsistently, with some receiving far more attention than others. Some will develop a lot, others not at all, despite them all having just as much potential.And on the whole, after you\'ve caught up to the show, you may...look back and question if you\'ve really learned anything. Indeed, you may be asking: ""What was the point?""Many shows would crumble under the weight of these flaws, and I couldn\'t entirely blame you if this has put you off from watching this anime.HOWEVER...Pokemon Sun and Moon is one of the warmest, most wholesome, and downright most pleasant shows I have ever seen. All of the above criticisms are perfectly valid, but instead of buckling over these shortcomings, Sun and Moon laughs off the complaints, reaches out its hand, and invites you to have some fun.The aesthetic is top tier. Alola is a tropical island, and this is nailed down so perfectly that any individual shot of most episodes immediately gives off a warm and pleasant vibe. Just looking at the show puts me at peace, but it\'s not just the artwork that\'s impressive. Many were wary of the character design changes Sun and Moon implemented, but the simplified designs not only mesh incredibly well with the setting, but also serve to make animating these characters much easier. I feel confident saying that this is the most well-animated Pokemon series to date, and one of the best looking long-running anime of all time. Whether it\'s an intense Pokemon battle or even a baseball face-off, everything is brought to life so vibrantly that it\'s impossible not to be charmed.The overarching plot may be lacking, but every episode provides it\'s own little story that manages to entertain, in so many different ways. One episode you\'ll be laughing at the antics of lost Pokemon finding their way home, another episode you\'ll be awed by a sudden explosion of stellar fight animation, and sometimes you\'ll find yourself tearing up at some of the saddest scenes in Pokemon history.But never fear, because you can wipe those tears away with some fun on the beach, see what new shenanigans Team Rocket is getting up to (spoiler alert: their new friend is EXTREMELY protective), and maybe even get hyped for a new capture or evolution.You\'ll have plenty of friends to experience this all with. Some might say TOO many, in fact, as the show often struggles to give every main character something important to do, but that\'s all right, you\'ll always get to see them again in the next episode. Every character is a joy to watch, boasting great designs and voice acting to really bring them to life. They all get time to shine, in different ways, and even the few I didn\'t like at the beginning grew on me quickly. The good vibes this group gives off are infectious, and this is a group of friends I\'m happy to watch doing pretty much anything.Of course, some may still be disappointed. Especially coming off the heels of XYZ, which took the Pokemon anime to a more serious place than it\'s ever been. Many might wonder why they should bother with a show that looks so silly in comparison. They may wonder what it could offer them, when all the goofy faces and simple designs seem so much like they\'re trying to appeal to children. And make no mistake, the show IS primarily for children. The Pokemon anime always has been. But just because that\'s the target audience, doesn\'t mean everyone can\'t have fun with it.The point of Sun and Moon isn\'t to arrive at any grand destination. It\'s not to teach you a valuable lesson, and it\'s not to make you ponder anything long after you\'ve watched it. The point, plain and simple, is just to have fun. To give you 20 minutes of bright sun, good friends, and a warm feeling inside that will hopefully brighten your day. This is absolutely the kind of show you can rewatch episodes of, not because you may have missed something the first time, but just because you want that Sun and Moon feeling again.If you\'ve been holding out on trying Sun and Moon for whatever reason, be that the art style change, different cast, or change of tone, I urge you to give it a chance. If you tried the show out but found yourself put off by it, maybe a change in mindset will help you enjoy it.Try to remember when you first got into the Pokemon anime. I\'m sure most of us were kids, and while we no doubt enjoyed the action and liked whatever characters we grew up with, the reason Pokemon is so beloved the world over is because the world of Pokemon is just inherently fun. It\'s nice to be transported to a world where the biggest thing you have to worry about is how you\'ll get your pet dog to evolve into a wolf, and going to school is a great time where you learn about the things you love.Sun and Moon certainly won\'t appeal to everyone, but if you can still remember that childlike wonder of first discovering Pokemon, if you want to be taken to a tropical island with some pleasant company for awhile, if you\'re interested in seeing consistently great and inventive sakuga, or if you\'re just in the mood for some good, clean fun, then you\'ll have the time of your life with Pokemon Sun and Moon. look back and question if you\'ve really learned anything.

If by any chance you didn't like it then message me and I will edit it out.First up the Story is more or less the same, about a 10 year old boy named Satoshi aiming to be a Pokemon Master. Usually Satoshi collects gym badges and enters the league, but this time it's different . Satoshi's new adventure is on a island with new pokemon and new friends. I'm not going to explain the plot anymore because I don't want to ruin anyones experience. The story improves significantly in time, but you have to...get used to the changes at your own pace. it look me 3 episodes to get used to for example.The most noticeable change in Sun & Moon is the animation style. This change is the most criticized, after all Satoshi was starting to look much more mature in XYZ. Yes, he looks much more of a kid, but how old is he? 15? 16? No, he is 10. He's been 10 since 1997. This criticism is very annoying. Anyhow, the animation suits the setting very well and also makes it more funny.The soundtracks suit the battling very well, not to mention the funny moments. The opening song is addicting and the ending song is amazing. For Pokemon you don't have to worry about the sound of the music or alike.Every individual character has their own personality. Their personality is what makes the show entertaining. For example, Lillie is too afraid to touch Pokemon. The characters design works well with the plot and everything else.I love Sun & Moon to bits. It's my life right now. #1 favourite anime at the moment and will stay that way. The reasons I love it is because of the comedy, animation, new pokemon and Z-Powers.Satoshi going to school wasn't the anime fault, it's the game. If you don't like it then consult nintendo. A change is not always bad, in this case it is perfect. Seeing Satoshi Lose in the league again and again wasn't exactly the best anyway .Thanks for reading and give Sun & Moon a try. I will prob edit in a few months.

Through my eyes I saw Sun and Moon trailing off of the XY series as a sort of ""calm before the storm"" if that makes any sense. After all the action that was brought by the previous season, the drama, the development, all the characters acting as one and thinking about the others, I felt Sun and Moon would be about Ash and him preparing for his next journey and learning what he could before his next big step into a new region and...a new adventure. What I thought and what I\'ve been watching are two completely different things.I was enjoying it at first but as it went along I started losing interest. I looked at this installment of the series as a ""laid back time"" meaning that this wasn\'t going to be as serious as previous generations before it since the Alola region is such a relaxed and easy going place, but I never expected it to be so uninteresting. I wanted to see travelling between the groups. Going all over the island and learning new things. With the idea of school they could have done so much. Make every new unit take place on a different island (schools are on each island) or each new lesson is taught in a particular part of the island that it relates to.I understand this whole generation is going to be centered around school but I honestly don\'t like that. Having to try and relate with and enjoy characters isn\'t possible for a lot of us because of the way that the writers have been taking the series. In my view, Mallow is really the only one in the entire group who actually seems to care. It\'s almost like they took Ash from XY and copy/pasted him into Mallow and just gave the Sun and Moon Ash a completely new personality.I want to go back to something like XY or Diamond and Pearl. We saw just how well they could write the characters and develop them. Sure there were a few dull moments but I\'m sure each and every one of us can say that the following episodes that were not filler always made up for it. Hell, even the fillers at times were amazing. I want to have that feeling where every week when I watch an episode, I can leave it to last on my list because it\'s the one I\'m looking most forward to. With the maybe 3-5 anime that update on Thursdays that I\'m watching, Sun and Moon is always the first and I just say ""let\'s get it over with"". I want the feeling where I can come back and wait letting the suspense build up and finally watching the episode and then thinking about how good it was for the rest of the night.If I ever watch a Sun and Moon episode now, at the end I\'m either thinking ""Why the hell is Ash so annoying? Seriously can you just act like you used to?"" or ""That was boring... Only decent thing that happened was Mallow actually attempting to get everybody to participate..."" THIS IS NOT WHAT THE SHOW IS ABOUT.Pokemon is a show about Ash who is setting out on his journey to be a Pokemon master while along the way he meets new people, makes new friends and learns from everyone. Sun and Moon doesn\'t include any of this. Kiawe for example could have had such a big role if they did not make him so annoying. He was the only one who had a Z-Ring when Ash first came here and he could have taught Ash and actually been a rival if they wrote Ash to have the same personality he once did. Lillie was supposed to have the largest role in the group seeing how she was the main characters in the games except now she barely does anything other than playing the role of an ""informant"" supplying the main characters with useful information as well as the ""tragic heroine"" since she can\'t touch Pokemon, other than Vulpix/Shiron, and always needs help from others. Lana is just meh. There\'s nothing to great about her other than the rare moments where she shines. And then Sophocles is just- *throws up*.What I\'m trying to say is that this series is nothing like a Pokemon series. This just feels like some random slice of life/fantasy/school life/comedy crap about a group of kids who just met some random kid who is hyper and they run around with their pets and one of the people in the group of kids is scared of pets so the others keep pushing their pets onto the one that\'s scared of pets so she won\'t be scared anymore. Then one of the kids is trying to get them to stop and have them all work together or make everything fun for them and they are the only one that leaves any impact on us. Then there is the hyper kid who comes there with nothing and then gets an OP power up and then one of the other kids who has an OP power up tells him that he has to be really strong to use that power up until the pet that gave the hyper kid that power up toys with him and says ""lets show this snot nosed brat what you can do"" and then they fight but the hyper kid doesn\'t win but still shows up the cocky snot nosed brat. Then the story continues for 25-27 episodes until SOMETHING GOOD FINALLY HAPPENS and then we have to wait god knows how long until something good happens again.What a Pokemon series should have is what we\'ve seen in every other region (besides black and white... Let\'s just not mention that). It should be a sense of a team where they treat each other like a family member. A group of 6 just doesn\'t work out. It just feels like they\'re classmates with no relationship whatsoever. Everyone should enjoy being with everyone, wanting to spend time with each other and learn from everyone or help each other. Have a sense that wherever one goes, the other goes and makes the journey/even a little bit more interesting. Everyone should have a goal or dream they are striving to get and actually show DEVELOPMENT TOWARDS THE DREAM OR GOAL.Sun and Moon from my eyes is not a ""Pokemon Series"". It\'s a lazy attempt at trying to appeal to an audience that is just not interested. Unless I can see a light in this very, very dark and dim place that the anime is currently in then I\'ll keep my nose out of it and continue to watch something that actually has me wanting more. a new adventure.

Unless I can see a light in this very, very dark and dim place that the anime is currently in then I\'ll keep my nose out of it and continue to watch something that actually has me wanting more.', 'Pokemon Sun & Moon is a weird story, its simultaneously widely hated and widely loved, so much so that its existence itself divided the Pokemon community into two halfs, ""SM Stans"" and ""XY Stans"".Personally while I love and appreciate the XY Series as well, Sun and Moon is just on a whole another league for me.After 20 long years of being on air, the Pokemon anime found itself a formula that it applied on every series, whenever the games came out, Ash went to the region said games are set and, traveled around the region, made friends, caught new Pokemon, collected badges and lost the...league, this is the ""basic plot"" of Pokemon summed up in one sentence, even when this is done well as is the case in the XY Series, watching the same formula again and again got repetitive in my opinion.Sun and Moon, while retaining the core themes and concepts of the previous seasons, took a very different approach, Ash didn\'t travel, he did make new friends but those were his ""classmates"", Yes, he went to School, he didn\'t collect gym badges as there are no gyms in the Alola Region but he did participate in the Island trials, so here are my thoughts.Characters : 8/10The Sun and Moon Series, despite having a way bigger cast than the previous seasons, developed each and every member in some way or another which I didn\'t think was possible for the Pokemon anime, Ash himself didn\'t get ""reset"" like he did in the Best Wishes series, he very much retained his skills which manifested in the XY Series, but one problem I had with XY\'s characterization of Ash is that outside of battles, he was quite stale. Sun and Moon fixed that, they made him childish and goofy while still badass and serious, a perfect mix.Story : 9/10The series has no ""main story"" all the small arcs and episodes build up to give us a really great Pokemon experience. Lillie\'s growth from a girl who is afraid of Pokemon and had problems with her family to battling her own brother in the Pokemon League and mastering a Z move was quite fascinating to see.Other characters like Sophocles, Kiawe and Lana got growth as well, Mallow despite being a okay character didn\'t get much development but she got an amazing episode which was episode 108, what shined was how the stories were connected to the main cast, we already talked about Lillie\'s story, that same story developed Lusamine, Gladion in more ways than one, that story itself made Gladion Ash\'s rival.Other small arcs like The Guzzlord and Zeraora mini arc or the return of Brock and Misty were really fun to see. It was really sweet to see all the interactions and relationship the characters shared, from the father and son dynamic Ash and Kukui had to Guzma who was sorta like a ""dark version"" of Ash, who quit his dreams after facing failures too many times.Animation : 7/10The new artstyle which cause a lot of controversy especially because of the look of Ash was implemented to enhance the character\'s movements by making the designs simplistic with less shading and details, the animators\' job became a lot easier as opposed to the well detailed designs of XY, while this sounds good on paper and the character animation did factually improve a lot, the battles for some reason were lackluster in terms of animation, despite being well written if a battle looks boring, it loses a lot of points, why do you think people like Ash vs Kukui? it was well written AND well animated, the next series is also taking this simplistic artstyle approach but my only hope is the battles look as good as the character animation does which is honestly amazing and the best in Sun and Moon. The backgrounds too look the best out of any series prior to it.Music : 10/10Nothing to say, Pokemon, be it the anime or the games, never disappoints with music, from beautiful remixes of games\' tracks to original tracks, Shinji Miyazaki is consistently amazing, this was his last series as the music scorer of Pokemon Anime, next series its Yuku Hayashi who is amazing as well (he did the score for My Hero Academia)Overall : 9/10Sun and Moon is just fun, it has a lot of ups and downs but which series doesn\'t? ignore the artstyle and give it a try, you won\'t be disappointed, league, this is the ""basic plot"" of Pokemon summed up in one sentence, even when this is done well as is the case in the XY Series, watching the same formula again and again got repetitive in my opinion.Sun and Moon, while retaining the core themes and concepts of the previous seasons, took a very different approach, Ash didn\'t travel, he did make new friends but those were his ""classmates"", Yes, he went to School, he didn\'t collect gym badges as there are no gyms in the Alola Region but he did participate in the Island trials, so here are my thoughts.Characters : 8/10The Sun and Moon Series, despite having a way bigger cast than the previous seasons, developed each and every member in some way or another which I didn\'t think was possible for the Pokemon anime, Ash himself didn\'t get ""reset"" like he did in the Best Wishes series, he very much retained his skills which manifested in the XY Series, but one problem I had with XY\'s characterization of Ash is that outside of battles, he was quite stale.

Initially, I hated the anime the moment I saw how Ash was designed which was like 3 years ago, then I thought let's give it a shot. After like 10-15 eps I gave up the anime for a really long time because at that time I was more into shonen anime and SuMo anime wasn't my cup of tea. I had questions also like why would Ash want to go POKEMON SCHOOL after travelling 6 REGIONS wherein he won 48 gym badges (8x6, do the math) and competed in 6 Pokemon Leagues and why wouldn't...you go an adventure like you did for 6 regions?So many questions, then after I heard that Gladion, Nebby made entries into the anime, I kinda kept up with it due to previews of next eps however slice of life still wasnt my cup of tea. Also I knew about these characters because I played the SuMo and USUM games and because of that I could watch the episodes here and there which contained some adventure, however thanks to their power ranger ripoff which was cringey to me I kinda narrowed down on eps to avoid thanks to people revealing the spoilers of next episodes on YT.However, this Summer I kinda wanted to watch something light hearted cuz I watched a lot of heavy shonen anime and I don;t know I just wanted more variety so I decided let's watch SuMo anime without skipping this time that too during my rewatch which I started on October 4th and was also watching the Alola League side by side.I am on the 22nd episode of my rewatch, and gotta say its been fun so far.....Oooof so many words dont want to be that other user who added 4200 words into it.....so will leave you to this that this pokemon series addresses a lot of deep themes on life for a kids anime like death (ep 21)Overall, I'll say this that I will try to finish SuMo rewatch before Galar arc for sure because it's just 12 days away now at the time I write this review and Bye Bye Alola you were awesome ( I know that its just I need to see the missed eps)Overall it's an 8.5/10 for me but here there's no 8.5/10 so the 0.5 is for Bewear who made chuckle EVERY DAMN TIME!THANKS AGAIN ALOLA!!! HOPE TO SEE SOME OF THESE CHARACTERS IN GALAR TOO IN SOME FORM! you go an adventure like you did for 6 regions?So many questions, then after I heard that Gladion, Nebby made entries into the anime, I kinda kept up with it due to previews of next eps however slice of life still wasnt my cup of tea.

Well that is the reason why pretty much most people got attracted to Pokemon GO and now it\'s dying. But seriously, I am not going to weep over the art style like the entire Internet. This is a legit non-salty review so give it all the hate you want.StoryOh, there is a story? Despite removing the gyms and making something more complicated like trials? Well that is a pretty stupid reason. There is little to no plot in this entire thing except fillers and more...random and stupid little things that no one literally cares about. This is a very cheeky strategy, to make their viewers watch a hell load of stuff and then fill them with hype for an ""epic battle"". (Since the very beginning, but atleast the old fillers were bearable and fun to watch)ArtI have nothing to say since you people are smart enough to figure it out. Remember how people were crying on Facebook and telling everyone to boycott Pokemon? Yeah, you should get an idea.SoundNothing to say here either. I guess the OP and ED is good for kids below 13 but there\'s literally nothing I can do if you like it because it is kiddish and all that. But trust me I am not judging anyone.CharacterAshCompletely dumped down to the very midst of nothingness. Well it was a stupid decision to send him to school and seeing his maturity get crushed is okay and all that but not at this level. Remember the ""fun"" we had watching Misty, May, Dawn and Iris fight with Ash? Yeah, it\'s nothing at that level.MallowInteresting character, For the least I would say she\'s okay and she knows what she is doing. Most people think that she likes ash and all that stuff so they have started shipping. (That reminds me Amourshipping is dead.)LillieMy favorite character due to various reasons. I thought she was a tsundere but bad luck fell upon me with the release of the game. It wasn\'t what I expected. She\'s related to a major plot point so I would avoid any further discussion about her.LanaSeriously too cute. I would say the second reason why I keep watching S&M but yeah, she\'s a kuudere I guess? Not sure what to say but she\'s the silent type. And she\'s flat..KiaweThe only character who has a serious attitude. He is cool and he knows the stuff he is doing so he was the first ""serious"" character I guess?EnjoymentIt has some funny moments but mostly the jokes are not that funny for an adult but it might be sufficient enough to make a kid laugh. (below 13)I seriously would have give the enjoyment a 1 rating but there were some parts that would appeal to the younger audience so I let it slide.ConclusionMaybe they are trying to oblige the new fans by showing them something new but seriously they never think once about their older audience and we are just overlooked because we turned old. (Just an empty assumption) Well whatever the case may be Reverse Psychology can be a real pain.If you\'re looking for nostalgia then you should probably wait for the 20th Movie because the animations look promising somewhat but I wouldn\'t pre-hype if I were you.Please think twice before reporting my review.

Not hate but my personal opinion.', ""Here's the thing with Sun and Moon. If you're going into this after watching XYZ, and expecting it to be similar in any way. Don't. This show isn't anything like that. And to be fair, it isn't TRYING to be anything like that.For this season (or region, or whatever), the show takes on a more slice of life style, and as a slice of life show, it is decent. You have some likeable characters, each with their own personalities, and they're all in a school. Why is Satoshi (Ash) in a school? IDK, but don't question it.Now, although the characters are decent to begin with,...after 146 episodes, you would expect them to like. Change. But that doesn't really happen as much as I would have liked. We do get some decent development through Lillie, and to be honest, this show would have been a lot more engaging if there was a more prominent overarching arc about her and her family. (Like seriously? There was so much being hinted at with her family, BUT it just doesn't end up being talked about). The other characters don't really get too much development, instead choosing to solve small problems that they have, but not too much else (I.e., one character is afraid of the dark so… his electric mouse lights up. Solid development I guess)The biggest change is clearly the animation, so I'll briefly touch on that. It's worse, but it's still alright. Satoshi's design is kind of annoying at first, but it's not really a big deal. In all honesty, it fits very well with the intended slice of life format, so it's not really something to hold against this show.The biggest problem for me is the actual story/plot. I know I'm saying that it's more slice of life, so like. This shouldn't be a problem. But it's really missing that little something that makes pokemon, pokemon. So we no longer have gym battles, and instead have the island challenges. What are these island challenges? That's kinda the problem. I DON'T REMEMBER. Nothing about this is memorable. I NEVER remembered how many of these challenges he had completed, or even what he did to get them. This is mostly my own fault for having a bad memory, but I really feel that it could have been done in a better way. Maybe the fact that the school setting is there throughout is part of the problem. I don't really know. (as in, the fact that the setting is the same for most of the series makes it easier to kind of mesh everything together and not remember as much as I would have liked to)(There's also another problem that I have with the story, but I won't go into it as it would involve too many spoilers)Overall, although there seems to be something lacking in this series, it does do a good job at what it's attempting to actually do. And don't get me wrong, there were many, many enjoyable moments throughout the series. If you go into this KNOWING that it will essentially be a slice of life, then this will definitely be a very good and enjoyable show, so if after reading this, you think you might be interested, then you should definitely watch it! The issue for me is that I didn't want this to be what it is, because I don't feel as though this is what pokemon SHOULD be. But don't let that stop you! (Unless you're like me, in which case, let it stop you. Although if you are like me, you'll be watching it anyways).See you all in Galar! after 146 episodes, you would expect them to like. Change.

Ash goes to new region to become pokemon master...basically it’s the same as every other season except it’s in a new region!! AKA the Aloha RegionNow one thing I will say is the animation, this was a hard one for me at first because I hated how Ash looked but my final conclusion, it’s Refreshing with new animations. A lot of people hate it. I hated it. But after staring at new design in shock for a few hours, I got used to it. And honestly...I like the new design for Ash.Apart from ash the new Region and characters is simply beautiful, the animation really does bring it to life and it’s deserves all the praise it gets, all the Pokemon look the part and it keeps you invested to see more of the region.Unfortunately the big down side to this anime is the plot, unfortunately for long stretches there is none and that’s a big problem in all of Pokemon not just this animeBUT! any episode with plot is always great to watch and the ending of this anime is one of the best endings to Pokemon I have ever seen and it’s one of the big reasons that got me so hooked to the series/games againMy final conclusion is this, if this is the new direction they are taking Pokemon I cannot wait to see how Pokemon (2019) or Pokemon journeys (however you want to say it) turns out. This series is defiantly worth a watch and it’s a great way to get back into the world of Pokemon I like the new design for Ash.Apart from ash the new Region and characters is simply beautiful, the animation really does bring it to life and it’s deserves all the praise it gets, all the Pokemon look the part and it keeps you invested to see more of the region.Unfortunately the big down side to this anime is the plot, unfortunately for long stretches there is none and that’s a big problem in all of Pokemon not just this animeBUT! any episode with plot is always great to watch and the ending of this anime is one of the best endings to Pokemon I have ever seen and it’s one of the big reasons that got me so hooked to the series/games againMy final conclusion is this, if this is the new direction they are taking Pokemon I cannot wait to see how Pokemon (2019) or Pokemon journeys (however you want to say it) turns out. This series is defiantly worth a watch and it’s a great way to get back into the world of Pokemon', '[SPOILERS]Wow, I did not expect this to make me nearly cry.Better yet, at the time, this was my first time watching the Pokémon anime since 2014.But, damn, is this show actually pretty fucking amazing. I’m surprised that this show- THIS show that was mocked by the community when it was announced... would become not only my favourite anime, but also win the hearts of many who previously despised it.Let’s cut the shit: This is no way the best anime I’ve seen. But, it is my favourite. (If you watch Schaffrillas Productions’ Best Animated Feature video, he says that The Incredibles is a better film than...Spirited Away, but the latter is his favourite.)The cons are as follows:- Inconsistent Pacing- Some characters don’t get enough time in the spotlight- Ash’s designPacing can honestly be a mixed bag. Sometimes, episodes can feel slow. Other times, they go too fast for your liking. Pacing does somewhat improve in the later episodes, but it can throw off your groove.Seriously, some characters get thrown under the bus. Other than Ash, Pikachu, Team Rocket, and Professor Kukui, the classmates I found to be well-developed were Mallow and Kiawe. I like Lillie, but she got way too much development with no goal in the end. Lana is just eh, and don’t get me started on Sophocles (he’s not that good...)Ash’s. Design. In. The. First. Half. Sucked. Although XYZ refined Ash’s appearance and honestly gave us his most impactful and memorable design (before Journeys), he looked kinda dumb and a bit of a goof. At least later on he looked way better and began to mesh well with the world more.NOW ITS PRO TIME:The animation IS AMAZING. OLM is honestly an underrated studio and should be respected more for their work. Sun and Moon did not hold back in the animation department. XYZ had 3-D Camera shit and CG backgrounds, but Sun and Moon said, “fuck that CG shit” and went mostly hand-drawn. There’s still some CG, but it’s not noticeable. The animation is smooth like butter and now, feels less stiff thanks to the art style change. Battles feel more lively and some ingenious camera work and character animation make it feel impactful. Even when the events are mundane, the animation still shows off the charm of life and breathes life into those scenes. Back to the battles, the final battle between Kukui and Ash offered THE single-best animated battle sequence in Pokémon’s 20-year history. But more on that later.The story is surprisingly fun despite the earlier pacing issues. Once you get down to it, it’s pretty good. But, once you understand the underlying context behind it, it gets real good. You see, for most of the time Ash and Pikachu are in a region, they don’t really take a good look at all the sights and sounds. However, since they’re forced on a specific island, this allows them to fully take in the wonderful region that is Alola. Compared to XY’s I GOTTA WIN story, SM’s approach is to slow down in life. It focuses on world-building rather than battling and it gives off a Ghibli vibe. It’s about the bond you share not only with your friend’s but with nature and the environment itself. You meet all these characters and, unlike previous seasons, they aren’t one-offs. They leave a profound impact on Ash and help him along his eventual journey and goal to travel the world. Once you realize you’re at the endgame... you realize that Ash will say goodbye to everyone, and you probably wouldn’t want that.Just like K-On told us that Graduation is not the end and Assassination Classroom told us to look towards the future, Pokemon Sun and Moon tell us that your family is closer than you think and will always stick by your side, even when you come back. This gives way to a finale that’ll rock you to the core and will likely make you shed a tear or two.The music is BANGING. FEATURING SOME GREAT AND CATCHY OPENING SONGS AND SOME GOOD BOPS IN THE CLOSING, YOU’L BE BOPPING YOUR HEAD ALONG TO THE TUNES. Not only that, the background score by Shinji Miyazaki is excellent and a great send-off to his 20-year stint with Pokémon. Some highlights include Hau’oli City and Lillie’s Theme.Then we get to Type:Wild and the Battle against Kukui. And OH MY IS THIS ONE OF THE GREATEST ANIME CLIMAXES. IM NOT CRAZY, YOU ARE.The League in general was great at tying up arcs and made everyone (even Sophocles) grow as a character. However, the battle against Kukui is not only a culmination of the entire 146-episode show, but the show’s entire story up until that point.Ash’s Pokémon get more highlights and give way to some great Arc conclusions for some, but the fight with Pikachu and Tapu Koko single-handedly may be one of the most impactful climaxes in anime.For 20 years, Ash tried to win a league, but failed. It wasn’t until he beat Karma- I mean Gladion to secure the bag. He is the champion now, but this moment solidified why he’s the greatest trainer in history. To win the league, he used his Lycanroc, but to solidify himself as the strongest, he used his day-one buddy, Pikachu. To defeat the giant Tapu Koko, they used the memories they made over their time in Alola as a stepping stone into their untapped power. They culminate everything they learnt from studying Alola to this single Z-Move in order to overpower a god. In a Studio Trigger-esque sequence with ambitious panning shots, flashy visuals, guitar shredding, and a large focus of coming together as one, you could tell that the impact Ash and Pikachu made in not only in Alola, but anime in general was undeniable. He did not need a divine intervention. He did not need some flashy transformation. All Ash really needed was friends who would stick by him and a partner that created an everlasting bond with him. And most importantly, all he needed was just some fun under the sun.And that’s what Sun and Moon is: a story about bonding with nature and people.It has episodic arcs, it’s flashy, it’s wholesome, it’s a show that’s willing to tell stories that break the boundaries of Pokemon, it’s... fun.Honestly, Assassination Classroom, Little Witch Academia, and K-On will be fighting over which one is better in my anime list, but it will never top the fun I had with Sun and Moon.And that’s why i fucking love this show.10/10 Spirited Away, but the latter is his favourite.)The cons are as follows:- Inconsistent Pacing- Some characters don’t get enough time in the spotlight- Ash’s designPacing can honestly be a mixed bag.

But, once you understand the underlying context behind it, it gets real good. You see, for most of the time Ash and Pikachu are in a region, they don’t really take a good look at all the sights and sounds. However, since they’re forced on a specific island, this allows them to fully take in the wonderful region that is Alola. Compared to XY’s I GOTTA WIN story, SM’s approach is to slow down in life. It focuses on world-building rather than battling and it gives off a Ghibli vibe. It’s about the bond you share not only with your friend’s but with nature and the environment itself. You meet all these characters and, unlike previous seasons, they aren’t one-offs. They leave a profound impact on Ash and help him along his eventual journey and goal to travel the world. Once you realize you’re at the endgame... you realize that Ash will say goodbye to everyone, and you probably wouldn’t want that.Just like K-On told us that Graduation is not the end and Assassination Classroom told us to look towards the future, Pokemon Sun and Moon tell us that your family is closer than you think and will always stick by your side, even when you come back. This gives way to a finale that’ll rock you to the core and will likely make you shed a tear or two.The music is BANGING. FEATURING SOME GREAT AND CATCHY OPENING SONGS AND SOME GOOD BOPS IN THE CLOSING, YOU’L BE BOPPING YOUR HEAD ALONG TO THE TUNES. Not only that, the background score by Shinji Miyazaki is excellent and a great send-off to his 20-year stint with Pokémon. Some highlights include Hau’oli City and Lillie’s Theme.Then we get to Type:Wild and the Battle against Kukui. And OH MY IS THIS ONE OF THE GREATEST ANIME CLIMAXES. IM NOT CRAZY, YOU ARE.The League in general was great at tying up arcs and made everyone (even Sophocles) grow as a character. However, the battle against Kukui is not only a culmination of the entire 146-episode show, but the show’s entire story up until that point.Ash’s Pokémon get more highlights and give way to some great Arc conclusions for some, but the fight with Pikachu and Tapu Koko single-handedly may be one of the most impactful climaxes in anime.For 20 years, Ash tried to win a league, but failed. It wasn’t until he beat Karma- I mean Gladion to secure the bag. He is the champion now, but this moment solidified why he’s the greatest trainer in history. To win the league, he used his Lycanroc, but to solidify himself as the strongest, he used his day-one buddy, Pikachu. To defeat the giant Tapu Koko, they used the memories they made over their time in Alola as a stepping stone into their untapped power. They culminate everything they learnt from studying Alola to this single Z-Move in order to overpower a god. In a Studio Trigger-esque sequence with ambitious panning shots, flashy visuals, guitar shredding, and a large focus of coming together as one, you could tell that the impact Ash and Pikachu made in not only in Alola, but anime in general was undeniable. He did not need a divine intervention. He did not need some flashy transformation. All Ash really needed was friends who would stick by him and a partner that created an everlasting bond with him. And most importantly, all he needed was just some fun under the sun.And that’s what Sun and Moon is: a story about bonding with nature and people.It has episodic arcs, it’s flashy, it’s wholesome, it’s a show that’s willing to tell stories that break the boundaries of Pokemon, it’s... fun.Honestly, Assassination Classroom, Little Witch Academia, and K-On will be fighting over which one is better in my anime list, but it will never top the fun I had with Sun and Moon.And that’s why i fucking love this show.10/10', ""In the Pokemon anime series, it’s common among the fans about the quality of each series that varies and changes from each other, where it’s lowering from the Indigo season to the Johns season, starting picking up a little with Advance, goes higher with DP, dropping low in BW and then going back high with XY. So when I started watching Sun and Moon (SM for short) it’s inventible to ask if it continued XY quality, or dropped it. The answer Is kinda surprising: it’s neither.To understand why I’m saying that, I will explain some introduction - Pokemon SM games were actually the first for...a long time in the Pokemon franchise that tried to do something new - making “new” format with the games. New format doesn’t mean there’s no Pokemon training but spinoff kinda thing, but taking the games in another way of presenting the old familiar adventure - not only the region structure, but the game drastically changes the adventure. Instead of going from town X to town Y, the player needs to go through varies a variety of challenges and trials scattered along the islands, and though of course it's about Pokemon and battling, they present another way of handling our beloved creatures in more challenging and interesting ways presented in the trials, in other words: there are no gyms here, only “final boss” in the name of Kahuna of the island. In the map area, there are no more towns but 4 islands where the player is gonna play a full play time on them. So when OLM went to adapt the games, it was inventible to make a new format for the anime as well - Ash once again reaches our new region Alola which contains once again new Pokemon, new friends, new challenges and etc , but as the game map isn’t big as mentioned, you can’t handle the same way of travelling in SM but creating “new” format for the games. The producers of the anime probably were sitting hours in their planning meeting to know how to handle the less adventure “feel” and the smaller map of Alola to create a long-run Pokemon anime, and then they reached a kinda silly conclusion - why don’t we send Ash back to school?Yeah, it’s just as you heard, now that the map isn’t big, and the same element of adventure can’t be done, there’s need to create a new format of Pokemon where Ash goes back and forth to the same place during the time he is supposed to train, catch, make new friends, and learn about the new generation of Pokemon. The only way they found how to make it works is getting him back to Pokemon school after he almost won the Galos league in XY, to learn about types, evolution and stuff that all of us know already from the age of 6 when we watched the Indigo season, and surely Ash does know already. Kinda ridiculous isn’t it?But is this ruining Pokemon? It’s actually not, Ash is still training and catching some Pokemon, aiming to be Pokemon master by winning the challenges, battling the Kahunas, and spending his time with his Pokemon of course (how can Pokemon be without that?). Obviously Ash makes new friends. In fact, the main cast in SM is the biggest yet, if ‘till now he traveled with groups of 3-4 people now he have 5 new friends to the main cast besides the recurring returning characters, so there’s lot of room for character development for each of them. So though there’s a new kind of format for Pokemon episodes - Ash maybe stays in the same place and doesn’t have much of “Pokemon adventure”, but he still does his Pokemon training and catching thingy like all Pokemon series. So, what wrong with SM?To explain it, I will start with what is good in SM - in fact, though the episodic format, SM have maybe more story arcs than most of Pokemon series, the first of them that features the legendaries Pokemon - Ultra Beasts in fact, was one of the best to my taste and made a really good impression, and there’s more of them, some of them maybe not in the level of the first one but still entertaining. Well, maybe except one which made me cringe so much. Ash still behaving as he should be after the XY series, though he kinda acts like he is in vacation from time to time, he still makes a good impression with creative training (literally) and variety of Pokemon that we haven’t seen him holding yet.The problem is maybe the common episodes in every Pokemon series - the “fillers” of the Pokemon anime were never really good, they always had some formula of the same pattern, some trainer and his Pokemon, annoying team rocket and stuff, unless there were good events in those episodes that developed the characters or the story they were always average. You would say - in SM it would be the same, average episodes and all. But no, SM taking a new level in “filler” episodes, making the most bizarre and strange stories about what’s not. even in the lousy Johto season there wasn’t that low level of stories. There’s truly here and there some golden ones, and even in the strangest episodes there was one good cute or funny moment, but those episodes was my no.1 cause to watch SM in very long times with lots of breaks, mostly due the feeling I’m wasting my time. And I won’t even start talking about the Power Rangers thingy they made, true that the some stories of the Ultra Beasts were good but the Power Rangers approach  was really annoying and pointless.Thing is, those low level quality episodes don’t come at any specific time like they usually do, they are scattered all over the place, between the story arcs and sometimes even created long run of those episodes without stopping. This situation made me think that the writers of SM were not the same for the whole series. Unlike previous Pokemon series, yeah even the bad ones, had consecutive level of writing, SM doesn’t seem to have this, there’s some really good high level stories here and there, some good story arcs, there’s the usual average episodes, and there’s some really low written episodes like each writer took turns to write his own episode.So the above question - is SM continuing the level of XY, or is it lowering it? Answer: neither, it  has some really high peaks in the story with good training and battle episodes and some good story arcs, but some stories and even one arc that makes you cringe, SM truly has more ups and downs than most of Pokemon series.But still, the good stories of SM are what is holding it so it won’t go down, whenever I  remember  the good character development and some arcs, and some of the battles that remind me of the XY battles, it makes me think good of SM. So though all the complaining, I still like SM story, though it's not one of my favourites for being inconsistent.Final note: about the Z-rings in SM, though I really appreciate how OLM has done them, but they had the annoying thing of clashing moves together from the first seasons, and instead of using the Z-moves in interesting ways we would except, they are only doing them for the thrilling blasting and stuff and not for the real purpose, making Z-moves feel like useless addition and not tactical and powerful attacks. Some of the Z-moves battles were okay though and the problem is starting only little later on in the series. Still, the Mega-Evolution in XY was much better used than Z- moves, while in the games Z-moves are supposed to be a better upgrade than Mega-Evolution.Story: 6/10As I mentioned, Ash definitely doesn’t change a lot in SM from XY, his design maybe returned to be childish and caricature, and sometimes acting as he is in vacation, but he still has lots of confidence and love for his Pokemon, training and raising them with love and care, and aiming of course to be the strongest and the best. Maybe he’s not the same kind of mentor he was in XY, but he didn’t dropped to BW lvl1 trainer. The only complain on Ash is the usual complain of being corny and cringe, in XY since he had some “mentor” rule that characteristic kinda disappeared, OLM made sure In SM that we will remember he still has that.Now, as I said, there’s a really big cast of characters, I will try to say the important stuff on the important characters, though there’s literally a lot, so I will mention only the regular ones.Prof. Kukui - it might sound surprising, but yeah. Prof. Kukui is not only the professor in SM but he is regular and main character here, his part in the series is not that big but he’s interesting enough to steal the show from time to time. What’s making Kukui special In SM more is the fact that he’s kinda serving as father-model to Ash, which is adding quite a lot to the anime. (Especially for the fact that he doesn’t have a shirt...)Lillie - Lillie is actually the only character in the anime that is actually based on her character from the game. The only difference is that they took her in some other way at the start of the series, at start it was a little strange but that direction actually made her character deeper than in the games, not only at the start of the series but also later on she has the most deep characteristic and the most development in SM, so I gotta give credit to OLM to how they handled her character, though I would love to see more closing to the game adaption than this (in terms of ideology), and maybe less annoying.Gladion - Must say about Gladion, he makes the show pretty damn good, at least when he’s showing up and acting as Ash’s rival in SM. He is definitely raising the series level when he’s there with his style. But his uniqueness in the series kinda fades away toward the end, really too bad but still one of the good characters here.With the follow characters, the anime took some of the anime characters from the trials and made them main characters, some of them were a hit-or-miss, some went pretty good. In the anime version they are acting as Ash’s classmates and friends to the region:Mallow - Kinda good character, she has good development but not much along the series, and though to be non-annoying she’s my least favourite due to her very little role in the development of the anime.Kiawe - Truly one of the annoying characters, but still better than the next one. Kiawe truly feels more like Ash’s rival in the series and still keeps being likeable unlike Ash’s previous rivals, he has development and golden moments here and there, but it felt as he had unused potential that turned into annoyance.Sophocles - Yeah this one was totally pointless, had a kind of development along the series, but his childish behaviour and goals just doesn’t make sense to me in the Pokemon world. I understand the need to adapt his character, but OLM really failed in this one.Lana -She’s actually my favourite character in SM, she had true goals, some good Pokemon battle scenes, good development, though not to be kinda deep as Lillie, she still was one of the best characters here.Oh and I can’t forget - Team Rocket, Jessie and James and Mewoth feel much less annoying in SM, and have some serious comedy upgrade that ‘till the end made me laugh with tears. They might still wants Pikachu, still want to annoy anyone, but they are doing a much better job on that in SM that makes their appearance being comparable to their BW appearance, though I still like their BW role more. The annoying thing about Team Rocket in SM is their motto being replaced, wish they hadn't done that. I understand OLM needs to renew things but that was really pointless and not catchy.Characters: 7/10The art at the start might be intimidating, it’s not clear at first if they wanted higher animation and art quality or making it more childish. The truth is, after a couple of episodes you start to get why they chose this “light” art, though to stand out on the other Pokemon series it’s great and engaging, and though Ash looks again child and Team Rocket designs look weird, it has the best art the Pokemon series can offer (‘till SM at least, didn’t watched Journeys yet).The animation get upgrade as well, there’s still some annoying reused frames, but some or even most of the battles are animated well enough to show how Pokemon anime adaption should be.The OST is still great (to Pokemon), and even surprising at times. The openings were weird though, I understand the need to fit the “Alola” theme and all, but they didn’t feel as a Pokemon opening, it’s not making them less good though.\u2028The voice cast was okay, except for Lillie’s English voice that was annoying (and maybe what made her annoying to me). Kinda weird at the start to hear Ash’s “mature” voice in his new design, but as I got used to the animation I got used to this as well.Art & Animation - 8/10OST & Voice cast: 7/10OverallSM is truly one of the good Pokemon series, it may have serious problems and have the most downhills and inconsistent story in the Pokemon long running series, but the good stories, the animation and the OST are making SM one of the good ones. For me at least it’s better than BW and Johto season, but it cannot be compared to XY/DP and even the Advance series where Ash is really developing, in SM he maybe still continues to get stronger as a trainer but he doesn’t develop much from when he was in XY and kinda feels stuck in a region of kids in school than taking challenges and forgetting his goal, even the Pokemon league wasn’t serious (in the term of league I mean, the battles were great). But after all, it’s Pokemon, and I’m fan of it and I enjoyed it, so who am I to complain? Those who love Pokemon have to watch SM, and even when strange and bizarre stories such as Power Rangers style gonna show up, true fans will stick to it ‘till the end where more good stuff are showing, it’s worth the effort of 146 episodes.Enjoyment: 6/10Overall: 7/10 a long time in the Pokemon franchise that tried to do something new - making “new” format with the games.

Then one day you realize that things will never change.Even with its best season, Pokemon XY, I was still reminded constantly of just how little substance there was in the plot. It could be summed down to, ""Bad things happen. Protagonist doesn\'t give up. The power of hope and love wins."" Basically, every typical shounen plot, ever. The repetitive formula became even worse when mixed with the slow-paced slice-of-life genre in Sun & Moon, a genre which doesn\'t...work for many people, myself included. Do note that I\'m not saying shounen anime in itself is bad; it just so happens to not be the kind of anime I could enjoy or tolerate any longer.Pokemon Sun & Moon sees our never-aging protagonist, Ash Ketchum, landing in yet another new region, Alola. He meets new friends and Pokemon, but this time, he\'s no longer pursuing his childhood dream of ""being the best that no one ever was,"" and instead chooses to settle for a more peaceful school life full of hijinks and quirky comedic antics. Basically the perfect plot for 7 year olds. So don\'t be mistaken - Pokemon is essentially a show for kids, now more than ever. In spite of its TWO episodes with more mature themes (which are still family-friendly parables designed to teach children about the meaning of death anyway), it\'s not really the ""darker and grittier"" kind of show some have exaggerated. It\'s Pokemon, a shounen show where the power of friendship triumphs over logic. Whereas the previous seasons had the excuse of being entertaining with its more fast-paced battle scenes, those moments are now few and far between, replaced by cutesy moments of Ash and his friends fooling around with whatever Pokemon they wish to market for the day. Basically your average filler episode of Pokemon filled up to 90% of the season.The characters are written decently enough, but I didn\'t watch Pokemon for some deeply complex characters; I watched it for the epic fight scenes that were once prevalent in XY. Decent and functional character writing just isn\'t good enough to cut it for my entertainment. Most of the characters are written in such a way as to teach about familial bonds and not giving up in the face of failure anyway; basically your average shounen moral lessons for 7 year olds. They are characters designed to educate children about the most generic and basic form of humanity, the kind that have been seen many times over in thousands of other shounen anime. Unless you\'re some Pokemon superfan, you\'d find yourself spending your time much better watching far more quality and original writing elsewhere. work for many people, myself included.

The cast is vibrant, full of personality.The show really shines when it tries to be serious; there's a whole episode dealing with death (which is something almost never talked in Pokémon) another one about family issues; and more recently, the episodes focusing on Lilly's trauma.As of episode 50, lots of things actually happened, and it was by far the most...shocking episode of the series, due to the way it ended. shocking episode of the series, due to the way it ended."", 'I told myself not to do this but I\'m going to do this anyways. When reading this, please keep in mind the following:I\'ve skipped around a lot with what episodes I watched. I did however watch all of the last 30ish episodes. All my current thoughts are directed towards the ending of the league and how I feel about it versus what happened/should have happened (imo) with XYZ and D/P.So due to that, obvious spoilers for D/P, XYZ, and Sun and Moon incoming.I\'m part of that group that really feels like the writing ruined Pokemon as a whole with not only the conclusion of XYZ...but also Diamond/Pearl. With D/P, we saw Ash at probably his best he has ever been at. He was proving to Paul over and over again how important love and care was to battling and his team was extremely well-balanced. Him losing that league was not a huge issue but some would argue it was. I\'m neutral about it; the big win was him overcoming Paul.In XYZ however, EVERYTHING pointed to Ash finally having everything he needed to win. The writing in this season pointed to Ash being calm and collected. It was obvious to anyone watching that he was on a bar much higher than anyone he was encountering leading up to the league. I will say that one fault he had was his over reliance on Greninja. It reminded me of the first season when Ash failed in the Pokemon League due to his over reliance of Charizard. However, it is not a completely apples to apples comparison since Greninja showed respect towards Ash while Charizard did not. Getting back on point, the writers gave clear indication that Ash was in the state of mind with the resources needed to win the league. Then out of left field, some dude with (at least) 3 legendary Pokemon wipes him out in the final. There is no poetic answer here; the writers decided to crap on all the character development Ash had leading up to this point. I would argue that there was 20 YEARS of character development leading up to this point.To add onto this, in this season, we saw arguably the most cannon relationship you\'ll see in Pokemon with Serena. The way they concluded their time together as well as the childhood friend plot point just hammers the notion that the show should have ended with them, at least in some way, showing that they\'ll stick together. In my opinion, what makes the most sense given the writing I\'ve seen, is that Ash should have won the league, finally finishing his quest. With that, he sticks with Serena as she continues on with hers becoming a full support role. Serena was there for Ash all this time, he would then do the same for her since his quest was finally over.Now moving onto the crux of all of this, Ash winning the Sun/Moon league. I had been loosely keeping up with the show, watching episodes here and there. I however for the past couple of weeks have been keeping up with the league episodes for Sun and Moon. Ash winning this league feels like a huge cop out. All of this character development is gone, he didn\'t even have a full team, and he is arguably at his worst battle sense wise in the series. I don\'t understand why the writers would give him this achievement now. The moment that makes the most sense is in XYZ and if not there, D/P.Let me take the time now to talk about the drastic change in visual style this show employed. Leading up to Sun and Moon, we had arguably the best comprise of animation versus artstyle in XYZ. The studio had achieved gorgeous and model accurate artwork while allowing the scenes that really need movement (the battle stuff) to have that fluidity. Yes the stuff outside of could and usually was pretty stiff. However, it was by no means hard to look at. It was a great comprise. With Sun and Moon, the studio decided to go into a bold and new direction. The artstyle was, in my opinion, downgraded to be more simple and expressive. This allowed the studio to go ""off model"" more often which speeds up the animation process. However, like with something such as Konosuba season 2, it is not to my liking because it can, in many instances, look like utter garbage. Yes it is expressive because that\'s one way to gain that effect; make the characters go over dramatic and really show their emotions. However, there needs to be a baseline that is present. Sun and Moon went too far into this new direction and it really hurts the brand in my opinion. The studio was working towards this drawn and cgi hybrid system for the past 10 or so years and it came to its apex in XYZ. With Sun and Moon going completely in a different direction, I cannot help but believe it was a silly mistake. If you like it, great. However it is an eye sore to watch.The VAs are annoying but that\'s because the show is targeted to kids. Kids love loud, in-your-face type stuff. I don\'t. When there is suitable emotion, I liked it.I\'m not going to say something silly like I\'m legit mad about this. I just find it so disappointing that all the pieces were there in the last series to have a seriously amazing conclusion to a +20 year journey. The state of mind was there, the team was there, the hardwork was there, and the (and I cannot believe I am saying this about Pokemon) romance element was there. It was all there in XYZ to give Ash the ending he deserved. Instead, we got this. It makes more sense to have had Ash win XYZ then act the exact same in Sun and Moon since, hey he just won the league time for a vacation. It seems like a pretty big dickslap to the fans. but also Diamond/Pearl. With D/P, we saw Ash at probably his best he has ever been at.

XY and XYZ were amazing and I was just so attached to it. Sun and Moon proved me wrong and showed something else I failed to see.The story is really good. I love how each episode is unique. Each episode shows the main focus of this anime: Alola. The region shines here and is just not  ""another"" setting. No, my friends. This anime puts the region up front. Alola and its culture were amazing in the games but here we get to see it even closer. Each episode shows a cool new facet of...it and it\'s a real living and breathing region. Plus it\'s fun. That describes the anime. Fun. Each episode is so much fun and brought a smile to my face! It\'s amazing the way it does it. There are no filler episodes because each serves a purpose to show Alola. Then there are the arcs. One time they went to another island, Akala and wow. Wow. It was amazing, the story was amazing and the visuals were amazing. One beautiful evolution with the sunset. I won\'t spoil but I almost shed tears on how beautiful that scene was. This Pokemon anime. story-wise it holds up and has its amazing moment. Just don\'t expect deep stuff and see the fun in it. It\'s worth it. 8/10Now the characters, a major pillar of the show. I\'ll say right off the bat they deserve nothing less than a 10/10. Let me explain. Ash is as great as always, he\'s a bit more energetic and is very childish. It took a while to get used to, as he was the opposite in XY. I admit I miss the XY days of Ash but this ain\'t half bad. Actually not bad at all. I still enjoy Ash and he\'s the still the awesome protagonist. Then it\'s the supporting characters and they rule. Mallow is the more energetic and lovable person or Kiawe who\'s the more calm but powerful dude. Kukui is awesome. Straight up awesome dude. This show has the best supporting cast ever. Each is amazing in their own right. 10/10SoundGreat music. The same ones you loved in the game are back and they give you the chills! Good stuff.OverallThis show surpassed my expectations. I really do love it and it\'s a nice chill anime that can lighten up even the saddest of days. It may not reach the heights of XY but in its own right, it\'s amazing.

I have seen almost all of the hundreds of episodes that have been released. Sometimes I loved it, sometimes I hated it.One thing about the Pokémon anime : we actually CAN\'T talk about it as a single show. Each ""cycle"" has its own art style, its own atmosphere, its own style of storytelling.Sometimes it\'s a hit, sometimes it\'s a miss. None of these shows are perfect but some of them are huge fails and some of them really are surprisingly good.What about Pokémon Sun&Moon, then? I\'ll be blunt : imo, it...is a HUGE fail in every way.STORYSatoshi decides to stay at the Pokémon School in Alola region because it seems fun. He meets some new friends, including Lillie who has a terribly sad background, which is unveiled across the first part of the anime.Just like the games, the story revolves around Lillie and her family, around the tragedies that they met in the past. That story is different from the game though.In the anime, Lillie got traumatized by a Pokemon when she was a kid and was never able to touch any of them again since then. After this, her brother Gladion left the house to train, while their mother runs her business, leaving her children aside.If that story is less tragic than the equivalent in the game, it is still really enjoyable to watch.Lillie\'s evolution is progressive and the mysteries around her story are good.So, what\'s wrong with the story of this show? Well, aside from Lillie and her family, the rest is empty. Almost each episode is a filler unrelated to the previous ones, and almost none of them actually bring something to the story or the characters.Also, as there is no Pokemon League and the Alola Tour is barely present, there is no actual story except for Lillie\'s past and the Ultra Beasts\' attacks. This is why most of the episodes are fillers : as long as they don\'t fit in any of those two stories, they are useless.Long story short, the story is good but the storytelling is terrible, because most of the episodes are pointless.ARTI\'ll be honest, I\'m from those who hate the new chara-design. There is just no denying that it is many steps backwards compared to XY. It\'s way less detailed than before, way less neat than before (there are countless drawing mistakes, like deformed bodies, dirty frame transitions and ugly motion blur).The worst thing is, Pokemon kept getting better and better when it comes to art style. It came from very far (the original Pokemon series was ugly, even back then!), but it kept getting better, UNTIL Sun&Moon. This show is the very first step backward that Pokémon took, regarding art style.That said, does it deserve all the hate it gets? I don\'t think so. Because it is still enjoyable to see, especially thanks to the light effects and the environments. But it is undeniably a flaw when compared to the previous shows.SOUNDPokemon has always been quite memorable when it comes to music. I love the openings, I don\'t really like the ending, and the OST is cool but not as memorable as before, imo.CHARACTERSExcept Lillie, all the other characters are barely developed and are pointless, at least for now. They\'re just here to fill in. Even Satoshi isn\'t very important to the story (which is hilarious, considering it\'s the MC).Most of those characters have very few episodes dedicated to them, and even those episodes don\'t teach us anything that really matter. Actually, the whole characters don\'t really matter as they don\'t have any story (thus, no progression towards any goal).Even Satoshi, who has ever had a goal, kind of stopped his progression. Some say it\'s because he is kind of on vacation... and I actually like that idea. In Pokémon SM, Satoshi takes a pause in his journey. It doesn\'t change the fact that he doesn\'t progress at all in this show though.ENJOYMENTPersonally, I really hate this show. After Pokemon XY which was serious and epic, we get one of the dumbest shows in japanimation EVER. There is a lot of brainless comedy, which is not even for kids : it\'s for babies, or retarded.No, I did NOT enjoy Satoshi jumping on an aquarium\'s glass. No, I did NOT enjoy the dozens of funny faces per episode. No, I did NOT enjoy ""Black Oak"" \'s Pokemon puns.That said, I really like the battles. The animation is not as good as before, but it is still quite good!Finally, there\'s the worst point: if the Pokemon anime has always been here to advertise the games, all the previous series didn\'t do ONLY that. Even BW, highly criticized, didn\'t do all its choices based on marketing.But Pokemon SM does. Almost EVERYTHING they do, it\'s for advertising. Want some examples? They bring back Brock and Misty in a few episodes. Story-wise, there\'s LITERALLY NO REASON. So why bring them back? Because the Let\'s Go games have been released.The same for everything: they keep throwing Z-moves in our face, like they\'re desperate to show what can be done in the SM games. For the sake of comparison: when they made Contests in the 3rd generation, the series version of the Contest barely had anything to do with the games version. Of course it introduced that new functionality, BUT the Contests in the series were their own thing. And they were developed. They weren\'t thrown to say ""look, you can do that in our games, please go buy them right noooow!"". The Contests were creative and the story of May (and Dawn later on) were developed.Honestly, the Pokemon SM anime is JUST an obvious advertizing showcase. Something even BW was not.OVERALLMany people consider Pokémon is ""for kids"" (meaning : ""not really clever""). Well, it\'s not always the case. Some of those shows are deep enough to be enjoyed even by adults, namely Pokemon DP and Pokemon XY. Even Pokemon AG can be fun for older people.Why\'s that? Because Pokemon can be watched as a SPORTS ANIME. Pokémon Battles and Pokemon Contests are some sort of sports after all, with the competitions and the training sessions.But Pokemon SM is definitely, with no doubt, stupid as hell. There is no competition to follow like in the previous show, there is very few story to learn, and it is plain stupid most of the time.Pokémon is not supposed to be dumb.

That kind of flare wasn't for me, and I found the show rather lackluster and a little disappointing, and I just didn't really care about the show anymore at that point.SM came along and blew my mind away. I got immersed in every aspect of the show! I haven't watch the dub (probably won't touch that at...all lol), but I highly recommend the sub! Especially if you're looking for something with a lot of energy and a sort-of Hoenn-vibe.STORY: 7-10I'm very in love with Alola & the places Satoshi goes. They haven't gone to many places yet outside of short visits, but I'm excited to see more of Satoshi traveling with his friends soon!ART: 10I'm not sure where the sudden hate for this art style came from. It's very, very amazing if you give it a chance. The move from the very age-old anime style is a huge leap in improvement! It looks very modern and like Ken Sugimori's art in his official works. I'd even compare it to the ORAS anime commercial, and I know of many people who wished for it to become a legitimate series due to how attractive the visuals in it were.Satoshi has never looked better. Pokemon has never looked better. It's a very beautiful show with smooth, fluid animations, and it makes me drool with how bright, fun, and full of energy the visuals lend to the show!It's also a very expressive art style! Especially or both the Pokemons & human characters. I can't keep track of how many original facial expressions & animation I saw.The animation is so fluid and smooth. There were a few times where I recognize some small flop in animation, but it's nothing that will destroy the experience.In addition, the rest of the visuals are gorgeous. Even though I wasn't very into BW/XYZ, I do recognize the gorgeous animations with the background art. SM still has all those things. Gorgeous Pokemon moves, background art, paneling, animations, and battles! The Z-Moves are executed with as much power and beauty in the animation as you'd expect.Sound: 10The sound was very good. In addition, I'm totally in love with the Japanese OP & ED songs!! (The English OP does not compare. At. All.)Character: 10Characters are fun and exciting! Satoshi seems so much more comfortable being himself. The way he's animated really allows him to be the fun, dorky kid with so much energy and love for Pokemon, and I feel like that really bounces off the screen & towards the audience to immerse them into the show.SM has so much character. It's very expressive and energetic, and I love the entirely sincere tone with it's excitement and sunny atmosphere. When there's a tone or emotion being expressed in the show, it expresses it with full force & doesn't skip a beat. I haven't had this much fun since the Sinnoh season! all lol), but I highly recommend the sub!

I haven't had this much fun since the Sinnoh season!"", ""I've been going around in mental circles for a while, trying to figure out how I wanted to do this review... Because the thing is... This IS a good season. It was just-- by a wide margin-- not my favorite season.There were a lot of things it did well that just weren't for me. But I kind of knew that would be true as soon as I saw the trailers for it when it first came out all those years ago. Everyone kept telling me I would get used to the art style. I still hate it. It looks fine on all the new...characters, but it looks awful on Ash and Team Rocket and all the old faces. And that may sound like a really insignificant, don't-judge-a-book-by-its-cover sort of complaint, but the art style can say a lot about a show. Especially when it's changing from season to season like Pokémon does. Sun and Moon's designs were a little goofier. In line with the season as a whole being a lot more lighthearted. And that's fine for a kids' show, and it could be perfectly enjoyable at times...(I liked all the characters. In fact, as a whole, I think this season has the most likable cast of characters of any Pokémon season I've watched. And the final episode was really heartfelt. Watching Kukui and Burnet hug him goodbye actually made me tear up a bit. Ash's mom has had some good moments over the years, but we've never really gotten to see Ash have a real family dynamic with anyone, and that aspect of it here was really great.)But Pokémon really hit its current peak with XY&Z for me. I loved that it got a little more serious. Anything toned down from that was going to be lesser in my eyes. Just a matter of preferences, I guess.Storywise, it was just weaker overall in my eyes. It really brought me back to the early seasons of Pokémon, where we went so long in between gym battles that it barely felt like there was a story at all. The island trial episodes were cool... but they really didn't feel like they held any significance over anything, especially because you didn't even end up needing ANY sort of qualifications to enter the region's first Pokémon League.The Ultra Guardians aspect of the story... watching  these kids form their own sort of pseudo-Power Rangers team was cool. (I love me a good magical girl-esque transformation sequence.) But suffered from the same problem. Everything just felt so disjointed here. The Ultra Beasts could show up on a whim... whenever the writers ran through enough of their other episode ideas, I guess. They posed enough of an actual threat to the region that I feel like the kids could have at least been looking for some way to keep the portal closed... I just really needed an overarching story for this season, and never quite found it. Like, once we got into the story with Lillie's family and amnesia in season one, things got really good for a while. Gave me hope. And then it all kind of just fell apart again.But ultimately... all the real complaints I have about this season... come down to me starting to believe that the writers and I must have very different opinions on what makes up the fundamentals of Ash as a character. Yes, he's easily excitable and has this unrivaled love for all things Pokémon... but I just can't see him ever being happy settling down in a place like Alola to go to school. Not even with great friends. Not even if the school offers new Pokémon-related experiences each class. It's just... not Ash. It felt too stagnant for him. I can't see the extremely spaced-out island trials scratching his competitive itch. At least when he's on the road, it feels like he's actively working towards the next challenge.I guess it's fitting but... This whole 'journey' through Alola feels like a vacation for Ash. In general, it's just not the place for him. Everything's just a little TOO laid-back. As a whole, it didn't really feel like a region for a serious battler like Ash. And in general, it feels like the writers handicapped his battling skills a bit, especially as the series went on. Like, yes, Ash is known for being the guy who can get out of a tight spot with sheer willpower and crazy ideas...  but sometimes it feels like the writers forget that he IS capable of actual type-based strategizing too.There are a few exceptions throughout. Gladion and Kukui...(Hau could have been an example, but we barely see him.)  Kiawe takes it seriously, and Lana also had a competitive edge, though the series (unfortunately) never seemed to take her as seriously as Ash and Kiawe. I don't think there's any better example than the few episodes where the class visits Kanto and Ash gets to really shine-- back in his element-- sparring with the gym leaders of old... while it quickly became clear that his new friends had really only understood battling in theory up to this point. Hell, Mallow doesn't have her moment where she realizes she shouldn't ever just give up mid-battle until the MIDDLE OF HER POKEMON LEAGUE MATCH... That whole League was a joke and actually really annoyed me, but... Deep breaths.Anyway. Sun and Moon was fun and cute and lighthearted and I DID enjoy a lot of it. I mean, Rowlet's the most adorable thing this franchise has ever created, so I have to give it points for that. It's just... not what I want Pokémon to be. We got to see it at its best in Kalos, and a story like this one just couldn't live up to my expectations after that. I know practically nothing about the next region... (I've literally only seen the starters and this sheep Pokémon and that's it.) But I'm hoping it picks back up again with the next season, and we get to see more of Ash as he was meant to be. characters, but it looks awful on Ash and Team Rocket and all the old faces.

Why did I use ""fresh"" to describe Sun and Moon? First, Sun and Moon completely removed the default concept of Ash\'s Traveling routine all throughout the past 6 Generations. Second, the supporting characters around Ash give the anime a new fresh feel, apart from the stereotypical feel that the past generations gave. Third, the new concept of Pokemon competition, where Gyms are removed and Trials are introduced, along with the concept of Z-Moves, all refurbished not only the anime, but the game too. Lastly, the ART, which triggered a lot of people, actually gave room for better facial reactions,...conveyed better emotions, and overall made the anime a lot more fun in conjunction with the jokes utilized in Sun and Moon. In summary, this season focuses more on the substance of Pokemon Sun and Moon anime instead rather than the animation. If Pokemon XY&Z raised the bar on battle animations, Pokemon Sun and Moon will raise the content standards. conveyed better emotions, and overall made the anime a lot more fun in conjunction with the jokes utilized in Sun and Moon.

Not only that but the art style changed drastically.At the current moment (ep 34) we\'re not in the main story yet but we have quite a few characters introduced that seem important to the plot, mainly Gladion.The art style, altough different, personally got quite better, it fits the overall theme of S&M way more than the static art style from the earlier seasons and it allows the characters to express...themselves a lot more, which is important, as S&M added a lot of slapstick comedy.Currently we have 2 openings and 1 ending, which are all above average and the OST mostly consists of game remixes and quite a few older soundtracks from X&Y. (as far I know)The characters improved a lot as well. All the main characters get at least 1 or 2 episodes just for them and at the current state (ep34) we got a good amount of character development for a pokemon anime.I only speak for myself but I enjoy S&M way more than any other season of pokemon but thats mostly me being a sucker for slice of life, not really liking the older art styles and 0815 adventure ""hey lets get 8 badges"" seasons.Overall Sun and Moon is by far the easiest to enjoy season and has the most depth out of any pokemon show, as it doesnt hesitate to tackle more adult problems like dealing with the death of a loved one and the grieving that comes with it. themselves a lot more, which is important, as S&M added a lot of slapstick comedy.Currently we have 2 openings and 1 ending, which are all above average and the OST mostly consists of game remixes and quite a few older soundtracks from X&Y.

I personally believe that this show isn\'t given enough credit and that honestly bums me out. I\'m gonna try to break it down nice and simple, to give you my thoughts of why I think this anime is actually quite good, and deserves a lot more praise. I put very little spoilers in here as I possibly could, so if you dont want ANY whatsoever. I suggest not to read.Story - Honestly. It is so refreshing to see that Sun &...Moon isn\'t the standard ""copy & paste"", linear story that a lot of the past ones were. Sun & Moon tries something different that we haven\'t really seen before in the past Pokemon anime.Satoshi (Ash) arrives in the Alola region with his mom to deliver a Pokemon egg to Prof. Oak\'s cousin, Samson. During the one day that Satoshi was there, he of course had a great time that lead him to the decision that he wanted to stay and adventure the Alolan  region. Now, at this point if you played the games, you would assume that Satoshi would go to each island right away to challenge all of the trails. Instead of doing that immediately,  he is introduced as a new classmate in the Pokemon school, where he makes new friends that were actually challengers in the game. Already off the bat, this feels really weird and different. As time goes on, Satoshi goes on adventures with his new friends and classmates, and also does the island challenges when the opportunity arises. Something that is  also new is that Satoshi and his friends become ""Ultra Guardians"". This in my opinion is kind of cringe and not that enjoyed for the most part. They basically go and fight any ultra beasts that come into the world through the portals, capture them, and send them back to where they came from. The way that they go about it, sending them off with their catch phrases and such, to me is pretty weird and not in a good way. Not that I hate it, but I personally could go without it. I do however like some of the episodes, and I love that they all have their own ride Pokemon, based on their personalities (or preferences). All in all, without going into too much more detail, I am seriously enjoying and having fun with this new story. Its really fresh and its a different approach from how all the other anime is. Go battle gyms, fight the league. Sure in the sense of this, it will end up that way as well. But there is no gyms, and as of right now in the current story, there is no league. But the professor is working on creating  it. A lot of people don\'t like this and honestly I can understand why, but to me, as someone that used to watch the Pokemon anime and just got so bored of it since it was always the same thing, Sun & Moon got me back into it. I feel like I can actually sit and enjoy almost every episode and be amazed by it.Art - Ok so, the art is probably also the biggest thing that people HATE. I get it. It\'s very different. It does seem that the quality has gone down in some aspects. I can admit that for sure. Although, I think why it seems that way, is just through the approach that they did. It looks more cartoon-y and does look like the same anime style it once had. Although, I love it. The animation is well done, and the character design has stayed true. Based on each characters personality, they animate them correctly with the ways that they walk, act, talk, etc. Personally I think it looks pretty good, and as i keep saying over and over again. Refreshing. X & Y they had great animation and art style, but it was the same old style that they\'ve always had, just updated.Sound - Wow. So the music in this show has been FANTASTIC so far. Most OP\'s and ED\'s have been amazing. Voice acting is very good and to a T. There isnt too much that I can think of that I can write more than that.Character - The anime has stayed true to how the characters are in the game, and I think for the most part, the directors have usually done a good job with that. They haven\'t butchered any of the characters, and have done their best to flesh them out in the anime. I love how they all are. Honestly in the game, I didn\'t care for them at all. Besides Lily. The anime has honestly made me love each of them, and makes me always want to watch to see how they grow as trainers, and see what they do next!Enjoyment - I have not been able to enjoy a pokemon anime in such a long time. X & Y was good. Also X Y & Z. That I didnt really have much problems with, it was really good! Although I didn\'t really care about it that much. However, Sun & Moon has honestly restored that fun for me. Everytime I watch an episode, I can seriously sit there and enjoy whatever the characters are doing, and seeing how Satoshi progresses in the Alolan region. I have recommended the show to a couple of my friends that like Pokemon, and they\'re having a great time watching it, and even they haven\'t enjoyed a Pokemon anime in a long time. I seriously think that Sun and Moon is perfect to sit down and relax to. It also has its time where it gets you really hyped up, and wanting to know whats next.Overall I seriously love Sun and Moon. Is it perfect? Definitely not. Is it different? For sure. Does that make it bad? No. I seriously think people don\'t like change, but sometimes, its good. There are some things that, like I said, I dont like about the show. But that hasn\'t stopped me in the slightest from giving the show a chance and see where it went. It\'s been a great adventure so far and I cant wait to see where it goes. I think people just really need to give it the chance that it deserves, and try to enjoy something that\'s a bit different.

It is more sit-com type of show with less intense scenes. There are still fights but it feels different.Story: The story of Sun & Moon isn't bad. It is just different. The story is still good because an episode can lead onto another episode but it doesn't feel as intense as earlier gens. It is just kind of boring and predictable.Art: The one time I finally get to use the art column lol. The art in this anime is so much worse and Ash looks terrible and everything is just screwed up...and I would give it a 1-2 if it wasn't for Tajiri saying he only changed the art because he could focus more on the intense fights and I definitely understand but the art is still very bad knowing that.Sound: I have no idea what to put here. intros in english and japanese are decent to good and thunderbolt has a good sound. The fights have good sounds this is a hard one to answer.Character: The characters in Pokemon Sun & Moon are incredible and in my opinion the best of any Pokemon series. there, I said it. They have good backstories, unique personalities, likeable traits it is all you could ever want. Take Gladion for example, (My Favourite Character) He is mostly mean, but stays mostly calm and can be nice some of the time. He had great development. And a good rival to Ash. Overall Sun & Moon has almost perfect characters.Enjoyment: I enjoyed Sun & Moon most of the time even when repetitive and boring. The sitcom style was hard to get used to but I did eventually. I enjoyed Sun and Moon.Overall:Overall Sun & Moon is very different and in my opinion a little more for kids than other Pokemon series. That aside the fights were incredible and next to XY&Z for me in fighting aspect.That will be all for my review. I hope you understand Sun & Moon better after reading this. and I would give it a 1-2 if it wasn't for Tajiri saying he only changed the art because he could focus more on the intense fights and I definitely understand but the art is still very bad knowing that.Sound: I have no idea what to put here. intros in english and japanese are decent to good and thunderbolt has a good sound. The fights have good sounds this is a hard one to answer.Character: The characters in Pokemon Sun & Moon are incredible and in my opinion the best of any Pokemon series. there, I said it. They have good backstories, unique personalities, likeable traits it is all you could ever want. Take Gladion for example, (My Favourite Character) He is mostly mean, but stays mostly calm and can be nice some of the time. He had great development. And a good rival to Ash. Overall Sun & Moon has almost perfect characters.Enjoyment: I enjoyed Sun & Moon most of the time even when repetitive and boring. The sitcom style was hard to get used to but I did eventually. I enjoyed Sun and Moon.Overall:Overall Sun & Moon is very different and in my opinion a little more for kids than other Pokemon series. That aside the fights were incredible and next to XY&Z for me in fighting aspect.That will be all for my review. I hope you understand Sun & Moon better after reading this."", ""If I am being honest, the show is actually pretty good. However I would prefer to start with the animation, a slightly over discussed topic I know.The animation can be looked passed, although Ash's style is a bit more childish, it isn't all that bad. It can be looked past once you get in to the series a bit more, I don't like some of the faces Ash makes though, a few of them are gross in my opinion. However the Pokemon look great, and the 3d effects they seem to have added into the battles look really nice. The lines are a little soft...however, they should be a little more rough in some areas, they have a lack of strait and hard lines, and everything seems a little soft on some of the characters. Ash's cheek marks and eyebrows seem a bit soft, along with the eyes and hair, this is a problem on many old characters which seem out of place with these changes, I mean James honestly looks worse than Ash in some situations. Again you can get used to these changes.I would not consider this the kind of anime that is a action adventure anime, its more of a slice of life at this point. And along with that, there is a bit of character development. Ash begins to seem more in place, and Sophocles and Ash become better friends, as well as Lillie being able to touch the Pokemon egg, Ash however, seems a bit immature, he seems to be more of a school boy than the amazing trainer he truly is, he should be a little more mature, and independent, but that is my only problem there. Hopefully as we get further in he will begin to get closer to his Pokemon.Not really much to complain about here, Lillie's voice gets a tad annoying when she gets fired up or battles, but other than that I don't see a problem. however, they should be a little more rough in some areas, they have a lack of strait and hard lines, and everything seems a little soft on some of the characters.

It's just a group of friends doing lots of different activities, and there's also pokemons in it.If you're wondering if there's any actual goal in this anime, the answer is that there is! Surprisingly!But the show barely has...any episodes related to it, so it's more of a side plot than anything else. Kinda disappointing.ARTI'll be honest and say that I honestly dislike how ash looks and this just feels like an entirely different timeline than the rest of the pokemon animes.The style here is much more simple and flat, VERY similar to the styles used in cartoons.The animations and special effects are pretty good though, for the pokemon fights. Which really shows how much they've improved so far in the special effects department.SOUNDNot much to say here. The sound effects are ok, the music is ok, the opening is good...I do dislike ash and a few other characters voices.

I think if people gave this a solid chance they’d realize it has a lot to offer.Let’s get the elephant in the room out of the way first. Yes, the animation quality took a hit. The animation is kind of underwhelming and choppy at many points. It’s probably the hardest part of this new generation to get over. But there is another angle to it, being that this is the first time the show hasn’t looked like a generic shonen and it feels like it has an actual identity of its own...now.Ash’s personality has been reworked in this generation like it has in every other generation. But honestly this is one of my favorite Ash personalities. This is the first time he’s behaved like an actual ten year old since the Indigo League but unlike then he has retained his competence from the Kalos League. This creates a real great balance to his character where back in Kanto Ash was massively incompetent and only won through flukes which made the series borderline unwatchable at times. But here he can capture the childlike naivety and wonder while not being a constant fuck up. If you want to see what I mean, check out Episode 10 for his competence and Episode 22 for his childlike behavior. You shouldn’t worry about spoiling anything for yourself, if you are even remotely familiar with the franchise then you should know how everything plays out.Then there’s the Pokemon School element to the show. Now when I learned about this I was convinced I would HATE this. But actually it has given some variety to the previously tired formula. See instead of tracing the footsteps of the generation’s respective game Ash instead attends a “Pokemon School” that he goes to daily to receive lectures from Professor Kukui or Professor Oak’s cousin. If you played Sun and Moon you’d already know Alola is a small place so the usual “Go on a journey” thing wasn’t going to work anyway. Instead they use the school as Ash’s sort of central hub for his adventures and whenever he thinks he’s ready he will attempt a trial.Most episodes have him hanging out with one of his friends who in the game are some of the trial captains but in the show are his classmates. I thought I’d hate them too by the way but each of them has real personality far beyond the one note personalities of all his previous companions making each of them endearing. This is made all the more amazing by the number of them. Usually when a show has a large cast all the characters feel malnourished since the writers ave to divide up attention but here they feel wholesome and amusing. This makes me think very poorly of whoever was writing the show before now because now I realize just how little effort they had been putting into Ash’s companions before this generation.There’s a lot more humor involved in this generation which I’m not entirely opposed to. The previous generations had jokes in them but they were usually all just recurring gags that got beaten to death early in the series. There is no shortage of lame recurring gags here either but they are balanced out with REAL jokes this time which I appreciate.Lastly I want to mention Team Rocket’s role in all of this. In previous generations they would harass Ash in every damn episode like fucking Swiper the Fox but this time around they usually only have a brief “meanwhile” sequence that shows us what they’re up to. I LOVE this. Since now when they actually do come to mess with Ash it actually feels special. I can not praise this choice enough. I love Jessie and James but they were downright mundane until now. Also they caught some really devastating Pokemon this time around. Jessie’s Mimikyu is a psychopath and is borderline unstoppable. It kicks Pikachu’s ass regularly, James’ Mareanie is nothing to sneeze at either.Overall I think this is extremely underrated and if you were turned off by the animation I strongly urge you to give it another chance and see what it has to offer. now.Ash’s personality has been reworked in this generation like it has in every other generation.

Of course, its prequel left me disappointed. But then again I decided to give it a chance and I never regretted, first episode is hilarious, so I kept coming back for more.Now, the anime has over 20 episodes and it kind of broke the typical storyline where Ash will lose his first battle against a gym leader or in this case the Kahuna. Strangely enough, this doesn't follow how the game went, seeing Satoshi's classmates are supposed to be the captains of the second island....So I am curious how the story will go.It broke many traditional ways of the Pokemon where Team Rocket will always be defeated and such, there's this episode where you will need a tons of tissue because you will cry a lot.The art style of this anime has really changed but I didn't mind because it is actually hilarious for me to watch even for that overreacting faces they make.I hope for the haters out there will try watching the first episode and stop hating the art style. Because you will get to see why they did that.

Because you will get to see why they did that."", 'Sun & Moon is a stark break away from the previous XYZ season, and it\'s definitely a welcome change. With the new animation technology this season, Ash is more involved than ever in each episode plot and daily adventures of his pokemon. His character animation is lively and rarely has any repeated animation (looking at you XYZ pokeball throwing Ash you can literally line them all up side by side for each battle and there\'s about a total of like 3 different throws) and he does more than just standing like a cardboard cutout and talk. And I personally enjoy the comedy aspect of it;...yes, it\'s cheesy, but it\'s endearing and there are honestly some tear-jerking and heartwarming moments in the series (check out episode 21 for the waterworks). And contrary to what his character design might tell you he is still capable and if not more capable than his previous versions of handling mature issues well, tackling issues like pokemon death and familial tension respectfully and actually reflecting his character as someone who loves pokemon (some previous seasons have some trouble keeping that continuity until he runs into a situation where it\'s needed and then it\'s like a switch). And I REALLY liked that Ash was actually aware of his past for once! He doesn\'t dwell on it but when it becomes relevant and he references a moment from previous seasons it makes me happy to know that his writers were kind enough to not press the reset button on him. The story is a lot more varied than the lineal ""well time to go to every gym I guess just like the games do"" and since its main setting is the school the story gets to branch off into learning more about the Alola region that we wouldn\'t find if we played the games. I like this a lot because I feel that if you\'re going to adapt a product related to the games it should have things that separate it from its original and introduce more elements to give it a sense of originality.   So all in all, if you couldn\'t tell already, I am enjoying this season thoroughly and I ask that you look through the bullshit of ""ash looks retarded and this series is childish go back to XYZ"" criticism and give this season a try. yes, it\'s cheesy, but it\'s endearing and there are honestly some tear-jerking and heartwarming moments in the series (check out episode 21 for the waterworks).

You\'ll probably find a lot of faults with this series and may come to hate the anime if you\'ve kept up with the series through the Kalos region.This review will be based on the point of view of...a fan of the series from day one (of games and anime). This review will also try to be as spoiler-free as possible, but there might be some minor spoilers so keep that in mind.Ash has finished another journey from the Kalos region and decided to hop on a plane with his mom to take a vacation in the Alola region. Ash then finds the Alola region interesting and wants to stay thus starting up the premise of the entire anime.Story: 3/10My main gripe with the story is the fact it basically disregards man relationships between Ash and his peers. The Pokemon series has always been about the camaraderie between the characters and how they bond throughout their journey (eg.: Ash, Misty & Brock the iconic trio, or Ash, Dawn, & Brock from Diamond and Pearl). The Pokemon series has also been about the friendship Ash develops with his Pokemon (e.g: Ash & Butterfree, Ash & Chimchar, Ash & Froakie). However, Sun & Moon as an anime completely disregards the building of the friendship between both humans and Pokemon. Yes, there are some episodes focused on the characters and their backgrounds, however, I feel like there are too many ""main"" characters that the writers cannot find the balance of developing the relationship with Ash & his ""friends"". For example, his relationship with Lillie (*minor spoiler warnings*). Lillie is a girl who was introduced in the main series of video games and put into the anime. Her storyline is just as important as it is in the video games, however, is extremely underdeveloped. Her relationship with Ash is also not developed so when Ash does his ""Ash"" thing of saving everyone and the world, it doesn\'t feel as impactful as it does like in Pokemon X, Y (&Z). It really disappointed me that arc because there was so much to explore with Lillie like how they did with Bonnie in X, Y (&Z) but they cut the arc short and it was extremely forced.Another gripe of why I rate the story so low is the disregard of Ash\'s dream of becoming a Pokemon Master. The definition of a Pokemon Master has never been explicitly stated, but one way to see as achieving this goal is to win battles by defeating Gym Leaders & winning the Pokemon League of the area. However, this is thrown out of the window in this series making many non-Pokemon fans very happy that they changed it up. But as someone who has enjoyed this anime to see how Ash travels throughout the regions, I personally hate it. Ash\'s journey is stagnated on Mele Mele island and it\'s rare to see him travel to the other islands. The thought of traveling and exploring the world (even though it was the same basic plot throughout Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos) it was interesting. Adventuring through a new region is new and exciting because it\'s always about the journey and the things that happen in them. Staying on one island, however, is not interesting (and sometimes creates snooze-fested episodes, because I think (from watching and playing all the games) a Pokemon Master is established as Pokemon Master because of their travels of exploring and meeting new Pokemon and people. Ash doesn\'t travel and explore the other islands, he doesn\'t camp out anymore in the forest or in-between cities, he just stays in his nice cushy home at Professor Kukui.Art: 3/10Oh my, if I could say the things I wanted to say about the art styling of Pokemon Sun & Moon (S&M), I\'d probably be hated by the majority of the consensus of the non-pokemon fanbase of S&M. Many people enjoy the artistic choices Sun & Moon make from having the characters draw in certain ways to portray emotions, and sometimes playing off of drawing styles of different Animes. However, as a Pokemon fan, it disgusts me. Why? Because Pokemon has had its definite style of Art set from the moment that it came out as an Anime back in the late 1990\'s. The anime has changed a bit in style in terms of having better fighting scenes between Pokemon during a battle, but this is completely disregarded in S&M. This was really quite disturbing for me because I saw nothing wrong with the art styling, and no matter what season of the Pokemon series you saw a picture of, whether it\'s the original series or Pokemon Diamond & Pearl, you knew it was a Pokemon series. However, when Pokemon decided to take the drawing styles of different animes to incorporate it into Pokemon, they lost what made Pokemon, Pokemon by it\'s drawing style.Also, all battle scenes in S&M are rated 1/10 for me because every time a (insert pokemon) battles (insert another pokemon) with an attack, whether it\'s a water vs a water attack, or an electric vs fire attack, it results in an explosion. This personally as a fan of Pokemon battles ticks me off the most. I watch the anime to see how an actual move would look like when put up against another move, not to see explosions happen 24/7 when it shouldn\'t be happening (e.g: water vs water move).Sound: 8/10It has the classic Pokemon tunes that also draw in from previous seasons. The openings about being a Pokemon Master & songs about the mysteries of Pokemon. It\'s not overly spectacular but it\'s still that classic Pokemon style of music.Character: 3/10I know Ash every time he goes to another region has to disregard everything he\'s learned in the previous region. The only time Ash has somewhat remembered what he learned from the previous region is when he traveled to the Johto (Johto because it was connected to Kanto) & Kalos (actually retained some brain cells and a sense of battling skills). However, in Alola, the same thing happens again, although it is quite heavily implied the relationship between Kanto & Alola is strong. Ash in this series disregards everything he learned in Kalos and has actually become less intelligent as a character and I never thought it was possible. His understanding went from a pre-teen (10/11/12 yr old)  to almost a 7/8-year old. It is childish his understanding of thinking from what you see normally in the Pokemon series regarding his battling style. Maybe I was spoiled in X, Y (Z) by his diverse usage of Pokemon throughout the season like his rotation between Pikachu, Froakie (and it\'s evolved forms), Hawlucha, Fletchling (and it\'s evolved forms). However, in S&M, Ash rarely uses his other Pokemon in battle, only focusing on Pikachu. This gravely disappointed me because it\'s not like Rowlett, Litten & Rockruff are terrible battlers as Pokemon but he just uses Pikachu, and only uses the others when battling a (insert important person).The other reason why I rate the characters as a 3/10 is that of Team Rocket. Over the years Team Rocket has turned into comedic relief in the series. But, since this anime has turned one of its main focuses of the genre into comedy, Team Rocket is just tossed to the side. I\'m not a huge fan of Team Rocket but the regards to them as comedic relief & as villains are rather pathetic. Team Rocket in previous season has had some rather successful attempts as villains which were nice to see, however, nothing has succeeded for Team Rocket even though some of it should have. Another reason Team Rocket is a pretty poorly written is that of Bewear. I understand that Team Rocket could never ""blast off"" because of the ratings of keeping it as a kid show and it implies the ""death"" of them, but to have Bewear stop them every time? After the first time, it was not funny. It was just irritating. Bewear as a character is written horribly and instead of focusing on trying to catch Team Rocket before they blast off, write about how it doesn\'t stop them while they\'re building a machine or something.Enjoyment: 8/10I\'m Pokemon trash, so matter how much this anime is a disappointment compared to the other seasons, I\'m still going to watch it. I\'d watch Pokemon even if it was drawn in stick figures and probably enjoy it as well. Pokemon is something childhood me loves and it still stuck with me throughout my entire life (Pokemon game came out the year I was born so I\'ve been a fan ever since it\'s creation).Overall: 6/10.As a long-time Pokemon fan that was hoping to see something good, especially because in X, Y (&Z) Pokemon fans were spoiled with good storylines, good development of characters and great battles. I\'m (always) caught up with this anime, and everything compared to it just pales in comparison of what a Pokemon series should be.If you\'re a fan of just anime in general and have not stayed with this series, you\'ll probably enjoy it because ""it breaks the stereotypes""  of what a Pokemon anime ""should be like"". If you enjoy seeing references to other animes in terms of art-styling, you\'ll enjoy this. If you have been a long time fan (and someone who was expecting something along the lines of what they saw in the Kalos region) you\'ll definitely be extremely disappointed in terms of storyline, characters, and art. a fan of the series from day one (of games and anime).

His understanding went from a pre-teen (10/11/12 yr old)  to almost a 7/8-year old. It is childish his understanding of thinking from what you see normally in the Pokemon series regarding his battling style. Maybe I was spoiled in X, Y (Z) by his diverse usage of Pokemon throughout the season like his rotation between Pikachu, Froakie (and it\'s evolved forms), Hawlucha, Fletchling (and it\'s evolved forms). However, in S&M, Ash rarely uses his other Pokemon in battle, only focusing on Pikachu. This gravely disappointed me because it\'s not like Rowlett, Litten & Rockruff are terrible battlers as Pokemon but he just uses Pikachu, and only uses the others when battling a (insert important person).The other reason why I rate the characters as a 3/10 is that of Team Rocket. Over the years Team Rocket has turned into comedic relief in the series. But, since this anime has turned one of its main focuses of the genre into comedy, Team Rocket is just tossed to the side. I\'m not a huge fan of Team Rocket but the regards to them as comedic relief & as villains are rather pathetic. Team Rocket in previous season has had some rather successful attempts as villains which were nice to see, however, nothing has succeeded for Team Rocket even though some of it should have. Another reason Team Rocket is a pretty poorly written is that of Bewear. I understand that Team Rocket could never ""blast off"" because of the ratings of keeping it as a kid show and it implies the ""death"" of them, but to have Bewear stop them every time? After the first time, it was not funny. It was just irritating. Bewear as a character is written horribly and instead of focusing on trying to catch Team Rocket before they blast off, write about how it doesn\'t stop them while they\'re building a machine or something.Enjoyment: 8/10I\'m Pokemon trash, so matter how much this anime is a disappointment compared to the other seasons, I\'m still going to watch it. I\'d watch Pokemon even if it was drawn in stick figures and probably enjoy it as well. Pokemon is something childhood me loves and it still stuck with me throughout my entire life (Pokemon game came out the year I was born so I\'ve been a fan ever since it\'s creation).Overall: 6/10.As a long-time Pokemon fan that was hoping to see something good, especially because in X, Y (&Z) Pokemon fans were spoiled with good storylines, good development of characters and great battles. I\'m (always) caught up with this anime, and everything compared to it just pales in comparison of what a Pokemon series should be.If you\'re a fan of just anime in general and have not stayed with this series, you\'ll probably enjoy it because ""it breaks the stereotypes""  of what a Pokemon anime ""should be like"". If you enjoy seeing references to other animes in terms of art-styling, you\'ll enjoy this. If you have been a long time fan (and someone who was expecting something along the lines of what they saw in the Kalos region) you\'ll definitely be extremely disappointed in terms of storyline, characters, and art.', ""I liked the anime so far, I liked seeing Ash and Pikachu using z-moves such as gigavolt havoc and more, I liked seeing Ash catch new pokemon, I liked seeing Ash battling the Kahunas, I liked seeing Ash go to school and interacting with his classmates I liked how this season is so different from the other previous seasons, I enjoyed the first season of the pokemon sun and moon animeI hope for this season in the pokemon sun and moon anime that Solgaleo, Lunala, Necrozma, Zeraora, Poipole, and all the other ultra beasts appear.

Their art style.. it\'s not pretty bad, but their face, especially with their make-face design seems pretty familiar when I\'m watchin One Piece. I hate how people still hated this season just because of their design well you know what they...say ""Don\'t Judge a Book by it Cover"" that\'s all. say ""Don\'t Judge a Book by it Cover"" that\'s all.', ""I’d rate this a solid 7.5/10, but I’m rounding up to an 8 because the MAL score is unfairly low.Starting with the elephant in the room: yes, Sun and Moon’s artstyle departs from the rigid, 90’s-inspiring designs that I and so many other grew up on. Yes, it takes a while to get used to Ash’s squishy, five-year-old design, especially if you're a fan of the preceding Pokémon XY series. But I promise that Sun and Moon is really special among the Pokémon anime entries, if you’re willing to give it a shot.First of all, Sun and Moon is by far the most “anime” of...the Pokémon generations, which I think adds to its charm. With Ash attending school, the anime gets to dive into slice-of-life. The static setting allows the anime to flesh out a larger ensemble cast, and to great success for the most part (even the Pokémon get more personality than in some previous generations). The squishy, simplified artstyle allows Studio OLM to really shine when it comes to animations (though admittedly, they go a bit too hard on the comedic art to me, particularly in the first part of the series). The Z-move routines feel like the most anime thing to come out of Pokémon yet, and the Sentai anime references in the Ultra Guardians arcs make me crack up every time. But if Pokémon battles and Ash’s ‘never’-ending quest to be the very best are what have attracted you to the anime, those are still there. Yes, Ash feels a little more directionless in this generation, and he doesn’t battle as much as he usually does, but it’s clear that he still has all of his trainer chops, and the battles, while generally brief, are still lots of fun.The increased character focus on a larger ensemble cast is coupled with much longer, concentrated story arcs that are rare to previous generations. This is seen most in Lillie, whose mother Lusamine runs the company that is critical to several arcs, and whose brother Gladion becomes Ash’s main rival (and whose father… well, that’s a Pokémon Journeys debacle). The connections that Lillie and her family have to Ash, as well as to each other, allow you to get really invested in them, particularly when they develop in leaps and bounds as Lillie does. It also makes the world feel large yet interconnected in a way that previous generations haven’t. Ash still gets to be a ‘chosen one,’ as he is so frequently in the movies, but he also is peripheral to some of Sun and Moon’s largest plot developments. It makes Sun and Moon feel homey and family oriented, yet still epic when it needs to be.It’s also worth noting that Sun and Moon takes risks compared to other generations of the anime, and not just in the artstyle. Sun and Moon has character death, abduction, marriage, and a lot of other not-very-Pokémon-y things, including Ash’s first (SPOILER, but come on, you already know this) league victory. In general, Sun and Moon takes risks to present something new and exciting, and for the most part, I think those risks pay off.Of course, Sun and Moon is far from perfect. A lot of characters don’t get nearly the amount of character development they deserve (cough, Mallow), if they get development at all (cough, Sophocles). I love the way that Sun and Moon sets the standard for recurring professor characters, but I’m pretty sure we all only love Kukui and not Samson Oak. The Ultra Guardians arcs, while great on paper and memorable for the memes, were mostly wasted opportunities. Gladion, while being an adorably edgy goodboi, doesn’t force Ash to actually develop as rivals like Paul have done in the past… and of course, the filler runs rampant. Then again, no one expects any Pokémon anime to be peak fiction, and these are all flaws that previous generations of the anime have dealt with themselves.I honestly believe that Sun and Moon has some of the best that Pokémon anime has to offer. If you have ever liked any part of Pokémon, please give Sun and Moon a try, and PLEASE watch it in sub because the score is far better than what the dub comes up with, particularly in the emotional scenes. the Pokémon generations, which I think adds to its charm.

The story is more open ended and the artstyle is changed somewhat significantly. These changes made it a hit or miss to the audience. You will either love it or hate it.

You will need to commit a lot of time on this since it is...146 episodes long though you could skip a couple of episodes without that much penalty also, you don't need prior knowledge to previous Pokémon series to know what's going on (It's a bonus if you know the original anime though). 146 episodes long though you could skip a couple of episodes without that much penalty also, you don't need prior knowledge to previous Pokémon series to know what's going on (It's a bonus if you know the original anime though)."", ""Pros:- Ash wins the Regional Aloa Pokemon League,- Ash got a few mythical pokemon,- relaxing formula,- much more expanded main cast,Cons:- none for me, but If I were to find one reason then maybe the story somewhat was lacking the dark moments present in games.It took about more then 20 years for Ash to win Regional Pokemon League....Thanks to fans rally up on social media corporations policy of Ash losing tradition was finally broken.

Rocket Girls,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1942/Rocket_Girls,"[""What were your first thoughts when you heard about the title name? Well, my first thought was &quot;this is lame title for a series, so I\\'m guessing its gonna be a pretty lame series.&quot; Well... I can tell you, I was wrong, really wrong and I don\\'t regret being wrong because it\\'s one of the best random title\\'s I\\'ve ever picked up.The story focuses on the adventures of 3 main characters, Yukari Morita, Matsuri and Akane Miura who comes in later in the series. Although, their dreams of becoming astronauts wasn\\'t intentional, it just sort of happen when Yukari wanted to find some answers...in the disappearance of his father and why he left her mother so suddenly on their honeymoon trip. On another note, there was this Space Agency in crisis where they needed someone drastic at a respectable size to continue their space program expedition before they lose funds and thats where Yukari comes in, in  willing to help out for the exchange from them helping her look for her father. In addition, this is where the comedy comes it.While it\\'s strange for a couple of high school girls to be able to become astronauts in a short period of time, it does gives a sense of idea  where anything is possible if you set your mind to it. The training, the laughs, making friends, trusting each other are all memorable moments a person experience and this series stay true to that.The character development is acceptable as they start to become less naive about the dangers they face but the adventures is what really lacked the most. Not enough mission I will say as a majority of the episodes were focused on the training. If it was a 24 or 26 episode series, then I wouldn\\'t have picked on that but that wasn\\'t the case.The OP &amp; ED was good considering it fitted well on the series as a whole. I believe the purpose of the OP was to lift your spirits high and prepare for new challenges to come and I reckon it delivered that.Inconclusion, a well worth series to watch. There are some humor moments where it gets you through those dull moments but the adventures and experiences from these 3 girls is what gives you the enjoyment of the series. in the disappearance of his father and why he left her mother so suddenly on their honeymoon trip.

The first half of this is series is pretty enjoyable; after episode five I'd have given it at least a 8. The story is far fetched but the characters are fun and the writing is crisp but after that the story goes from far fetched to ridiculous to absurd. Major characters vanish from sight, others are introduced but add nothing and the lead character turns into just another plucky girl adventurer. It's rare to see a series self destruct as quickly as this. Rocket Girls is to science fiction as Scooby...Doo is to ghost stories. Doo is to ghost stories."", ""Rocket Girls is an exciting departure from the sci-fi depictions of space which many other series tend to favor.Story:The plot of Rocket Girls is fairly straight-forward. The Solomon Space Agency finds itself incapable of building a rocket which can transport an adult male into space. What they can build is a smaller tried-and-tested rocket which can get a high school girl into space. After some convincing, our main protagonist Morita Yukari joins the SSA as the first high schooler to become an astronaut.The series examines some of the foundational principles of space flight in a very entertaining manner. For instance, Morita becomes rather concerned when...she learns that a new fuel type is being developed for use in the rocket and tends to blow it up rather than push it into space.Throughout the entirety of the story spaceflight mechanics are closely adhered to. So closely, in fact, that at one point during one of Morita's lectures on orbital mechanics the board is shown with a number of actual equations regarding the Hohmann Transfer maneuver.There are numerous such instances of 'Did the Research.' The suits used are well understood concepts known to the professional world as Space Activity Suits. The capsule used has a Delta V capacity befitting something of its shape and size. The lifter has an appropriate size and payload capacity.Art:The colors and atmosphere of the series are very warm, resulting in a fun show about schoolgirls in space. There are a number of CG elements in the series which are smoothly blended into the animation which add a futuristic, clean touch to the spacecraft shown.Sound:I will admit that I do not usually notice the music in a series unless it's 10/10 or unless it's quite jarring. Since I didn't notice the music in this series I can only assume that it's about an 8/10 :)Characters:The three main characters are introduced over the course of the first half of the series and, while they don't break ground in character exploration/depth, have believable personalities and mix well with one another.Morita Yukari is energetic and stubborn. She's argumentative but can be persuaded with some effort. Matsuri, Morita's half-sister, is entirely technologically illiterate at the beginning of the series. She makes up for her lack of knowledge with a cheerful personality and solid moral character. Miura Akane is the resident geek whose emphasis is biology. She's quiet, incapable of strenuous physical labor, and very determined.Enjoyment:As someone who is well-versed in the mechanics of spaceflight at the formal level I was flabbergasted by the attention to detail which this series possesses. As such, I had an amazing time watching the show and could not help but grin every time a physical principle was accurately referenced.It bears mentioning that this series was made in conjunction with JAXA (The Japanese NASA), and it shows.Even ignoring the technical sophistication of the show, the story and character development is something which I enjoyed thoroughly. It was fun, interesting, and constantly entertaining from the beginning of the first episode to the credits of the last.Overall:Put all the previously mentioned items together and one gets a meticulously accurate, highly entertaining show worthy of consideration even by those whose interests do not include spaceflight. she learns that a new fuel type is being developed for use in the rocket and tends to blow it up rather than push it into space.Throughout the entirety of the story spaceflight mechanics are closely adhered to.

I picked up Rocket Girls expecting a cute slice of life about cuties who do things with rockets..... What I ended up watching was an amazing and incredible anime about becoming astronauts.Rocket Girls takes place on Solomon Island where we have three girls, Yukari, Matsuri and Akane as our mega cute astronauts. At first, the story seems to be very slice of life, but within the first 10 minutes, there is clearly something more at work here. Yukari is trying...to find her father, but gets forced into an odd situation where becoming an astronaut will help her find him. The training is grueling, the situations are far fetched,and everything happens really quickly.Honestly, I don't know how to write the story down in a way that makes sense without it being a straight up dissection of Rocket Girls. It's best if I just say that Rocket Girls isn't what you'll expect it to be, it's full of great twists and many heartfelt moments. I teared up a lot as the anime was reaching it's end and then the last episode happens and I almost cried. It's a cute story, but it's not a slice of life, in-fact I'd go as far as taking Rocket Girls seriously for when the serious moments happen, because it's very tense and has drama that will make you want to watch the entire show in one sitting.Art style, Rocket Girls is one of the most beautiful anime I have ever seen. Bright, vibrant and absolutely radiant colors explode off the screen, it's such a visual treat. The animation I feel is really really good too, though I found the CG scenes to be pretty poor for the most part.Sound/Music: Off the walls great music. I need to find an OST or something because everything that was played was just fantastic. Every single song and sound that we hear in Rocket Girls is top notch, presented well and played beautifully. Everything makes sense and there are clear reasons for what is being played and why........ I really don't know why this one is giving me a hard time to write things down for, I guess I just feel really impacted and can't write anything good down at all.I guess I'll just say that Rocket Girls is a really good show that does a great job of mixing comedy (I laughed out loud so many times), drama/tension, heartfelt moments and cuties.

Rockman.EXE,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1710/RockmanEXE,"[""I've enjoyed the Mega Man Battle Network series ever since middle school, so I decided to investigate the animated series motivated by my desire to merge my anime and gaming hobbies. What followed was a long couple of months trudging through its over 50 episodes, after which I admittedly missed having it around. The bottom line is that Rockman.EXE is very much a low budget commercial to boost toy and game sales, and while it isn't the worst kids show I've ever seen, there isn't much of worth the be found here.(Please note: I interchange the English and Japanese character names Rockman/Mega Man and Netto/Lan...at will)This show is not pretty to look at. The animation ranges from abhorrent to just below actual quality, but most of the time occupies a space that isn't good enough to praise but isn't bad enough to nitpick. A handful of fight scenes throughout the series look genuinely cool and fluid, and were probably only afforded with the money they saved by heavily reusing a few stock footage clips in nearly every episode. Of course, I can't expect too much from a Studio Xebec production in the early digital age, and as such I was prepared for the massive amounts of conspicuous CG. Some of the stock CG animations look pretty nice, but a few episodes which feature fully rendered 3D characters and environments just hurt to look at. I did appreciate Xebec borrowing a satellite model from their prior production of Zoids Shin Seiki Zero for a quick cameo, even if it is another apparent cost saving measure. Another side note is that the only character exclusively animated in 3D is a virtual pop star eerily prophetic of the later popularity of Vocaloids.I was not enthralled by the audio while I watched this series, but upon closer inspection I really like the soundtrack. The Japanese voice work isn't terrible, but it's about as cheesey as you would expect from a children's animated product of this caliber. The only standout voice that really annoyed me was Dekao, who sounds like a precursor to Black Clover's Asta. The theme song is kind of bland, but it definitely grew on me over the many weeks I listened to it in my car. Once I gave the soundtrack a dedicated listen, I was so intrigued I had to insert the following mini-album review.I think the soundtrack operates better on a budget than the show overall. For the most part it seems like they only afforded one guy with a high end arranger keyboard, with minimal live instrumentation. It sounds like I'm playing Pokemon XD, or if you lower the bit rate, Pokemon Emerald. The synthesized guitars, horns, strings, and what not were all probably top of the line at the time, but maintain a distinctly synthetic texture that I absolutely adore. The battle compositions are charging and harrowing, and the friendly pieces for Netto-tachi are goofy and fun. My favorite tracks are Lan and Rockman's themes, with wide piano chords that send me flying through the futuristic series of tubes that the Net Navis inhabit. Overall, I think the music is much more sound than the writing or animation, and my best Google research tells me it was composed by one Kohei Wada. Thanks, probably Wada-sensei.I was not disappointed by the story or characters, but only because I never had high expectations for either. Like so many other long running series, the characters have to remain static to keep kids coming back every week for more of the same shenanigans. That means almost no character growth, and minimal development. The Team Rocket analogue is arguably more developed than our main cast, with one of them even having an emotionally moving backstory. In general, the Net Navis are more competent people than the humans in the show, because many of them are just idiotic for comedic effect. A handful of characters like Dekao and the Battle Network iteration of Rush really grated my nerves, but overall they weren't so terrible that I actively hated all of them.The plot itself is sparse, with a tournament arc early on leading to a global threat that is quickly forgotten for episodic hijinx. Most episodes consist of our heroes throwing Rockman at whatever new goofball villain they meet, all the while pestering everyone and each other. The progression of Lan and Rockman learning new techniques is dismally slow, so I don't even want to imagine what it would be like to watch this weekly.

Don't get too hung up on seemingly important plot threads, because you're unlikely to get any kind of satisfying conclusion.

I can really only recommend this series to huge fans of the game, or those desperately in need of something to watch who have exhausted all better options. at will)This show is not pretty to look at. The animation ranges from abhorrent to just below actual quality, but most of the time occupies a space that isn't good enough to praise but isn't bad enough to nitpick. A handful of fight scenes throughout the series look genuinely cool and fluid, and were probably only afforded with the money they saved by heavily reusing a few stock footage clips in nearly every episode. Of course, I can't expect too much from a Studio Xebec production in the early digital age, and as such I was prepared for the massive amounts of conspicuous CG. Some of the stock CG animations look pretty nice, but a few episodes which feature fully rendered 3D characters and environments just hurt to look at. I did appreciate Xebec borrowing a satellite model from their prior production of Zoids Shin Seiki Zero for a quick cameo, even if it is another apparent cost saving measure. Another side note is that the only character exclusively animated in 3D is a virtual pop star eerily prophetic of the later popularity of Vocaloids.I was not enthralled by the audio while I watched this series, but upon closer inspection I really like the soundtrack. The Japanese voice work isn't terrible, but it's about as cheesey as you would expect from a children's animated product of this caliber. The only standout voice that really annoyed me was Dekao, who sounds like a precursor to Black Clover's Asta. The theme song is kind of bland, but it definitely grew on me over the many weeks I listened to it in my car. Once I gave the soundtrack a dedicated listen, I was so intrigued I had to insert the following mini-album review.I think the soundtrack operates better on a budget than the show overall. For the most part it seems like they only afforded one guy with a high end arranger keyboard, with minimal live instrumentation. It sounds like I'm playing Pokemon XD, or if you lower the bit rate, Pokemon Emerald. The synthesized guitars, horns, strings, and what not were all probably top of the line at the time, but maintain a distinctly synthetic texture that I absolutely adore. The battle compositions are charging and harrowing, and the friendly pieces for Netto-tachi are goofy and fun. My favorite tracks are Lan and Rockman's themes, with wide piano chords that send me flying through the futuristic series of tubes that the Net Navis inhabit. Overall, I think the music is much more sound than the writing or animation, and my best Google research tells me it was composed by one Kohei Wada. Thanks, probably Wada-sensei.I was not disappointed by the story or characters, but only because I never had high expectations for either. Like so many other long running series, the characters have to remain static to keep kids coming back every week for more of the same shenanigans. That means almost no character growth, and minimal development. The Team Rocket analogue is arguably more developed than our main cast, with one of them even having an emotionally moving backstory.

It was a time where Megaman had a strong support from Capcom and gave different spin offs from the original saga but still maintaining the feel of what made Megaman so great. One of this spin offs is the Battle Network series which it had a good run on GBA and made this anime to be created possible, so let's see how this series...does by its own.Story=6The story is very simple an evil organization called World Three, (WWW), wants to take over the world with the use of new technologies from the year 20XX that has made every single device connected to the internet possible, which is what Dr Wily wants to achieve. But it is time for our heroes Megaman and Netto to stop this from happening with the help of his friends and family.The story is not complicated but it is very fast paced in the first episodes, it shows you the rush of how important is this new interconnected world and the problems on how it can go to chaos if it is controlled by someone. Which is one of the main problems of this series, the story wants to rush it during the first half which makes you feel excited and always ready for action but then it starts going downhill when they want to show you the second half of this story. It was way too long for what should have been and the way they tried to have some character development from part of the humans is just way too cliche and very annoying sometimes,also the filler is very present and wanted to expose things that simply could have been avoided. There is an episode where they do Mario Kart style episode and another on how bad an unimportant maid sucks and her job.So it shows that they didn't have idea on how to finish it after the battle and important evil vs good moments were finished, which leads to a stressful watch if you want to conclude this first season.Art=6The animation is very fair, it was the time when computers were helping animators to pull this job quickly, which you can see in many 3D elements of the series which gives a nice touch to the interface of the internet world they have and that was booming during those years. Also the 2D animation is simple but it has its own identity that are very similar to the art work this game is based.Sound=7The opening simply kicks ass. The intro is very pumped and wants you to get excited for the the battles of the show. The endings are nice but not very memorable. The BGM is sometimes kinda lacking and just appears when the battles are going on, although this ones are good.Voice characters are ok for the most part everybody does their work perfectly and there are any annoyance among then when they say their dialogues.Characters.=7They are ok, but nothing stands out, we have the typical hero which wants to do things right, the best female friend, the silent rival that wants to be the best, the dorky side character that believes he is the main rival, a rich girl that gets everything and more. The highlights are the Net Navis, which are the main company of this characters. They are really cool and the battles when they face each other lets you see how they are personality wise and give you and great inside on how they attack and their abilities. My favorites being Megaman, Bass, Skullman and Magicman.Enjoyment=6It is a very standard series. It has really good battles and nice action going on here and there. But it can get tedious at times with unnecesary filler.Overall 6/10Thanks for reading this review,P.D.

The Navi or what we call a character in-game are adjusted to the person in real-life such as the personality, body, etc. Rockman is the main character with a lot of styles but never once I forget all those styles.Enjoyment (10)It's very enjoyable to watch this anime and play the game even though it's in 2022!Overall (9)Recommended to those who love technology in the past and relate all network or virtual  battle to real life (Usually bad things happen since there are a lot of viruses and bad navi's). anime very old.

Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14749/Ore_no_Kanojo_to_Osananajimi_ga_Shuraba_Sugiru,"[""(2017 EDIT: Anime has JoJo references.)Oreshura is just another harem rom com. It has nothing special about it and it doesn't stand out much at all. Yet it's really likable and you can't find many reasons to hate it. The reason is probably because as plain as it is, it does what it's supposed to do pretty well.The story was decent (7). It wasn't special but it wasn't boring either. In fact, it didn't have much of a story. It's pretty much about a childhood friend trying to get the protagonist back to her from his kind-of-evil girlfriend, while more harem members join the...crew along the way. The different thing about this is the super lighthearted tone. To me this is what basically sets the anime apart from the others of the same genre. Oh, but it could also be because the protagonist ACTUALLY chooses someone in the end.The art suited the lighthearted tone really well (8). The light colors gave off a watercolor like feel to it and it went well with the character design which together made it really cute, or rather, attractive. There should be more anime with this type of art, and I think it would go well with a lot of romance anime.The sound/music suited the art and story perfectly (8). Of course it wasn't brilliant or outstanding, but it was fun and very well done -lol- , and the opening and ending were really cute, or rather, attractive. The BGM suited the comedic moments really well too.The characters got me pleasantly surprised (8). For a generic harem, you can't expect too much out of the characters. You would expect (or I expected) the main character to be an ordinary, plain and boring person who can't make any decisions by himself, has the school idol at his feet every day but still refuses to notice her, who's parents are either dead or somewhere abroad, a non-blood related sister who would happen to have a crush on him, a perverted,wacko best friend who makes the MC look mature and reliable, when he himself has a porn mag stashed somewhere, etc. I could go on and on but that isn't the point I was trying to make, which is that the main character is actually likable. The essence of a harem anime are the harem members, not the leader himself. If the leader was more interesting than the members he would seem like a member himself. This MC is neither almost non-existent nor is he super fancy. He's just a nice guy who isn't overly anything and isn't annoying in the slightest. There is no imouto. There is no wacko friend, but instead a super sweet trap/friend. Yes, his doesn't live with his parents, but there's a story as to why things are like that. And his chuunibyo makes him pretty hilarious too. Most of the other characters are based on regular harem archetypes, but what makes them different is how funny, embarrassing and nice they all seem to be to each other. No two characters are alike, which is another plus point in harems.The enjoyment is over 9000 for me (even though I'm limited to putting a 10). This was a short and entertaining anime with the least offense I've seen an anime of its genre pull off. I'd recommend it to anyone who's just finished watching Corpse Party or something.Overall, this anime is one of the neatest of its type and is a fun show for anyone who doesn't hate Harem with their life (9).

As the name states it, yes, it\'s a warzone between a childhood friend and the girlfriend with the addition of another two comic relief character.Story, 6/10:For the story, well, people may thought, \'Hey, this must be another simple harem show again. whatever, i\'ll just watch it for fun\'. Yeah, at first, i was like that, then, after a certain episode, the story was getting even more exciting. And to think that each and every one of the girls were given fair chances in getting the guy.One thing that i really like...about this show is that, it didn\'t feel rush. Everything went smoothly with the flow. Although there were moments where you would be like, \' whuh?\' but it was still good.I gave it a 6/10 score because the story didn\'t reached the climax where it should have been. And a few other scenes that should be so powerful, but ended up with a \'meh\'Art, 8/10:One good thing about this anime is the art style. Some people might be disturbed by the light coloured theme, but for me, i loved it! It was so refreshing and so cheerful. God, the opening was so full of colours, i was caught by the colours myself.The character design was okay i guess. Although there were some scenes where the character\'s face was a bit weird.Sound, 7/10:I would say that the Sound in the anime played a not-so-much part in most of the massive scenes, where it should be. So yeah, maybe that\'s one of the reason why i feel the climax didn\'t reach the peak where i think it should have been.The OP and ED played a major role in setting up the cheerful atmosphere. I love the OP. Hahaha.For the second last episode, the ED played a major role  in setting the mood for the last episode. I can\'t tell you what it\'s about, but it was aweesome.Character, 8/10:So in this harem, we have the genki girl, Harusaki Chiwa, the tsundere, Fuyuumi Ai, the chuunibyou, Akishino Himeka and the beauty, Natsukawa Masuzu.Usually, in a harem anime, the main guy would be a total clueless dumbass that didn\'t even notice a girl likes him even after that girl confessed to him. But Eita, is not like that. he may be clueless at times, not because he is dumb, it\'s because of the family affairs which made him not to trust love.And yes, i would believe that kind of reasoning, family problems could turn a person into anything.Then, there\'s Chiwa, the childhood friend, fell in love with him after a certain incident(I won\'t spoil it). Also, has a bulletproof reason to love him.Masuzu in the other hand, doesn\'t have any reason to love Eita, but she develops feelings for him later on. and i must say, watching Masuzu grew from the beginning to the end is really fun and sweet at times. although she can be a jerk.Himeke and Ai, were practically the comic relief love interest. But even so, their reasoning to fell in love with Eita were both solid rock. Yes, even for a side character, i was rooting for Ai at some point.A bunch of \'the usual\' harem character but with interesting backgrounds and solid reason to why they like the same guy. Trust me, you won\'t get bored with any one of these characters, ever.If only, every harem makes sense like this one...Enjoyment, 8/10:When the episode is getting dull, or the start of a new mission, behold! The Burning Fighting Fighter Notebook of Darkness!HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!YES, It was so embarrassing, i can\'t stop laughing.Anyway, besides that, watching every singe one of the characters(including the aunt) developed at a same rate was really enjoying. every single one of them had a fair chance, even Kaoru. Yes, Kaoru. If only Kaoru was in the harem circle....Overall. 7/10:Like it\'s title, \'My girlfriend and childhood friend fight too much\'. i agreed on that 100% percent. Because, it was all about a childhood friend and his gilrfriend. Ai and Himeka were just there. One of my favourite thing about the anime was watching Masuzu and Chiwa fought.*cough* *cough* the last scene in the final episode, yup. i love that scene. eventhough there were no sparks between them, i swear i saw them inside my head.it was so intense that it was so good.Credits to the huge character developments in Masuzu. And yes, now i\'m stuck between both of them.If the harem is bad, you\'ll like every characters in the harem circle, if the harem is okay, you would like only one of them but if the harem is good, you would stuck in choosing which one is the best.Yes, even now, i didn\'t see any winners yet. Not common for an anime but it\'s OreShura, where everything were for a reason.P/s:I am rooting for second season!! No notebook, less comic relief, more love pentagon. Instead of being 80% comedy 20% romance, my guess, it would be 25% comedy, 25% serious and 50% romance for the next season.

The thing is, he gets blackmailed in the most embarrassing way possible. Now he\'s nothing more than a little boy toy to a certain admired beauty at school. But hey, at least he\'s getting a hot girl with a manipulative personality yet someone “cares” about him in some way right? That\'s not what it seems to be...Wait, this is a bit too fast. Let\'s start from the beginning.Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru (God damn that is a long name, so I...will call it \'Oreshura\' instead), is an anime series that debuted in 2013 based on the LN written by Yuji Yuji. The Japanese title literally translates to:“My Girlfriend and Childhood Friend Fight Too Much”YA THINK?Well, the series does display that theme quite a bit. For starters, we got this kid named Eita Kidou who is in his puberty years in high school. He\'s a normal high school student with a healthy body. At that age, most boys would think about girls, right? No, in his case, the only thing is in mind is to study, study, and study. In fact, he hopes to become a doctor. (for a friend\'s sake) Well hell, if anyone tries to make that into a goal, we should all envision on the journey to get there. It\'s not an easy task being a doctor and saving lives, not to mention the amount of education you need to obtain the occupation. This also came from some bad memories from his past related to his parents. (poor kid) And beyond that, he has decided to eradicate the thought of “love” from his thoughts. In other words, the only focus on his mind is to achieve his goal, with absolution regardless of the costs. Oh but life just isn\'t so easy for this kid because there\'s one BIG problem:Masuzu NatsukawaShe\'s a mysterious transfer student where after nine long years came to his school all the way from Sweden. She has silver hair and in anime logic, we all know that\'s an attractive trait. In real life though, that\'s probably bizarre. But at any rate, this girl quickly becomes the talk of the school where boys instantly becomes attracted to her. On the other hand, Eita is just being Eita there with no second thoughts related to her. That is of course till one faithful day. After a certain incident, it seems that Eita becomes blackmailed by a certain notebook (Death Note reference anyone?) and now is literally forced to play the role of a “boyfriend” for Masuzu. It\'s basically an offer he can\'t refuse!Of course, in today\'s anime industry, the concept of the \'fake boyfriend/girlfriend\' theme is not new. It\'s literally a palm in the face at occasions where we watch a fake couple doing fake things that are expressed as fake romance. It\'s overused all over the world but hey, it\'s still here. The fact that Eita and Masuzu are a “couple” means that they are the talk of the school and among other things, an obstacle for both Eita and his childhood friend Chiwa Harusaki. That\'s because Eita promised to become a doctor in order to help her with the injury that she endured during her times as a kendo specialist.Now regarding Chiwa, this girl gave the word \'annoying\' a whole new meaning. With a lack of any sex appeal, an annoying mouth, and obliviousness to a lot of things, she plays the mascot of the show. In fact, she is even nicknamed as Chiwawa as a pun for chihuahua. This is because her petite figure and hairstyle resembles those of a puppy. Well, let\'s not forget about her mouth of course because a puppy barks when annoyed and Chiwawa here is no different. Sorry Chiwawa fans.She brings on some early drama in the series after finding out about the whole fake \'boyfriend/girlfriend\' ordeal. Being herself, she lacks the knowledge of “romance” and its ideas so she tries her best to break them apart. With her persistence, she often tries to interfere during their moments of “romance”. However unlike Masuzu, Chiwawa lacks confidence. Unfortunately for her, it seems that Eita only sees her as a childhood friend although at many occasions, he seems to put her in high regards and does truly care about her. Among other things though, Eita-kun also meets other girls which puts Chiwawa on even more stress when she realizes the many rivals to love.Those rivals would be Himeka Akishino who self-proclaims herself as Eita-kun\'s “ex-girlfriend”. Her introduction invokes the wrath of not only Chiwawa but also Eita\'s fake girlfriend Masuzu. It becomes a battlefield and Himeka portrays herself as the “Burning Princess Saint Dragon Lady of Dawn”. It all happened after a certain event and after being a witness, she is determined to prove to Eita that she is his destined one. Too bad destiny doesn\'t land her well on the side of love. Speaking of which now, destiny presents another girl, the all loveable pink haired girl Ai Fuyuumi. She seems to play the role of the antithesis with her tsundere like features and delusions. In fact, she even has a little cute history but that would be spoilers. Watch the series and you\'ll see.With these girls and Eita-kun in the mix, we have the formula for a harem. They all have different colored hair too but with different physiques. It also seems that at the same time, Eita can\'t seem to pick which one to choose. In fact, he still wants to escape from the idea of love and pursue a dream as a doctor. Well tough luck to Eita kun because this kid can\'t ever catch a break. From some of the episodes, he gets humiliated by the notebook, beat up by thugs, and caught up into countless misunderstandings in what some may see as an unwanted harem. It\'s a battlefield for all the girls and everyone to themselves. It also seems that at some occasions, Masuzu may generally care for Eita in a more romantic way as opposed to their fake relationship. Still though, it doesn\'t avoid the typical harem themes. We have the jealousy from the girls that often results from misunderstandings, the stalkers on dates to “observe” what Eita is doing, and hell, even the traditional CPR scene. It gets old and overused . Let\'s not also forget the “transfer student” theme, the childhood friend relationship, and even a case of the naked apron idea. It\'s Harem with a capital H.The series is labeled as romantic comedy and surprisingly, it does have its comedy side. The idea of “love” is really played out during many episodes is weak though as I\'ve yet to sense that feeling of real romance from any of the character. However, I admit that the comedy of the series is done surprisingly well.Let\'s see, there\'s the fun references of chuunibyou presented in many episodes involving Himeka and Eita. They imagine themselves as the “Burning Fighting Fighter” and “Burning Princess Saint Dragon Lady of Dawn” respectively. But of course, this theme isn\'t new to the anime industry especially in terms of romantic comedies. Yes, I\'m looking at you, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Other little fun gags in the series revolves around Masuzu who presents herself as a hardcore Jojo fan. In fact, she often uses references and quotes throughout the series to make humor. These often puts Eita in an embarrassing situation but amusement for Masuzu herself. It\'s not surprising though given her manipulative personality. Additionally, there\'s the idea of \'obvious lies\' involving Ai. It\'s so obvious that her “boyfriend” doesn\'t really exist that it should be a big sign for anyone. Additionally, her strict policy of being a “hall monitor” contradicts her personality as she herself seems to want fun. Yup, I personally found these little gags here and there amusing or at the very least presents comedy in a fun way.Unfortunately, it seems that not all of these doesn\'t work out too well in the end. There\'s still fan service and the typical beach episode, the festival at night (with yukata for decoration), the obvious love triangle/square, and Eita being oblivious to certain things in life despite his intellect. I also personally found that Eita is a bit annoying to watch. Being a nice guy, he often wants to help others by putting himself at risk but I feel like he\'s not using his brain much. Although I admire his care for the other girls, I find that his actions presented are a bit weak to my liking. Additionally, I also find that Himeka\'s character to be way too blend and hardly stands out at all. In fact, at some occasions, I forget her existence in the show just like her delusions that are nonexistent. The love triangle is also weak too in my opinion. It seems that Eita doesn\'t wants any of them as a real girlfriend. In fact, it seems that the only thing he would marry would be a career and that is of being a doctor. Maybe, one of the girls should pursue a career in medicine or something to stand a better chance.In terms of visuals, I had a hard time adjusting myself to watch this. Even being a manga fan, I would have to say that A-1 Pictures dropped the ball on this one. The characters are generic, washed out, and not to mention most of the scenes from this series are so bright that one might need sunglasses to get a true experience. The girls themselves also lacks any realism at all. Well, I guess some of the more humorous scenes are presented better visually but ultimately, this series only gets a \'5\' in the art department. I\'m disappointed.I don\'t have too much complaints about the music/soundtrack of the series. However, that OP song ""Girlish Lover"" by Mizukara wo Enshutsu Suru Otome no Kai is like a buzz to my ears occasionally. It\'s very girlish (sticks with the title) and really tries to tell the viewers that this series is what it is: a romantic comedy with a harem. It\'s also funny how Eita doesn\'t seem to be in the OP song at all. It\'s almost if the girls in this show is the more dominant characters, not the guy. This is especially true for Masuzu. As regarding the background music, I find it just fine and sometimes amusing especially during a few of the guitar rhythms during those \'notebook scenes\'.Ultimately, I will give this show a \'6\'. It\'s definitely a threat towards to a \'5\' scale though with its lack of characterization in Eita\'s harem. The main male protagonist, despite being kind, lacks any distinct features from what I see him as. As for the drama, it is presented in a more causal way rather than anything too serious. With seemingly no real winner in fact, this series is just a romantic comedy with a harem that our friend Eita-kun can hardly stand. Well, I could barely stand this series at many times but if you want to find some fun with its comedy parts, Oreshura might be worth a shot. If you want to pursue a doctor career yourself though, then save that precious time that you\'ll never be able to buy back; not even with blackmail. will call it \'Oreshura\' instead), is an anime series that debuted in 2013 based on the LN written by Yuji Yuji. The Japanese title literally translates to:“My Girlfriend and Childhood Friend Fight Too Much”YA THINK?Well, the series does display that theme quite a bit. For starters, we got this kid named Eita Kidou who is in his puberty years in high school. He\'s a normal high school student with a healthy body. At that age, most boys would think about girls, right? No, in his case, the only thing is in mind is to study, study, and study. In fact, he hopes to become a doctor. (for a friend\'s sake) Well hell, if anyone tries to make that into a goal, we should all envision on the journey to get there. It\'s not an easy task being a doctor and saving lives, not to mention the amount of education you need to obtain the occupation. This also came from some bad memories from his past related to his parents. (poor kid) And beyond that, he has decided to eradicate the thought of “love” from his thoughts. In other words, the only focus on his mind is to achieve his goal, with absolution regardless of the costs. Oh but life just isn\'t so easy for this kid because there\'s one BIG problem:Masuzu NatsukawaShe\'s a mysterious transfer student where after nine long years came to his school all the way from Sweden. She has silver hair and in anime logic, we all know that\'s an attractive trait. In real life though, that\'s probably bizarre. But at any rate, this girl quickly becomes the talk of the school where boys instantly becomes attracted to her.

This is not the case, the show had an opportunity to start an original Rom/Com by matching a hopeless guy who focuses on his studies rather than women who is then thrown feet first into a relationship he has no control over thus leading into shenanigans and mishaps but I was sorely mistaken.Story 6/10:The plot was unoriginal and poorly executed. It lives up to its name as a Rom/Com by being unable to build...up a viable plot by relying heavily on comedy and simply sets up all the girls for Eita’s harem. The pacing is rather fast as it only has 2 episodes to set up the story behind each of the girls and how they came to love Eita making sympathy hard to make with the characters. The characters are quite 1-dimensional and don’t really have much outstanding features to them. There are a few exceptions to the plot’s execution, when the story turns to the drama section, trying to touch the viewer’s feelings, it succeeds. In the end, OreShura is mainly a show for the laughs and focuses on the comedy and romance is a side-dish.Art 8/10:From background to character design, overall the art was great. It gave a happy atmosphere matching to that of a Rom/Com. The characters look unique and don’t, magically, look the same as some animes tend to do. The lighting was well done but shadows seem somewhat lacking. Effects don’t happen very often (love hearts and such) but in certain scenes for example, when Masuzu reads from Eita’s notebook, it looks wonderful and nice to watch.Sound 9/10:Sound was great overall; it achieved engaging sounds which catches the viewer’s attention with its background music and ambient sounds such as the sounds of busy streets and the ticking of a clock and is quite consistent as it doesn’t suddenly become silent. The OP is very cheery and catchy which gets you into the show.Characters 6/10:The characters are very cliché and unoriginal.Our main character, Kidou Eita, who seems to be an interesting character by “giving up on love” first, seems like a good idea but it has the opposite effect. Because of this, Eita is completely clueless in romance and is very dense about the girls around him. He is a recovering victim from “eighth-grader syndrome” which is held against his own will by the likes of Natsukawa Masuzu who uses it as blackmail.Our female leads aren’t any better, our supposed idol, Masuzu, doesn’t seem popular at all after the first episode despite this is one of her main traits, then we have the childhood friend (>_>) Chiwa, who is a failure in love unable to show her feeling to Eita, now we have Himeka, another victim of eight-grader syndrome who sticks to Eita like super glue, and finally we have the wonderful tsundere with pink hair, Ai, she uses her best friend (Whose gender can't be defined) as a wing(wo?)man. We now have a fleeting team of flavorless women lined up for Eita's harem. Not much exciting here.Overall 7/10:If it wasn’t for the art and the big laughs every now and then, I might have given up on this series. If you are looking for an intricate plot with twists and turns, this is not for you. This is more of a comedy than a romance. The comedy certainly will make you laugh or at least chuckle once.

What we have was more like a generic harem, romance with comedy kind of anime where everything was predictable, except that this anime deviated from it's plot, where after ep 2 one would be surprise if the main character's role was no longer what it was suppose to be, in fact studio A-1 Pictures, focus more on the mismatched tandem than anything else.So, my category ratings:Mediocre 5.Story- like I said, it was a basic harem type of an anime where the plot...was secondary and the focus was on the 2 mismatched pair namely Masuzu and Eita, the other members of the chico's harem were merely obstacles for the pair.Fair 6.Art- I'd probably say that, there isn't much any fanservice for the pirreos to howl about, and I have no qualms them girls being in bikinis, though Masuzu wasn't wearing any underwear it didn't look that malicious. I like the girls' uniform, however I don't like the boy's school uniform, now c'mon, that blue shirt with white collar matched with white pants? OH, this anime's illustrator has poor sense when it comes to guy's fashion.Good 7.Sound- well then, the VA's really did match the characters voices and I'd like both the opening and the closing part of the anime.Enjoyment- it was enjoyable to say the least when the main chico character defends the girls who would be mocked and the situation where you would like to know as to what happens next. Also, what make it it more enjoyable were the girls  would say those sweet 3 words to the main character ( Eita). I have to admit, that there were parts of this anime that I would like to slap the guys head for being stupid with the girls feelings.Pathetic 1.Argh! I hate when that guy (Eita) has chosen that no good girl (Masuzu) over Ai, so the score was for him (Eita). Frankly, either he's very stupid or he just uses Masuzu so as to keep romance away from him, since he known that Masuzu was not a typical girl that one might not want to marry and have a family with, either way, I fell bad for those girls who have confess their feelings for him especially Chiwa. Since his role was to be this guy who shuns romance, his character should've been this cold and hated guy with a tsundere attitude, not only to all girls but to Masuzu as well and that Masuzu wasn't able to exercise any leverage on himDreadful 2.Aside from the fact that the main character (Eita) has chosen that girl (Masuzu) really makes this anime go downhill, now for studio A-1 Pictures to give this anime a U- turn by giving it harem ending was like adding insult to injury over us audience who are hoping that he'll pick anybody else than Masuzu. The said studio should have just let it have a harem ending than doing a U-turn. was secondary and the focus was on the 2 mismatched pair namely Masuzu and Eita, the other members of the chico's harem were merely obstacles for the pair.Fair 6.Art- I'd probably say that, there isn't much any fanservice for the pirreos to howl about, and I have no qualms them girls being in bikinis, though Masuzu wasn't wearing any underwear it didn't look that malicious.

This anime isn\'t an exception. Although what most rom-coms try to do is have a unique characteristic that separates from the normal.Story: 6The romantic comedies I\'ve seen always has a typical setting for it\'s story. You\'ve got your typical male somehow attracting people of the opposite sex to do your dirty work for you. Okay, that\'s a bit of an overstatement but you know what I mean. You have a new student who comes around and takes advantage of our main character Eita. He is entirely not...interested in love and is recovering from a middle school like syndrome where he has a mindset of thinking he\'s someone called ""Burning Fighting Fighter"". Because of this, she uses him as a way for other guys to not constantly ask her out by having him be her boyfriend, and to make sure he doesn\'t do anything wrong, she uses a notebook of his experience as the Burning Fighting Fighter. It sounds like a nice story to step foot on, but that\'s what really ""starts"" the anime.Art: 9A unique aspect of this anime is it\'s art. Bright, vibrant colors that separates other anime. It\'s opening and ending truly stand out to show it\'s nice art. Although at some points it feels really bright as if someone wanted to turn the contrast of the anime to unnecessary amounts.

Eita is extremely clueless when it comes to the girls showing their affection. ALL the girls like him. That\'s the point of a harem, but it\'s irritating to see how narrow-minded he is. Yes I know he\'s uninterested in love. I just never thought he\'ll be this clueless. He\'s still a likable character by being a helpful person to all his women.There\'s a total of four girls that appear in the anime. First you have your mean, tsundere-like figure who uses Eita as she slowly starts liking him. Next you have your child-hood friend who doesn\'t like that fact that Eita is dating someone, as she has feelings for him too. You then have a character who similarly has a middle school syndrome and remembers Eita from her past life and wants to be united. Lastly you have another tsundere-like character who has a crush on Eita. I\'m just trying to be brief about this as you have to watch the anime to find more back ground information about them, as it\'s what really drives the story forward.Enjoyment: 7It\'s an ok anime. I expected more from what it presented. It has a decent amount of comedy that makes you like some characters. At the end of each episode it doesn\'t really bring me in to watch the next one.

Because of this, she uses him as a way for other guys to not constantly ask her out by having him be her boyfriend, and to make sure he doesn\'t do anything wrong, she uses a notebook of his experience as the Burning Fighting Fighter. It sounds like a nice story to step foot on, but that\'s what really ""starts"" the anime.Art: 9A unique aspect of this anime is it\'s art. Bright, vibrant colors that separates other anime. It\'s opening and ending truly stand out to show it\'s nice art. Although at some points it feels really bright as if someone wanted to turn the contrast of the anime to unnecessary amounts.

From the very beginning I expected that this series would take a sort of slice-of-life route, but this was in fact a grave misconception on my part as the series was actually a harem. Now, while I have no issue with a series making use with such...a format, Oreshura really brings nothing new and exciting to the table. Thus, herein lies the problem.As a means of illustrating the issue I have with this series, allow me to do what any reviewer should, which is to dissect the series into its fundamental elements (e.g. the art and animation, the story, etc.) and to comment on each one, detailing what the series does well and vice versa.-Story-While this is not the biggest flaw in this series, it is certainly a significant one and one that I must stress profusely. The story, essentially, follows a highschool student named Eita Kidou, who is black-mailed by a female student (Masuzu Natsukawa) as a means of forcing him into pretending to be her girlfriend. As such, other girls that are around him (who, for the most part, are childhood friends of his) begin to become jealous, leading into the show's harem aspects.That, in all honesty, is the story of this show. Now, I should not be required to explain that such a plot is so unbelievably banal that one could easily predict how the series would play out from point A to point B. If one struggled with this, then they could certainly predict what sort ending the series would make use of. This is due to the fact that the series restricts itself to a rigid, linear structure. The protagonist is blackmailed and, as a result, ends up 'developing' feelings for the blackmailer. Because of this aforementioned linear structure, the show is unable to diversify and, in turn, fails to be unique in any aspect.-Characters-The characters, if one could refer to them as such, are the weakest aspect of Oreshura. Why, you ask? Well, there are two reasons. First and foremost, as this is a generic harem, each character follows the conventions dictated by common characer archetypes that are seen in anime. We have all of the typical cast of characters: The blissfully unaware protagonist (Eita), the childhood friend (Chiwa), the tsundere  and other childhood friend (Ai), and finally, the highly irritating hussy that is Masuzu Natsukawa. The final mention brings me nicely into my explanation of the second reason for why the show's characterisation is its weakest aspect.The second reason is, of course, that Oreshura's main heroine is the epitome of impertinence. As such, this renders her as a character that is difficult to tolerate, let alone one that the viewer can grow to love. While it is not necessary for a heroine to be likeable, it is necessary for the show to provide a valid reason for them acting in the manner that makes them so unlikable, which Oreshura tries to gloss over, so to speak.Thus, we have a cast that is exceedingly generic and a main heroine that is very difficult, if not impossible, to tolerate due to the fact that a legitimate reason is never provided to compensate for her distasteful personality.-Art and Animation-The show's art style is definitely one of its stronger points. Each scene in Oreshura is vibrant and colourful, fitting in with the overall upbeat nature of the show. Even so, the art is not particularly detailed, making it seem somewhat lacklustre in comparison to other anime series.The animation of the show is, for the most part, consistent and fluid. That being said, there were certain points in the show where the animation was neglected, resulting in the inconsistent and unrealistic movement of vehicles, characters, and so on.-Music-Unfortunately for Oreshura, the art and animation are the only redeeming feature of the show. The music used is not very memorable, and I personally found the opening theme of the show to be irritating, as opposed to catchy and enjoyable, which is what it was apparently trying to be.-Conclusion-Perhaps the most important question would be whether or not I would recommend this anime series. My answer to this question is, obviously, no. However, if you intend to watch this show despite having read through this review, then I have no intention of stopping you. I do, however, recommend that you stream this show via a legal streaming website such as Crunchyroll, as opposed to purchasing a Blu-Ray and/or DVD release of the show. If you are reading this on Crunchyroll, please disregard the previous statement.Overall, this show is far too generic and bland for me to recommend to any person. The characters do not undergo any development as they are restricted by the archetypes that they represent. This, in turn, makes the intended emotional points in the show seem far less believable and they ultimately fall flat as a result.Furthermore, a predictable ending makes the watching the show a pointless exercise, as one could easily surmise how the show would end, many episodes in advance.-Afterword-Well, if you actually took the time to read through this review, I thank you. If you agree with my review, please feel free to say so. Likewise, if you happen to disagree with my review or have any advice which could help me improve upon my next review, please leave some feedback on my MAL or Crunchyroll profile page, depending on which website you are reading this on.TL;DR:Please take the time to read the review.

Most of the time spent on anime involves romantic comedies or dramatic romance stories,so I figured I\'d watch this one as well. Not only was I pleased to see not one but more beautiful girls but from most of the series in my list this was amongst the ones I enjoyed the most. ""Why is that?"" you would ask yourself. Well it\'s like this: from my point of view, the lucky bastard, Eita inevitably draws around these girls due to the fact that he is nice. He desperately tries to make them disappear but they end up in a pinch and he...rushes over to help them thus deepening their bond with him.It makes me ask myself after watching similar series: ""Why do they always get the good ones?""Now, from Eita\'s perspective, a bunch of troublesome girls begin to pester him and he doesn\'t know why.He asks himself :""How did I get stuck in this mess?""The Story itself is very enjoyable especially when it leads to open conflicts and for some reason it kept me happy while waiting for new episodes.So if you feel like  watching it I recommend it with warmth. rushes over to help them thus deepening their bond with him.It makes me ask myself after watching similar series: ""Why do they always get the good ones?""Now, from Eita\'s perspective, a bunch of troublesome girls begin to pester him and he doesn\'t know why.He asks himself :""How did I get stuck in this mess?""The Story itself is very enjoyable especially when it leads to open conflicts and for some reason it kept me happy while waiting for new episodes.So if you feel like  watching it I recommend it with warmth.', 'Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru, or My Girlfriend and Childhood Friend Fight too much, is pretty much what the name says. This show is a harem. However, I found it quite different from a lot of other harems.Story - 7/10:Okay, so this show is a romantic comedy/harem. Usually, I tend to try and avoid romantic comedy, because they all have kind of a similar theme or story. This show was not an exception, though there were a few aspects that I did like and stood out to me. I have not seen a show where the main character is AGAINST love. This...is because of family reasons. Typically in a harem, the guy either doesn\'t care, or wants a harem, like Issei from Highschool DxD. But the main character here doesn\'t, which just made the story funnier. However, I understand the he is against love, but sometimes, he\'s just oblivious. Enough said about that. So we have a typical harem plot: mysterious girl appears and likes guy and has to fight with his childhood friend along with other girls, to get the guy. Nothing we haven\'t seen, right? Although some parts of the plot are nothing new, I found the whole ""Burning Fighting Fighter"" thing a funny twist, and I believe that Masuzu using the notebook to blackmail him was a new element that I hadn\'t seen. I\'ll talk more about the character later though. I gave that story a 7/10, because while some of this was nothing new, Oreshura managed to bring some new and unique elements into the show.Art - 9/10:This show had very nice artwork. I really liked the style, and the bright colors matched the mood of the show well. Some people might not like it, or think it\'s silly, but I thought the art fit the show perfectly. The character design was nice, and they were easily distinguishable.Sound - 8/10:The sound for this show I believe served its purpose. I found that the OP and ED, Girlish Lover and Wonder Tale, fit the mood of the show perfectly, and were nice to watch. It was like a treat at the beginning and end of each episode. Not to mention the songs were catching, and it was nice to hear all of the main female cast sing in the full version of the OP. That said, there were times when music could have been better, like in the more dramatic parts of the show. Overall, the sound was enjoyable, and fit the show well.Character - 6/10:Oreshura had an interesting set of characters that made the show what it is. Eita is a high school boy who is against love for family reasons. Masuzu is a mysterious and beautiful transfer student who sits by Eita. Chiwa is Eita\'s childhood friend. Himeka is a girl who claims to know him in her previous life. Ai is a tsundere who has a crush on Eita. What do these characters have in common? They all have fellings for Eita. Chiwa has a great reason which I will not spoil. Himeka believes she was his princess in her past life. Ai also have a good reason that I will not spoil. Masuzu blackmails Eita into being her ""boyfriend"" so guys will stop asking her out, but grows to have feelings for him. The characters are not really unique, but nevertheless, fun to watch. It was nice to see all the characters progress and develop. What I found really great, was that there were times throughout the show when I was rooting for each of the girls, and it felt like they all had an equal chance at being with Eita. Although the rivalry was mainly between Masuzu and Chiwa, the girls all had a fair chance at times, and progressed equally.Enjoyment - 8/10:I really enjoyed this show, and it remains one of my favorites. It was very funny, and fun to watch. If you want a more serious, intense show, I would stay away, but if you want something fun and lighthearted, Oreshura might be for you. I enjoyed watching his girlfriend and childhood friend fight too much, and I believe the show did what it was supposed to: to entertain.Overall: 8/10I give Oreshura a 8/10. The story is good, the art fits the show great, the sound was nice, the characters were decent, and the show was enjoyable!

Hate reading overly lengthy reviews and going through every unnecessary point as some of the reviewers do, so expect this one to be short (Ironically, didn't turn out to be so short.)Scrolling through the other reviews left me wondering.Am I seriously the only one who thought this was such a wtf anime?So, I loved the beginning, it sparked a great interest for me to see the rest of the anime and I liked the first half.Then the seventh episode came along and...things started getting... I don't even know how to describe it. I can't emphasize how weird and nonsensical the show started turning real fast..The new girl, Himeka was introduced, there she was for one episode and was never noticable again. Literally one episode was all she got. She feels so unimportant, volumed down and received so much less screen time than the other three it makes me wonder why they even introduced her to the show. Hence, it was actually a fight between the other girls.*Minor spoilers*The two girls introduced at start, Chiwa and Masuzu, were going at each other in first half of the anime, then Ai came along and story mostly focused between the relationship between her and MC, main lead across 7-10 eps.Now, that part about her crying when he promised her to heal her back injury wasn't even touched upon until practically the end and after going through the second half of the anime it felt so incredibly out of placeIn fact, everything that happened in first part felt like that, as if it was all forgotten.The pretending part was something I had completely forgotten about throughout the second part, as well as some other things I won't bring up since I already spoiled enough.* *The last three episodes were so painfully uncomfortable and awkward for me to watch and enjoy. The relationship between the characters was so unclearly shown to me I couldn't even tell to which point did he come to with each individual girl.You know that feel when you watch a typical harem and you know which one is going to be picked, which ones are just extras and which ones will get the short end of stick? Yeah, nothing of sort is even remotely apparent here, except for the completely discriminated one I mentioned before, himeka.Maybe I'm being crazy and stupid. I don't know, that's just how I feel about the show as a whole. things started getting... I don't even know how to describe it.

How it leaves an impression for its viewers. And how it leaves the mind lingering in a positive way.It is what it is guys. I cannot say much any further. Honestly what\'d you expect from this anime, is what you are going to expect. BUT, It\'s really funny. It\'s so funny that it is worth watching.

Thanks for reading (sorry for terrible typing, sensor sucks)Alright,  Im not in the best condittion to write a review, considering I smashed my computer and using a phone but I really want to change the negative view cast on this show thus far.Please try not to mind typos cuz error seeking sucks- So I just began episode 7 confused cuz I totally forgot what happened last week. Ever fhave that happen to you? so I basically reviewed the last feww episodes and kinda get...it better. Point? Ep 6 - 7, watch out:PAnyways to the main section. Ill condense my whole review into this single section.Tis is twery fun to view, enjoyable and a nice watch. Sure, you may dislike a few heroines or two but with all of them, one is ought to flow your boat (a few lolis, tsundere etc.)The art, music and animation are near perfect in my opinion. At the very least it does not hinder with the anime.The characters are nice, with many different kinds so you will like a few and maybe dislike a few. Even so, some are just so adorable you can forgive the ones you dislike.Story, is mostly comedy, with  a few jojo references that I have no clue what it means (better get to watch jojo) but it is few and does not hinder the enjoyability.Rating-9Why? I watch it whenever it is released, no  questions asked and it cheers me up. Nice and good in almost every aspect and nothinng so harsh to make you go, crap lets hold it off, for like a year? (almost missed watching to aru majustu after touma got hit with the feather)Message: WATCH OR AT LEAST TRY, mostly shounen tho. I have no clue how a girl would view this show but if you like harems, comedy, and multiple heroines, give it a shot. You have nothing to lose but a ton of joy to be gained from watching is terrific show it better. Point? Ep 6 - 7, watch out:PAnyways to the main section.

The characters were generic and not interesting. The sound and art was solid overall, no huge mistakes in animation was made either. It is a light hearted anime, so don\'t watch it if you are expecting a tear jerker.Story(6/10)- The story overall is a generic school harem with the main character being an overall average guy with the girls being a childhood friend, a shy girl, a demanding girl, etc. There is not much...making this anime different than others in the core aspects besides the fact that one of the girls pretends to be from the protagonist\'s past life which the protagonist made up when he was in middle school. The main protagonist is trying to hide his embarrassing past so he would not be seen as a chuunibyou that is where some of the cringe- humor comes into play. Besides the cringe-humor, there is nothing else that is really funny in this anime. The ending is both unexpected and disappointing at the same time.Characters (5/10)- Like I said before, this anime has uninteresting characters. The main protagonist Eita is an average guy (for the most part) and he can\'t choose a girl he wants to be with, even though all of them would pretty much go to the semi-extreme to get him to like them. He knows that they like him, but, he is indecisive and that is another way this anime is not unique to other harems. Eita overall is uninteresting. The only interesting part about him is his relationship with his parent (which is skimmed over briefly which is a wasted opportunity) and his fantasies (which is highly over-used to a point where you don\'t care anymore). The main heroine Natsukawa is a popular girl that every guy had a crush on. She chooses the main protagonist because they are both ""anti-love"", meaning that they both despise love, which is ironic since they both of them start to make a liking for each other. You end up not liking Natsukawa as the anime goes on because she plots her plans to meddle with other peoples\' lives and they show very little romantic angles with her and the protagonist. There are some romantic angles to remind the audience that she can still end up with the main protagonist. The childhood friend character Chiwa is the run-off-the-mill childhood friend who lives next to the protagonist and she knows ""everything"" about him. She had a big impact on how the main protagonist turned into how he is now in the anime as shown by the scenes from the past. But, it is too obvious that she likes him. It is painful to watch her try to get him to like her since it is very cringy. She stops relationships from forming with other girls from the anime which makes you dislike her as well. She tries to squeeze her way into the main protagonists\'s heart and that is what makes me dislike her.  Himeka is the shy girl that is EXTREMELY uninteresting.  She is just there in the anime. There is no point in her being there. The only thing she has going for her is her fantasizing with the main protagonist. Then we come to Ai, probably the only character who I really like in this anime. She is quirky in a good way. Her awkwardness just makes you want to love her. The way she tries to get close to the main protagonist and how the main protagonist\'s best friend helps her out plan out their next move makes her a likable character.  She actually attempts to hide her crush with the main protagonist unlike the other girls. She is the most likeable out of the bunch because of the way she reacts to the main protagonist. But, she ruins her own character by being over aggressive.Sound/Art (8/10)- The music and art in the anime overall is solid. The music came at the right times and the art was average to say the least. There were no obvious mistakes in animation when it came to the finished product. The music is not unique or interesting however. For me, music in anime is absolutely essential. If the music is good, it could give that anime a few extra points. However, the background music was nothing to write home about. It was completely average. The opening is very annoying and predictable. They had the main heroines sing and it was overall annoying. I would skip the opening every time because of how annoying it is.Overall enjoyment (7/10- Skippable)- It was an average anime to say the least. There is really nothing that I think separates it from other harems. You can pretty much watch another harem to get your harem fix if needed. But, it is not horrible. Overall it is a light hearted anime that you can watch to the side since it is a short series. I would recommend this anime for anyone needing a harem fix or a light hearted anime, but it is skippable.*Im not a huge fan of harems overall, so my opinion may be different from someone who adores harems. making this anime different than others in the core aspects besides the fact that one of the girls pretends to be from the protagonist\'s past life which the protagonist made up when he was in middle school.

The better anime series radiate energy, creativity and professionalism: they may draw from many special anime ""worlds"" or genres while still appealing on several levels that transcend the limits of genre.  Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru, or Oreshura for short, certainly strikes a chord with me  (even tho its tagged as a Harem/Romantic Comedy anime).  The staff prove themselves keenly observant and talented, and can deliver the goods in story, voice, art, music, and production.I tend to let an anime reveal its story at its own pace, but...beyond its romantic comedy category, I found Oreshura to quickly establish its thing: playing with cultural tropes and interpersonal relationships.  The male protagonist Kidou Eita is depicted as a post-chuunibyou highschooler who is bent upon his studies, not all the ""love on the brain"" high school life he sees around himself.  Nevertheless he\'s helplessly swept into the romantic plans of several girls around him; the girls even form a high school club named Society Advocating Maidenly Excellence For All Girls, and a skeleton in his chuunibyou closet past is a key to dragging Kidou along.Oreshura can pop surprises: Eita\'s aunt Saeko, a writer/creator at a gaming company, triggers the concluding story sequences by enrolling the girls in her company\'s publicity-event contest.  But throughout, this anime\'s strong points are its agility in turning up amusing displays of cultural awareness, its attractive artwork and color palette, and storyline flow.

(do You know where this is going?) Then one day, he finds another semi-woman, who has majestically gushing silver hair, walking, she gallants over the empty battlefield of barrenity and storms of darkness, blinding her eyes of inner-cold heartedness... She finds, a regular guy, and procives... to play with he's mind like a playful whore, as she pretended to be he's girlfriend. If he tries to break up, she will give out he's note book to the rest...of the school, embarrassing the heck out of him! (and basically black mailing him) So, yes, Harem happens. (obvious fact)REVIEW:Let's be real everyone, the whole show is pretty much a Harem all the way through, we have the childhood friend, the generic woman hoarding protagonist, the quiet girl, and the obvious love interest, tsundere, etc... Its also a “Light Novel Adaptation” which means it has a 95% to be turdful. However, this is the same case, but slightly better. Why it can only be summed up within two words: “Natsukawa Misuzu” Because:Her character design is really beautiful. Period.She's the very feisty type as she can be playing with the protagonists mind as she loves teasing him all through out the show.She actually develops, into a very sweet character, but still keeps the feistiness which I like.Most of the time, she always seemed very happy and playful with this enjoyable aura.You just got to lover her personality.And Yes, she does have her emotional moments, and because of how well written she is, they actually work. However, for the rest of the cast; they are all Your completely generic archetypes used for like the seven millionth time! As they could not catch up with Misuzu's greatness, they are characters that I just can't take seriously as one of  the repeated formula for Harems these are far too overused. The story feels like a complete Harem, and You can pretty much predict whose girl is going to jump on the Woman Hoarding Lead's bed after the first episode. There are also JoJo refrences. Like, the author really loves JoJo, and he/she written Misuzu as a fangirl of JoJo, with some moment even stating flat out that this is JoJo refrence at some points in there interactions.So yes, Oreshura is Your completely 95% run of the mil harem. Why 95%? Misuzu, You will only watch this show for Misuzu if You do not enjoy the exact same repeated formula over and over again. Without her, this review would'nt even exist, as the show will only exist as one of the masses amount of generic Harems being released in Japan.

The character designs look a little different, yet refreshing unlike big bouncy juggernauts, with a darker colour scheme. It does the job in a slightly better manner.Music however, is nothing to talk about, it just fits the mood, and that’s all what it does.

And at first it seemed like a love triangle anime, and it was what first 4 episodes were about. And they were really really great! Then after that, with introductions of other girls, quality fell off. Some silly things started happening. It wasn't terrible but it was a sharp contrast to how great first arc was. But then when things settled into place, it just keeps getting better all the way to the end, and ends up surpassing the first arc.It has great characters, with actual development...(at least some of them). It's cute and funny, it has a distinct visual style that was pulled off well. It has high production quality. Great OP/ED. Great voice acting. But where it really shines among other anime, is that in the second half it takes itself seriously. It actually takes a bite at the harem genre and freaking deals with it! And deals with it well. Not in the School Days kind of way, but second closest thing to seriousness.The whole harem setting is set up in an impressively believable way. The character dynamics just work. Though some of its tropes are stuff we've been seeing a lot lately in the genre, so I wouldn't say it's a deconstruction of the genre, but it the next best thing.  I'd say this is the best harem anime. The only ones in league with it are Haganai and Korezom, but for completely different reasons. Haganai is incomplete so it cannot be fairly compared yet. And KoreZom is a parody full of craziness. And School Days is a full on deconstruction.Mayo Chiki is generic traditional harem done right. In comparison to that, Oreshura is not something I'd classify as generic harem. It's a step above that. It's a great romcom that happens to tell a story that falls into a harem genre. But it goes so far and beyond in seriousness, quality writing and actual romance that it's a step above Mayo Chiki. But note that it is different from it, it even has no blunt fanservice. Fanservice is in the league with Sakurasou or Haganai, and maybe even tamer. (at least some of them). It's cute and funny, it has a distinct visual style that was pulled off well.

In some ways, OreShura is no different than those. But with a great cast of characters and somewhat unique scenario, it manages to stand out, at least a little bit. For the sake of my own sanity, I\'m gonna divide this review into 6 sections: Story, Art, Sound, Characters, My Enjoyment, and My Overall opinion of the anime. I\'ll make sure to keep it spoiler free. I\'d just like to point out that these are my opinions and mine alone, so feel free...to disagree. With that aside, let\'s begin.StoryThe story is essentially your typical harem affair: An extremely dense main character (Eita) is starting high school with his childhood friend who harbors feelings for him (Chiwa), then suddenly a new, stereotypical, foreign, rich, school beauty appears (Masuzu) and decides the MC is going to be her boyfriend (but not really). Add in the delusional but devoted to the MC 8th grade syndrome girl who believes the two were lovers in a past life (Himeka), and his childhood fiance who he met before his childhood friend that manages to continue harboring feelings for him (Ai) and you have the pieces of a generic harem anime. While the plot is predictable and bland in many respects, the latter parts manage to be at least a bit unique with a few twists and it should be enough to keep you watching. Of note though is the somewhat iffy pacing, with one of the girls being first introduced more than halfway through the 13 episodes. It could have been laid out better or more efficiently if you ask me.ArtThe anime has a very pleasant art style in my opinion, very colorful and vibrant with animations of faces and characters appearing smooth and well-detailed up close. Some of the background characters and art feels lazy by comparison, but it\'s not awful or something that would completely take you out of it by any means.SoundThe opening and ending themes for the anime are ""Girlish Lover"" by all the female lead\'s voice actresses, and ""W:Wonder Tale"" by Masuzu\'s voice actress, Yukari Tamura. Both are fairly pleasant pieces and fit the feel of the anime, even if the former is a bit childish. The anime\'s OST is decent as well, with nothing in particular standing out, but the songs that blend so perfectly in the background doing just enough to keep it flowing.CharacterNow this is where someone could argue that OreShura shines. The cast of girls is one of the stronger you\'ll find in any harem, from the hopelessly law-abiding and marriage-obsessed Ai to the straight-faced and childish but terribly entertaining Himeka. Despite conforming to stereotypes of anime and manga of the same genre, the characters feel real and believable, with their dialogue going smooth and life-like, and their personalities being decent enough to feel compassionate towards them when the show calls for it. I especially liked Himeka and Chiwa\'s characters quite a bit, with both being great performances that can make you grow quite attached to them. Eita\'s character felt like a weak point (by comparison anyway), but thenagain, many harem MCs seem to be.EnjoymentSure, it was far from perfect. And some of the moments did make me cringe and shake my head, but it was an overall great ride. I can honestly say I wasn\'t bored once watching this anime. I was always waiting to see what happened next or how certain events would turn out. There were quite a few laughs too, even a bit of emotion (not nearly enough to induce tears if that\'s what you\'re looking for, sorry). Definitely an entertaining ride.OverallWhile the anime lacks in its story and doesn\'t wow you with its soundtrack, its lovable cast of characters and entertaining (if a bit cliche) moments should help you trudge through it. Definitely not a ""MUST SEE OMG BEST ANIMU EVAR"" type show, but if you\'re looking for a decent harem with a likable cast, you could definitely do worse.Thanks for reading! to disagree. With that aside, let\'s begin.StoryThe story is essentially your typical harem affair: An extremely dense main character (Eita) is starting high school with his childhood friend who harbors feelings for him (Chiwa), then suddenly a new, stereotypical, foreign, rich, school beauty appears (Masuzu) and decides the MC is going to be her boyfriend (but not really). Add in the delusional but devoted to the MC 8th grade syndrome girl who believes the two were lovers in a past life (Himeka), and his childhood fiance who he met before his childhood friend that manages to continue harboring feelings for him (Ai) and you have the pieces of a generic harem anime. While the plot is predictable and bland in many respects, the latter parts manage to be at least a bit unique with a few twists and it should be enough to keep you watching. Of note though is the somewhat iffy pacing, with one of the girls being first introduced more than halfway through the 13 episodes. It could have been laid out better or more efficiently if you ask me.ArtThe anime has a very pleasant art style in my opinion, very colorful and vibrant with animations of faces and characters appearing smooth and well-detailed up close. Some of the background characters and art feels lazy by comparison, but it\'s not awful or something that would completely take you out of it by any means.SoundThe opening and ending themes for the anime are ""Girlish Lover"" by all the female lead\'s voice actresses, and ""W:Wonder Tale"" by Masuzu\'s voice actress, Yukari Tamura. Both are fairly pleasant pieces and fit the feel of the anime, even if the former is a bit childish. The anime\'s OST is decent as well, with nothing in particular standing out, but the songs that blend so perfectly in the background doing just enough to keep it flowing.CharacterNow this is where someone could argue that OreShura shines. The cast of girls is one of the stronger you\'ll find in any harem, from the hopelessly law-abiding and marriage-obsessed Ai to the straight-faced and childish but terribly entertaining Himeka. Despite conforming to stereotypes of anime and manga of the same genre, the characters feel real and believable, with their dialogue going smooth and life-like, and their personalities being decent enough to feel compassionate towards them when the show calls for it. I especially liked Himeka and Chiwa\'s characters quite a bit, with both being great performances that can make you grow quite attached to them.

I was kind of confused, I was wondering whether or not Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru would get a second season. When I found out that it didn't, I was kind of disappointed, as at the end of Ep 13 there were still many unsolved plot threads that needed solving. Even early episode plot threads did not get answered in Ep 13, well sort of. Though overall it's not that big of a problem and does not affect the scoring in big ways.Another Issue I had with the...main plot was that it lost its original goal. Being anti-love, I was expecting the main male lead to hate love for the majority of the episodes, but I guess my theories were wrong. It just turned into a classic harem story.Though that's not to say that this anime is bad, I definitely enjoyed it. The art and animation were well done and the sound for the anime was pretty good and on sync with the animation.Another thing that bothered me were the characters. As listed above I, I felt that some of the characters had lost their main personality trait and became cliche anime characters. This does not say that all characters are bad. I just believed that some of the characters weren't themselves from time to time in the later episode.To wrap this up, I believe that the overall score for this anime is a 6/10 and it is definitely enjoyable.

Why 6? Well, the plot of this anime is not that original not to say an abused type of plot where an ordinary kind guy, works hard and therefore starts to build up relationships and in the process gaining harem. He gains his harem by starting a club which is a bit common to high school flicks these days.His harem includes a...childhood friend, a popular girl with a dilemma and etc.Art: Rating 9. In my opinion the animation is one of the best this season especially at episode 1 where the guy wore a knight outfit.Enjoyment: Rating 7. Only seven because there's a point where you'll get bored and will want to skip certain scenes. It is also predictable so you won't be excited upon seeing the next episode.Sound. Rating 9. Listen to the opening theme and that will explain to you why 9. The BGMs are also quite cool.So yeah. Overall. It is a 7.

It\'s a harem rom-com with nothing massively revolutionary about it. HOWEVER, the way in which this show does this genre is probably the best of its kind.You\'ve probably already read the synopsis about this anime, so I don\'t need to go into great depths. It follows a guy who rejected all forms of love due to love leading to his parents leaving him, living alone. One day he sits next to the most popular...girl in the school, who gets asked out nearly every day. One day she approaches him and asks him out. On the way home, she explains that she has the same thoughts about love as him and they become fake partners. However, his childhood friend also has a crush on him, and she tries to cover it by claiming that she just wants to be ""popular"". So the fake girlfriend sets up a club for women who want to remake themselves and become popular. BUT WAIT, more people become involved in the harem, until it\'s an awkward 4 way harem, with each member being involved in the club.I tried to make it as non spoilery as possible, hence the crappy description, however each character involved and not involved in the harem are done extremely well, and you feel like you know exactly why each of them are in love with the main character.Without giving any spoilers, the last episode is done brilliantly well, with a very bitter-sweet ending.I\'d easily recommend this to someone who likes the genre. girl in the school, who gets asked out nearly every day.

It's one of those animes where the main protagonist isn't chancing love, but instead trying to fulfill another purpose even though it is an harem.Story: - 7/10 -The story follows a highschool boy named Eita, who wants to do something with his life. He wants to be a doctor so he can pay back his aunt who is his current guardian and to help a childhood friend. Everything starts of like a normal slice of life series however, he is one day met by the most beautiful girl in school. Masuzu, who blackmails him by using...his embarrassing notebook into being his boyfriend so the other boys can stop asking her out.The story itself isn't so bad and you may think it isn't unique but using blackmail for love is interesting and I like that because it's funny to see how things work out.Art: - 8/10 -Of course, the art is amazing. This kind of art is used for anyone who has been down lately and want themselves to cheer up. The artwork that has been done in this anime is a job well done.Sound: -8/10-The sound in this anime is good. Depending on the mood of the scenario, each soundtrack hasn't failed to impress. Other sound effects in the background such as crickets or the waves of the ocean also create an immersive effect but it's not consistently heard throughout the show.Character: -8/10-Characters in this anime were very interesting as they all had their own unique personalities. Masuzu was the serious fake, A-Chan the tsundere love crazy type, Chiwa the annoying one (Literally) and Himeka the weird one. Each one of them have their own backstories on why they're in love with Eita and it's pretty interesting. Each character has a unique voice to reprsent who they are and I guess that really pulled me into the show.Enjoyment: -9/10-I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I really liked how clean and refreshing it was and how It prevented itself from not copying other harems (Although some scenes were cliche). If a season 2 was going to come out, I would definitely watch it. The comedy in this show made me laugh a lot as it captured some really funny moments.Overall: -8/10-Overall I give this show a 8/10. I would have maybe gave it a 9 if the show didn't have so many obvious cliches. I wonder if they did 25 episodes instead of 13, it could have been interesting and it would make a much more impact on the viewer.TL;DR - Watch this anime if you've been down as it will lift your spirits up!Feel free to add me. his embarrassing notebook into being his boyfriend so the other boys can stop asking her out.The story itself isn't so bad and you may think it isn't unique but using blackmail for love is interesting and I like that because it's funny to see how things work out.Art: - 8/10 -Of course, the art is amazing.

Seriously.The biggest reason why harem anime has come into existence is probably because of the audience being comprised of people who want to have their dreams of having all the girls in the world chase after them fulfilled. Which is cool and all, cause without them, harem anime won't exist. However, with that dream fulfillment, you have a great compromise in quality.With Oreshura though, the anime just digs itself deeper. The harem just becomes so unrealistic that it is impossible to see the absurdities this anime...would go to. I cannot comment on them without going into spoilers.

The white girl just tries to blackmail the guy with a notebook that he wrote during his chuunibyou years, and keeps reading it aloud in front of everyone while the guy desperately pleads her not to do that. Which is fine, except how come no one in the anime gets the point that the notebook is the guy's notebook in reality? And the white haired girl keeps threatening to blackmail the guy with it for the entire anime, and the guy complies like a dog. How in the hell is that possible?The last is the complete ass pull at the end of the anime. I won't tell you what it is, but the anime ends in the most ridiculous way possible.

Then they introduce two characters, one of which thinks they were lovers in a past life and another that was a childhood friend as well. It's your general harem, nothing new. The only difference would be the situation between the MC and his girlfriend. But it was executed rather well, I'll give it that.Art: 9/10 I...actually really enjoyed the style of art! It's bubbly and light and really nice and easy to look at.Sound: 8/10 the op and ed were catchy and one of the few I didn't skip over. Any insert osts matched the mood rather well. I don't really pay much attention to sound though.Character: 8/10 if the story stuck to the main two rivals and the MC, I would've given a 9.5 for characters. Eita doesn't know how to handle love, he's very honest to himself, he can logically think, etc. I fell in love with him too tbh. Chiwa, the childhood friend, is rather annoying at times. However, she has good reason to be in love with Eita, trust me. But, in my opinion, the saving grace would be the girlfriend, Masuzu. She's a total bitch, I won't deny that. Especially in the first few episodes. But once it starts showing more of how she really feels and her internal struggles, I was able to identify and sympathize with her more, making her the most complex character.However, I can't ignore the delusional Hime and the tsundere Ai.

I have actually read some of the manga which was somewhat interesting so go check that out too. I've written a review before which was more of a rant, but this one will be a little more stable.Story: Read the synopsis. The story itself is original but gives me a somewhat desire to have more. The storyline can actually have the potential to be much much more, but cuts short. At sometimes the emotions in the scenes were pretty powerful which definetly evoked some feelings from me....Like I said, with some really good quality it could have lifted off but doesnt.The comedy, in my opinion, is just horrendous. I never chuckled or even grinned to the supposed comedic scenes because the humor is just so childish and overused. Example: Our female character Masuzu tortures our male character Eita with a diary he has written from his past (unfortunately in the past this poor sap was dillusional with his retarded gimmick burning fighting fighter so he wrote everything in that characters perspective). The amount of times Masuzu reads out his entries is ridiculous and continues to persist throughout the episodes.The romance is where this show actually shines. We have a fake couple consisting of anti-love activists which only purpose is to drive away annoying confessions (for the girl of course, Eita is just an intelligent nerd). As indicated from the title, a childhood friend is now involved with the love triangle (will later develop into a love pentagon) and the scenario is actually pretty depressing. The osananajimi (meaning childhood friend if you didnt catch on) is now torn apart because the boy she has spent most of her time with is now with another girl. The only problem with this concept is actually....nothing really. The real problem is that the directing is so bland and uninteresting, it seems like the situation is watered down. The extra 2 characters is simply not necessary but that would destroy the purpose of the harem category of the anime. I personally dislike harems because the amount of time to develop each character is way too short and this generally applies to this show also.This is going to be around 7.5 out of 10Art: The animations are mediocre so don't expect intense angles/perspectives to excite your eyes. However I will say the character's design is good and the colors are vibrant. The brightness of the hue actually bothers my eyes, not because of the beauty, but because there are simply no deep tones which is not aesthetically pleasing. The character are drawn nicely and the appeal of each individual sticks out well. I would personally grade this department a 7 out of 10. One more thing should be noted. The ED is absolutely gorgeous and the music is fantastic so if anything check that out. This deserves a 7.5 out of ten.Sound: Okay. No big surprise. The ED, however, has a great song and the emotional scenes are accompanied well with a sweet background music. 7 out of 10Characters: Contrary to typical shitty harem animes (like Kono Naka), the characters are entertaining. Like i've stressed earlier the character development is lacking. The final member of the harem joins during episode 7 which only leaves 5 episodes left to develop a good background and a progression for the story at the same time. Aside from this issue the personalities are interesting and have much variety. Oreshura has the popular types of tropes: tsunderes and kuuderes with a nice blend of distinctive attributes. The seiyuu's are good, however i must complain that Masuzu is boring to listen too and Chiwa's seiyuu steals the show. I give this a 7 out of 10Enjoyment: Yea I can say this was pretty enjoyable. The interactions i see and the situations that are created are somewhat fun to watch. I have to say, that this show is not going to make you become enlightened or suddenly jumpstart emotions. You will not be missing much from deciding to ignore this anime, but I would recommend taking a little peek for romance fans. I say this is 7 out of 10 (could have been 8 out of 10 with some tweaks)Overall: I don't know what to write here. do whatever you want Like I said, with some really good quality it could have lifted off but doesnt.The comedy, in my opinion, is just horrendous. I never chuckled or even grinned to the supposed comedic scenes because the humor is just so childish and overused. Example: Our female character Masuzu tortures our male character Eita with a diary he has written from his past (unfortunately in the past this poor sap was dillusional with his retarded gimmick burning fighting fighter so he wrote everything in that characters perspective). The amount of times Masuzu reads out his entries is ridiculous and continues to persist throughout the episodes.The romance is where this show actually shines. We have a fake couple consisting of anti-love activists which only purpose is to drive away annoying confessions (for the girl of course, Eita is just an intelligent nerd). As indicated from the title, a childhood friend is now involved with the love triangle (will later develop into a love pentagon) and the scenario is actually pretty depressing. The osananajimi (meaning childhood friend if you didnt catch on) is now torn apart because the boy she has spent most of her time with is now with another girl. The only problem with this concept is actually....nothing really. The real problem is that the directing is so bland and uninteresting, it seems like the situation is watered down. The extra 2 characters is simply not necessary but that would destroy the purpose of the harem category of the anime. I personally dislike harems because the amount of time to develop each character is way too short and this generally applies to this show also.This is going to be around 7.5 out of 10Art: The animations are mediocre so don't expect intense angles/perspectives to excite your eyes. However I will say the character's design is good and the colors are vibrant. The brightness of the hue actually bothers my eyes, not because of the beauty, but because there are simply no deep tones which is not aesthetically pleasing. The character are drawn nicely and the appeal of each individual sticks out well. I would personally grade this department a 7 out of 10. One more thing should be noted. The ED is absolutely gorgeous and the music is fantastic so if anything check that out. This deserves a 7.5 out of ten.Sound: Okay. No big surprise. The ED, however, has a great song and the emotional scenes are accompanied well with a sweet background music. 7 out of 10Characters: Contrary to typical shitty harem animes (like Kono Naka), the characters are entertaining. Like i've stressed earlier the character development is lacking. The final member of the harem joins during episode 7 which only leaves 5 episodes left to develop a good background and a progression for the story at the same time. Aside from this issue the personalities are interesting and have much variety. Oreshura has the popular types of tropes: tsunderes and kuuderes with a nice blend of distinctive attributes. The seiyuu's are good, however i must complain that Masuzu is boring to listen too and Chiwa's seiyuu steals the show. I give this a 7 out of 10Enjoyment: Yea I can say this was pretty enjoyable. The interactions i see and the situations that are created are somewhat fun to watch. I have to say, that this show is not going to make you become enlightened or suddenly jumpstart emotions.

I thought that would be obvious; it be her accomplice."" -Mana NatsukawaI\'d like to start out by saying that this review is going to be somewhat influenced by my own personal opinion, and I will also try to stray from revealing any spoilers about the plot.Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru (Whew, I\'m going to refer to it as Oreshura) is in some ways (referring to the BEGINNING of Oreshura and the MC only) similar to the newly released Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. The MC differ in a few ways; level...of intelligence, home and family situation, and knowledge of what is going on around them. While Hikigaya Hachiman is witty and downright negative, Kidou Eita is determined, smart, and kind. The main similarity they share is how they got to where they are. They both were rejected by female peers, they both, through their anti-love attitudes end up forced into clubs and then proceed to be surrounded by women. This is however where the pair of anime begin to split. While Oregairu begins on a path to comedy and character presentation, straying from the romance and harem themes, Oreshura walks the path of a common harem romance anime with some tasteful fan service included.Characters: While evaluating characters I mainly look at their personality. In Oreshura I managed to find all of the common personalities in standard harem anime, with one exclusion of Masuzu Natsukawa. Regarding Masuzu, at the moment, I can\'t put a pin on what to tag her as, tsundere,tsun,dere, or downright weird with the personality changes she goes through. But like Masuzu, Eita, Hachiman, Yukino (from Oregairu) are similar in their anti-love antics. Of course in harem anime there is either one of the following personalities which I will represent through similar characters in other harem anime I have watched. There is the  Hikigaya Hachiman, there is Ichika Orimura, Rito Yuuki, and Tomoki Sakurai. In Oreshura, the main character, Eita Kidou most likely falls under the character of Ichika Orimura because of their similar personality of kindness to all and downright obliviousness to everything that goes on around them. The other characters including the main character harmonize well and show some character development mainly regarding the romance theme to Eita Kidou that contribute fairly to the plot. I won\'t say it was amazing, but their conversations between each other during their club meetings and activities made me laugh. Burning Fighting Fighter uses Black Flame! (XD You\'ll understand after watching). My favorite parts in this anime regarding the characters have to be the delusions each has.Art and Sound: The opening and ending theme kind of reminded me of the To Love Ru series but I\'ve never had to complain about the OST to an anime series before. The art wasn\'t sharp and amazing, but smooth and nice that didn\'t detract from the overall value.Plot: Well the plot wasn\'t too bad, I saw much originality in how each harem character was introduced into the main character\'s life, and the way their daily slice of life episodes went about were slightly different from what I have seen. Although the ending and beginning have to be common, since it IS a harem themed anime, the overall unending of harem themed anime cannot be seen elsewhere. The plot developed quite nicely, regarding the main characters interaction with each of the girls and providing some background information here and there that wasn\'t needed but when shown,but very appreciated later. At first in an episode I thought they were going to through in some Yaoi (which I just can\'t tolerate) I was like WOAH... But in both a negative and positive way I was relieved and disappointed. Introducing that minor theme would have been somewhat interesting to the harem anime since I\'ve yet to see it, but as I stated above, I can\'t tolerate homosexuality. The story wasn\'t too cliche to the point where I was bored, but nicely presented in a comedic, romantic way.Enjoyment: I enjoyed this anime for mainly 2 reasons. The comedy it provided in the main characters delusions, and the romance between the main character and his kanojo. (I\'m a romance nut). I would recommend this anime to anyone who has seen Oregairu, or into the harem/romance themed anime.Thanks for reading!-Nebarto of intelligence, home and family situation, and knowledge of what is going on around them.

I don\'t want to scoff any of the points I\'ve thought about well watching this anime, so I hope I can convey every thought I want here. Firstly, even though there\'s a lot of them, I want to address the negatives right away this time. This review will be spoiler heavy, so I will cut off here with a short, non-spoiler version to start off. Then separate it from the main, spoiler review with a visible warning from when it starts.Hmm, explaining the entire context concisely without spoilers. Uh, let\'s see, the main character loves to study,...but every girl is instead trying to get on his dick. Despite coming off as nice to each other, all of them are pretty mean to the male lead. The main girl in particular makes his life a living hell. If you watch all of this, I can assure you that you are expecting another mostly generic harem. Bright points are the art style being nice to look at, voice acting being pretty top notch and the soundtrack is quite nice on the ears. All of the tones for the girls, even for Japanese voices, sound fairly distinct from each other.Upon finishing the whole anime, I believe you could identify every one of them by their voice. This anime won\'t leave very much to remember and, at least I felt, it has a lot of mental stress the longer you watch it. For those who dislike watching an innocent character get tormented, this anime may not be for you. Nothing too physically brutal, but more verbal. Sometimes, public shaming. I would suggest watching it with a friend to get a better experience with it, since there\'s a lot to nitpick more than there is to wholesomely enjoy.(END OF ""I want to see this for myself"" REVIEW)So, before we can analyze it, we must explain it. Ore no Kano- Oreshura follows the plot of studyholic Eita as he tries to pursue a difficult career path and insists on studying whenever he can, being the top of his grade. He has a childhood friend who mooches off of him frequently, named Chiwa. Short, petite and cute enough to be perfect eye candy for loli viewers. And will most likely be girl of their choosing as you realize the rest are pretty developed in comparison.Our story starts here, then. Eita wants to study a lot, goes on about how love is worthless and is, more or less, content with being single for the rest of his life due to certain family circumstances that made him grow to hate the very idea of it. Then out of nowhere, a new transfer student- this isn\'t the part you care to read about, you know how this goes. She naturally becomes the main girl for the rest of the anime upon her introduction, but not in the ways you\'d expect.Enter Masuzu, a literally self-proclaimed bitch whose whole goal is to make the viewer hate her, but despite this, she still ranks pretty high on this site. That\'s because your hatred toward Masuzu is actually justified for the story they\'re telling to make sense. Her character is very hateable, so much so that even the other girls dislike her a lot. I have more to say on her, but we will get to that later.The only other significant male character is Kaoru, who is pretty dormant for a good chunk of the anime and initially serves as Eita\'s lunch buddy at best, offering mild dialogue and opinions toward Eita\'s strenuous situations. He comes off as a bit of a trap, but is still pretty boyish in design. I imagine a good handful of viewers were fooled, however.The story unfolds a bit more, now with all these characters set to be the only ones you see for a little while. Masuzu actually has a blackmail plot set in motion for Eita, starting by trying to get him slightly closer to her. Then, upon walking home from school together, she reveals that she has acquired his personal journal, which contains stories of his chuuni-driven youth. From here, she threatens to expose all of his embarrassing thoughts to the world, but will hold onto them safely as long as he pretends to be her fake boyfriend. Masuzu meets Chiwa shortly after and the three eventually end up in an unofficial school club about, you guessed it, love. And from here, the anime continues to fold with these characters and their antics, primarily involving Masuzu setting up bizarre schemes for the sake of having fun watching other suffer, as well as she herself occasionally reading off of Eita\'s journal to Chiwa, describing them as wise words of her first love. Eita, always, sits through these and suffers.Himeka, uh, I really can\'t describe this one for very long, even knowing I am now allowed to delve into the plot more. There is a comical, then brutal, fight scene that breaks out fairly early on in the anime and Himeka is one of the bystanders during this. Through witnessing this, she immediately falls in love with Eita. Himeka serves as the most absurd of the girls due to her abrupt introduction and similarly being a chuuni, same as Eita, albeit she still embraces it. She has cute characteristics, but is also busty and has a relaxed voice on top of this. For the more unique fetishists out there, Himeka may have something for you.Then, the same events continue, now with Himeka present in the club as well. The most notable moments that Himeka commits to are when she first meets Eita, as she was very quick to embrace him, much to the annoyance of the other girls. She is the only girl in the anime besides Masuzu who blatantly lies to everyone, calling Eita her ""ex-boyfriend"" to explain why she is so affectionate around him. And, occasionally, she tries to embrace him whenever she can, as well as making him feel sexually frustrated due to her innocent personality, attractive body and similar chuuni ideas.Lastly, we are introduced to the most flamboyant girl of the four, Ai. You think you\'ve seen it all, but you have never seen a tsundere like Ai before. Initially starting off with the trait more generically, she blossoms into one of the most unique girls in the entire cast. Frequently being manipulated and teased, Ai is meant to make the viewer laugh and nothing more almost all of the time. Indeed, her greatest trait is that she is a tsundere character that also serves as comical relief. Perhaps, the first I\'ve seen in an anime and most likely why she ranks above Masuzu.Now that all of the girls are into play, the anime begins to develop them as it continues. As you would expect, Masuzu gains the most development, but quantity isn\'t necessarily quality, even in the anime world where most are cursed to have only twelve episodes. Yes, even a character that doesn\'t have very many scenes can outshine one that has a multitude, but we will get on that later. The anime\'s dynamic remains, mostly, unchanged.The most notable change to happen to the default flow is that Kaoru, previously only a lunch buddy of Eita\'s for quite a number of episodes, is now a significant character due to the fact he knows Ai very well and, unlike any other character in the anime, is able to control her very well, isn\'t afraid to be blunt with her and actually manages to swing in another dynamic that isn\'t the usual antics of Masuzu or her club. Eita, Kaoru and Ai actually have quite the handful of scenes together, which is a nice change of pace from the normal flow you grew used to, as Eita is not tormented and their conversations feel more natural.I really don\'t believe I am scoffing anything, despite how airheaded my statements sound. If you watch the anime yourself, you will grow to see that it really does unfold pretty similarly. But, now that I have a lot of context out of the way, it\'s time to delve into the negatives.Every girl in the anime actually has their own personal moment with Eita at one point, something I actually did appreciate...at first. It came off as healthy exposition, was a good way to get to know them and it made it seem like there would be more unique developments. Despite this, however, the girls still generally treat Eita the same as they did when they first met him, much to my annoyance. This annoys me in a lot of anime, however. There are scenes where the female seems like they are respecting the male more, but then they still go back to the same dynamic, as though they are acquaintances again. As such, Oreshura is not breaking any new ground with this, but it\'s certainly still annoying nonetheless. And for an anime that actually does a fairly good job at tying the girls\' backstories together, it\'s shameful they don\'t feel that important when their bonds don\'t feel like they\'ve strengthened with Eita, yet seem that way with one another.As I said before, Masuzu has frequent scenes where she reads off Eita\'s journal in front of Chiwa, but that further expands to all the other girls. I find it extremely annoying since you have to sit through her shamelessly reading his personal sentiments in front of others, sometimes in scenarios where there\'s abuse humor from them slapped onto Masuzu\'s reading. Most notably, one instance where Chiwa wanted to hear something from it one time, due to the way Masuzu phrased it, and both her and Himeka held down Eita, forcing him to endure it and being whacked whenever he tried to stop it. These scenes, I believe, served no purpose at all in the anime other than to be funny to those who love this stuff. As I have said, more times than I can count by this point, a lot of people love abuse humor. More power to you for being able to laugh a lot at it, but even trying, I can not see why it is funny to see Eita suffer, especially due to how nice his character is.Which brings me to my most notable point, the suffering. Unlike other abuse humor cases I\'ve witnessed in anime before, Eita\'s pain seems really dark by comparison. The worst of it actually begins around the arc where they go to the beach, to determine who is the one for Eita. As a bonus, of course, these episodes tailor toward the viewer seeing every girl in their bathing suit, a classic anime trope. However, one of the running gags really did not sit well with me. They managed to break new ground in one area, I suppose.Okay, so you have the standard ""melon breaking"" game taking place. Guess who is the one- Eita. They blindfold him, but don\'t give him a stick to hit the melon with. Pretty interesting, so this grabbed my attention to see how it would go. They said to use his head to hit the melon and all of the girls are giving him directions as to where the melon is, with some of the lines actually being pretty funny. Masuzu is the last one to give him a direction, completely different from where everyone else was guiding him. Oh, but I left out some context. Eita and Masuzu are being suspected of being a fake couple by this point, so Eita intentionally chose to follow Masuzu\'s word over the others, despite how obvious it was that she was in a completely different direction. He finds some ""melons"" alright and this scene was almost pretty comical, as I was wondering why he had to use his head to hit it over a stick in the first place. He falls onto Masuzu and begins inadvertently groping her, following the other classic trope of ""why is this so soft"" and my expectations were that this scene would end, maybe, with Masuzu trying to comically push him off and say he is ""too daring"" or something.Much to my surprise, however, all of the other girls, knowing he is blindfolded, scolded him for being a pervert and, not joking, duct tapped the word ""LEWD"" (in Japanese) onto his back, so that once he ripped it off, it would leave the mark. Now, this may not seem as dark as I made it out to be, but what really sets me off about it is that he has already had a bonding moment with each of the girls by this point, on top of all of them knowing how Masuzu is. Eita was blindfolded, yes he did go out of his own way to listen to Masuzu himself, but he definitely did not intentionally aim to grab her chest. The ""squeeze"" thing is just a trope that they do cause they\'re confused as to what they\'re touching, so that doesn\'t really count as an intentionally perverted action. It just hit a lot of wrong notes for me, due the exposition I was given before, and I feel the punishment he received was very harsh.The same thing happens one more time, this time with one word for each arm, when he is trying to encourage Himeka to go up onstage for a certain scene. Basically, Himeka gets one more deep moment with Eita, she does the usual embrace, but this time, Eita embraces her back, saying something very nice to her (watching the whole scene, with the atmosphere and all, helps more than me explaining it in its entirety) and it\'s pretty meaningful. But, after this, the duct tape punishment happens again and, well, I thought it was a bizarre thing to do to him.There\'s a lot more I could go on about, but then it might sound more like a rant and less like a review, so I wanted to keep it as short as I could. It\'s fairly obvious by now, but abuse humor never sits well with me since it\'s usually executed in very poor ways. I\'m not blindly hating on the whole anime over it, but rather how it uses it. And it happens a bit more in the series beyond the beach arc. It\'s just hard because his character remains so nice and he receives little to no reward for this kindness.Oh, but I suppose I did say I would mention the positives at the end this time. One thing Masuzu said really hit me pretty hard. ""No matter how well I pretend to be your girlfriend, I can\'t do anything about time."" I have witnessed certain relationships that ""blossomed"" way too early and the one thing Oreshura made clear was that Chiwa has the deepest bond with Eita out of the other girls. Indeed, you need time to have such a bond with someone. And as manipulative as she was, I appreciated that quote a lot.And, well I surprisingly did not bring it up once earlier, Eita actually has random phases where goes into what I\'d like to call ""Chuuni Mode"" as his eyes go absurd and he transforms back into his wild, youthful self, complete with the imaginary backstories he made up and moves. The first time this happened was rather hilarious, but he actually does this during that ""fight"" I mentioned earlier. It starts off with him being in that mode, which is why Himeka fell in love with him in the first place. He does it only a few more times throughout the anime, but it was honestly such a nice deviation of character that I am upset it did not happen more. Or rather, I am upset he has had a lot of stressful situations with the girls and did not think to channel this source. It may have been out of character for him to rely on it through such means, but it this ""form"" of his was honestly so entertaining that I am sad it is spread so much throughout the anime. It would have been a hilarious running gag if it happened at least once in every other episode, if not every episode.Oh, and a more minor one, but I actually appreciated a lot of the action that this harem has. I don\'t mean fighting anymore, but sexual. Eita gets hugged quite a bit in the anime, his fake girlfriend kisses him a few times (he even does it once to her) and, overall, it helped certain scenes shine more. In a lot of anime, where romance is the target, I do not see enough action. Maybe I suppose it\'s because I understand Japan is far more serious about stuff like this, with hugs and kisses conveying far more serious connections, but that\'s perhaps why they felt so special this time around. Masuzu obvious has the most action since she is pretending to date him, but Chiwa hugs him a good amount of times and even kisses him once, so look forward to that if you came down here with the intention of reading spoilers beforehand. I can assure you it\'s quite adorable once you get to it, but it\'s the last scene in the anime, so you will have to wait a while. It expresses the most clearly that she wants out of the Friend Zone. As I said before, Himeka does hug him a lot, but her youthful spirit could play a role into that as well, as I believe she does not fully understand how love works and believes you can be that affectionate all of the time, even when you\'re not really dating. Only about three of the girls really gave him anything more than a hug.I gave this anime pretty harsh scores, but I\'m content with them. I do believe the story suffered due to the characterizations being out of whack at times, certain abuse humor really killing the more ""serious"" impact those ""bonding"" moments could have had and, well, a lot more things. Look forward to every scene with Eita entering Chuuni Mode, every deviation that strays away from the harem formula and tuck yourself in because it is a rough ride. Oh yeah, I forgot, Masuzu has a sister. Her relevance and substance to the plot is so standard that I actually advise you watch it yourself instead of hearing it from me. I\'m sure some of you, reading this after watching, thought I forgot about her. But no, she just wasn\'t that significant. Oh, but wait, I did say ""three of the girls"" earlier. Yeah, she actually does kiss him once and is the only one who wanted to make out with him in the anime too, as her character is genuinely perverted and almost worse than Masuzu.But yeah, this one was a mouthful, but I wanted to make sure I conveyed every thought I had about Oreshura. You don\'t have to avoid it, because I think the unique experience is still worth it due to the fact it could vary from person to person, some might even love how it unfolds. I have at least one favorite scene from it (EP12, 4:02-4:30) that managed to make me laugh the most out of any other instance in the anime. I\'m sure you will enjoy it too.Oh, so you read all the way to the bottom, huh. Just a note of warning, I figured I\'d spoil who he actually ends up with down here, since I partially cared enough to reveal it, should the viewer have any hope he ends up with one of the normal girls.Sadly, it\'s the obvious one. He stays with Masuzu. I wanted Ai to end up with him. but every girl is instead trying to get on his dick. Despite coming off as nice to each other, all of them are pretty mean to the male lead. The main girl in particular makes his life a living hell. If you watch all of this, I can assure you that you are expecting another mostly generic harem. Bright points are the art style being nice to look at, voice acting being pretty top notch and the soundtrack is quite nice on the ears. All of the tones for the girls, even for Japanese voices, sound fairly distinct from each other.Upon finishing the whole anime, I believe you could identify every one of them by their voice. This anime won\'t leave very much to remember and, at least I felt, it has a lot of mental stress the longer you watch it. For those who dislike watching an innocent character get tormented, this anime may not be for you. Nothing too physically brutal, but more verbal. Sometimes, public shaming. I would suggest watching it with a friend to get a better experience with it, since there\'s a lot to nitpick more than there is to wholesomely enjoy.(END OF ""I want to see this for myself"" REVIEW)So, before we can analyze it, we must explain it. Ore no Kano- Oreshura follows the plot of studyholic Eita as he tries to pursue a difficult career path and insists on studying whenever he can, being the top of his grade. He has a childhood friend who mooches off of him frequently, named Chiwa. Short, petite and cute enough to be perfect eye candy for loli viewers. And will most likely be girl of their choosing as you realize the rest are pretty developed in comparison.Our story starts here, then. Eita wants to study a lot, goes on about how love is worthless and is, more or less, content with being single for the rest of his life due to certain family circumstances that made him grow to hate the very idea of it. Then out of nowhere, a new transfer student- this isn\'t the part you care to read about, you know how this goes. She naturally becomes the main girl for the rest of the anime upon her introduction, but not in the ways you\'d expect.Enter Masuzu, a literally self-proclaimed bitch whose whole goal is to make the viewer hate her, but despite this, she still ranks pretty high on this site. That\'s because your hatred toward Masuzu is actually justified for the story they\'re telling to make sense. Her character is very hateable, so much so that even the other girls dislike her a lot. I have more to say on her, but we will get to that later.The only other significant male character is Kaoru, who is pretty dormant for a good chunk of the anime and initially serves as Eita\'s lunch buddy at best, offering mild dialogue and opinions toward Eita\'s strenuous situations. He comes off as a bit of a trap, but is still pretty boyish in design. I imagine a good handful of viewers were fooled, however.The story unfolds a bit more, now with all these characters set to be the only ones you see for a little while. Masuzu actually has a blackmail plot set in motion for Eita, starting by trying to get him slightly closer to her. Then, upon walking home from school together, she reveals that she has acquired his personal journal, which contains stories of his chuuni-driven youth. From here, she threatens to expose all of his embarrassing thoughts to the world, but will hold onto them safely as long as he pretends to be her fake boyfriend. Masuzu meets Chiwa shortly after and the three eventually end up in an unofficial school club about, you guessed it, love. And from here, the anime continues to fold with these characters and their antics, primarily involving Masuzu setting up bizarre schemes for the sake of having fun watching other suffer, as well as she herself occasionally reading off of Eita\'s journal to Chiwa, describing them as wise words of her first love. Eita, always, sits through these and suffers.Himeka, uh, I really can\'t describe this one for very long, even knowing I am now allowed to delve into the plot more. There is a comical, then brutal, fight scene that breaks out fairly early on in the anime and Himeka is one of the bystanders during this. Through witnessing this, she immediately falls in love with Eita. Himeka serves as the most absurd of the girls due to her abrupt introduction and similarly being a chuuni, same as Eita, albeit she still embraces it. She has cute characteristics, but is also busty and has a relaxed voice on top of this. For the more unique fetishists out there, Himeka may have something for you.Then, the same events continue, now with Himeka present in the club as well. The most notable moments that Himeka commits to are when she first meets Eita, as she was very quick to embrace him, much to the annoyance of the other girls. She is the only girl in the anime besides Masuzu who blatantly lies to everyone, calling Eita her ""ex-boyfriend"" to explain why she is so affectionate around him. And, occasionally, she tries to embrace him whenever she can, as well as making him feel sexually frustrated due to her innocent personality, attractive body and similar chuuni ideas.Lastly, we are introduced to the most flamboyant girl of the four, Ai. You think you\'ve seen it all, but you have never seen a tsundere like Ai before. Initially starting off with the trait more generically, she blossoms into one of the most unique girls in the entire cast. Frequently being manipulated and teased, Ai is meant to make the viewer laugh and nothing more almost all of the time. Indeed, her greatest trait is that she is a tsundere character that also serves as comical relief. Perhaps, the first I\'ve seen in an anime and most likely why she ranks above Masuzu.Now that all of the girls are into play, the anime begins to develop them as it continues. As you would expect, Masuzu gains the most development, but quantity isn\'t necessarily quality, even in the anime world where most are cursed to have only twelve episodes. Yes, even a character that doesn\'t have very many scenes can outshine one that has a multitude, but we will get on that later. The anime\'s dynamic remains, mostly, unchanged.The most notable change to happen to the default flow is that Kaoru, previously only a lunch buddy of Eita\'s for quite a number of episodes, is now a significant character due to the fact he knows Ai very well and, unlike any other character in the anime, is able to control her very well, isn\'t afraid to be blunt with her and actually manages to swing in another dynamic that isn\'t the usual antics of Masuzu or her club. Eita, Kaoru and Ai actually have quite the handful of scenes together, which is a nice change of pace from the normal flow you grew used to, as Eita is not tormented and their conversations feel more natural.I really don\'t believe I am scoffing anything, despite how airheaded my statements sound. If you watch the anime yourself, you will grow to see that it really does unfold pretty similarly. But, now that I have a lot of context out of the way, it\'s time to delve into the negatives.Every girl in the anime actually has their own personal moment with Eita at one point, something I actually did appreciate...at first. It came off as healthy exposition, was a good way to get to know them and it made it seem like there would be more unique developments. Despite this, however, the girls still generally treat Eita the same as they did when they first met him, much to my annoyance. This annoys me in a lot of anime, however. There are scenes where the female seems like they are respecting the male more, but then they still go back to the same dynamic, as though they are acquaintances again. As such, Oreshura is not breaking any new ground with this, but it\'s certainly still annoying nonetheless. And for an anime that actually does a fairly good job at tying the girls\' backstories together, it\'s shameful they don\'t feel that important when their bonds don\'t feel like they\'ve strengthened with Eita, yet seem that way with one another.As I said before, Masuzu has frequent scenes where she reads off Eita\'s journal in front of Chiwa, but that further expands to all the other girls. I find it extremely annoying since you have to sit through her shamelessly reading his personal sentiments in front of others, sometimes in scenarios where there\'s abuse humor from them slapped onto Masuzu\'s reading. Most notably, one instance where Chiwa wanted to hear something from it one time, due to the way Masuzu phrased it, and both her and Himeka held down Eita, forcing him to endure it and being whacked whenever he tried to stop it. These scenes, I believe, served no purpose at all in the anime other than to be funny to those who love this stuff. As I have said, more times than I can count by this point, a lot of people love abuse humor. More power to you for being able to laugh a lot at it, but even trying, I can not see why it is funny to see Eita suffer, especially due to how nice his character is.Which brings me to my most notable point, the suffering. Unlike other abuse humor cases I\'ve witnessed in anime before, Eita\'s pain seems really dark by comparison. The worst of it actually begins around the arc where they go to the beach, to determine who is the one for Eita. As a bonus, of course, these episodes tailor toward the viewer seeing every girl in their bathing suit, a classic anime trope. However, one of the running gags really did not sit well with me. They managed to break new ground in one area, I suppose.Okay, so you have the standard ""melon breaking"" game taking place. Guess who is the one- Eita. They blindfold him, but don\'t give him a stick to hit the melon with. Pretty interesting, so this grabbed my attention to see how it would go.

Even though I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone.. It's got the typical standard thing for any type of harem type anime.. Childhood friend? Rich girl? Strange and Quiet girl? Overly in love girl? All done and dusted! ALSO this is one of the most important things.. The main male lead is not a pussy and when he let's say kisses someone? He doesn't freak out like a little bitch and sky rockets himself into the sky like all the other anime series.. :DStory 8/10: Really enjoyed that they went through...the entire series with the fake girlfriend thing and it ended the way it ended.. (even though chiwa shouldn't of kissed him.. ffs chiwa!!) I felt like it was a nice refreshing way to look a harem and see it develop into a nice new story I haven't seen yet.

Really glad they made it this way around where the guy didn't get noticed and the girl noticed him and it was really refreshing to see these two characters develop their emotions like this instead of them being left out all the time. I'm also glad to see how each character really affected each others life and it came out for the best in the end.Enjoyment 9/10: I really enjoyed how they made the two characters come together and how it ended up with everyone, apart from the kiss at the end Chiwa! Chiwa ya lil bitch... You had your chance and you wasted 9 years on it! ffs! I would highly recommend this to people if you're looking for a good harem type series where it will end in him choosing a girl... (I personally love these types of harems..)Overall 9/10: As said I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend this series to others."", 'Oreshura:Story:Eita (Main Protagonist) Aims in High School to get into the National University School of Medicine, As he has a main focus in life everything else is not important, Including ""Love"" until Masuzu, the school beauty with the silver hair who has the same views on ""Love"" blackmail\'s Eita to be her ""Fake"" Boyfriend to try and stop the attention she gets daily.I think this synopsis is pretty unique and peeked my interest from the early few episodes but after a while this series went downhill.Characters:Harusaki Chiwa is Eita\'s childhood friend, she lives next door to him and one that has been pushed into...the ""Friend-Zone"" Her whole back-story and development is really good, Best part of the whole show in my eyes and as a viewer i really felt sympathy with her and her situation.Natsukawa Masuzu is Eita\'s ""Fake"" Boyfriend, as the story has already explained, after this whole blackmail situation, Nothing really happened even including her character development.

The light novels went further than the show, so if you're looking for your complete and definitive ending you may wanna look elsewhere.The comedy is usually funny which is a bonus, however the art, music, and character isn't really out of this world.

I still consider myself an amateur to the whole anime scene, so take my words with a grain of salt.7/10 story.Storywise it isn't too bad. The plot was well established, the romance (or harem) part was good, not much to complain about really. Just like a lot of harem animes I've seen, this anime takes more of a Slice of Life approach, with no real direction of any goal, and simple but reasonable backstory to back the situation. So don't expect to feel attached to the anime, it just does what harem animes do and indeed...this anime does it right.9/10 art & sound.In my opinion, A-1 Pictures is one of the best anime producers in the scene, having seen many of their animes, this anime lacks no flair and/or quality the other animes have presented. One suggestion though, from me personally, is that I would like the colours to be more vibrant, but at its current state is fine too.6/10 characters.-As to characters, it's not bad per se, but it could've been so much better. I'll try to review this without spoilers, assuming you haven't been spoiled from the comment section yet. A particular relationship in this anime is pretty unique. Two people who take the concept of love from a different perspective. This anime could've done so much more with their perspective of love, like spending some time on their thought process and/or more elaboration. But it simply neglected the idea and brushed it aside with a simple explanation with tasteless Ex Machina.*I will only be talking about characters which I think wasn't well presented. As to the other characters, they were good and average.*-Himeka AkishinoThis character absolutely did the light novel series no justice. Her introduction was loosely tied together and besides a sloppy explanation, it provided absolutely no backstory or reason as to why viewers would want to root for her or as to why she should be a strong contender for the main protagonist's love interest.-Ai FuyuumiShe revealed she was a childhood friend of the protagonist that he had met ten years ago. The story didn't elaborate on their childhood even the slightest bit and thus her status as a childhood friend becomes absolutely worthless and thus providing no sentimental value for us to empathise or even for her to be a strong contender.So I hope this review helped in some way.

OreShura is a rehash of a rehash of a rehash. And when you\'ve gone past two rehashes, that\'s not a good thing. That\'s a very bad thing. A very, very bad thing. And normally I\'d keep quiet about shows that I didn\'t enjoy, but I feel like some points nevertheless must be addressed about this particular show, to serve as a warning.I was thrown off by how much I disliked the female lead (Masuzu). She explodes onto the scene and attracts everyone\'s attention, typical oujou-sama style....Her character isn\'t too bad looking, and at this point I\'m thinking, ""She must be a pretty interesting character."" But I was wrong. The show attempts to make her as contemptible as possible, which I don\'t understand the reason for. I just didn\'t get it. It felt like the authors WANTED the viewers to feel absolutely frustrated with how shallow and character-lacking she was. It felt like I was watching a piece of paper flopping around and interacting with other, equally floppy pieces of paper, cut-outs of characters and their images. No special quality. No uniqueness to distinguish their place and role in the show. A bland continuation of ""going with the flow"" and ""force the situation onto the main character"". The way Masuzu just forced herself onto the main character\'s life was incredibly irritating and unnecessary. It created a gaping hole in her character that would not be filled for all the episodes to come, no matter how good of a relationship the main character builds with her over time. Her introduction was a failure, and her reservations and desires of the main male character were empty and unsatisfactory.A bit strange to talk about the main character after the lead female, but this is the crux of the issue. As with many harem shows, this main character is nothing more than the embodiment of what I refer to as, ""personality in the gaseous form"". That is, the character is so devoid of its own characteristics and decision-making abilities that it fails to impact the plot in any major way. Not solid, or even liquid, but pure gaseous. It seeps through events, almost blending completely into the background, and only when the plot needs a push does he perform ""the right thing"".  The viewer is unable to penetrate the veil of ambiguity that is the main character, which defeats the purpose of a clearly told story. While I understand it\'s a harem and that anything can happen in a harem, the story does not even attempt to make the viewer even a little emotionally invested in any of the characters, or anything that\'s happening. The MMC is a combination of weakness and head-strong personality, the worst mix possible. I felt like throwing up whenever he played his ""Because I\'m righteous"" card. Give me a break.The conflicts, which would normally serve as the jumping points for emotion, plot progression, character development, and a shift in the flow of the events, are also forced and trivial. Petty. Unsubstantiated. Unreasonable. They held little meaning to me, especially when the antagonistic forces were as equally trivial as the protagonists. Or perhaps, it was simply because the main character was, again, quite weak.Hah. I just realized who some of the characters remind me of. So like, Masuzu is probably a scaled down, much less interesting version of Chitoge, from Nisekoi, and Hime (the third harem member introduced, because that is where I stopped), is also the equivalent of a scaled down, much less interesting Rikka, from Chuunibyou. I don\'t know about the childhood friend.The reason I gave it a 6 and not a 5 (as tempted as I was) was that, it is understandably difficult to flesh out every single character in a 13 episode show. The artwork wasn\'t too shabby. And admittedly, there were a few moments when I thought my mouth would give a ghost of a smile.A combination of poor character development, poor characters in general, petty conflicts, and lack of motivation to care about the characters, however, all contributed to making this quite a disappointing 6-episode trial and a waste of time.

Trying to forget this horrible past, he gave up onto creating any kind of close relationship with girls, dedicating himself on studying the whole time... That until Masuzu gets transferred to the same class...Finding someone who is as cold as her, Masuzu takes this chance to force...Eita on being her fake boyfriend. That way, other classmates would stop bothering her, but what about Eita? His childhood friend really believes on this act and it feels like betrayal... Moreover, two liars can always develop feelings for each other...{ART - 8/10}The intense use of light colors and a simple, yet gorgeous design, made the overall art look as sweet as the OP theme itself. Fantastic intro and ending themes, full of visual effects, feature amazingly made backgrounds and a huge variety of unique paints!{SOUND - 7/10}Background music is always making presence to make up for the lack of effects (that aren't need). A cheering song, featuring the voices from all four girls, is featured on the OP theme, while a slow and tender one plays during endings.{CHARACTERS - 5/10}Starring too few and common personalities is one of the weak points. However, both Eita and Masuzu stand out, due to their pretty original attitude. They share a mutual hate for love and just want to be alone, moving on and living peacefully. The whole act thing may change this conception a little bit...Three other girls are pulled into this battlefield, as they try to prove their love for Eita. Being a childhood friend should give Chiwa some boost onto reaching her objective (and actually does). Cheerful, gentle and fragile, her love for Eita can't be measured. Later introduced, Himeka also suffered from chuunibyou and strongly believes being Eita's alter ego girlfriend. She's the cute and quiet type one. Ai represents a total tsundere and deliberately tries to make Eita remember from a promise they both made in the past.{ENJOYMENT 10/10}For a long time, I felt just like Eita: unconcerned about futile matters and focusing on important things. I guess I could identify myself a bit with him... The meaning underneath all this situation is that we can always hurt ourselves, but this shouldn't keep us from being happy, with or without love...{OVERALL - 7/10}Love may be unkind.

A cheering song, featuring the voices from all four girls, is featured on the OP theme, while a slow and tender one plays during endings.{CHARACTERS - 5/10}Starring too few and common personalities is one of the weak points. However, both Eita and Masuzu stand out, due to their pretty original attitude. They share a mutual hate for love and just want to be alone, moving on and living peacefully. The whole act thing may change this conception a little bit...Three other girls are pulled into this battlefield, as they try to prove their love for Eita. Being a childhood friend should give Chiwa some boost onto reaching her objective (and actually does). Cheerful, gentle and fragile, her love for Eita can't be measured. Later introduced, Himeka also suffered from chuunibyou and strongly believes being Eita's alter ego girlfriend. She's the cute and quiet type one. Ai represents a total tsundere and deliberately tries to make Eita remember from a promise they both made in the past.{ENJOYMENT 10/10}For a long time, I felt just like Eita: unconcerned about futile matters and focusing on important things. I guess I could identify myself a bit with him... The meaning underneath all this situation is that we can always hurt ourselves, but this shouldn't keep us from being happy, with or without love...{OVERALL - 7/10}Love may be unkind. It can tear you down from deep inside, make you forget about your main ambitions and even turn you into a totally emotionless being. It all depends ln your choices, so it's not to be blamed at all... Eita doens't understand this particular feeling very well and he knows that it can turn his life upside down. Yet, he can't deny the existence of tenderness on his heart... The question is who should be the one receiving it from him..."", 'TL;DR: A budget show, story, plot, creativity and art-wise. Episode 1 = Good. Don\'t bother with the rest.Looking back on it, this show was nothing more than 1 actual episode and the rest is cliche along with fillers.The only episodes worth watching are first and that mostly just the first half, that\'s what made the show interesting. If you wanna see the direction the show takes, watch until episode 3. That\'s a -dead end-(don\'t quote me on that).Rest of the show is your common romantic comedy(as casual as it gets, like your TV movies/shows. It\'s like watching Titanic for the 27th time). I liked...how it started, it was quite smart and human for characters to start off like that. Neither we\'re too confident or too stupid and they acted in a manner that made it good. Then, there\'s the rest of the show.. How his girlfriend went from ""same as you"" to ""madly in love"", ""a bitch"", and also ""the devil"". His childhood friend went from a good friend to a chiwawa that screams all day and acts so tsundere it\'s unbearing. Saw this show many times before. Saw it done better. Saw better comedy and episodes which order would matter, but here not;MC went from uninterested to ""oblivious/dull"" and he gets criticized for it; So much screaming in this show!! I\'m not having my volume at 100 yet I can hear her from the other room, good thing I didn\'t watch it on TV. It went like a rollercoaster, from kinda good to absolutely ignorant. Eventually get got all boring.(What do you do when you have no more imagination or things to do with your current characters? Add more characters! - Japanese anime/manga creators.)I liked the style of the Art though (so bright sometimes), but some faces made me laugh like their eyes we\'re dark dots that moved sideways while zooming in.

This is pretty interesting since a hero and heroine are not ""an idiot who have love in their brain"". This makes them unique from everyday male harem protagonist. He still have delicate side to girls but not much, but what makes this anime 7/10 is even though the story have a good development is there\'s many mysterious thing that unsettled, such as Masuzu past, maybe it wasn\'t worth attention much if we can just guess by ourselves but for some people (including me) it bugs me..Art 10/10Smooth colouring, refreshing...style, and nice artwork.

The worst part to all this is the animation isn\'t all that bad they just had to get rid of the glowinessSoundI mean... it\'s studio recorded? I don\'t know why this is even a section it sounds ok I guess but I don\'t really focus on audio all that muchCharacterThe characters are awful people however the show doesn\'t seem to realise that these people shouldn\'t be rooted for they constantly paint them in good light while making them do horrendous things, let\'s look deeper.Masuzu throughout the entire show is blackmailing the MC in a an awful way, not only this but she steals his first ever kiss and constantly sets out to ruin his time with friends (See episode 10). Masuzu has not a single redeeming quality as a character and should be treated as the villain in the show but instead she\'s one of the heroines.Himeka has no right to even be apart of this harem literally just hugging the MC one day and deciding ""Yeah I was your ex girlfriend in a past life, now date me"" and the MC just goes along with it and never says to her ""Please stop, you\'re scaring me"" or something to that effect. She has no personality what so ever and no interests or ambitions, you could take her out the show and nothing would change in any of the dynamics and it\'s only in episode 11 the other girls even really acknowledge her existence.Fuyuumi is a terrible person using her influence as a hall monitor to break up the maidens club just so the other girls can\'t hang out with the MC anymore and that\'s just her introduction. She constantly lies about a fake boyfriend for no real reason and is hung up on a marriage certificate drafted 10 years ago by someone primarily ignoring her. All this brings me to my next point, were they really even childhood friends? I mean he doesn\'t remember her at all and most of the clips we see is mainly him ignoring her so to me it seems that she might have a few screws loose.Kaoru is a terrible friend, I mean first of all they knew the MC is ""going out"" with Masuzu and him and Chiwa ""flirt"" but they\'re still gonna try and add in Fuyuumi to the mix? All this and then start leaning on him in later episodes all flirtatiously did they see what happened in School Days when you try and pull that stunt?Chiwa is best character in the show but at the same time doesn\'t fit in the show because everyone in the show is such a bad person that she seems too perfect. But none the less let\'s discuss why she should of been final choice.-They\'ve known each other for 9 years and have pretty much spent the whole time hanging out together-After she got injured he dedicated himself to getting good grades to become a doctor on the off chance he could help her in the future. He also learned to cook just for her and she comes round for meals pretty consistently throughout the show-She lost her goal in life and as such is trying to become popular to replace it but as the show goes on she does this less and less showing actual character development (Something everyone else lacked).-When she gets sick one episode he spends the day with her and even helps rub her back, this shows his dedication to her is even greater than his gradesIn conclusion she should of won and he should of really cut the other 4 out of his life and found some better friends (Yes, Kaoru too)EnjoymentYou know how some shows you can watch all the way through in one sitting? You know some shows you have to stop after a few episode or even one episode? Yeah, I had to stop this show every 10 minutes because of how cringe inducing most scenes are.OverallThe show feels like it had no real goal in mind except to make a bit of money for the studio and it lacks any compelling elements that make you go ""Yeah I\'d watch this again"".

This show has opened my eyes, I now can appreciate those one dimensional aspects of other shows. why? It's pretty simple I have a strong dislike for this show and here is why.StoryThere always has to be an explanation for why the protagonist suddenly becomes a chick magnet. In this show's case its because he was blackmailed and had a lot of action while he was younger. In the case of being blackmailed, it makes no sense why he cares about keeping his secret....First of all his plan is to study, not to stand out and to avoid love because of his parents. If people found out about his secret, would it matter? He is already a loser and it also would keep love away from him. But then after being blackmailed he involves his childhood friend which is then manipulated by the same person so why does he still go along with it. Also the jojo refrences are a headache that is in the show solely for the viewer to feel like their special for having watched or read a unrelated series.ArtThis is something that is hard to screw up and hard to perfect. This show is not anything special art wiseCharactersFirst of all I do not like any of the characters. The character Musuzu is unlikable, her personality is that of a villain, yet the viewer is supposed to like them? Her past is brushed over and vague yet easy to guess, and she screwed up the main character's goal because she was selfish. If this show only had her and Chiwa then the show would not be as bad. That gets me to Hime a girl so gung-ho on past lives that they forgot to add her personality. She devotes herself to a delusional nerd that has has no memory of Hime existing yet they don't portray them as a stalker. Instead of them adding her to the club and harem they should have added her to the FBI watch list.SoundSound is mixed properly and played at appropriate times there is nothing else to really say about it.OverallThis is one of the first shows I gave a one to and I do believe it is deserved compared to the other things I've seen.

What's the appeal here? We got a standard harem show where it's blatantly obvious who's going to win from the start except it's not standard in the following ways:- the protagonist is not perfectly average but actually the highly driven star student that is popular and well-respected but known to have zero interest in romance.- the protagonist does not have a heart of gold at all and is in fact dismissive and uninterested about the drama in the life of others most of the time.- the winner is not a...normal tundere and is never verbally or physically aggressive but nevertheless openly a manipulative, selfish bitch.- the winner starts out as winner already; blackmailing the protagonist into faking a relationship to avoid getting unwanted attention from othersThe interactions between the protagonist and deuteragonist are actually very refreshing and charming this time around with the deuteragonist being completely confident rather than the usual flustered and uncomfortable with his own emotions. The rest of the harem cast however serves no function to the plot; their interactions with the protagonist are uninspired and their character designs bland. It's not interesting to watch in any way opposed to the sly manipulative behavior of the deuteragonist.Were it just for the interactions between the two primary characters this series would be very entertaining but it's diluted into interactions with many other characters that provide no way to move the plot forward; the rest of the harem stands no chance and that's obvious from the start. The only appeal the harem adds is if the viewer actually just enjoys it for nothing more than the power phantasy of obtaining such a devoted ensemble of suitors — I don't get the appeal.So be one looking for an excellent developing romance between a stand-offish academic overachiever and an amoral, cynical, manipulative master troll then this might be the show one is looking for; one just has to accept that it's diluted with uninteresting harem filler and that every character in the entire series except for the protagonist's guardian has romantic feelings for the protagonist not to mention the unrealistic scenario of all these suitors seemingly ignoring the fact that the protagonist for what they know is in a relationship with the deuteragonist despite the præmise of the series being that they're merely prætending.Could I give separate ratings for the Eita–Masuzu parts they would be 9/10 and the rest stuck at 3/10. normal tundere and is never verbally or physically aggressive but nevertheless openly a manipulative, selfish bitch.- the winner starts out as winner already; blackmailing the protagonist into faking a relationship to avoid getting unwanted attention from othersThe interactions between the protagonist and deuteragonist are actually very refreshing and charming this time around with the deuteragonist being completely confident rather than the usual flustered and uncomfortable with his own emotions.

The only appeal the harem adds is if the viewer actually just enjoys it for nothing more than the power phantasy of obtaining such a devoted ensemble of suitors — I don't get the appeal.So be one looking for an excellent developing romance between a stand-offish academic overachiever and an amoral, cynical, manipulative master troll then this might be the show one is looking for; one just has to accept that it's diluted with uninteresting harem filler and that every character in the entire series except for the protagonist's guardian has romantic feelings for the protagonist not to mention the unrealistic scenario of all these suitors seemingly ignoring the fact that the protagonist for what they know is in a relationship with the deuteragonist despite the præmise of the series being that they're merely prætending.Could I give separate ratings for the Eita–Masuzu parts they would be 9/10 and the rest stuck at 3/10."", ""ORE NO KANOJO TO OSANANAJIMI GA SHURABA SUGIRUOre no kanojo to osananajimi ga shuraba sugiru (yes that is a very long name), is a great little light-hearted romantic comedy. It is definitely one of the better light-hearted anime's as it doesn't try to be too much.PROSOre no kanjo's comedy is consistently above average. Although I wouldn't call it industry leading. I found the story line more or less believable but would've loved it to be extended a few episodes. Ultimately the best part of ore no kanojo was without a doubt it's light-heartedness, it's joyful and bubbly, just what it set out to do.CONSThe...character development is what i find to be the biggest flaw. Some of the characters, definitely would have significantly benefited from a bit more screen time as their stories felt underdeveloped and somewhat rushed.Should you watch?I think for most people that enjoy this type of light-hearted anime, ore no kanojo will be a pleasure to watch. You'll find it to be better than most other anime's in its league and it even has a few slice of life emotional moments. character development is what i find to be the biggest flaw.

None of the characters are especially interesting or unique, due to all the trickery there\'s an excess of cringe comedy in this show, which is really bad for someone like me who suffers heavily from vicarious embarrassment, but otherwise it\'s pretty run of the mill ""trying not to deal with a bunch of girls...who like you and are always around you"" kind of ordeal. It\'s not especially bad, hence the good rating, but it\'s not like it\'s unique or had enough of an effect on me for me to spend too long on this review.If a sequel comes out with a lovely secretive and subdued tomboy girl, I\'ll absolutely be back for more because that stuff is incredible.

Because the protagonist, ""Kidou Eita,"" (which I will refer to as protag) is basically a normal guy, he deludes himself in his fantasy that he is the ""Burning Fighting Fighter"" until his childhood friends hip injury and his families infidelity snaps him back into reality to try to become anti-love and to study to be a doctor. Though the anime isn\'t perfect and leaves quite the hole in your heart and mind towards the end of the story, you can find a shred of meaning...through watching the anime.The main problems with the anime are 1) The unclear ending, and stemming from this, 2) the lack of intention behind it all.For this reason, its important to look at the anime and extract meaning for oneself. Each love interest of the main character represents a tie to himself and his own situation; a bit of his own personality.1) Harusaki Chiwa: This is his \'osananajimi,\' or childhood friend. She is the main reason protag stays away from love and focuses on becoming a doctor, (she broke her hip in a car accident and he wants to heal her), which both causes her to fall in love with protag, and causes protag to stay as \'family\' with her. She represents his attempts to avoid delusion and enforce his repression of love.2) Natsukawa Masuzu: This is the special/attractive character of the anime. Masuzu\'s backstory is being forced to be the attractive puppet dragged along for business with her father, having to lie, act nicely, and hold a front constantly. Consequently, the plot is her lying and manipulation with the protag in order to achieve her own objectives. They both share trying to lie and escape from delusion, as protag had to force/lie to himself to stay away from love, and Masuzu had to lie her whole life. Masuzu constantly tortures the protag throughout the anime with his weird journal from middle school, but the weirdness is what causes her to fall in love with protag in the anime. She starts to love how he can be his usual weird self without being afraid of ostracization.3) Akishino Himeka: This character is similar to protag in that she is the weird/eccentric one, but she actually believes her delusions. In a way, she represents protag\'s weirdness/eccentricity.4) Fuyuumi Ai: Fuyuumi follows the \'tsundere\' archetype, and has childhood memories with the protag. The protag unfortunately does not remember them until she tries to remind him. Fuyuumi represents protatag\'s repression of love. That is why the author includes the fact that all of protags childhood \'lovey-dovey\' memories with her are forgotten, as he tries to run away from it to become a doctor. Fuyuumi is the most entertaining personality in the anime.Ultimately, the protag is forced to choose a partner, and he sort of decides with Masuzu, but it doesn\'t really work out as intended. Protag tries to reject each love interest to set things straight but fails with the opposite effect each time. The ending was a bit disappointing for me, but it after a while I realized something. The anime doesn\'t end with who protag chose as his love interest, but ends with the love interests being comfortable being in a \'battleground\' with one another. Every time the protagonist tries to move on the scale of delusion and normality, it just makes love and life even more of a battleground for him. What would you expect though, after all that is basically the title of the anime.This anime pissed me off, but I think you can take something from it. Every time you step away from authenticity, or run from life, it ends up making things far worse than it is. Just as the protag ran away from love, from delusion, from lies, and from normality, if you run away from yourself, you must be willing to accept that you will be trapped in an eternal battleground.My rating of this anime was originally 6, and should stay a 6 from face value, but looking at it from my perspective and trying to take something out of this anime makes it a 7. The story doesn\'t end here, it continues in the light novel, but it ends with an ambiguous story, just as the anime did, so don\'t expect clarity from that situation. I think it is good that it died here. It deserved to die here.

You have the dull ""WHOA I NEVER KNEW YOU LIKED ME"" MC, the tsundere, the quiet reserved girl, the childhood friend, BUT YOU HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A CONCLUSIVE ENDING HURAAY.(I won\'t spoil it don\'t worry)Story 3/10:I mean the story is nothing special. It\'s about a guy who is secretly a superhero dork who writes his little fantasties within his notebook BUT guess what? One of the main heroine discovers his notebooks and blackmails him to become her boyfriend. He agrees but the childhood friend comes in and feels threatened...by the new girl and this whole series is just a crap fest of which girl can steal the heart of the MC. LITERALLY nothing new. The story bored me and most romance anime do, trust me. But like I always say, a romance anime can literally have the crappiest story but if it has really personal and well thought out chracters then the author did a good job. The author does nothing right.Art 6/10:I always have been a fan of the A1 Studios art, it\'s very modern and clean and this anime is no exception. The colors are bright and cheerful and it fits the theme and setting of this anime pretty well. The art isn\'t something that I\'ll say ""WOW"" but it is appealing to the eyes.Characters 4/10:I literally only liked one character in this anime LOL. Every other character has such apparent character flaws that it honestly made me bored/annoyed everytime the characters popped up. I mean for starters the MC is really smart academically but bro you seriously can\'t tell that your childhood friend likes you? And there are two other girls literally saying that they want to marry you but you don\'t take them seriously and just try to avoid them. AH just like in every harem genre, the MC is a dimwit and it\'s just really frustrating.Overall 4/10:The anime was somewhat enjoyable because of Ai(that one character I liked). Everything regarding this anime was subpar but if you like a comedic and bright anime then I recommend this anime to you. Just to warn you though, even though there is a somewhat of a conclusive ending and is supposed to make the audience think ""What\'s going to happen next"" I literally did not do that and immediately closed my browser once I finished the anime.

The characters were adorable and the story was very interesting. I am really hoping for another season.I do have some criticisms of the story line though. As always, for the viewer to be able to deeply empathize with each of the characters, more development of them needed to be done. As it stands we know very little about the background of most of the girls. Yes, they all have some kind of connection to Eita, but we really don't know much about them. We also don't really understand what motivated Eita to declare his love for the one girl who...most tormented him. In order to understand that, we need to understand Eita's background better. Finally, the one girl who was most kind and loyal to Eita from the beginning, the one that motivated Eita to become studious and strive hard in school, was rejected. Why? What a cruel outcome. It just cannot stand, and I believe this hopefully will be addressed in any possible second series of this show. most tormented him.

I\'ve had my full fill of harem romcoms, and few hit the mark like this one does. And I\'m not just saying that because it has higher quality content, but also because it has DIFFERENT content. You might have no idea what I\'m talking about, so I\'ll be very specific.Each of the heroines actually has a real reason to ""fall in love"" with the protagonist. They don\'t suddenly start falling into his lap for no reason, but they rather each come to him in a well paced manner for very believable...reasons. Of course, that said, other romcoms aren\'t necessarily unrealistic in this respect. Girls and guys ask each other out all the time just because of physical or emotional attraction without anything deeper being there. However, the fact that there is a deeper reason behind each heroine loving the protagonist gives Oreshura that much more depth.There is also the concept of a fake relationship. While this concept might not seem unique, I\'ve only seen one other anime where it is central to the plot. The way this anime goes about the fake relationship is outright different than what I\'ve seen before. I can\'t say more than that without spoiling the anime. It might not seem like much, but even this alone makes it stand out from the vast majority of romcoms, harem or not.Oreshura also doesn\'t end in a way that just maintains the status quo. The final episode changes things significantly enough that a second season of this anime would not have the same feel in many regards. Again, I cannot elaborate without spoiling it, but the fact that this anime does not have a static ending sets it far apart from the typical romcom.Other than that I will admit it has many similarities to other harem romcoms (such as a sometimes far too clueless protagonist), but it is also not littered with certain things that plague other romcoms, like constant ecchi fanservice or lewd joke after lewd joke. While this show does have its fair share of comedy, it takes a turn for the serious quite often (and not necessarily in a romantic way).I watched Oreshura in two days. I would have watched it in one had I not had to sleep badly. I don\'t usually go straight through anime even as short as this, preferring to pace myself, but this one was so good that I couldn\'t help but be pulled into the next episode.I definitely recommend Oreshura to anyone who wants to watch a school romcom that is far better than the norm.Now, something for the MAL review elitists, even though the guidelines are not rules and my review has already met what a review MUST be. Plus, I actually have something relevant to say about each section this time. Feel free to skip this part as the review before this paragraph was the real review.STORY: 7/10The story was nothing special, though there is the potential for it to develop into a truly strong plot if one of the elements is developed more significantly. I was disappointed that element wasn\'t elaborated on more; however, given that this was only a 13 episode season I  understand why it wasn\'t developed more yet as it would have completely thrown off the pacing. Saving such development for later in the story is a good idea, but it means that the story covered in this season is nothing special. It\'s nothing profound. It\'s nothing that will change your life. But it\'s certainly good, good enough for me to say it\'s well above the average plot, though nowhere near a masterpiece.ART: 10/10I have one reason for giving Oreshura a maximum art score. And that is that the art is unique. While I like the typical style of anime these days, it is getting old to see the same exact style in almost every single new anime, and the same applies to the year Oreshura came out in. But Oreshura\'s art has an almost muted and pastel feel to the colors. Between that and the character design, which while similar to the typical style these days has large enough differences to distinguish them from other anime, I feel the art of this anime stands out against a sea of anime that look practically the same as each other.SOUND: 7/10This is the most pointless section in my opinion, as unless the sound or music are particularly noteworthy or terrible, it\'s not worth even mentioning. Perhaps the only value of this section is to make one\'s arbitrary score slightly less arbitrary if one even chooses to average the section scores. Nothing about the sound stood out in Oreshura. The voice acting was good, but not noteworthy. The opening and ending themes were actually quite catchy, but not something I\'d go out of my way to listen to, and the rest of the music was average and forgettable.CHARACTER: 10/10The characters are lovable and cute, but that\'s not nearly enough to warrant a 10/10. I give them a 10/10 because they are NOT typical of their character archetypes. Childhood friend characters are almost always boring with the personality and art design of a wet towel. And yet in this case, we a get a loli with short twintails wearing a collar that is quite eccentric in her own right and isn\'t a weakling that just rolls over to everyone else. The girlfriend character doesn\'t even have an basic archetype, which is absolutely refreshing. Her emotions bounce around so much, from friendly to harsh to loving to depressed, that you really buy this twisted girl as a real human being. She\'s not anywhere near hysterical, but she\'s also obviously not in control. She is the antithesis of extreme character types. The chuunibyo girl was the character I was most worried about being bland, but when they paired the chuunibyo trait with a kuudere-like quiet, monotone voice and very forward actions I was pleasantly surprised. I don\'t think I\'ve seen that combination of character traits before. The only character that comes even close to typical is the tsundere, and even then she\'s far more shy and dere than any tsundere I\'ve ever seen, though not nearly so much that I could consider her even close to being a dandere. And lastly we have the protagonist, who while he might not seem like much, is an intelligent boy who got to the top of his class through sheer determination, which is a sharp contrast to the average everyman we usually get for a protagonist. He is typically clueless about the heroines\' true feelings, and he does see them as an annoyance as many protagonists often do, but the rest of his personality makes him a character I\'m not used to seeing. He\'s not an idiot, and that is very refreshing.ENJOYMENT: 10/10There\'s not much point to this section given that it\'s clearly obvious I thoroughly enjoyed Oreshura. From start to finish, not even one episode disappointed me.OVERALL: 9/10The average of the section scores is 8.8, but I\'d already decided on a 9/10 before I even wrote this review. This anime is not one of my absolute favorites nor is it a masterpiece, but it very much stood out to me as a unique and well-written work.

I look forward to a second season, and if there isn\'t one, I\'ll quite likely buy the light novels or the manga.', 'Hey everyone, today I\'m going to make a looong (and I mean it) review about Ore no Kanojo - so here\'s my ""very gentlemen"" like greetings to all of you. Even if I really love romance, harem, and school-life themed anime, I\'m a total action-craver. So with that, me watching an anime like this, is pretty insane. But by watching this anime, I finally opened my eyes to the world of rom-com animes. But just FYI, this anime isn\'t a normal rom-com - it\'s pretty different from the ""normal"" ones.So, to start off, here\'s the summary of the anime that you guys probably all read,...but here I go anyway: ""Eita enters high school aiming for the National University School of Medicine. Because of his parents\' divorce—and his goal—he shuns anything to do with romance or love. One day, Masuzu, the school beauty with the silver hair who has just returned to the country, enters his life in a most unexpected way. Chiwa, his childhood friend since elementary school, will not let this go without a fight."" So now that the summary is out of the way, I\'m gonna start talking about my first impression before watching the anime. When I first read the summary, I thought it\'d be something like Accel World without the Brain Burst and all the actions (Shoutouts to all the Accel World fans. We really need a second season!). I thought it was going to be like ""the popular girl falls in love with the main character kind of thing like Accel World - except in this case, none like how Haru, the main character from Accel World, is a loser, and Eita is the smartest (not the nerdy kind) student in the whole school. But I knew I was wrong even before the first episode of Ore no Kanojo ended. It\'s more like Onisekoi in the sense of how they have to fake being a couple. Mazusu, the all-star popular girl is very manipulative, yet ""evil"" girl who uses Eita\'s probably one of the very few weaknesses - his fantasy-filled notebook he used to write. She threatens Eita to fake being her boyfriend so people would stop asking her out - being asked out 52 (or something like that)times in two months is self-explainable. She makes a club to lure Chiwa in, which later becomes their sort of HQ of some sort where the girls who like Eita (its a harem if you didn\'t know) meet up at lunch, and all the other stuff.Woah, I think I typed way too much.Art- 9I overall really enjoyed how things were drawn. By the way, I\'m very picky about how the anime is drawn. I NEVER watch anime with the old drawings no matter how good the story, song, or character is. Some people may have been annoyed how the anime was drawn, but in my opinion, I think it was absolutely enjoyable.Sound - 7The sound was, um, ""interesting"". The ending was better than the opening, but it wasn\'t too bad. The song overall is the song that fits the anime in a way, but I\'m thinking it could\'ve been much better.Characters - 9This is one of the greatest reasons on why I watched this anime. The characters were very good. Masuzu reminded me of Kuroyukihime a bit. Although the ""childhood friend"" Chiwa\'s words made me cringe time to time, and how she was annoying, the characters were absolutely fantastic. Most of the characters were the typical romance anime characters with different faces, they were unique from others. The characters were very deep, and it\'s one of the two anime where I like all the characters - Trinity Seven being the other (WE REALLY NEED A SECOND SEASON ON THIS ONE TOO).Story - 8The story was in between decent and good. The story was good, but not really my type. It would\'ve been better for me if Masuzu asked out Eita because she actually liked him, and if it would\'ve been the normal romance anime, but I know I\'m just being greedy because lots of the watchers out there loved how this anime was, and the fact Masuzu being like this is what makes Ore no Kanojo what it is.Overall - 8It was good, and if they were to make a second season, I\'d definitely watch it. Although, I really wish it could\'ve been more ""romantic"" between Masuzu and Eita, but I can\'t complain about that, because like I said, that was what made this anime what it is.Thanks for reading, and hope you didn\'t hate it so much :) but here I go anyway: ""Eita enters high school aiming for the National University School of Medicine.

These accouterments will be necessary to prevent certain special effects from infecting and spoiling our cloths; and our self-respect.The anime we will examine is ""Oreshura"", which I will use to name it in the future.That long Japanese monster of a title, while accurate; doesn\'t say anything to anyone, except a die-hard english speaking Japanese language enthusiast. A true Japanese person would have trouble explaining what that monster of a title means, to anyone but another Japanese national.I even tried to get a...direct translation of ""Ore no kanojo to osananajimi ga shuraba sugiru"", which gave me ""My Girlfriend and Childhood Friend Fight Too Much"". After receiving this translation, I just sat for five minutes, dumbfounded; that a title as innocuous as that, actually was important enough to produce an Anime of 13-chapters.But I digress. Oreshura translates to ""I Shura"". Which means the original long-monster title means something I don\'t care about, and the newer short title means absolutely nothing. ""Shura"" is not a \'person, place, or thing\' in this Anime. If you are confused by all this, you can imagine how confused I was about this.------------------But let\'s try to get into the Anime itself.1). Firstly, let\'s give a way a plot point, as a means of disassembling a non-sequitor. While there is an argument between our main character fellows\' girlfriend and his childhood friend, this happens so rarely in the Anime, that the title isn\'t anywhere near the mark. A closer title would have been; ""The Lion, The witch, and the Wardrobe"". Oops!? I can\'t use that, it\'s already taken by a live-action movie. Drat!2). The girlfriend. while the show goes to great lengths to point out that our two protagonists are not interested in ordinary puppy love, but instead are just trying to create a situation where both (but mainly the female) can avoid further dating requests and the usual behind the scenes comments from fellow classmates that just happen to like these two peoples\' looks. And we find that some comments are made snidely, and presented by people that aren\'t happy about anything.Now let\'s look deeper. This Anime had a real chance to take this story into a real character based mystery and blew it. The whole reason of the female \'Mazusu\' wanting to leave all that running and jumping behind, was not the constant approaches, but paranoia developed after total insanity came about while living with her father. Her father then decided she needed a change of scene, and sent her from Sweden to Japan, on the condition that she would be reported on, by her own sister, to their mutual father.Father had brought about a situation that forced his wife, their mother, to leave, never to return; leaving the two daughters to the fathers\' tender mercies. The narrative stops very suddenly, and we are never allowed to see the rest of the reasons for the tortured soul that is Mazusa.All the above is in the Anime, and I\'m told, elaborated upon slightly, in the Light Novel.Is she sane? No. Is she dangerous? No. Is she a conniving little rat, that uses her obvious physical allure to get what she wants? Yes! Should she be able to do this at the tender age of fifteen? Absolutely not! But she does. And the unfinished back-story to her character could have easily shown us a reason for this criminal but precocious behavior.And thereby hangs my objection to these goings on. We had a right to know how this personality evolved into the Mazusa we see in this Anime. Without that explanation, the whole story becomes weak and unsatisfying. Without it, the conflicts Mazusa creates with her rivals, becomes unnecessary. Mazusa connives in ways unusual, even for an adult of training, in the misleading of assailants (such as an espionage agent) for reasons that are unclear.She offsets blame, by using blackmail against her own partner. That stress leads to confusions of meaning between the person blackmailed and other females in his social circle. She uses temporal doubts, to allow her to be absent, when she promises to be places, and then complains when her partner does not get that she is playing a ruse. In other words, she assumes her beau is just as criminally clever as she is, and gets mad when he can\'t see the future, as a consequence of her thinking, while she leaves him out of the planning.Does she evolve as a personality? Slightly, but not in any way that means she won\'t do any of this stuff again. She even jokes about that possibility in the last episode, while laying on top of her fake beau, which of course confuses him. She is sexually adept in ways that he is not ready for, at his age. It becomes obvious that while she offers sex to him, in a philosophical way, she has no intention of actually carrying it out. Even though most of his other female friends would have no trouble completing sex with him.Which gives us another reason to want to know what the hell the completed back story has in it, that creates this conundrum. A psychologist would probably be able to get pretty close. I\'m gonna just pass something out there, and hope I get close. I\'m so distressed that the story in Oreshura is so weak, that I have to offer an alternative plot that fits the conditions of the present story line, while giving us a much stronger and edgy\'r product.What if the heavily dominated and controlled Mazusa was raped by her father?It explains his desire to place rigid and very strange controls on her, to the extent that her sanity finally cracked, and she ended up in a sanitarium for awhile ""trying to please daddy"". It would explain why her mother left in disgust, and was chased out of this home, in order to prevent her from creating an escape for their eldest daughter; and silence her in political ways. The wealth displayed is enormous. What if daddy is a politician? It explains why Mazusa\'s younger sister reports on Mazusa in a conspiracy against daddy.But most of all, it begins to give us an explanation for Mazusa\'s extreme and weird behavior, especially regarding her relations with boys her own age. It explains the social competence, while also givings us a cause for the desire to feel the air between her legs. She has this thing about wandering around with nothing under her skirt.---------------------------------------I place the above, as a reason to have doubts about the competence of the authors. They had a chance to make this into a true horror story, that begins as a rom/com, and ends in a tragic horror story that would have raised the hackles of everyone who watches, while never getting all the way to Hentai Anime. It might have started a new genre. But the opportunity was blown, while all the plot points are present, to try again, and make something great! And that being said, by me. A person that doesn\'t like horror stories, in the main.Because the plot is watered down, the dialog is very weak most of the time. The soundtrack is adequate, but not memorable. The opening and closing music is something I hate, which is J-pop, played fast, and in the process; creates a singing voice that sounds like a squirrel being strangled. A pity, as the singers are all people that are respected voice actors. The video and cartooning is a bit weak, as it is all done in fuzzy pastels (not a resolution problem, it\'s intentional); to make the scenes appear mildly romantic, even when the situations are anything else.And so I close this review, of a story with massive potential, never realized. A watered down mess, that ends with the viewer wanting to know what the future holds for our young fellow and his 4-female friends. And then their\'s his aunt, that told him outright, she wished he would chase her around the coffee table too. Another entire story arc, missed entirely.I give Oreshura a weak 6. direct translation of ""Ore no kanojo to osananajimi ga shuraba sugiru"", which gave me ""My Girlfriend and Childhood Friend Fight Too Much"".

Another entire story arc, missed entirely.I give Oreshura a weak 6.', ""Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru, shortened to Oreshura, is a harem comedy that I actually enjoyed and I hate the harem genre. My worst experience with the accursed harem genre so far was watching things like Girl's Bravo and Maburaho. Those almost made me quit anime altogether, quite frankly. Those disgusting, pandering, weirdly drawn boobs-in-face-every-few-seconds shows were not for me.• Although, we know from the first episode that one of the female mains, Masuzu, goes commando. Fanservice wasn't the centerpiece of the series.  I initially did not like Masuzu as much as the internet seemed to because she seemed like another...boring, witty Senjougahara archetype, but I eventually got woed by her feminine wiles and continuous Jojo's Bizarre Adventure references.• I grew up with things like Tenchi Muyo!, Ranma, and Saber Marionette J, so I guess a part of me wasn't completely opposed to the harem genre (even though the shows themselves are like average, average, and bad; nostalgia can be an important factor). Those mid-2000's harems were just the fucking worst. If you want to see the same three-tier female archetypes with multi-colored hair, rubbing themselves up and down a normal looking guy, who everyone wants to bang, then feel free to revisit that era of anime. I dare you. Better yet, watch Eiken.• The main character of Oreshura, Eita, is bland. He's like a less male power fantasy version of Araragi, in the sense that he altruistically tries to help girls. I barely even remember what he looks like. And besides the main two girls, the other two can be boiled down to crazy tsundere and zany chuuni girl with past life issues. Neither of them are acceptable options, in that regard. Though the main girls have their own set of issues, Masuzu being a habitual liar and Chiwa being the annoying childhood friend. I think being a childhood friend is the unfortunate curse in anime that means that you’re fated to never be loved.• Now that we know that the background characters have only slightly more personality than those of Plastic Memories (which had the most UNIMAGINATIVE characters of all time, if you didn’t sense the overwhelming sarcasm in the last statement), let's venture into the other aspects of the show. The characters are thrust into pretty typical situations like classrooms and beach episodes, so that really isn't important. I think the thing that was good about Oreshura, aside from bland protagonist syndrome, was that the characters are dysfunctional and have problems. Somewhat resembling the real world, except living life as a real person is not nearly as sexually appealing… or pastel.• Overall, it's enjoyable to watch. The character can be pretty typical to the light novel genre, but it was fun and there were some sweet romantic moments, as well as A-1 Pictures usually having enough cash to make something substantially good.

Don\'t get me wrong I enjoyed it, with gut wrenching awkward scenes and hilarious situational irony this show was a pleasure to watch.Eita (hope I\'m remembering that right) is the center of affection for his childhood friend who also happens to be his neighbor, Chiwa (also hope that is right). He studies hard everyday to strive for a higher goal of becoming a doctor, which leaves little time for a love life, but this is okay because each morning he rises and denounces the...very thing he has no time for. This all changes when the most sought after girl in school, Masuzu declares his love for him in front of their entire class. The pair rush from school hand in hand until Eita feels it\'s safe to confront her, upon doing so she pulls out a notebook (which I thought was a deathnote and got waaay to excited) and begins to read passages from it. Moments go by before Eita realizes this notebook is HIS old notebook and Masuzu now has the power over him to reveal all his childish fantasies to the rest of the world. This blackmail begins by Masuzu revealing that she also hates love and she enlists Eita as her ""fake"" boyfriend in order to keep all the other guys at school from pestering her about dates.It may seem a simple premise but when you throw in Himeka, the slightly delusional past lover from Eitas\' fantasies written in said notebook, and Ai-chan, Eitas\' original childhood friend whom he had forgotten about until she sprung on him a marriage license written by the both of them in their kindergarten years.All in all this anime is pretty great watch, and one of those scenarios that you could actually see happening in life where one person is the center of affection for multiple people, and you find yourself thinking who will he choose in the end. very thing he has no time for.

It was reminiscent of Chuunibyou in a way, with the whole Burning Fighting Fighter thing and all. It had an interesting premise, and I'm a fan of romances, so I thought I could get into it. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. OreShura was a grim reminder of why I shouldn't watch shows with a Harem tag.Imagine a semi-decent romance story. Okay. Now imagine 4 of them. In the same setting. With the same loser guy. I understand it serves as...some sort of fantasy fulfillment for some, but that's not what I'm looking for in an anime. It killed any sort of romantic tension it could've had.However, what pissed me off about OreShura (and what made me write this review) was the ending. Not because it was bad, it was par for the couse actually, but because they teased me with a very good ending in the first half of the episode, then killed it in the second half. Too bad, I was starting to actually enjoy myself until I was reminded that things would barely change at all, and that there would still be 3 girls going after a guy in an actual commited relationship.The comedy was good though. If the entire show was just Masuzu reding excerpts from the MC's journal I'd probably give it a 7. some sort of fantasy fulfillment for some, but that's not what I'm looking for in an anime.

You may be jaded by this genre by now, but do see if the humor strikes your funny bone. I am not sufficiently discriminating to provide individual rankings on story, art, etc. When I watch anime my faculties of discrimination are dormant. I can say that based on the humor my Enjoyment ranking is 10. This is probably an anime that I will rewatch when...I am in the mood for a good ol' comedy.

Too much harem is in this series. The Story is just a full drawn out bullshit love thingy which I cannot spoil but is completely immature and not worth watching. The art is great but the characters just get hell bent over such stupid stuff and makes it not very fun to watch. There was barely any enjoyment except when the stuck up girl fits into the picture. Honestly this anime felt very incomplete and the main plot towards the end was just a downwards spiral.Other words, watch another anime, this one is the worst I...had ever watched. had ever watched.', 'Oreshura genuinely surprised me. I can only summarize Oreshura as ""a roller coaster of emotions""... for all the wrong and right reasons. The anime lacked originality in its plot and development compared to other rom-com/harem anime out there. Even still, the anime was very light-hearted and enjoyable to watch at times.I don\'t think Oreshura is for everyone, but I don\'t want to discourage people from experiencing it. For the avid anime enthusiast looking to be analytical and be engrossed in an interesting and exciting plot, I wouldn\'t recommend Oreshura to you. For those looking for a chill, light-hearted, and overall energetic anime, I think Oreshura...would be an amazing title for you.Overall Score: 7.2Sound (9) - The musical elements implemented in Oreshura were top notch. Light-hearted moments were met with amazingly whimsical tracks. The music in Oreshura had a huge emphasis on the dynamics and pacing of the anime. A lot of the music/background music were really fun to listen to and got me excited.Art (7) - Pastel in nature, Oreshura came off very polished and aesthetically pleasing to the eye. While there weren\'t too many scenes that absolutely blew me away, I wasn\'t ever displeased at Oreshura\'s visuals.Characters (6) - More times than not, characters seemed very dense and were quite bland. Good writing assisted all of the characters, but none of the characters themselves seemed very original or inspiring at all. Every inclusion of a character was interesting and had a unique impact on other characters already established in the story, but nothing stopped them or another character from being pushed to the side the next episode.Story (4) - As previously stated, the story lacks originality and fine-tuning. After several episodes, Oreshura became repetitive with a story that was almost predictable all the way through. The plot isn\'t very enjoyable, sometimes becoming uninteresting. It was only halfway through the anime--when all main characters were established--that the plot began to thicken and become a topic of interest. Disregarding the latter half of the anime, it felt as though every single episode was a filler episode to another anime.Enjoyment (10) - Humor is a main theme in this anime. Almost every other scene can be attributed with a scene of good, light-hearted humor that eases how disappointing the overall plot is. The anime is also referential to other anime classics, alluding to popular titles like Dragon Ball Z, Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure, and many more. The humor in this anime is one of my favorites, and every episode had me bound to laugh, but that was pretty much it.

Not gonna lie, it does look unique compare to other harem animes.The majority problem is that scene cutting (anime editing)  is not good. But still a good anime, so you guys should check it out. "", ""I honestly came in and watched this with the lowest of the low expectations (that OP did not help, too), but I was pleasantly surprised how good it actually is.If you want my quick opinion, I recommend this to anyone who likes RomComs.  It's damn funny, and the romance is pretty OK. The art style is worth taking note of (very reminiscent to Sakurasou), and it also has some decent drama, if that's your thing. Now, on to the review.-Gael Cliche-OK, bad things first. The story is about a very beautiful girl who gets in a fake relationship to avoid creepers. Hilarity ensues. Gee,...haven't heard of that one before. They don't put in very many twists either, so the story gets predictable from time to time.-Choose Your Archetype-The cool beauty. The childhood friend. The stoic girl. The tsundere. The loli. Sigh. There is absolutely nothing wrong with archetypes, as long as you put your own twists in it (see: Steins;Gate, which uses harem archetypes (Kurisu is a tsundere, Mayushii is an airhead, etc.) in a non-harem setting). The problem stems from the fact that OreShura does very little in that department (the Mazusu-is-a-bitch route looked promising, but I feel they didn't exploit it enough).-Oven Ain't Hot Enough-Most of the characters, in my opinion, are under-baked. They get very little airtime, and most of that airtime goes to comedy routines too. Hime's introduction lasts only 2 episodes, and most of it isn't even her on screen. Ai gets introduced waaay too late into the story, so I wasn't that invested in her (which is a shame, since her character could've been good). But what pisses me off, Natsukawa Masuzu, the MAIN FEMALE LEAD, is UNDERDEVELOPED. THE. MAIN. FEMALE. LEAD. I mean, just...how?!To it's credit, Eita and Chiwa have really good character developments. I mean, it makes sense that Eita will be well developed (he is the MC, after all), but Chiwa? I mean, yes, I want each and every character to be developed well, but if you're going to pick only two characters to develop, why not pick, oh, I don't know, THE MAIN FEMALE LEAD?!-The Pet Girl of OreShura-On to the stuff I really liked. If you liked the general look of Sakurasou, then you are going to love this. The colors are all very light, and very easy on the eyes. I fell in love in first sight, to be honest.-My Rock-When it comes to RomComs, OreShura is a very solid choice. The romance is pretty OK- it has its moments now and then- but the comedy is where this really shines. This anime is absolutely hilarious. Seriously, if you want a good laugh, just watch the first few episodes. The notebook gag and delusions gag in particular really gets to me, just because of how relatable it is.-Natsukawa Mazusa-OK, I'm seriously not over this WHY IS THE MAIN FEMALE LEAD UNDERDEVELOPED?! I mean, geez...I could write a whole frackin' rant about this, but maybe some other time. haven't heard of that one before.

This review will contain spoilers, so if you\'re  watching it or haven\'t decided yet, proceed with caution.OreShura starts off with an interesting premise, with the whole blackmail thing and ""I used to roleplay because I\'m a loser"" whatever, but it quickly turns into a boring, predictable and frankly saddening display of a guy who kind of sucks at making reasonable decisions and has no charm...whatsoever.Once Ai\'s character is introduced, that\'s when I believe the show took a turn for the better. Ai Fuyuumi is, in my humble opinion, the best girl in the show. As the episodes with her develop, so does genuine chemistry between her and Eito. Once I got to ep 10, I was actually hopeful that this relationship would take off and bring us to some kind of epic finale where Eito confronts Masuzu about the notebook and stands against the embarrassment of his past to move on...And that\'s how the show SHOULD have ended. Instead, we got some half-assed moment of ""true emotion"" between Eito and Masuzu in the most forced confession scene I have ever witnessed followed by the friend-zone-ing conversations between Eito and the other girls. I was completely disappointed by this ending because that relationship that was, in theory, supposed to start off fake and become something real, but it just never does that. It stays a fake relationship for the entire show until the narrative forces it to change.Ultimately, I was disappointed by OreShura. I believe that Ai was actually the best girl in the show and that it should\'ve taken a turn towards that route, but hey, when you\'re the one making it, you can do whatever you want, can\'t you? whatsoever.Once Ai\'s character is introduced, that\'s when I believe the show took a turn for the better.

The show started off with a lot of potential... but that gets thrown out within 5 episodes and becomes a boring harem. I honestly skipped to the end (only 2 eps left) because i couldn\'t take how the show had nothing going on except weird clingy girls doing the obvious to a clueless cliche ""loveless"" guy. The show would of been great had it followed just him, the ""fake"" girlfriend, and his childhood friend. While going deeper on each of their backgrounds and have them grow.The other two...girls would of been better off in just being a story for a episode or two. Having them stick around feels pointless. They aren\'t interesting, they are weird, and really give now growth to the show.Overall this show was a let down from what it had in its first 3 episodes. If a second season comes it should go back to its roots and avoid the harem bs. girls would of been better off in just being a story for a episode or two. Having them stick around feels pointless.

If a second season comes it should go back to its roots and avoid the harem bs.', 'We all have biases, so I came into this anime wanting to fill the void after I had just watched another harem rom-com, OreSuki, and the timing couldn\'t have been better, since the ringtone for the MC in OreSuki is quite likely a reference to this anime. But OreSuki is a parody of the harem rom-com genre, while OreShura, being published five years earlier, is definitely in the generic class through-and-through. So it was a bit nice to go back in time in that respect.But what I really enjoyed about this anime was that I could almost ""see"" the author in the work. I...almost want to say that it is peak wish fulfillment, as I feel like he has spread out different parts of his personality among the MC and the girls and developed them around some of those traits. For instance, he really lets his ""chunbiyo"" flag fly, and its a major comedic trope and character trait for THREE characters! (Also, one of the girls is a big Jojo fan). Something like that made the work feel down-to-earth from a writing angle, and I enjoyed the author indulging in his freedom of expression and seeking out what is fun for him. Those kinds of things are inspiring for a writer like myself.That\'s way too meta though, isn\'t it? Well, that\'s why I said we all had biases.Sound:I was honestly charmed from the opening scene. Lately I\'ve wanted to pay more attention to soundtracks, and so I was surprised when this anime had such a relaxing tune from the very beginning. While the OP and ED weren\'t my taste, the OST was very good throughout. To continue with praising the audio, the VAs were also very enjoyable (Chiwa\'s was my favorite). (8)Story:There actually is some logic to the events in the show (as in clear cause and effect, and consistency, and not just random events to throw the character\'s into certain situations). However, although the characters have their own motivations, there isn\'t really an overarching narrative, and the plot is really more relationship based over having a clear theme or goal. (6)Art:It was fine, but I didn\'t enjoy the style of how they drew the side-profiles. (5)Character:The biggest points here come from consistency, especially Masuzu, who is truly the best argument for a character driven story. It was a nice change of pace that the MC isn\'t actually the flawed one here, but most of the character development is for one of the main heroines. Unfortunately though, it\'s only 12 episodes and a crowded cast, so the other girls, although introduced more or less quite well on their backstory, didn\'t receive much direction or development other than their obvious role as harem members. (6)Enjoyment:I did laugh a lot. The OST is something to revisit, and overall, if I ever wanted to write a harem romcom myself, which I almost felt inspired to do because this anime seemed so approachable, I would definitely check out the light novel of this series.

It builds up the drama and tension while maintaining it’s comedic base. It doesn’t rub your face in it’s fanservice. It’s great IF you’re into this sort of thing. And I am not, hence the nature of this review.Problem number one is Chiwa Harusaki. It is no secret that my most loathed thing in anime is characters who expect the object of their affection to return their...feelings, without having to tell them how they feel. Plus she’s loud and annoying, but at least she was honest about why she didn’t want Eita hanging around with these other girls.Problem number two is Ai Fuyuumi for the very same reasons as Chiwa except she she’s in denial. On top of that her motivation for wanting to marry Eita is a one note gag that gets old fast. You promised me in kindergarten we would get married. I’m picturing a 45 year old Ai Fuyuumi if she never met Eita again. A tired office lady who bores hosts then staggers home and falls asleep clutching a 40 year old note.Problem number three is the inevitability of the show’s climax. I don’t want to spoil it here but it’s so obvious that it can be called it’s logical conclusion. It wouldn’t make sense for the series to end any other way.Problem number four is the amount of stalking and extortion that goes on in this show. One could say that it’s done for comedic effect, but consider the premise then remember “you cannot extort those who refuse to be extorted.” I reached the same conclusion that made me drop Wolf Girl & Black Prince; you must like it or you wouldn’t tolerate it. Hence problem three.An honorable mention goes to Mana Natsukawa. What is with her and the little sister in A Town Where You Live? Now that I think about it, those two shows and SNAFU feature a girl who’s kept as a doll for their family’s political ambitions and have a meddling sister. But that is a topic to another time.Because this show centers around my most hated anime trope I had a hard time getting any entertainment value from it. It seems like an okay harem comedy but I’ve seen better. feelings, without having to tell them how they feel.

I wrote down that I watched it 20 times, but truthfully I probably watched it many more times than that ^.^While not entirely faithful, the main plot doesn't deviate much from the original Swan Lake story.  However, the wonderful character development, the way the mood seamlessly slips from light-hearted comedy to heartfelt romance (and everything in between), and even the little quirky characters like that squirrell that chewed through a bunch of wooden handles make this movie one of the most memorable I've ever seen.Since the movie was made in 1981, the art is a bit...antiquated, but I chalk this movie up there with classics like Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery Service ^.^ antiquated, but I chalk this movie up there with classics like Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery Service ^.^"", 'This movie had a soft fairy tale vibe that flew along the famous Tchaikovsky theme of the same name. I don\'t know about the original story of the theme, but this one was about a princess of a kingdom that was defeated by a evil wizard, that was turned into a swan for no one to be able to fall in love with her. The thing is that Siegfried, a prince of a kingdom nearby gets an interest on the pretty bird on the lake, the rest, as they say, is history.I found interesting the fact that they used the wizard as a friendly...fellow instead of a dark ebil wizard.

However, they do take some liberties with the story in order to cast it towards a younger audience, such as turning the primary antagonist into somewhat of a bumbling oafish wizard.

Shinmai Maou no Testament Departures,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36688/Shinmai_Maou_no_Testament_Departures,"[""I'm writing this as somebody who has read the novels and understands the entirety of the series plot.Visually Departures is the best the series has ever looked. There were some cool nods to LN fans with some of the characters casual clothes from SWEET! getting animated. The service scenes were never going to be on the same level as the novel, because that would have certainly pushed it into R18 territory, but the anime original scenes were a let down, because they lacked the variety and intensity of the novels.I think Departures did a better job of setting up the Nonaka's getting summoned back...to the Village, but the rest of the anime original content was kinda filler nonsense. They would have been better off just doing a straight adaptation of chapters 2 and 3 from volume 8.There's some really good world building that happens in chapter 3 of volume 8 that makes most of the events in the series make much more sense, and it's a shame they didn't adapt those scenes.The onsen trip with Chisato was adapted badly and they were real ambiguous about an important event that happens during that trip which has lasting consequences on the rest of the novels.Basara's anime original fight against Lars was well done.  This was probably the best animated fight of the series and it gives me hope that they'll be able to do justice to the fights from volume 9 onward if a S3 is green lighted.My favorite part of the OVA came during the credits. As an LN reader, I got to see a character animated that I never thought would have ever been animated. So that was a treat for me. Overall Departures is a decent watch that sets the stage for the best arc in the series. I recommend picking up the novels though if you want the most authentic version of the story. to the Village, but the rest of the anime original content was kinda filler nonsense.

It focuses on establishing why returning to the village is an issue not just in terms of potential danger, but also in terms of bringing up old traumas for Basara, Yuki, and Kurumi. This is conveyed to the other members of the group, and in doing so it gets everyone...on the same footing before departing, which naturally involves some decent relationship development not just between Basara and the rest of the group but also amongst the other group members themselves. This is able to occur because Basara is busy away from the group with a side story centered around Chisato, though one that isn't made entirely clear where it came from or what the purpose was but it seems to set up things that'll come up again at some point. Though to some degree it is getting kind of irritating at this point how that seems to be all that Chisato ever gets, in that she's had a decent amount of scenes but no clear substantial development and only hints and mysterious teases that seem largely pointless. There's also a fight against Lars, and though the stakes don't feel that high it's awesome enough. I don't think I've mentioned it before in any of my reviews, but Lars is pretty damn cool. The art and animation were just as good as the second season and of course the critical scenes were still there and strong. The ED was the OP of season 2 which was good enough I suppose though it would have been cool to get something new. on the same footing before departing, which naturally involves some decent relationship development not just between Basara and the rest of the group but also amongst the other group members themselves.

I was so looking forward to Chisato/Basara having an intimacy scene that would top the raw passion of the bath scene in the first OVA. Instead we got a lukewarm, rushed onsen scene that had zero build up and failed to capture any the raw sexual emotion of the light novel. There's a scene where Basara and Mio are making out in a cave under a waterfall which is...cool? It's nothing we...haven't seen before dozens of times already. This OVA was supposed to introduce something new to the animated franchise and increase the lewdness to a level not seen in the BD and past specials. To cross that thin line between super ecchi and hentai that Shinmai had tiptoed for so long. Instead it felt like a rehash of established material that was done far better elsewhere in the series already. Just as damning is the inconsistent character designs and subpar animation that you'd expect from some cheaply strung together hentai rather than one of the most successful LN erotic adaptations of the past several years. This shouldn't happen for a well planned special that doesn't have the production constraints of seasonal TV series.There appears to be a segment of the Shinmai Maou community that cares about the battle narrative. In that case, maybe you'll enjoy the well choreographed action sequences. I do not so I did not.

The animation is top quality, and some of the censoring done in this OVA was funny and well made for this being an anime.My main annoyance with the entire show though, both the two seasons and the OVA (haven\'t seen the extra fanservice OVA, so can\'t comment on them), is that the main protagonist never actually get laid. He\'s surrounded by 5 hot ladies that services frequently, yet he never gets anything in return.The fact that it is an anime and not a full blown hentai, means they can\'t show everything, I...get that. But given how far they go to show skin, bunnies, tusch, even nipples (something I haven\'t seen outside of hentai, still fairly new to anime though), yet not even off screen sex. I just don\'t get that.If I needed some hentai for the expressed purpose you use hentai for, I\'d just go to a website providing that. This is a story, a thin one, but one nonetheless. It goes all the way, the only is doesn\'t show is sex, not even hinting anything off screen. So why bother making a show like this in the first place then??I thought ""maybe, at the \'wedding night\'"", but one of the short clips with Maria suggest them having sex. Not sure about that though as the censoring was covering up so it was hard to tell. But considering the that he never actually had sex with the other four girls, I don\'t think he actually ended up having anything with Maria either.So I just have to ask myself again, what is the point of a show like this??Don\'t get me wrong, I enjoyed it. Some hot naked anime girls in some steamy scenes and some cool action and a pretty sweet action. But when there is so much emphasis on the lewd, yet there is never indicating anything actually happening, then why spend so much time and energy on a show like this??Maybe I just don\'t get it, that is possible. I hate to bring Kirito up again cause I\'m not a fan for SAO, but even he got lucky. It was all off screen and always suggested through actions and conversation, but no one watching that show had any doubt that he and Asuna had sex at their cabin after they gt married ingame.Yet this guy marries 5 hot chicks and gets thirsty just by saying no or not doing as they\'re told (something every guy had fantasies about at one point at least), yet, nothing... No wonder he\'s so pissed off all the time....This was my rant for this show. I gave season 1 a 7, season 2 a 6 and the OVA a 6, giving the show an overall rating of 6,33 (this does not count the season 1 and 2 fanservice OVA\'s as I haven\'t seen them).I would have liked to have given then show a higher score, cause I think it deserved it. But the fact that they make an anime so heavy in the lewd yet blueball the main protagonist as much as they do, makes me feel like the show misses the mark.Either make it the way it is and he bangs the girls like crazy, or keep it way lower on the lewd if they\'re just gonna blueball. It just feels like such a misstep to a point were in the end, the lewd scenes started to just annoy me.

Being a service anime produced by the energy-saving-ism Japanese animation industry, this anime does its part, which is to provide ecchi scenes and not to make significant logical flaws in the plot, fantastically. The story is a cliche, but characters do not do what they are supposed not to do. Plus, the harem girls are wonderfully cute...and ecchi.

Shinmai Maou no Testament: Toujou Basara no Hard Sweet na Nichijou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/29027/Shinmai_Maou_no_Testament__Toujou_Basara_no_Hard_Sweet_na_Nichijou,"['First off I would like to say don\'t even consider this OVA a ""sequel"" it has almost zero relevance to the original parent story consider it more of a side story. This practically a whole episode of pure extreme fanservice and nothing more. If that what you\'re looking for, then enjoy because its uncensored. For me its by far the closets thing to hentai in an OVA.Story:Well like I stated before, zero relevant story line within this OVA. It literally stars off with Maria cooking 3 panties inside of a soup. This OVA is mostly just Basara and the 4 main girls roaming around in...his house, school, and the nurses home. The episode is packed with some both crazy new ecchi scenarios I\'ve never even thought were possible and some very typical cliche ones.Art:Just as before in Shinmai Maou no Testament you have a nice bright setting and vivid colors that are contrast with the well drawn backgrounds. There isnt much to complain about its simplistic and easy to view. The main part about the art that gives it a +1 compared to the parent story is the uncensoring. Personally the censoring completely ruined some of the scenes within the anime, but now since you are able to view it without the annoying duck tape, sun rays, black lines, and misty bathrooms. The OVA itself became spectacular art wise. If you haven\'t seen it censored seriously go watch it literally half your screen was covered with black and white lines.Sound:Not much to say about the sound expect what you heard in the parent story because its exactly the same. Well fitting background music, good sound effects such as unclipping of bras, boob rubbings, and lotion splurts. I guess the voice acting was pretty good. The nurse voice was very alluring and womanly while Mio was being a basic tsundere.Character:You have only five characters showings within this OVA. Basara, Mio, Maria, Yuki, and Chisato. Basically its just these five characters getting into sticky situations that are very unexplainable and pure fanservice.Enjoyment:If you enjoy ecchi this is what you\'re looking for. Personally I enjoyed it because I got huge kicks out of the unexplainable and absurd situations they got into I also find it hilarious how they tried to end it on a serious note like it was some kind of intense drama after showing all this comedy and nudity.Overall:Pure fanservice nothing more dont consider this a ""sequel"" but rather a special. Zero plot, but a whole lot of another type of ""plot"" if you like oppai and oshiri watch it it is practically meant for you.If you\'re a fan of this series it already has a confirmed Season 2 + OVA under the name ""Shinmai Maou no Tesament Burst"" likewise with the OVA name.Story: 2Art: 8Sound: 7Character: 7Enjoyment: 8Overall: 7 his house, school, and the nurses home.

This is an OVA for Sister Testament, blah, blah, blah, I still say that this series would\'ve done better as a hentai, because this...this right here, is basically anime porn.  (I\'m not even going to try and be professional for this one, I\'m going to tell it how it is.)Story (2.98/10): Ok, I\'ll be honest here, there\'s not really much of a story for this OVA.  According to the OVA, the story is ""The Daily Life of Toujou Basara"", and if you\'re familiar with this series, well, you can probably think of what that means....The entire OVA revolves around Basara\'s daily life, which is apparently filled with Maria\'s perverted antics with Mio such as sucking on her breasts, using a banana as a stand-in penis, and having dinner with the sexy nurse at school and making her cream in the shower as he does...things to her.  (I think they actually had sex in the shower, but I\'m not to sure.)  There, that\'s what this OVA is about.To be honest, this OVA is nothing more than hentai.  It\'s can\'t even be considered as gratuitous fanservice because they go FAR beyond that horizon.  No, this is actually borderline hentai, filled with boobs, boobs, more boobs, and other scenes that require the closing of your door when you watch them.  It\'s not really a quality OVA at all considering it really just jumps right into things with little to no warning.  After all, the female breast needs as much screentime as it can get.Overview:+  Boobs  (That\'s about the only positive that I can find with this.)-  Completely pointless OVA that is nothing but a softcore hentaiCharacters (4.99/10): The characters are virtually the same in this OVA like in the actual show.  The only difference is the fact that their characters really don\'t make much sense in this OVA because of the way it\'s structure.  Hell, I don\'t remember the nurse being anything close to being that kind of character in the series, so yea.Art and Sound (7.00 and 7.43/10): The art really hasn\'t changed in quality for this OVA, so there\'s really nothing to talk about there.  But...since this is an OVA, there\'re some courtesies that weren\'t taken.The thing is, because OVA\'s are bundled in DVD\'s and such, they don\'t really have the restriction that normal episodes have when they\'re aired.  As such, they can remain...uncensored.  This basically means for this series, you get nipples on your boobs.  And because every female character in this OVA goes topless for a couple minutes or so, you\'ll be seeing a lot of them.The sound is the same tracks that were used in the original show.  I personally think they\'re pretty good tracks, hence the decent score.Overview:+ No change in art+ You get nipples on your boobs+ Same, good soundtrackPersonal Enjoyment (3.00/10): I wasn\'t really a big fan of sister testament in the first place because of the kind of show it was after watching it for a while, so this...wasn\'t exactly a pleasant surprise.  I didn\'t even know this show had an OVA planned, so I didn\'t really know what I was expecting.  (I kind of regret it.)Did I like this OVA?I only stayed for the ""plot"".  There was no reason other than that for me to watch this.  Next.What didn\'t I like about this OVA?Everything else sucked.  Next.Would I recommend this OVA?With the next ""Burst"" coming out in October, if you\'re a fan of the show and want to get a ""burst"" out of yourselves first, go ahead and watch this.  Or, if you\'re a perv, you should watch this too.  TBH, this is basically softcore porn.  There\'s nothing to really say aside from that.Overall Score: 4.66/10 The entire OVA revolves around Basara\'s daily life, which is apparently filled with Maria\'s perverted antics with Mio such as sucking on her breasts, using a banana as a stand-in penis, and having dinner with the sexy nurse at school and making her cream in the shower as he does...things to her.

It's packed with ecchi in various forms whether it is Mio's perverted dreams, more of Maria's mischievous acts, or the school nurse getting in some action with our protagonist. Though definitely a side episode, the last portion does give a bit of insight and character development to our busty nurse.Animation:The animation is on par with the main show; expect lots of ecchi and lots of nudity and lots of groping. There's no action in this episode, just a lot of ecchi scenes- if you've...made it through the main show nothing here will really faze you.Sound:This uses the same OP and ED as the main show, and recycles the BGM as well. Expect the same good performance from the VAs as well, including lots of ecchi groans.Story:What I said in the intro pretty much sums up the episode. The first half is ecchi with the harem members. The second half is ecchi with the school nurse. Entertaining if you like ecchi or ecchi-based comedy but otherwise this can be skipped.Character:Given the short length, I wasn't expecting much in terms of development. Surprisingly, the show teases that the nurse might have more to do with Basara than what was hinted at in the main show, you'll have to watch it to find out more!Value:For half an hour's worth of ecchi, it's rather packed with... ecchi. If you want to test your neighbors, play this at full volume. It's not in any way necessary from a plot perspective, just a fun addition for fans of the show. made it through the main show nothing here will really faze you.Sound:This uses the same OP and ED as the main show, and recycles the BGM as well.

Because of that, this episode was much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. For once, there was consensual sexual tension instead of being enslaved by jealousy or the idea of betrayal.This OVA also focused on Maria, which is good because she's the show's lifeblood; without her, this anime would fall into obscurity.Lastly, if you're going to watch this series, I'd suggest watching this episode...as it's the least cringe-worthy of them all which is saying A LOT.Sadly, you'll have to watch the previous series for context purposes.

Segment one is that Mio is having a dreaming and well maria finds out and lewd thing happen after that Maria is serving Basara but she mad him panties of Mios and of course Mio gets upset: Segment 2 is really about Basara and well Chisato she basically asked him 2 help with her swimsuit and there after they go to her house and after he eats her cooking lewd...things happen.Art: art is the same as the anime so nothing really new.Sound: OP and ED are the same and sounds are the same so nothing new her as well.Character:  Basara is the main guy of the anime and well he is pretty shy when it comes to the pervy parts but in action he is a total bad ass.

So the whole point is for the ecchi/erotic scene to be honest.The first part is the same generic ecchi slapstick, not worth mention because it's just the same daily interaction with the MC and the main heroines.The best part is gotta be the second half, the school teacher. That scene alone carries this whole series/franchise, the voice acting is also very good, 11/10 would watch it again ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).That's all in it, I can't elaborate more but I had to write something to fill up the quota for this review lol.

Sola Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3174/Sola_Specials,"[""If you really loved the Sola anime you might disagre to my review and love this short OVA as well. Hovever if you thought it average or havn't seen the TV series I'd recommend skipping this one.The OVA consists of of two side stories taking place at diffrent times of the original series. The first almost anytime during the first half of the series and the second is the day before episode one. It doesn't add anything new to the story nor does it dive deeper into any side story or character.All the characters are from the original series and none is left out but...there is no character development or any deeper look into any part of the story from the original seriesThe art and animation is the same as in Sola, very nice, esspecialy the photos. The same goes for sound and music. Nothing new but nothing bad either.If you wathced Sola and want more of the same this OVA isn't a bad choice but it won't last long or give you anything new. As stated in the begining I think that unless you found Sola to be one of the best animes you've seen in a long time you are better off looking for something else. there is no character development or any deeper look into any part of the story from the original seriesThe art and animation is the same as in Sola, very nice, esspecialy the photos.

Suki demo Kirai na Amanojaku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/58449/Suki_demo_Kirai_na_Amanojaku,"[""The short answer is it's fine. Sincerely, this was a fine, charming, quaint little film. It has an odd little urban fantasy. It's a coming-of-age story about learning to be more independent, a small exploration of found families and working together, and a quirky twist on shinto-tinged fantasy lore.Sounds nice right? However, there are a lot of problems here. The problems are more numerous than they probably should be, especially with a really competent team, and a fairly solid director who has performed well in the past. The talent is clearly there, so what happened?I think it's best to compare this to something like a...gymnast performance. Sometimes a gymnast just has a bad day. Sometimes they have a great routine but either their mood, skill, or level of confidence just doesn't let them perform at the level they need to. It's just an oopsie. But enough small mistakes begin to add up real fast. It makes the whole performance just sloppy. You want to not blame them, because you see how skilled they are. But a subpar performance is still subpar.So what happened here?Let's start with the good. The presentation of this anime is GREAT. It's so pretty throughout. The character designs are fun, especially the clothing. Every time a character was was given a new piece of clothing, I got excited. The general design is a also nice. You can tell they spent a lot of time getting their designs just right, especially the color palettes. The backgrounds and landscape shots are also quite lavish. There are quite a few CGI shots throughout the film, but they're fairly inoffensive. Also, can we talk about the monster designs? Holy crap those are cool. The whale mouth those things have is legitimately one of the neatest, creepiest looking things ever. I love it!That's nice, but there's bad right? Unfortunately, there's quite a lot of bad. The biggest problem with this film is that it's story and pacing are all over the place.This film feels like it was written out of order and without cohesion. This comes in two parts: the order of the plot and the structure of the narrative.First the plot. This is the general story of teens go on an adventure, resolve a conflict, and hopefully come out the other side happy. The problem is that it's extremely bookended. The first quarter is really intriguing and fun; the last quarter is very intriguing and fun. Then... there's all of the rest. The middle half of the film is just kind of there. It's made as this travel journey, but the travel is not very purposeful. All the action happens in meeting this girl, learning about her lore, and then concluding the big story at the end. But the center of the story is this odd slice-of-life. Don't get me wrong, the slice-of-life is nice and cozy. But it feels out of place in a more story-driven, action-oriented film.Then there's the narrative. Here the problems deepen. What is this story about? Well, it's about an oni girl who comes to the real world. Why? Well, for reasons. Also, did you know that people leak energy when they are hiding their emotions? Don't worry, that won't be important later, only for the times where it's relevant. Our main character has a bit of a complicated house-life with a strict dad. But don't worry, the dad will go away when he's not important. Oh, by the way, the oni girl wants to find her mom, who is gone, but she didn't come here, so she'll have to go somewhere else to find her. Oh, and the fun part, we get to travel to oni world. Why is it in snow land? Dunno, but there are monsters, and they're sorta spawned from the oni girls mom, but sort of not. Also, the demons have their own society, but it's not important. What is important, is that the main characters reconnect with their family, but that happens after the films over, so don't worry.Do you see the problem? Not only is there a LOT of plot to cover, but there are about ten-thousand different concepts and ideas they want to explore. This film isn't even 2 hours, and it's trying to handle all of that and more. Because of this, the screenplay is never allowed to linger on a coherent point. It's like a pinball, constantly bouncing between story beats. This leaves it difficult to keep up, and the story quickly loses coherency. Even when you can understand the general path the anime wishes to explore, it still leaves you confused, just because of the sheer volume of concepts and ideas.This film also seems to be suffering from identity crisis. What does this film want to be? Is it a coming-of-age film? Is it a found family film? Is it a roadtrip film? Is it a tourism advertisement for Yamagata Prefecture? It's it a romance? Is it a family drama? Is it a fantasy? I wish I could tell you, because it's literally all of those at the same time. This film is so bloated on ideas that it's dizzying. What's worse, because the film is so spread thin in plot, narrative, and direction, it feels so milquetoast and bland. It never commits to anything, so anything meaningful the film has to say, it has no ground to stand on while saying it.It's really just unfortunate, because so much about this had such high potential. This COULD have been great if they focused in on one aspect of the story. If this was just about the oni girl, awesome. If this was just about the protagonist, cool. If this was just about the slice-of-life, cool. If this was just about defeating the evil monsters, cool. Instead, it's all of those concepts and MANY MANY MORE. But then it's just nitpicking on what could have been, rather than what was made. And what was made was not very good. It is entertaining. It's cute. But if you're looking for something meaningful and deep, you're in the wrong place. gymnast performance. Sometimes a gymnast just has a bad day.

But still good.Its about a shy boy Hiiragi Yatsuse who always goes out of his way to help others in order to make friends, but is very unappreciated.One day he encounters a girl Tsumugi who looks like she\'s in trouble, so he offers to help her.Turns out she is an oni (a demon) in search of her mother.Hiiragi decides to run away from home in order to guide Tsumugi to the Hie Shrine where she may find a lead on her mother\'s whereabouts.On their journey they encounter kind, helpful and generous people.Tsumugi also seems to be pursued by strange...seemingly demonic spirits who cause snow to fall (despite being summer) whenever they are near.I wont spoil it but the plot does evolve into something more.Altough all the characters are written fine i do have an issue with Tsumugi.She\'s not badly written but can act stubbornly stupid at times.She doesnt seem to know what she wants.

The character designs were pretty generic but the white hair and oni horns were a nice touch to make them stand out.Why this movie was mid? Well the pacing was out of the place, it would have worked better if it was a whole slice of life/fantasy series where they could have fleshed out the adventure aspects of it while also explaining the whole narrative better.Well, here's hoping that their future works get good, this was better than A Whisker Away (same director) but not Penguin Highway (same screenwriter,...but not the actual author). but not the actual author)."", ""My Oni Girl is the second release of Studio Colorido’s three film deal with Netflix, and it’s a moderate step up from the first.It is, as their previous few films have led me to expect, an exercise in convention. Its plot and themes are basic, and obvious. To briefly summarize, our MC isn’t assertive enough, and that causes him to get taken advantage of. Over the course of the film he grows to be more confident thanks to the help of an oni girl, who’s tied to supernatural phenomena that represent his character flaws, and the film’s themes. It’s the type of story that’s unlikely...to reveal additional depth on repeat viewings, and is pretty predictable.That will make or break the film for you; either you’ll find a comfortable sense of warmth in its familiarity, or boredom in its predictability. If you’re in that second camp, you probably already know it and aren’t expecting anything. But if you’re in the first, you should absolutely watch this movie.I’m firmly in that first camp. I could watch a million films like this and never get bored. I have, almost; there’s hardly a conventional coming-of-age anime drama I haven’t watched, and in watching them I’ve become adept at identifying what exactly makes one good or bad.So, all that said, how does this film stack up?It certainly makes the grade in terms of animation, though its visuals aren’t perfect. This, like Colorido’s previous effort, makes heavy use of CGI, which looks good, but isn’t seamless. What is and isn’t CG falls exactly on the lines you’d expect (vehicles are, so are environments in scenes with complex action, occasionally buildings are), as do its issues. Moving CG objects sometimes appear to be moving at a lower framerate than 2D objects. Environments and 2D characters are not seamlessly composited. All that’s to say, you can tell what’s CG and what isn’t. The 2D animation is film quality, and is most impressive in moments of detailed character animation.The visual style is where the film runs into some issues. Some scenes are underlit (or at least, they look underlit on my display). Colorido’s usual style is as close to the neutral anime film aesthetic as anime films get, and this film employs it without alteration. It looks good, but doesn’t have a unique visual identity.The filmmaking is competent, but never mind blowing. Like, in one scene the two main characters are working at a flea market stall. They’re under a tent, in shadows, while the customers are in sunlight. The main characters are lit like this to represent the MC’s lack of assertiveness; they’re only working here because he feels he owes a favor to the guy running the shop, if he was more confident he’d probably have turned him down. Across the market we see another character, also in shadows, implying she’s also only here because she’s been strung along.Ideas like that are the fundamental building blocks of good filmmaking, and this film incorporates plenty of them across the runtime. It’s a solid, well made film, but it’s just that. The score is never applied in a super interesting way, no cuts particularly impressed me. There is one aggressive sequence of match cuts at the very beginning, which kinda doesn’t work, but I’m a Kon fan so I’ll let it slide.This is all to say, the filmmaking and overall visual style meet the demands of the conventional story, but don’t elevate it. A director like Shinkai (with Shinkai level resources) could probably elevate this script to the point that I’d cry, and indeed, a film with an identical plot structure by Shinkai (Suzume) did just that. Both this film and that follow an adventure plot, during which a series of discrete arcs happen, each exploring different sides of the central theme. If you see comparisons between the two films, that structure is why.Information is delivered in questionable ways at times. At the beginning, the film needs to establish that the main character isn’t assertive enough, and does so in five separate scenes. He wants to talk to someone, but doesn’t because they’re in a conversation; he can’t find a partner in class, so he ends up with the teacher; he offers to help clean up after class, but gets left with all the work; a girl asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend, and he goes along with it; some classmates say they didn't do their homework, so he lets them copy his. Later we see his dad forcing a decision on him without even considering his opinion, suggesting where he might have gotten this trait.All that’s fine, but could have been streamlined a bit. Just using one or two of those scenes would have had the same effect as showing all five. We even flash back to them less than twenty minutes later; even accounting for the slow kids in the back, the audience doesn’t need to be told this a sixth time. It’s not as bloated as some other genre films (including Colorido’s last Netflix film), but isn’t perfect either.The output of all this is a good film, one that’s worth watching if you’re into the genre, but doesn’t have much appeal outside of it. It’s comfortable. It’s competently produced. It’s not too heavy or emotional. It’s not too profound or thought provoking. It’s not too stylistically ambitious. It's a perfect movie to watch on a weeknight.

All felt emotionally charged, and meaningful in this. The beauty found between the blossoming love between the characters, amongst beautifully detailed visuals and backgrounds, makes this all the more perfect. The development of the main character going from an individual who takes himself far in the pleasing of others as a measured goal, to that of a free-spirited, yet true to nature character can be seen as a bit cliche. Yet is executed perfectly. The beautiful telling of growth, development, and letting go are...hidden behind wonderous layers of metaphor, visual storytelling, and subtle actions, all of which make the film so much greater.

Tantei Opera Milky Holmes,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7768/Tantei_Opera_Milky_Holmes,"['In the near future, in a world tarnished by lawlessness and disorder, exists an elite detective agency known as Milky Holmes. Represented by four talented young girls, the agency exists to fight against those that threaten the people\'s security. Through their struggles to preserve peace is a courageous, poignant story of mystery and betrayal...Wait, none of that has anything to do with Milky Holmes. Let\'s try again.For Sheryl, Cordelia, Elly and Nero, any shred of courage and talent is tossed aside within five minutes of the first episode. After losing their supernatural abilities— ""Toys"", the once-esteemed detectives devolve into a group of scatterbrains miserably failing...at every single thing that they set out to do. Bear attacking them in the forest? They try to befriend it. An antagonist\'s identity revealed in front of them? They assume it is cosplay. Between their innumerable failures, one inevitably starts to wonder if they would be more at home in a mental hospital rather than a detective academy.It\'s easy to recognize the four girls due to their colorful designs. Sheryl stands as your typical happy-go-lucky protagonist, characterized by her circular pigtails and massive hair bow that somehow outsizes her entire head. On the other hand, you have Cordelia, the equivocally \'mature\' member of the group who frequently falls into hysteric outbursts.  There is also Nero, an energetic tomboy, and Elly, a timid girl who speaks so little that you\'d confuse her as being mute. Generic it is, but the girls are made to stand out as a group more so than as individuals. This is not an anime about Sheryl, but an anime about Milky Holmes.Rather, the side characters are where the show shines. Serving as the series\' antagonist is the Gentlemen Thieves, a four member criminal organization led by Arsène and her enormous bosom. As a long-term rival to Milky Holmes, they more or less function as the show\'s equivalent to Team Rocket. In almost every episode, the two are involved in some sort of inane conflict with each other. The best part is the character ""Twenty"", a man wearing a monocle and top hat who frequently rips his shirt off, screams to the heavens about his beauty, and runs around exposing his erect nipples to everybody in sight. Yes, seriously.There is also a third group named the Genius 4, a police unit which continually finds themselves pulled in between the nonsense of Milky Holmes and their rivals. The only character of note here is its leader Kokoro, a self-professed child genius with an IQ of >1300. When not gloating about her questionable intellect, Kokoro is usually seen fulfilling her sadistic urges by manipulating the members of Milky Holmes, for often amusing and occasionally depressing results. It\'s a shame that so few episodes see her with any significant screen time, given that she\'s the most entertaining of the female characters.One of the more unique aspects of the series is that it is an homage to the detective genre. Blatant references to famous fictional detectives exist within the names of nearly every character (Sherlock Holmes, Nero Wolfe), while common conventions of the genre are frequently parodied through the idiocy of the characters. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly find some level of amusement in all the references.Though do not expect mystery from Milky Holmes. There is none to be found here, aside from deep philosophical questions like how much damage the characters have received to their brain. Even the conflicts are resolved through supernatural powers and violence rather than any sort of reasoning or detective work.But that is the point of Milky Holmes. It is intentionally stupid. It\'s a comedy anime that does not waste unnecessary time on character and story development, nor does it pretend to be witty highbrow entertainment. It is easy, simple humor revolving around the exploits of Dumb and Dumber— compounded with a cast of excessively cute girls. Milky Holmes does an excellent job being what it is, but those who find this sort of comedy appalling would be advised to set their eyeballs in the other direction. You won\'t be missing a whole lot.Occasionally the show does attempt to focus on its story, to largely dreadful results. The sudden dramatic tone makes for an uncomfortable and incongruous transition, taking away from the inherent appeal of the series. If everything after the first episode is filled with absurd humor, how is the viewer supposed to care when the story comes back at the end? Perhaps it may have been better with no plot at all.  Still, the climactic fight in the final episode was a surprisingly pleasant conclusion to the season. There\'s a neatly animated battle scene with Sheryl using her wits and power (for the first time), and in the last minutes we are treated with a very Milky Holmes-esque twist to the story. In other words, it is immensely silly. And flagrantly stupid.The art fidelity leaves much to be desired, but there isn\'t much to complain in terms of visual style. Character designs are colorful and appealing while the backgrounds employ a unique crayon-drawn aesthetic. Often though, you will see off-model faces and strange proportions in between important scenes. It\'s quite jarring and could easily be alleviated through a larger budget.Music is not Milky Holmes\' forte, but the excellent OP compensates for the forgettable score. It captures the charm of the anime and serves as a nice little treat before each episode begins. Adding to this is a solid cast of seiyuu who do a commendable job at making the comedic lines actually work. There\'s nothing worse than a comedy performed by lifeless actors, and thankfully Milky Holmes is in complete contrast to that.This is the kind of anime that only comes around every once in a while. For a medium where manzai humor and cliches are predominant, a title such as Milky Holmes almost seems alien. There\'s a certain charm to be found here, and if you can forgive the glaring flaws of the anime you will most likely be in for an enjoyable ride. Assuming of course, that you are not offended by protruding nipples and utter stupidity.Failure has never been this cute. at every single thing that they set out to do.

There is also Nero, an energetic tomboy, and Elly, a timid girl who speaks so little that you\'d confuse her as being mute. Generic it is, but the girls are made to stand out as a group more so than as individuals. This is not an anime about Sheryl, but an anime about Milky Holmes.Rather, the side characters are where the show shines. Serving as the series\' antagonist is the Gentlemen Thieves, a four member criminal organization led by Arsène and her enormous bosom. As a long-term rival to Milky Holmes, they more or less function as the show\'s equivalent to Team Rocket. In almost every episode, the two are involved in some sort of inane conflict with each other. The best part is the character ""Twenty"", a man wearing a monocle and top hat who frequently rips his shirt off, screams to the heavens about his beauty, and runs around exposing his erect nipples to everybody in sight. Yes, seriously.There is also a third group named the Genius 4, a police unit which continually finds themselves pulled in between the nonsense of Milky Holmes and their rivals. The only character of note here is its leader Kokoro, a self-professed child genius with an IQ of >1300. When not gloating about her questionable intellect, Kokoro is usually seen fulfilling her sadistic urges by manipulating the members of Milky Holmes, for often amusing and occasionally depressing results. It\'s a shame that so few episodes see her with any significant screen time, given that she\'s the most entertaining of the female characters.One of the more unique aspects of the series is that it is an homage to the detective genre. Blatant references to famous fictional detectives exist within the names of nearly every character (Sherlock Holmes, Nero Wolfe), while common conventions of the genre are frequently parodied through the idiocy of the characters. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly find some level of amusement in all the references.Though do not expect mystery from Milky Holmes. There is none to be found here, aside from deep philosophical questions like how much damage the characters have received to their brain. Even the conflicts are resolved through supernatural powers and violence rather than any sort of reasoning or detective work.But that is the point of Milky Holmes. It is intentionally stupid. It\'s a comedy anime that does not waste unnecessary time on character and story development, nor does it pretend to be witty highbrow entertainment. It is easy, simple humor revolving around the exploits of Dumb and Dumber— compounded with a cast of excessively cute girls. Milky Holmes does an excellent job being what it is, but those who find this sort of comedy appalling would be advised to set their eyeballs in the other direction. You won\'t be missing a whole lot.Occasionally the show does attempt to focus on its story, to largely dreadful results. The sudden dramatic tone makes for an uncomfortable and incongruous transition, taking away from the inherent appeal of the series. If everything after the first episode is filled with absurd humor, how is the viewer supposed to care when the story comes back at the end? Perhaps it may have been better with no plot at all.  Still, the climactic fight in the final episode was a surprisingly pleasant conclusion to the season. There\'s a neatly animated battle scene with Sheryl using her wits and power (for the first time), and in the last minutes we are treated with a very Milky Holmes-esque twist to the story. In other words, it is immensely silly. And flagrantly stupid.The art fidelity leaves much to be desired, but there isn\'t much to complain in terms of visual style. Character designs are colorful and appealing while the backgrounds employ a unique crayon-drawn aesthetic. Often though, you will see off-model faces and strange proportions in between important scenes. It\'s quite jarring and could easily be alleviated through a larger budget.Music is not Milky Holmes\' forte, but the excellent OP compensates for the forgettable score. It captures the charm of the anime and serves as a nice little treat before each episode begins. Adding to this is a solid cast of seiyuu who do a commendable job at making the comedic lines actually work. There\'s nothing worse than a comedy performed by lifeless actors, and thankfully Milky Holmes is in complete contrast to that.This is the kind of anime that only comes around every once in a while. For a medium where manzai humor and cliches are predominant, a title such as Milky Holmes almost seems alien. There\'s a certain charm to be found here, and if you can forgive the glaring flaws of the anime you will most likely be in for an enjoyable ride. Assuming of course, that you are not offended by protruding nipples and utter stupidity.Failure has never been this cute.', ""I think that some people didn't know what exactly to expect from the series when they first went into it. Goodness knows I was expecting something else. My review is going to hopefully clear up some things for people, before they even pick up the Anime, because I garantee, some people aren't going to be happy with it.Story: (3+9)/2=6I have a ligitimate reason for giving the story an odd two part rating. In my case, it has to deal with the fact that from the summary I read, I was expecting something that was cute, innocent, almost like a brand new take on an old...Anime, CLAMP Gaukuen Tanteidan. As a mystery buff, I expected something series, with a mystery every episode.I didn't get that. Well, I got the whole cute thing, but this anime is like a fangirl writing fanfiction who has an interesting summary and then you find out that they are rabid, but not that they are a bad writer, just that they're... *cough* a little bit perverted in their writing, causing you to hit your head against the desk. Truth be told, these types that ARE actually well written are rare.As for the seriousness... there is none. It is completly comediec. You don't get any major mysteries in this series, it is more along the lines of adventure. Actually, I really have to question how these girls even became detectives. It is almost as if they are trying to parody and poke fun of the Mystery genera, in how the detectives always solve the cases. It is rather interesting in that regaurd.Art: 8The art work is nice and crisp, the colors bright making one thinking it is a simple, happy go lucky children's Anime. Particularly if you haven't seen any clips that show the more... well, the moments that push it in some people's minds. Typically, I say that panty-shots (that's what I call them, though in this one there aren't really any shots of panties) aren't needed in most storylines to make it a good storyline. It's just there to attract people in.Well, with the way it is cut down later on, I think it did in fact use panty shots to draw a certain crowd in, but the humour and shots actually do add to the storyline. I think it has to do with how the characters are protrayed in the series, which I will get to later.Sound: 10Sound is not my fortay, but I felt it was nice and I liked the opening and closing. Actually, I was laughing at some of the sound effects.Character: (6+10)/2=8I have another split rating here. Why? Well, obviously I was expecting smart detectives, but I ended up with some really dumb characters. All of the detetives are... well, as one character says... they are retarded. Their words, not mine. And then the bad guys... I have to slap my forehead, as they aren't bad guys. They're... well, for the most part brighter then the detectives, but they are also... nicer then how the girls start out. I say that because the girls were spoiled brats. Even with being parodic, the character have problems.Enjoyment: (4+10)/2=7I wanted something else really, so in that regaurd I was rather disapointed. But what I got... completly unexpected really. I got a story that was... I love parody, I love satire, and I can't help but look at this as a MAJOR comedic parody of the Detective Genera. And it pokes fun of the 'panty-shots' other Anime put in.Overall: (6+8+10+8+7)/5=7.8Truth of the matter is, if you don't know what you are going in for, it is... or could be a major disapointment. It isn't a bad Anime though... simply... different is the best word for it. Anime, CLAMP Gaukuen Tanteidan.

The rest of the show doesn\'t really promote pedophilia. How can you when the main villain of this series has gigantic b**b!-""Wow! A mystery anime! Finally I get to watch something else other than Detective Conan!""Once again, throw away that perception. Did the title say Detective Holmes? No. Unlike Detective Conan, it\'s clearly not stated it\'s...a detective show. Closest you\'ll get to them solving a case is almost to nil.

Tantei Opera Milky Holmes.If i look at my scores 8 for story, 8 for art, 8 for sound.Its not really the animation or a great storyline which amazed me. The character are so funny to watch and the most important point for me was the ""enjoyment"".I dont care if the arts bad, story boring and the sound annoying, but the jokes was so nice to watch, and the insider gags were so funny( ones you get it) that the enjoyment factor was at maximum for me.And...whats really special for me was that i dropped this anime once. After watching the 5 ep i started to watch something different. But suddenly somewhere near christmas i started to watch ep 6 and was so fascinated that i couldnt stop and watched all of them in one day.And the last ep was probably the most awesome last ep i saw.That was my little christmas miracle ^^And the hype didnt end, i read other blogs that they also fascinated about this awesome anime and even convince other to watch it and they didnt regret it.So to everyone who think this is a serie about little girls who fight bears, they are right but thats the charm of Tantei Opera Milky Holmes. whats really special for me was that i dropped this anime once.

At the start I am greeted to the protagonists and the antagonists. The first five minutes prove to be very promising, with the characters losing their powers. I figured that they would have to use teamwork to move forward. What I got after that though was highly disappointing.I\'m going to be straight with you, one of things that got me through the first few episodes was the lolies, and even then, they...weren\'t much on their own. I got the feeling that the creators thought that making the girls borderline retarded would make them more cute, sort of like the girls in K-on, mainly Yui. But the difference between the two casts is that at least the girls in K-on get good at what the set out to do. Yui get to be a good guitar player, and even though she acts it, she does get good grades when she puts her mind to it. The cast of Milky Holmes never really improved. At first I was appalled at the amount of discrimination the girls got simply for losing their powers. Those that lose their powers are called ""useless"", and Milky Holmes was no exception. Supposedly the girls were famous and had solved many cases, but once their powers were lost, they were treated lower than dirt. I still held similar sentiments throughout the show, because they were expected to get their toys back when it was never proven that anybody had ever done that before. But most of it left because the girls really did tend to be useless, they hindered far more than helped.And this show really doesn\'t have a villain. This show is supposed to be lighthearted. We learn in the first episode that the Student Council President is Arsene, and her three henchmen have also all infiltraded the girl\'s school. One is a teacher, one a chef, and the other a fellow student. I will repeat this show really doesn\'t have a villain. To be honest, the ""villains"" were more interesting than the girls. I would guess Arsene enjoys the chase more than victory, because several of her plots are to help the girls get their powers and deep down she seems to have a good heart. Twenty, the teacher, is narcissistic to the point he carries around a dakimakura (hugging pillow) with himself on it.The chef dude (who\'s name eludes me) is usually serious, but he too tends to provide some comedy, and Rat, the student acts like a rival at times to the girls. The villains remind me a lot of Team Rocket. I felt that they were doing most of the work for making the show enjoyable.Speaking of enjoyment, I felt the first few episodes were poor, but it picked up in comedy after that, only to get more serious later on. This tended to create a clash I felt. As the story got more serious, the characters didn\'t really follow suit. I understand that if it had the girls would have seemed too different, but I felt as it was, they stood out and got in the way. The tone in the later episodes I felt didn\'t really work with the characters. The midsection of the series was definitely the best of them.I get that the show is suppose to be a parody of the detective genre, I think a parody itself would work, but what I got wasn\'t so much a parody of the detective genre, and more of k-on where the girls are supposed to be detectives. And it\'s a k-on where they suck at their job from beginning to end. At least the villains aren\'t so bad, otherwise the people would be doomed.The most memorable character and my favorite is Twenty. I really wanted it to be one of the lolies, but my favorite loli of the show, Irene, wasn\'t featured enough. Twenties antics just really stuck out, even amongst the other strange happenings from the cast. Like when he licked his dakimakura of himself, or when he frequently stripped in class, or best of all, one of his lines in episode 3.

But after hearing that it was nominated by Japanese fans as the best anime of 2010 (although Japanese fans do admittingly have some odd tastes in anime…) and hearing some good comments about it from the few people I knew that were watching the show, I figured going back and finishing the show couldn’t hurt. And I can say that, after watching this series, while it is the most underrated from the Fall season of 2010, it is by...no means the best of the year. For a comedy, it was actually done rather well, and while it gets heavy in fanservice sometimes, this show turned out surprisingly better than I had expected.That being said, the key thing you need to realize when approaching this anime is that it’s pretty much just a huge parody about everything it touches upon. It parodies the detective-phantom thief dynamic (which Detective Conan is famous for), along with a ton of random jokes and video game parodies. I’ll admit that I didn’t get all the jokes, but the ones that I did understand were hilarious, or at least brought a smile to my face. If you start watching this show expecting anything other than slapstick comedy, be warned, you won’t find this show particularly enjoyable.One thing I did notice about some of the jokes, though, is that while some of the jokes were loaded with moe and cute laughter, the implications of the joke were actually quite a bit more serious. For example, when I saw that the main cast was OVERJOYED to be thrown into jail so that they could get a free meal, while the moment was funny I also thought “man, did they seriously just become happy by being thrown in jail?”. This happens quite a few times, such as when the starving, desperate protagonists decided to grill mushrooms that they harvested from the underside of their old, decrepit desk, so on so forth. I guess you could say that I was surprised by how there a few more serious implications to certain scenes than you would think for a moe comedy show. I don’t think this was done on purpose, but it’s still an interesting little thing to note.The main cast was a total mess, though I do think it was done that way on purpose. The story follows a group of four girls that have aspirations of becoming great detectives, but when they lose their superpowers (termed “toys” in this show), they become utterly useless. Like, seriously, they were probably the most incompetent, simple-minded, spoiled main cast I’ve seen in a long time.Spoiled in the sense that the main characters had become almost completely incompetent after they lost their powers, which just shows how over reliant they were on those powers. However, these negative traits were often used to comedic effect, which I thought was an interesting way to go about things. Some of the characters, although extremely lacking in any sort of proper character development, turned out rather charming to watch and got laughs out of me.The main story got rather repetitive quite a bit, but the main strength with the story was probably how it was executed. The story certainly tried to put some unconventional twists into whatever was happening, and while it wasn’t always successful, it was still quite good at keeping the viewer engaged in the happenings of the show. The pure ridiculousness of the events in the show, along with how this show never tries to really take itself seriously (as opposed to some often forced drama in other comedies), works out surprisingly better than I had thought it would.What was a bigger issue in this series was probably the production quality, which was very weak in the first episode, and mediocre throughout the rest of the series. Tantei Opera certainly will not be winning any sort of best animation awards, but JC staff still managed to pull through in the end.Overall, Tantei Opera was surprisingly better than expected, and did exactly what the creators meant to do; create a slapstick comedy with some absurd situations and characters, and nothing really beyond that. While I certainly don’t think this was the best comedy by any means, it certainly had a more unique execution with a bunch of it’s jokes. I can see why people say this is the most underrated show from Fall 2010 outside of Japan. While this show certainly isn’t for everybody, and the fanservice may turn some people off from this show, Tantei Opera has it’s own merits and strengths that make it a rather entertaining show in it’s own right.Production Quality: 7.5/10Characters: 8.0/10Story: 7.5/10Setting: 7.0/10Overall Enjoyment: 7.5/10 (Rounded up to a 8 on MAL)Feedback and comments (as well as criticisms) are always welcome :) no means the best of the year. For a comedy, it was actually done rather well, and while it gets heavy in fanservice sometimes, this show turned out surprisingly better than I had expected.That being said, the key thing you need to realize when approaching this anime is that it’s pretty much just a huge parody about everything it touches upon. It parodies the detective-phantom thief dynamic (which Detective Conan is famous for), along with a ton of random jokes and video game parodies. I’ll admit that I didn’t get all the jokes, but the ones that I did understand were hilarious, or at least brought a smile to my face. If you start watching this show expecting anything other than slapstick comedy, be warned, you won’t find this show particularly enjoyable.One thing I did notice about some of the jokes, though, is that while some of the jokes were loaded with moe and cute laughter, the implications of the joke were actually quite a bit more serious. For example, when I saw that the main cast was OVERJOYED to be thrown into jail so that they could get a free meal, while the moment was funny I also thought “man, did they seriously just become happy by being thrown in jail?”. This happens quite a few times, such as when the starving, desperate protagonists decided to grill mushrooms that they harvested from the underside of their old, decrepit desk, so on so forth. I guess you could say that I was surprised by how there a few more serious implications to certain scenes than you would think for a moe comedy show. I don’t think this was done on purpose, but it’s still an interesting little thing to note.The main cast was a total mess, though I do think it was done that way on purpose. The story follows a group of four girls that have aspirations of becoming great detectives, but when they lose their superpowers (termed “toys” in this show), they become utterly useless. Like, seriously, they were probably the most incompetent, simple-minded, spoiled main cast I’ve seen in a long time.Spoiled in the sense that the main characters had become almost completely incompetent after they lost their powers, which just shows how over reliant they were on those powers. However, these negative traits were often used to comedic effect, which I thought was an interesting way to go about things. Some of the characters, although extremely lacking in any sort of proper character development, turned out rather charming to watch and got laughs out of me.The main story got rather repetitive quite a bit, but the main strength with the story was probably how it was executed. The story certainly tried to put some unconventional twists into whatever was happening, and while it wasn’t always successful, it was still quite good at keeping the viewer engaged in the happenings of the show. The pure ridiculousness of the events in the show, along with how this show never tries to really take itself seriously (as opposed to some often forced drama in other comedies), works out surprisingly better than I had thought it would.What was a bigger issue in this series was probably the production quality, which was very weak in the first episode, and mediocre throughout the rest of the series. Tantei Opera certainly will not be winning any sort of best animation awards, but JC staff still managed to pull through in the end.Overall, Tantei Opera was surprisingly better than expected, and did exactly what the creators meant to do; create a slapstick comedy with some absurd situations and characters, and nothing really beyond that. While I certainly don’t think this was the best comedy by any means, it certainly had a more unique execution with a bunch of it’s jokes. I can see why people say this is the most underrated show from Fall 2010 outside of Japan. While this show certainly isn’t for everybody, and the fanservice may turn some people off from this show, Tantei Opera has it’s own merits and strengths that make it a rather entertaining show in it’s own right.Production Quality: 7.5/10Characters: 8.0/10Story: 7.5/10Setting: 7.0/10Overall Enjoyment: 7.5/10 (Rounded up to a 8 on MAL)Feedback and comments (as well as criticisms) are always welcome :)', ""When watching the first episode my first impression was that this anime was a children's anime on detectives and thief's, oh but how i was wrong. After watching more episodes i find that this series is definitely for older audiences especially when the teacher made his appearance.Story: 5/10Whilst their is a plot half of the episodes are dedicated to pure randomness, this is to be expected of from a comedy series. Now to the main story line. This story revolves Sherlock and her friends and their mission to re-gain/ find their toys whilst also trying to arrest The Gentleman Thief Empire. This is a...plot that hasn't got much to it except that.Art: 8/10I enjoyed the art style used for this anime. I like how each character is drawn and how they animated the some of the battle scenes. The background was nothing out of the ordinary which was a little disappointing but the character design made up for it.Sound: 7/10I did like the choice of the theme music since I thought it fitted quite well with the story. My reason for saying that is because the opening (i think) was sung by the seiyuu's of the main four characters whilst the ending represented Lady Arsene in a way.Character: 7/10Each character had their well known personalities from Hercule and her shyness to Mr. Nijuuri who loves himself. Each character is definitely unique in their own way and great to watch.Enjoyment: 6/10This series was hilarious at most times, whilst at other times it bugged me especially whenever the episode revolved around Kokoro Akechi, she really bugged me because all she did was pull pranks on Milky Holmes that I didn't really find funny.Overall: 8/10This is a great series to add to your list since it is packed with a great amount of comedy. It was fun to watch and it had a great art style too. If you are the type who likes to watch anime where they're serious about the plot then i wouldn't recommend this to you since they love to joke around in this series alot.

Overall a fantastic series."", ""Tantei Opera Milky Holmes is about the conflict of two opposing sides: detectives and phantom thieves. They are both bestowed with amazing powers called Toys and they fight beautifully in the dead of night.That's what the intro wants you to believe, but that's not really the case. More than anything, it's about four useless idiot detectives tripping over each other.I don't know why it's called Milky Holmes, either, but I'm guessing that's just something they thought sounded good in 2010.The Milky Holmes are descendants of famous detectives and were themselves supposedly famous before the series started, but now they've lost their powers and became...completely useless.We don't really get to see them be good at anything and they don't seem to acually have the personalities or the intellectual abilities of their ancestors, so we never get the feel for them ever being impressive in any way.They go to Holmes Detective Academy where they used to live in luxurious rooms until all that was taken away from them after they've lost their powers. Now they're reduced to living in a dirty, moldy attic and eating at the most neglected table in the caffeteria, where they can get a boiled potato each, at most.A lot of the humor is derived from the girls being put in miserable situations like this, but they mostly remain positive (except maybe Cordelia) about it and they're idiots, anyway, so it never feels too malicious and remains funny.There's no real story or change or character development throughout the whole season: it's all just ridiculous episodic plots that don't matter by the end of the episode and, even though it's about detectives, there isn't really much mystery solving, either.Most episodes are about the Milky Holmes running into some kind of trouble or trying to find a way to get their powers back. I'm fine with that, because those episodic plots can be pretty funny and the main characters are good enough to carry the show, but it would definitely be a better series if something did change from time to time.My favourite episodes are among the craziest ones: the one where they get lost in the forest and the one where Sherlock switches places with a princess who happens to looks exactly like her. Other than those, most episodes are fine, but there are a few straight up boring ones.Most of the characters are likeable, even though a lot of them don't get anything to do and aren't extremely memorable. I do love the four main characters and really enjoy their dynamic, though. They're entertaining and you want to see them succeed, even though they very rarely achieve anything.Sherlock is happy go lucky and possibly the dumbest one of the bunch, Nero is tomboyish, eats a lot and has a short fuse, Hercule is the least interesting character, since her only traits are being quiet and shy, whileCordelia is probably the most interesting among them. She's used to a life of luxury and when she's forced to live in poverty, she can't handle it. As soon as something goes wrong, she starts disassociating and can turn into a maniac at the blink of an eye. Her outbursts made me both laugh and feel sorry for her at the same time. She's also obsessed with cleanliness and often fantasizes about the Holmes being the ideal team that always gets along, but that rarely happens in real life.Other than them, there's Arsene, the phantom thief who gets the plot going by taking away the Milky Holmes' powers. She's just watching over the Milky Holmes most of the time and her motivations remain somewhat unclear to me.In tow, she has a misfit band of phantom thieves who follow her blindly, among which Twenty is the most entertaining.He's a narcissistic pervert who loves himself way too much and has a running joke of taking his clothes off and exposing his grotesquely long nipples.The other two aren't very interesting and they mostly just fawn over Arsene or serve as straight men to Twenty or the Milky Holmes.The final group of characters are the Genius 4, who are a kind of police force for capturing phantom thieves. I don't really know what the difference between them and the detectives is and why they both exist, because that's never explained.Among them, the most prominent character is their leader, Kokoro, a typical example of an angry, spiteful, but dumb and useless loli, who is still entertaining.The other G4 characters seem interesting, but don't have much going on. You can make out what their personalities are supposed to be, but they don't do a whole lot.The opening is great, featuring a really catchy song and fun visuals, while the ending is okay, mostly being still images of the characters in somewhat compromising positions. The ending song is pretty catchy, too, but I found myself skipping it more often than not.Aside from three or four episodes, the animation isn't anything special and the art is good enough throughout the series, being appropriately cute or deranged, depending on what is needed at the moment.The last episode of the season was extremely disappointing and had me questioning if the other seasons are just the same thing all over again.The first season was entertaining, but I don't want to just watch the same thing again and that's the main reason why I'm not exactly rushing to continue watching the series.This season was entertaining enough that I could see myself getting back into it in a few months' time, though, once I get a craving for braindead nonsense again. completely useless.We don't really get to see them be good at anything and they don't seem to acually have the personalities or the intellectual abilities of their ancestors, so we never get the feel for them ever being impressive in any way.They go to Holmes Detective Academy where they used to live in luxurious rooms until all that was taken away from them after they've lost their powers.

This show threw me for a ride. It took me a few episodes before I realized the kids genre was removed on MAL. I was sort of puzzled by the stripping male teacher who would pinch his nipples. Well despite that oddity, this show is definitely a stupidly fun show. Why? It has nothing to do with mysteries, special powers, or anything pertaining to the story. It is nothing more than the adventures for a group of girls to attempt to regain what they once had only to fail humorously.Expectation: 5Episode Scores: -,-,-,8,6,8,7,7,7,6,8,8Actual: 7 (Good)Analysis:Starting up with a quote...from the episode discussions, ""This show is dumb in all the right ways."" This sums up a lot. Extremely episodic, with happy art, and a tale of how the good guys and bad guys coexist as friends and rivals at the same time. Our queen of thieves miraculously seals away the toys of the great Milky Holmes detective group by accident, and at a loss without them goes undercover as the detective academy student body president. Her goal? To try and restore them to their glory of course, but they will say they just want to humiliate them. Her assistants also join the work force there, or rather they are able to because of the extreme idiocy of the cast. How the group was ever great is beyond me, for they cannot even figure out the identity even when they change her into her costume. Yup, has to be cosplay of course.Yet the misfortune of the Holmes group is very enjoyable, and there are a few good adult humor jokes that were good just because they seemed out of place. Indeed, it may be that the odd expectations I had allowed me to enjoy what I would usually see as average humor. Yet, I think that the comedy in this show is not bad even in hindsight. There is rarely any actual detective work in this show, as the powers allow the detectives to function more as police trying to apprehend the suspect rather than solve who it is. In actuality, the times where they attempt to incorporate detective work is when the show is at its worst.Conclusion:There is not much to say about Milky Holmes. Offering a pretty good comedic value, and requiring little brain use to enjoy it with the show exceeded my expectations. I give this a solid Good out of 10.Sequel: Would watch! from the episode discussions, ""This show is dumb in all the right ways."" This sums up a lot.

In other words, I went in with literally zero expectations.The ride was definitely a bumpy one.A short summary of Tantei Opera Milky Holmes would be something along the lines of: A cute and somewhat entertaining little anime, that has a tendency to be about as non-sensical and generic as can be. If you want a good storyline, good characters and a satisfying ending, you\'ll definitely want to look elsewhere. If you want a whacky, zaney and non-sensical anime with cute girls,...please stay and read on  - But prepare to hit the off-switch on your analytical brain however, because this show makes no sense.The story itself is not something that is going to blow your mind. It is straightforward, is cemented from episode one and onwards and doesn\'t really take any twists and turns down the line. The story works for the anime and its cast, but other than that it really doesn\'t deserve any particular spotlighting.The art is mediocre at best. What I mean by this, is that while certainly not bad or lacking in any means, it is also not particularly beautiful, fluid or unique. Colourful is about the only real compliment I can give it. That being said, it doesn\'t take anything away from the viewing experience either.The sound averages out at a ""fitting, but forgettable"". It certainly won\'t be a distraction whilst watching, but it certainly won\'t stand out to you either. I wish I had more to say here, but the soundtrack really is forgettable. Both the opening and the ending are bland, and I\'d dare say they\'re borderline bad.The characters is where Tantei Opera Milky Holmes starts pulling a bit ahead of the other anime in the deep moeblob ocean. The main cast is about as generic as they come, with your token airhead, tomboy, quiet bashful girl of course the ""semi-responsible"" girl. It is the ""villains"" however, that add some flavour to it all. The ""Gentleman Thief Empire"", made up by the four Phantom Thieves: Twenty, Rat, Stone River and Arséne are downright hilarious to observe at times and the banter between the main cast and this group of Phantom Thieves is surprisingly very entertaining.Not to mention the fellow ""Fighting-for-good"" group of the show ""Genius 4"", who despite being on the same side as Milky Holmes end up in constant arguments and fights with each other.It is this character interaction, combined with the shows tendency to pull completely over-the-top and ridiculous scenarios out of its pocket, that allows Tantei Opera Milky Holmes to pull ahead of the curve, even if it is by a tiny amount.Tantei Opera Milky Holmes is generic and downright stupid for the most part, but still somehow manages to string together an interesting mix of characters, earning it a decent 6/10. please stay and read on  - But prepare to hit the off-switch on your analytical brain however, because this show makes no sense.The story itself is not something that is going to blow your mind.
