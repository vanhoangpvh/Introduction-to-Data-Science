Midori no Makibao,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3550/Midori_no_Makibao,"[""Makibao is a shonen anime dedicated for kids and preteens. However,be sure to watch makibao alone because of the show's nude art. I enjoyed watching this as a kid. I gave it an 8 because of the good story.The story was great. A typical underdog character that works hard to succeed his dreams of meeting a beloved one. The story consists of more on comedy than drama.The art was a little bit shocking. WIKIPEDIA confirmed that this is a shone anime but yet the main character, Makibao , is practically showing his pubes. Maybe the art is designed with naturalsm.The art is depicted with a...particular style that is hard to describe. Know shin-chan? Maybe they're related.The sound was okay.The characters blended wall. A protagonist, antagonists, a heroine and supporting characters. This is one of the rarest shows that make the leading role an animal. But it did not matter anyway for the harmony was smooth.I really enjoyed their antics but no overpowering was done.Overall I say that this is a good normal anime (good,normal? what's that?) It is worth killing your boredome. particular style that is hard to describe. Know shin-chan? Maybe they're related.The sound was okay.The characters blended wall.

Naruto: Takigakure no Shitou - Ore ga Eiyuu Dattebayo!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/594/Naruto__Takigakure_no_Shitou_-_Ore_ga_Eiyuu_Dattebayo,"['Esta review también está en español.Something Naruto related without review? I\'ll fix that now!Naruto: Battle at the Hidden Falls is the second special of this series (the first one was Find the Crimson Four-leaf Clover!), showed in the Shōnen Jump Jump Festa 2004.Story: Team 7 must escort Shibuki, leader of the Hidden Fall village, back to home... and they succeed without any problems, although, they note that their protegee is a big time wuss. But, when they reach the place, a group of missing nins led by Suien (former Hidden Fall ninja), take every civilian as a hostage (yes... the twenty of them), and demand...the ""hero\'s water"", the village\'s treasure, that can make the user chakra ten times bigger for a limited time. Although it\'s a hidden village, there is no Kage (or ninjas... at least, there isn\'t in this special... I wonder where the hell was Fu...), so Naruto and Sasuke (Kakashi isn\'t there, and Sakura is useless) must save the villagers and beat Suien (and his useless minions), shonen style.Animation: the same of the beginning of the series (more exactly, this is after the chunin exam, cause Naruto knows the Naruto Uzumaki Barrage, but before the Tsunade search, cause there\'s not Rasengan yet). Correct in general, although the water sword jutsu looks ugly, and for a weird reason, they decided to show, from several angles (and speeds), how Naruto stepped on dog poop. The character designs of the new people are... average at best. We have the masked ninja (very similar to Izumo), the one with the crazy hair, and the sexy chick. Suien have a diaper in his head, like Chouji xD.Sound: no differences with respect to the series, both in music (no opening, though) and the voices.Verdict: you probably deduced it by now, but there isn\'t a lot to say about this special. The plot is average, and there aren\'t flashy fights. This could be filler. But don\'t let that last word scare you: although this isn\'t brilliant, it\'s kinda entertaining (and not very long), and is a good chance to see good old team seven in action, when they were young and inexperienced. I recommend this only to Naruto fans (who else would see it?).--------Algo relacionado con Naruto que no tiene review? Eso se arregla ahora!Naruto: Batalla en la cascada oculta: ¡yo soy el héroe! es el segundo especial creado de la serie (siendo el primero el del trébol de cuatro hojas), emitido en la Shōnen Jump Jump Festa 2004.Historia: El equipo 7 tiene como misión escoltar a Shibuki, líder de la Aldea Oculta de la Cascada, de vuelta a casa... y lo logran sin ningún sobresalto, excepto por el hecho de que Naruto y compañía notan que su protegido es un cobarde bastante importante. Peeeero, cuando llegan, un grupo de ninjas renegados de otras aldeas, liderados por Suien, (antiguo Ninja de la cascada), toman como rehenes a toda la población (que son como... veinte personas), y exigen que se les entregue el “agua del héroe”, el tesoro de la aldea, que es capaz de aumentar el chakra del usuario 10 veces por un tiempo limitado. A pesar de ser una aldea oculta, no hay Kage (o ninjas, porque en este especial no se ve a ninguno... ¿donde se habrá metido Fū?), por lo que Naruto y Sasuke (Kakashi no está por cuestiones burocráticas, y Sakura es una inútil) deberán salvar a la gente y vencer a Suien (y a sus muy inútiles esbirros), al estilo shonen.Animación: la misma del principio de la serie (para que se orienten, esto se ubicaría después de los exámenes chunin, por que Naruto usa la ráfaga de Naruto Uzumaki, pero antes de la búsqueda de Tsunade, dado que todavía no se ve el Rasengan). Correcta en general, aunque el jutsu espada de agua se ve mal, y por alguna razón, decidieron mostrar, desde varios ángulos (y a distintas velocidades), a Naruto pisando excremento de perro. El diseño de personajes de los debutantes... ninguno resalta mucho, tenemos a al ninja enmascarado a lo Kakashi,  el del pelo loco, y la chica bien dotada. Suien tiene un pañal en la cabeza, como Chouji xD.Sonido: ninguna diferencia con respecto a la serie, tanto en música (aunque no hay opening) como en las voces.Veredicto: como probablemente hayan deducido por lo anterior, no hay mucho para decir de este especial. La trama no pasa de decente, y ninguna pelea es llamativa. Bien podría ser un filler. Pero que eso no los desmotive: si bien no es bajo ningún punto de vista brillante, se deja ver, y es una oportunidad de ver al buen equipo siete en acción, cuando eran jóvenes e inexpertos, sin muchas técnicas a disposición.

This could have been an opportunity to introduce the life and culture of a different village. But while there is an attempt to do so, it fails to hit the mark. We are not told much about the Hidden Waterfall Village aside from the fact that it has something called the “Hero’s Water,” then the story proceeds to focus on the village leader, Shibuki, who is paper-thin in terms of characterization. He is beloved by the villagers and they hail him as some kind of hero, yet we are never shown why this is so. For this...story to work, we have to empathize with Shibuki, but we never really understand or get to know him enough to become properly invested. As a result, the emotional payoff is minimal, and the final showndown just feels mechanical. It doesn’t help that the opponents are painfully generic, and the fight scenes aren’t all that impressive either. Sakura pretty much plays no part here, and Sasuke and Naruto feel like they’re just going through the motions.The usual tropes and the usual platitudes but without the emotional resonance the main series has. story to work, we have to empathize with Shibuki, but we never really understand or get to know him enough to become properly invested.

Although 40 minutes long, which makes it the longest Naruto special feature, it was pretty fast-paced and action-packed to make the time fly by very quick. Also, while the animation is clearly dated at times by today's standards, it never becomes an issue since this is the style we've come to associate with Naruto. There are even a few moments where you might end up shedding a tear. I almost did.It did have another simple fighting plot, but it was done with finesse and enough surprises on the way. Most...importantly, it managed to hit home emotionally, especially in the second half, and the characterizations worked well. It was good to see Team 7 in action overall, even though it's just Naruto and Sasuke who dominate. Shibuki is a surprisingly well-written and developed character, and his scenes were emotionally impactful in the latter half. Humor was minimal but there were moments that were outright hilarious. The music was also good.All in all, this one has a good plot, well-written characters, solid action and a nice emotional investment. As a Naruto fan, that managed to tick all the boxes for me and I would recommend watching it if you too are a fan of the character or the original show. importantly, it managed to hit home emotionally, especially in the second half, and the characterizations worked well.

However, this special combines a simple yet enjoyable short story with brilliant animation, sound design, and characters.The story presents a new village with its own backstory and a conflict that is generic but is a strong conflict for a special featuring a younger Naruto. I love the idea of a hidden falls village and the idea of hero water. The name is beyond generic and cliche but its function makes this village stand out. The village is also mentioned in other...parts of the anime too and serves a somewhat deeper role. However, many concepts within the story are overly generic.The animation and art style are brilliant, everything that is required to create good animation is executed greatly in this special. I have already talked about the animation of the show in my main Naruto review so I will not further discuss this.The same goes for the sound design. Great sound effects, voice acting, and the iconic soundtrack are all brilliant. I just don’t want to repeat what I said in my main Naruto review as this is the same.I want to focus on Shibuki’s character, as this special had him develop the most. He is hailed as the village hero and yet he is a coward who can barely fight. Through his journey, and interactions with Naruto. He overcomes said cowardly nature and fights for his village. A short but sweet character journey that is the highlight of this special.Most specials in most anime are rarely for me, this special is one of those rare ones and it makes sense. Brilliant story, animation, sound design, and characters serve to make a great short special.Overall, I rank this 7/10 parts of the anime too and serves a somewhat deeper role.

Quanzhi Fashi II,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36318/Quanzhi_Fashi_II,"['**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**I am editing my review for the full season: here it is.I made a review which was ep1-10. By god, the last two episodes were awful... just... oh man i never wanna watch something that bad again.This show had a neat first season. I liked it through its flaws and simplicity, but that is something I can\'t say about the second season.Story: 2/10First season was a pretty neat story of someone with no background making it to the upper echelons of society by his own talent and natural dispositions. Second season? A giant bird invades a city and we have to stop...it (rwby much?). Ok everyones dead, good thing I didn\'t care about any of them... Oh you\'re telling me a girl with no usability of her legs escaped death multiple times to arrive at a underground shelter safely? sure. Oh, MC just drank a pool of water that was supposed to be super important? k.Its just not good. Its so boring it makes my eyes roll at times. So predictable I could have predicted the whole of the season in the first episode or two. And its not a testament to my predicting skills, it was truly not innovative in any way.The story is truly a predictable, cliche pile of stereotypes and absurdity. The way the MC achieves the next level of magic is just absurd and so predictable...Art: 8/10, same as season 1Same reasons as season 1. Nice art, cool designs, sick magic, neat environments.The art is the best part about the show. The magic at the end was especially neat... But bear in mind, the art is not unique or telling of the story at all. The only reason it is rated this high is because it is pretty. I mean sure it looks like it came from 2014, but its still a pretty show.Sound 5/10:Voice acting doesnt have the awkward laughs (praise) that the first season had. OST is meh at best. It is just mediocre at best.Characters: 2/10This was a problem in the first season, characters were not fully developed.BUT the second season has the audacity to kill of some of the already underdeveloped cast because story and character motivation... Honestly theres only one or two actually interesting characters, past that, all the characters are bland and generic. The last three episodes come and it is simply a mess of a show and its character unrelatable and boring. No motivations were fleshed out, no deep backstory setup, no interesting dialogue between the characters, literally nothing to note! It pisses me off because other shows have done this same exact thing but 100x better.Enjoyment:  2/10:ohgod: i liked the last season, was one of my favorites (i like OP mc\'s). But this one has really lost my attention due to it being so predictable. In the last few episodes, iit just became blatantly obvious that the show was a cliche mess that had no innovation whatsoever.Overall: 4/10I like OP MC\'s, usually I rate em pretty high depending on the cliche-ness of them. But this was just absurd, there was literally no innovation, a crappy cliche story, horrible characters, and really was not that enjoyable to watch near the end because half the time I was asking ""why the fuck is this happening, this is absurd"" rather than actually being engaged in the \'powerful youth\' bs. I came back each week to watch it because I did want to see the end, but near the end of the series, It just spiraled into a mess where I knew what was going to happen 4 episodes in advance.Between the visuals and sound, this show is truly a pain to watch past the 6-7th episode. Everything is just predictable, boring, and archetypal.I would not suggest the second season to anyone. The first season I would, but not the second. it (rwby much?).

Honestly theres only one or two actually interesting characters, past that, all the characters are bland and generic. The last three episodes come and it is simply a mess of a show and its character unrelatable and boring. No motivations were fleshed out, no deep backstory setup, no interesting dialogue between the characters, literally nothing to note! It pisses me off because other shows have done this same exact thing but 100x better.Enjoyment:  2/10:ohgod: i liked the last season, was one of my favorites (i like OP mc\'s). But this one has really lost my attention due to it being so predictable. In the last few episodes, iit just became blatantly obvious that the show was a cliche mess that had no innovation whatsoever.Overall: 4/10I like OP MC\'s, usually I rate em pretty high depending on the cliche-ness of them. But this was just absurd, there was literally no innovation, a crappy cliche story, horrible characters, and really was not that enjoyable to watch near the end because half the time I was asking ""why the fuck is this happening, this is absurd"" rather than actually being engaged in the \'powerful youth\' bs. I came back each week to watch it because I did want to see the end, but near the end of the series, It just spiraled into a mess where I knew what was going to happen 4 episodes in advance.Between the visuals and sound, this show is truly a pain to watch past the 6-7th episode. Everything is just predictable, boring, and archetypal.I would not suggest the second season to anyone. The first season I would, but not the second.', ""Reasons you should watch this anime:1. Moderately entertaining and short enough you can finish in 2 sessions when you are really bored. Then forget it existed completely.Reasons you should not watch the animes:1. extremely poor voice acting, MC sounds like poorly paid amateur. And fit to voice a stupid side character than the main lead.2. MC has no personality, no flaws, nothing interesting about him. Just more power than everyone else, more attention, etc etc. This seems to be a recurring theme in chinese anime. They simply don't know how to write a human being. Only some 5 year old kid's idea of a hero....Everyone's praising the MC every 2 seconds, you'd get sick of it really fast. You would think after years of naruto, bleach, the new hero academia series, they would pick up on the formula to a flawed shounen hero who has to work to get power and fame. Or noblesse / overlord type series where MC is OP, but focus and time of the show is on weaker characters he protects from the shadows.3. Animation Quality - i personally forgave this because I know chinese studios won't have the nice budget that Japanese established studios do, but still the action scenes are pretty bland in terms of animation and you have to use your imagination if you want to keep watching.5. Music and Sound - cheese, over the top and unnecessary.4. Subtitles : [for non chinese speakers] whoever did this is probably THE WORST subber in anime translation world. And i don't mean the translation. Every 2 seconds there's an irrelevant comment that has nothing to do with the show. Every 2 mins you break immersion and just wanna strangle whoever left those immature and unnecessary comments splayed all over the anime.

Since as I have said the history is pretty good. ', ""Okay well i've never written any reviews before, but the few on MAL seem to be exceptionally negative so i thought i might just try and put an opinion out there of some-one who although understands the number of flaws in the 2nd season and can see it is not a particularly well written anime, still very much enjoyed the seriesI will try to keep this spoiler free as possibleNow maybe I do have a bit of a soft spot for anime set in a school environment with OP MCs, but i don't think this show was without its meritsI think if you want to...be able to enjoy this anime you have to go in with the thought that this is just going to be a fun filled fighting montage that lacks a particularly intelligent or ground braking new story. It certainly not as bad as the story for the other anime below a 7 rating in MAL that i have seen and don't think it deserves such a low ratingStory - 6/10Now the story was a little bit all over the place, a few plot holes, but these are often just simple issues of characters not acting reasonably to a situation, Mo Fan being a prime culprit for this.If your not able to overlook this kinda of thing, then i can imagine this show being a difficult watch for youIt is also a little easy to predict in in places, i did find myself on occasion successfully predicting what was happening next/next deathThey make the classic anime mistake of randomly going into a little more detail for a random character, right before killing them off a couple timesThis not only lets me know who they planning to kill next, but doesn't really add any emotion to the situation, because i still don't really care any more about them because of the couple of minutes of extra screen time you have given them (as i mention later no real backstory is given so its hard to connect with many of the characters)Despite this i still very much found myself feeling sad/shocked just due to the shear brutality of the situation, and the overwhelming loss of life especially to young kidsThere are 2 major differences between this season and the 1st1)-They've tried to go much darker, with this season, characters are getting killed of left right and centre (although they get a bit carried away and just start killing off and putting time into characters I care almost nothing for)-I quite enjoyed this dark twist on events, it gave a very apocalyptic feel which was a nice change from the first season started to wonder if mainish characters might actually die from quite an early point of the season-I also enjoyed the one hit kill kinda style from the monsters this season, a problem I often find with anime is the insane amount of damage people can take before they die, so it was refreshing to see when people got slashed, they tended to just die after2)-The 2nd season is spread over a time period of just a week or two, whilst the 1st is over a couple years-This caused an issue because many of the side characters barely changed from the start to the end of the season (mentioned further in character section)Oh also just one more thing, ridiculous ending, just doesn't bother answering anything in a cliffhanger for the next seasonOther than that I did just about overall enjoy the story for the 2nd seasonArt - 7/10I think this is possibly the one area where there is actually a small improvement from the first seasonBut i guess thats what you would expect considering the 2nd season came out nearly 2 years laterI really like the artwork for the combo attacks when he uses both fire and lightning at the same timeSound - 5/10Nothing very special about the OSTDidn't like the opening or outro songs as much as the first season, they both sound a bit blandCharacter - 5/10I think this was one of the main issues with the anime (i touched on it in the story section)But there is just a lack of character development i'm struggling to remember a single bit of backstory for any side characters/main charactersSo a lot of the characters just feel hollow and only the around to die so the show can pretend that it could kill of anyone at any point-The only character that really changed at all was our MC,  Mo fan, and all that he did was get a bit stronger, I still know nothing of his life, why on earth he got teleported to this world, why does he have necklace that eats the souls of everything he kills?!?!-And on that note their didn't really seem to be much difference between training for his tier 2 and tier 3 magic and, it would have been nice if they had done something different and more exciting instead of just recycling the first seasonEnjoyment - 8/10Regardless of all the flaws, I very much enjoyed this animeI went in with the mindset of, hopefully this will continue off from the 1st season, sadly I was disappointed from that perspectiveHowever I was given an entirely different anime to enjoy, that was a more ridiculous way darker and just lacked some of the story quality of the 1st seasonOverall - 7/10Overall i would still recommend the 2nd season to most peopleI still watched it all in one sitting, and despite the lack of character progression still found myself wanting more, and often at points at the edge of my seat because i was always intrigued as to what was going to happen next to the students/town etc.....I can see why a lot of people don't like it though, but i just think in order to enjoy it you just need to watch it for what it is, which is Mo Fan, (and the general, who is dench but they of course wait for the last episode to show you........) just going crazy and murking demons for 12 episodesAnyway I hope this review helps anyone who's on the edge for whether or not to bother with the second season be able to enjoy this anime you have to go in with the thought that this is just going to be a fun filled fighting montage that lacks a particularly intelligent or ground braking new story.

I watched all 12 episodes right before now and honestly, I am severely disappointed at this pathetic fall from the first season. Given it's season two I'm going to assume you have watched the first and am going to spare the intro for this review, as I only wright reviews for things I think are either really bad, or really god damn good. This is the former.Quanzi Fashi 2nd Season, or in English, Full-Time Magister 2nd Season is very clearly a minimal effort cert. It does everything...wrong. The story covers nothing, its 12 episodes of a single event that is not satisfying and very very boring. The season aims to kill off people with any level of development, or none at all. Nothing seems to have any impact in this season. The story is especially poor when placed next to the first season. Of which I enjoyed immensely and loved just about every moment.When we look at the art I'm going to say for the most part it is just as good as the first season. Though things are not as defined and with the first episode changing the ending of last season, I'm inclined to say its dropped dramatically for me in comparison, but it is the only nice factor of this as it's different from what most people watch. on the lower end of things but still. far from the worst animation to ever exist. The effects at the very least are fantastic.Moving on to sound, there isn't anything there. Its boring and I barely noticed it beyond the speech (which was almost as bad or worse in a few spots) could have been so much better.Character I basically covered but ill go on to say that, there really isn't any development. Nothing is substantial and nothing matters when it comes to the characters. Oh boo hoo some characters died but that wasn't necessary, none of the events here were.Enjoyment, Ill put it this way, I barely paid any attention after ep 7 and stopped caring all together by ep 10. it was absolutely HORRIBLE...... If this gets another season, which I seriously doubt it will. I expect some god damn redemption for this ... atrocity.....Overall.. 4.... just because of the Art.....

While it is somewhat of a departure from the formula of the first season, the production has improved significantly and a number of story elements are far more compelling, making this season seem more ""full"" in many respects. While QF2 is, like the previous season, by no means a masterpiece, what it gets right outshines what it gets wrong.Like my review of the first season (QF1), this will be pretty much spoiler-free, only this time, instead of going into detail about every facet of its production & execution, I will be...focusing on its strengths & weaknesses in comparison to QF1, to give you an idea of what to expect without giving anything away. With that said, let\'s get the scores out of the way:Story: 7Art: 5Sound: 7Characters: 7Enjoyment: 8Overall: *7/10*STORY: There are a number of major differences between the two seasons in terms of story progression, some of which make them flow in a completely different fashion. First. while QF1 is something of a coming-of-age story that comprises a period of roughly 4-1/2 years, covering Mo Fan\'s high school career, QF2 is more of a quasi-dystopian tale that takes place over the course of less than a week, and details the events surrounding the ""Bo City Disaster."" As a result of this, the story isn\'t nearly as MC-centric as it was in QF1, especially since Mo Fan is in the midst of a citywide catastrophe and thus not the only major player in the story. Finally, because you are seeing multiple perspectives of the same events over a far shorter period of time, the story moves much more slowly than it did in QF1, creating a viewing experience almost completely unlike its predecessor.One thing that the seasons share, though, is the abruptness of their endings. Unfortunately, this is one aspect in which QF2 especially disappoints - while the ending in QF1 was so easy to predict that you pretty much knew what would happen by the 4th episode, it was still quite entertaining and met my expectations for a good finale; in QF2, the ending was a bit anticlimactic, not too believable and kind of cheap by comparison. This was a bit of a letdown, but the blow was lessened by the fact that I binge-watched all three seasons in one sitting when I first saw this series.ART: The animation in QF2 is MUCH better. Almost immediately, it became obvious to me that considerably more effort was put into the art. While the character designs are a little more plainly-drawn, the action scenes flow much more smoothly and do not contain the shit-tastic panels that sprang up in QF1 from time to time. Perhaps the greatest improvement in production quality, though, is in the monster designs, which are leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. In the first season, the monsters never really give you the impression that you should be all that scared of them, as they moved slowly and looked kind of dopey. In the second season, however, that could not be farther from the truth: Every monster depicted looks terrifyingly deadly and evil, like something that would haunt even a grown man’s nightmares. While the one-eyed rats in QF1 looked like cycloptic green penis Twinkies, and moved about as gracefully, the rats in QF2 actually look like giant, bloodthirsty, man-eating rats that would literally enjoy killing you. The wolves are no exception; in fact, they are so ruthless & menacing that they make the new-and-improved rats look almost stupid and silly by comparison. Even worse for Bo City, there are now at least three “species” of wolves they encounter, each one exponentially more horrific than the last. Finally, you have the “black-raised monsters,” which are a uniquely threatening presence and often a sign of much worse things to come. It’s amazing what a detail like this can do to alter an entire production: Before, there was talk of the dangers monsters posed to humanity, but you never got a sense of the true gravity of the situation; in QF2, however, you are shown exactly why humanity’s very existence is threatened by these creatures just by how they look, which is actually pretty impressive.Despite my praise for the improvement in production quality, I do need to make one thing absolutely clear: The animation is still not very good. Make no mistake, corners are still being cut and the characters’ movements are still pretty stiff & unnatural at times, so do not expect a stunning visual experience from any season of QF. This is still low-budget trash, but it is trash that just so happens to be very entertaining because it still gets a lot of things right.SOUND: There is really not much to say here, except that the voice acting improved and the sound effects are generally not too bad. The music isn’t nearly as enjoyable in this season, though, but I don’t watch anime for the music.CHARACTERS: Perhaps the most significant change in this season is the development of many secondary characters and Mo Fan’s interactions with those around him, which makes this story a little more interesting & engaging. In QF1, the series was focused entirely on Mo Fan & his high school career, so other characters did not get (or need) much development beyond their initial establishment. In QF2, the focus is more on a specific event in Mo Fan’s city, so you almost have no choice but to rely more on supporting characters, which QF2 handles surprisingly well. In addition, you see how the rest of society react to the catastrophe, from military magicians to regular people, and you get an interesting glimpse into how this society is run. I don’t want to give away too many details about the characters and spoil the fun, but there were a few shining character moments I would like to mention:- As one might expect, there are a number of tragic deaths, and each one ends up conveying something of substance about some of the surviving characters... although one such moment will make absolutely no sense (you will cringe when you see it).- Mo Fan literally threatens to kill one of his classmates if he doesn’t shut the fuck up, and it is a gloriously satisfying moment. That entire scene is pretty badass, and it helps further expose the extent of Mo Fan’s ruthlessness as well as his resolve.- Several characters get a chance to shine, and one character turns out to be far more honorable than one might expect... while at least two others are revealed to be much worse.ENJOYMENT: Like I said in my introduction, I don’t quite understand why this season gets so much heat. I really liked QF2 and found it to be technically superior to QF1, especially since it looks better and has a more “focused” story, but people really seem to think otherwise, for some reason. While I may enjoy this season ever so slightly less than QF1, mainly due to the lackluster ending, there isn’t much that justifies the level of hatred. My theory is that the timeframe has a lot to do with it, since they do feel different as a result, but perhaps there is something I’m missing…?-----------------------IN SUMMATION: While this season does have a more disappointing ending than the last, QF2 is a major improvement in most other respects: The production quality is a couple notches higher; the monsters actually look scary; the supporting characters get significantly more attention; and there is a more cohesive & well-defined plot. There are also some differences in tone, scope and timeframe that fans of QF1 may not expect, but one should not overlook this season just because of such details. In the end, QF2 is an entertaining, action-packed adventure through a hellish cityscape with likable characters trying to make it out of a disastrous & terrifying situation, and it makes for a fine continuation of the series. focusing on its strengths & weaknesses in comparison to QF1, to give you an idea of what to expect without giving anything away.

I don’t want to give away too many details about the characters and spoil the fun, but there were a few shining character moments I would like to mention:- As one might expect, there are a number of tragic deaths, and each one ends up conveying something of substance about some of the surviving characters... although one such moment will make absolutely no sense (you will cringe when you see it).- Mo Fan literally threatens to kill one of his classmates if he doesn’t shut the fuck up, and it is a gloriously satisfying moment. That entire scene is pretty badass, and it helps further expose the extent of Mo Fan’s ruthlessness as well as his resolve.- Several characters get a chance to shine, and one character turns out to be far more honorable than one might expect... while at least two others are revealed to be much worse.ENJOYMENT: Like I said in my introduction, I don’t quite understand why this season gets so much heat. I really liked QF2 and found it to be technically superior to QF1, especially since it looks better and has a more “focused” story, but people really seem to think otherwise, for some reason. While I may enjoy this season ever so slightly less than QF1, mainly due to the lackluster ending, there isn’t much that justifies the level of hatred. My theory is that the timeframe has a lot to do with it, since they do feel different as a result, but perhaps there is something I’m missing…?-----------------------IN SUMMATION: While this season does have a more disappointing ending than the last, QF2 is a major improvement in most other respects: The production quality is a couple notches higher; the monsters actually look scary; the supporting characters get significantly more attention; and there is a more cohesive & well-defined plot. There are also some differences in tone, scope and timeframe that fans of QF1 may not expect, but one should not overlook this season just because of such details. In the end, QF2 is an entertaining, action-packed adventure through a hellish cityscape with likable characters trying to make it out of a disastrous & terrifying situation, and it makes for a fine continuation of the series.', 'I fast forwarded through the last 5 or so episodes, so ""seen 12 of 12"" is not totally true but since there was no story line and nothing happened for the second half of the season, it\'s not totally false either. 5 hours of my life I\'m never getting back. I would say that this contains spoilers except that there really is no plot to spoil.This is hands down one of the worst animes I have ever seen. Everybody else has already touched on the lack of story, lack of logic, plot holes, cliches, immature translation subs [I try not to complain much on this...since I\'m benefiting from the translation].I\'ll just mention one more thing that drove me nuts which is that all the females in the show just run around screaming, crying, and praising the men for saving them. The men literally pick them up and carry them around while running away from monsters, even though they are all students in the same ""elite"" class in the magic school. The supposedly most powerful mage, a woman, is told by her father to hide in the Safe Zone and does nothing at all in the season besides run into the arms of the MC crying when she finds him safe. Oh! And don\'t forget about the obligatory huge-boob lady that grabs the MC when the enemy is coming and smashes his face into her boobs, and then notices his face is in her boobs and shoves him away. It\'s only been done a million times before, what\'s a million and one? Anyway Chinese society is really sexist (my mom\'s friends\' husbands still beat them) so I guess I shouldn\'t be surprised at any of this since I\'m benefiting from the translation].I\'ll just mention one more thing that drove me nuts which is that all the females in the show just run around screaming, crying, and praising the men for saving them.

The Chinese talk extremely fast, and the subtitles sometimes blur off the screen.

In the second season, I honestly think it did worse than the first season.First of all let me start with the art and sound of the show. The whole of the season feels very mismatched. The main characters are drawn well, but everything around them seems lacking and low quality. The monsters are designed well, but a herd of monsters is basically a copy of one monsters (which always cracks me up and takes the tension away from a scene). The sound is also very generic; it...almost feels like using copyright free open source sounds. It also sounds kind of outdated for a show in 2017.Now I will talk about the characters and the story so please keep in mind THERE WILL BE SPOILERS AHEAD.In my review of the first season, I said that I look forward to seeing how the main character will grow and improve. Well, I was very disappointed to see virtually no character development during this season, not only for the main character but no character had any sort of growth. The season flips the tone of the story upside down from what seemed like a comedic superhero theme into a survival theme in the second season, yet even though the characters are mages they are scared of facing monsters, even after encountering them several times. You'd think that would be enough to realize its a life or death situation, but it literally takes the death of several of their friends for them to even have that simple realization (even though the street is littered with corpses). The characters are very slow in fighting back, they show no improvement or reflection, and are virtually useless without the main character, including the teacher. The main character keeps upgrading his powers, yet his main flaw (imo), his character, shows no growth whatsoever. The story also feels kind of imbalanced by the fact that side characters would die with no good reason, while the main characters (Xiaohou, Fan Mo, and Xinxia for example) are protected by a literal plot armor. After all of that, the season comes to a very abrupt end (much like the first season) which shows no reconciliation whatsoever.To conclude, even though this show is shorter than a normal anime, I still got genuinely bored during quite a few episodes of the show. If you don't have the time, then I would not recommend. If you do, then at least know that even though the execution was very flimsy, the idea behind the story is actually very interesting. almost feels like using copyright free open source sounds.

Ro-Kyu-Bu!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10572/Ro-Kyu-Bu,"['This review for Ro-Kyu-Bu! will be based on opinions made after viewing the first episode of the series.This show is like a cross between a really sugoi (tl note: sugoi means amazing)adaption of Slam Dunk and Kodomo no Jikan. Basically, we have this lolicon who becomes a basketball coach for an elementary school. This team he has to put up with (tl note: enjoy) consists of two perverted DFC goddesses, some dfc who thinks she’s Shaq, a glasses girl who will probably get hit by a train by the end(as they all do), and this overly self conscious big tits girl who belongs on...a street corner. So, in short, this lolicon is in hebun.Throughout the first episode we get a lot of very nice shots of the school girls being seductresses, from them welcoming their coach to their school as what they call “imouto maids” (and calling him onii-chan, iyaaa~n), to playing with each other’s cute, adorable, tiny little chests in the shower, which alone made this show a 10/10. These skillfully inserted service shots contributed to the intricacy of this fine, well written show.By now you must be asking yourself, “Well, it has some high quality shots of some splendid, delectable young ladies, but is there any sports in this?” The great part is there is! Kind of! This first episode has the coach gauging each of their abilities, from hidoi~ to sugoi~ (big tits girl is ultra hidoi, ducking at passes! mou~ bakabaka!) It shows some basic practising for beginners, and starts off with a suteki basketball game! And with the episode ending with some boys’ basketball thug club confronting the bro tier lolicon coach, you can anticipate many more basketball games in the coming episode, on par with even Slam Dunk’s quality!So if you love angelic, flat chested goddesses playing ~uguu basketball under the authority of a lolicon, who is totally whipped by a woman who goes ~nyahahaha and is probably his sugar mama, this show is a must see for you! a street corner.

I was initially reluctant to watch this anime because of the score, but I\'m glad I committed in the end.Ro-kyu-bu is a loli/sports anime with a barebones plot and relatively static characters. While some might consider this points to criticize the anime on, I would like to point to the genre of the piece and remind everyone why we are watching this anime. To learn more about basketball? I should hope not. Sports anime is almost always a terrible representation of the actual sport itself. I will smack anyone who dares...to say that Prince of Tennis accurately portrays realistic tennis matches and strategies with my Wilson K-Blade Team.  Ro-kyu-bu is all about the girls. Loli anime is meant to be plain and simple, focusing more on cute art and high-pitched voice acting to attract fans rather than any depth of content.For a loli anime, Ro-kyu-bu sets a pretty high standard.Story (7/10)Art (8/10)Sound (9/10)Character (6/10)Enjoyment (8/10)The story revolves around Hasegawa Subaru, a 1st year (sophomore equivalent) high schooler who\'s also a basketball star. However, the high school basketball team/club gets disbanded because the team captain gets caught in a scandal with some elementary schoolgirls. So, what\'s the most obvious thing that Subaru can do?I\'m sure the author was aware of what irony is.The driving force behind the initial plot is the Subaru\'s refusal of playing basketball once the team was disbanded. Which is stupid. What kind of basketball player gives up basketball just because a school team is disbanded? Out of all the possible motivations that the author could have used, this was quite a poor choice, one that ultimately makes the message of the anime (Don\'t give up on what you love) weak and frivolous.The actual plotline with regards to the basketball team is, surprisingly, not bad. The girls don\'t win every single game they play, and success is compounded with failures. While some episodes introduce filler characters, each episode contributes to the plot or characters substantially.Regardless, plot is merely secondary to art in a loli anime. Ro-kyu-bu has a unique art style that fits quite nicely with the overall feel of the anime. This art style focuses a lot on the eyes and hair - even Subaru\'s hair is done quite detailed. Unfortunately, the same can\'t be said about their faces. Some of the angled scenes in the anime result in awkwardly derpy faces, especially for the protagonist. Besides those rare moments, however, the art remains top-notch and well done.How in the world did they get such an all-star voice crew? Hanazawa, Ogura, Itou, Iguchi, Hikasa - a seiyuu dream team. Needless to say, the girls sound amazing: Maho with fiery zest, Saki with icy tone, and Hinata with breezy pitch.The OP and ED are nicely done. Usually, songs that are sung by all the main seiyuus of the anime end up with better quality. The OST of the anime is not particularly amazing, which hinders the perfect 10.I mentioned static characters in the introduction. Besides Subaru, every character in the anime is static and fits quite neatly into stereotypical and preassigned roles. Maho is the loud prankster, Airi is the clumsy well-endowed,  Saki is the glasses girl, etc. Natsuhi is the boy rival of Tomoka (meaning they will inevitably be paired together in some way shape or form), Aoi will be tsundere until S2E13, and Miho-sensei joins the ranks of multitudes of teachers who act and look just like students.Character molds are not a completely negative thing. After all, dynamic characters take more time and effort to prepare, and are likely to be misinterpreted or distracting. However, it would be a nice touch to make at least one of the girls a dynamic character.On a whole, this anime is freaking cute. And genius. That ""small forward"" segment has got to be one of the greatest scenes in all of loli anime. I honestly enjoyed watching the characters interact with each other in their various ways, their various personalities and characters complementing each other.Overall (8/10)Ro-kyu-bu is not supposed to be some great action story like SAO or have deep philosophical insight like Ergo Proxy or be filled with heartwrenching scenes like After Story or all of the above (Angel Beats). In fact, none of the anime I just mentioned comes even close to Ro-kyu-bu in terms of pure loli goodness. Whether you are a full-blown lolicon or just an average anime watcher, Ro-kyu-bu will satisfy your cute needs for quite a long time.

The whole first episode is basically him getting an assessment of the girls, rating their skills, interacting with them like a real coach would with a kind of dramatic ending to the episode with the girls worrying and the coach confronted by little boys who are trying to act tough.Because this is the first episode and basing this off the synopsis the story should be overall pretty good, it\'s got an interesting plot, and him getting tricked into being the coach was very funny.The art of the show is very nice, very clean colors, great animation, very detailed work and just overall very good artwork.I don\'t pay attention to openings and endings though the opening is very catch, kind of a techno mix in it with some pop and was very nice. The ending sound is kinda cutesy and face paced.The characters of the show work very well together and you will enjoy them and their personalities, I have a problem with Airi and giving her double D sized tits.... But all the other ones have very strong personalities and you will find them enjoyable for loli characters. She is really the reason why I gave the characters a 7 just because it\'s a very overused thing to do in a loli anime and it makes haters hate ever more.Overall, I quite enjoyed the first episode, it went by in no time for me and I think it is going to be a very good summer anime, something cutesy, loli, funny and kinda slice of life anime, something you\'d watch when you just want to see something with a little extra ""umph"" in it that you will enjoy. actually find enjoyment in it)Their wasn\'t a whole lot of loli jokes, though 6th grader with what looks like double D sized tits...... too over the top.

Although it\'s far from great Ro-Kyu-Bu is a charming series.If you are looking an anime that is heavily focused on basketball then you are looking in the wrong place. Basketball is simply the activity which brings everyone together. However the series does lack a solid plot because the focus is on the characters themselves making it feel like a slice of life some of the time. The series is character driven and the majority of this anime is spent developing the characters, which is okay but it makes it hard...to comment on a plot that\'s hardly there. Nevertheless how each character develops combined with the ""practice"" and games are fun to watch.The art is good but it isn\'t anything spectacular, the characters designs, the backgrounds and animations are all decent. But there is nothing really special.The sound is solid. The opening and ending are really catchy and they really fit the anime. The voice actors did a great job too, they all fit the personality of the character they were playing.The characters is where the series excelled.  The variety of personalities work well together and you can feel the bond that the characters have and develop with each other. Each character undergoes a significant amount of development and by the end each character has overcome something that has been holding them down. The series is driven by these characters if you took out any character the series just wouldn\'t be the same.Ro-Kyu-Bu is very lighthearted which could make for a very fun watch.  It is not a bad way to pass the time but it\'s not something everyone can enjoy. Some people aren\'t just into this kind of thing and sometimes the series does get a bit corny.Ro-Kyu-Bu is a pretty entertaining series (if you are into this kind of anime). It\'s not a must watch but if you are bored, watching this isn\'t a bad way to pass the time. Also this series just shows how lolis+basketball does not equal disaster. to comment on a plot that\'s hardly there.

To be honest, an anime in the SoL pseudo-sports genre will most likely look not that...exciting, so it's not a shame for the studio.Everything fits and looks clean, but nothing is memorable or unique.The quality is so-so sometimes bad, sometimes okay. Sad for a sports anime, but as I said it's more about the lolis than about the sport.The character designs were decent and cute loli as you might expect. They looked distinct and fit their rolls.5/10 MediocreSoundI personally didn't like either the opening or the ending. But its electronic jpop tracks fit the show well.The ost is forgettable, bland and not mentionable. It still worked fine with the show. Nothing stood out.The only redeeming factor was the Voice Acting cast for the show, with Yuki Kaji voicing the Maincharacter Subaru, and Kana Hanazawa voicing the female lead Tomoka. Everyone else did also a great job being cute lolis.5/10 MediocreStoryA loli bascetball team gets a teenage coach who kinda falls in love with one of the girls who is fairly talented in what she does. He helps them to play in a real professional match.The premise sounds generic and bad, unless you are into lolis, like me.It's rather slow and doesn't make too much sense, especially from a sports point of view. But to be honest I have no clue about sports and thus won't judge it on that basis.Don't take it to seriously.It does offer fanservice, small bits of romance and here and there funny moments though.5/10 MediocreCharactersWhen it comes to SoL shows the characters are mostly the driving force behind it. Ro-Kyu bu does a decent job in regard to characters.They are all likable, show almost normal human traits, make sense though fall into their sterotype archs. They even show character development!But there is on mentionable character from them all. Subaru for the most likable pervert/lolicon in anime history (at least for me). He is a true rollmodel when it comes to lolis. ... damn I wish I was him...7/10 GoodValueI certainly will rewatch it and am excited for the second season. Though no episode stood out in particular to be re watched again. There is basically also no good reason to watch it again besides for the cuteness.On a sentimental basis it's on a high list, I will certainly remember it for being the basket-lolis anime, and it also was the first anime that made it right when it comes to the lolis.On a historical basis, well its Studio Blancs first anime as far as I know, besides that. Nobody will remember this show. Way too generic.4/10 DecentEnjoymentMy enjoyment was on a constant high, all dem lolis were just too damn cute, and that maincharacter cracked me up. It even had some thrilling moments though were too generic too be regarded highly.Overall it was a very enjoyable show.8/10Overall it scores a 6/10 (though for me it will always be a masterpiece!)Fair exciting, so it's not a shame for the studio.Everything fits and looks clean, but nothing is memorable or unique.The quality is so-so sometimes bad, sometimes okay. Sad for a sports anime, but as I said it's more about the lolis than about the sport.The character designs were decent and cute loli as you might expect. They looked distinct and fit their rolls.5/10 MediocreSoundI personally didn't like either the opening or the ending. But its electronic jpop tracks fit the show well.The ost is forgettable, bland and not mentionable. It still worked fine with the show. Nothing stood out.The only redeeming factor was the Voice Acting cast for the show, with Yuki Kaji voicing the Maincharacter Subaru, and Kana Hanazawa voicing the female lead Tomoka. Everyone else did also a great job being cute lolis.5/10 MediocreStoryA loli bascetball team gets a teenage coach who kinda falls in love with one of the girls who is fairly talented in what she does. He helps them to play in a real professional match.The premise sounds generic and bad, unless you are into lolis, like me.It's rather slow and doesn't make too much sense, especially from a sports point of view. But to be honest I have no clue about sports and thus won't judge it on that basis.Don't take it to seriously.It does offer fanservice, small bits of romance and here and there funny moments though.5/10 MediocreCharactersWhen it comes to SoL shows the characters are mostly the driving force behind it. Ro-Kyu bu does a decent job in regard to characters.They are all likable, show almost normal human traits, make sense though fall into their sterotype archs. They even show character development!But there is on mentionable character from them all. Subaru for the most likable pervert/lolicon in anime history (at least for me). He is a true rollmodel when it comes to lolis. ... damn I wish I was him...7/10 GoodValueI certainly will rewatch it and am excited for the second season. Though no episode stood out in particular to be re watched again.

The artwork was typical of a slice of life anime and lacked originality, though the quality was good.The plot was straight forward enough and lacked depth, though the direction was good and made for a heart warming story at times.  However, as the series progressed it became apparent that the linear direction of the series will cause viewers to lose interest, and I doubt I could sit through more than a few episodes at a time before becoming bored with lack luster...plot.  It seemed to me the ecchi aspect, panty shots, and awkward situations the characters are caught in is what the writers seem to think that those aspects would bridge the gaps where boredom arrives.The art as mentioned above was of good quality, including the lighting, scenary, and fast motion animation.  All seemed clean, crisp and fluid, however the originality was lacking.  From my point of view there are a handful of slice of life animes which can compare or exceed this series graphically, and because of the lack of originality in this series it just seems to fall short of masterful in this area.The characters are key in any slice of life anime and Ro-Kyu-Bu did not disappoint to capture the spirit of a harem.  Though the harem was heavy on the younger sister type, that was completely due to circumstances laid out in the plot.  The characters seemed to work well together, and you were able to see a little bit of Suburu’s personality in each of the other chacters making the relationships realistic.All in all Ro-Kyu-Bu was an average series, I could recommend it to a few select people which are into loli, harem, and ecchi but aside from that it is a very selective fit.Rating 5/10POSTED BY @GameJok3r plot.

The girls basketball team show dominance on the court and will accept any challenge ahead of them with the help of there coach on the sideline. ', '***This is a Spoiler-Free Review***You probably have your pre-conceptions of what kind of show Ro-Kyu-Bu is.  Even from just looking at a splash image, you may know whether or not this show is for you.  This review will not convince anyone that is disturbed or offended (lol) by an anime about grade school girls playing basketball and the occasional ecchi rom-com harem antics that come with such a setup.  For those of you still reading, there\'s a little more beneath that stereotypical exterior...(but only a little)Story [6/10] - After watching the first episode it\'s pretty hard to get a feel for what...this show is going to be like.  Do they shirk off the premise in favor of the cute cast of characters (K-On) or do they include in technical detail the action of sports while building the plot towards an ultimate goal (Bamboo Blade)?  Do they find the right balance of sports, and moe?The answer is obvious.  Ro-Kyu-Bu, for better or worse, is not a sports anime, and this is evident from the start.  It is, at its core, part of the MoE wAvE everyone loves or hates.  As such, it\'s difficult to review the plot because what makes the wheels turn is fanservice (a little too much at times) or scenes that build the charm of the characters.  However there is also a focus on the gradual maturing of the characters.  Subaru, in trying to find an outlet for his basketball discovers more about himself and his love for the game, while the girls discover more about why they play basketball, and their relationships with each other and their coach.  Don\'t let that fool you though.  Ro-Kyu-Bu doesn\'t take its plot too seriously.Art [7/10] - Good but nothing to write home about.  Backgrounds, background animation is great, following the trend of many slice of life anime and modeled off of real-life locations in Japan.  Sports animation is where the budget was blown, as the basketball scenes feature excellent artwork and animation.  There is definitely visual appeal in here, so what I\'m about to say may be a little harsh.What pulls this score down is some of the character animation.  And not really the artwork...I got used to the style quickly and found a lot of them to be cute for their strange, old-school style.  However, due to this nature, there are so many instances where when a character turns their head or is drawn in the background (even in the BD versions) their expression, pose etc. just end up being awkward...reminiscent of poor churned-out romance anime like Suzuka.Sound (OST, OP/ED, Voice Acting) [9/10] -When an anime cast records a full-length studio album titled after the show they were in, you know they are aware that this is a major selling point.  Whether or not you watch this show, if you like Anisong you should check out Ro-Kyu-Bu! the self-titled album featuring the main cast of characters.The soundtrack is good, but not exceptionally memorable.  You have your melancholy, sports action, comedy, and daily-life style tracks among others.  It fits well, but not particularly ""listenable"" outside of the anime.The OP, ""SHOOT!"" is great.  Composed by KOTOKO, featuring the guitarist from fripSide (source: KOTOKO herself at Animezement 2012) and vocals provided by the 5 females leads, it is a mashup of dream proportions.  The ED is also great...also included on their album.  It blatantly panders to fans of Anisong, as if you\'ve ever been to or seen a Japanese idol or anisong concert, you\'ll know a major part of them is the ""cheering"".  The ED basically scripts the cheer for the fans, so that even a total newb can cheer along at concerts...yep that\'s the kind of song it is, but it\'s still catchy.Lastly, the voice acting.  Once again, it\'s clear this is where the money was spent.  With an all-star cast of Hanazawa Kana (who doesn\'t love her?), Hikasa Youko [Mio], Iguchi Yuka [Index], Ogura Yui, and somewhat less-known Hidaka Rina [Last Order]...and a side cast that includes [deep breath] Ise Mariya, Noto Mamiko, Satou Rina, Satou Satomi,  Kawasumi Ayako, Itou Kanae, Itou Shizuka, Kotobuki Minako... yeah basically, your ears are in for a treat.  I\'d be bold enough to say that if none of these names or previous roles have done anything for you in the past, you won\'t appreciate Ro-Kyu-Bu as much.Character [9/10] - This is what will sell Character CDs, doujin, dakimakura, phone straps, figures, you name it.  On one side that is to say that when it comes to moe appeal, the show does its job well.  However it still does a good job of building the characters so they are not cardboard cutouts.  As with most slice-of-life shows, it takes the time to delve into each character\'s motivations, fears and weaknesses, and take the time to treat them.  Again with a pinch of salt considering its premise, but if you stick with it by the end you may feel satisfied to see the girls (and Subaru in a sense) grow up.In small ways, each character overcomes their stereotypical role by bonding with the other characters and improving their game, which leads to some unexpected developments and surprises.  Using the premise of basketball as well, you can see their passion and dedication grow and the results of their developed team work and honed skill are evident.  They also are filled with immaturity and childhood problems, which makes you want to protect them (the true sort of definition of moe).  Combine this with superb performances by the voice actors and you have a delightful recipe, but like anything sweet, one consumed in moderation.Enjoyment [8/10] - It\'s an abused adage but do you enjoy ""cute girls doing cute things""?  If so, you can do far worse than Ro-Kyu-Bu, and considering the likable personalities of the characters, even if you can\'t imagine watching an anime with basketball as the premise (I certainly couldn\'t) you won\'t waste your time.  The characters WILL worm their way into your heart.Overall (not an average) [7/10] - By the end, I was left with gaps in my memory as to what the plot actually was, but definitely had burned-in images of the characters and their personalities.  In short, it\'s a slice-of-life that says ""who needs plot when you have a cute and dynamic cast of characters?"" but doesn\'t rewrite the genre or usurp other titles that ask the same question with a more definitive answer. this show is going to be like.

I typically try to avoid using this word, because of how people react to it, but…. It’s the only way to even explain what Ro-Kyu-Bu is….…… Welcome to Loli’s playing basketball!!! That’s right, that’s what Ro-Kyu-Bu is, but fret not, aside from a few bathing scenes, it’s not all that bad, I promise (I’m totally lying, don’t listen to me, beware, ecchi)! The story of Ro-Kyu-Bu is about a high school student who is forced to be a sensei to 5 school girls in a...basketball club.  The student, Hasegawa Subaru is forced by his aunt who is a teacher at the elementary school, who is an “L” as well to train 5 girls for three days; it’s a sort of plot to get Subaru back into basketball and it works incredibly well too, because once he witnesses the girls playing, he devotes all of his free time into helping train them.So the story is pretty simple and the only issue I have from it is there seemed to have been some problem when Subaru played basketball, I know MAL gives the synopsis for it, but without reading it, you’d never really “know” that, it’s never expanded on or even talked about, though I guess there are vague hints… maybe? (I really don’t think so).  If you haven’t figured it out yet, Ro-Kyu-Bu is without a doubt, slice of life with some comedy involved, there are ecchi scenes as well, so take that into consideration before watching something like this. The main reason to watch this though, aside from the amazing cast of characters is the way all the girls get better and grow.The stars of the anime, the absolutely adorable and ridiculously cute girls; we have Tomoka, the ace of the team, the most experienced basketball player and she has an excellent jump shot, which is what draws Subaru to want to coach the girls. There is also Hinata; she is the epitome of what moe could ever hope to be, innocent, adorable, super cute and a seiyuu performance that will knock you out from squeeing and being so darn gleeful, Hinata is an unbelievable girl and her growth is tremendous. Maho, our rambunctious, loud and hot headed member of the group, her ability to learn is astounding, surpassing everyone and anyone in the same age group (though being new to basketball, she still has a lot to learn). Can’t forget about Airi, she’s the super tall girl who doesn’t really look like she belongs in elementary school, she’s been through some tough things growing up and as such, is afraid of a lot, her being tall is also difficult for her too, since she believes being tall is bad; her developments throughout the anime are quite amazing. Lastly we have Saki, the intelligent girl who can stay cool even under pressure, the game changer as I would call her; she’s capable of a lot and her skills are used often to stay competitive in games.The girls are cute; the story is just as cute. The spirit to play basketball, the yearning to win and go on to do something more with basketball; it’s really just incredible. I can’t even believe it, but this amazing anime had me tear up for just being so darn cute, I had all these emotions and feels when the girls wouldn’t back down and wanted to continue playing, to continue learning and growing, things like that always get me to tear up and in Ro-Kyu-Bu, it’s no different. The actual growth of the girls is well shown too, aside from Tomoka, everyone else essentially starts off as newbies, they have no idea what to do and how to do it, so Subaru starts with the absolute basics, learning to pass, how to shoot, learning coordination and being aware of your surroundings. Now because it’s a 1-cour anime, the girls pick up on the lessons incredibly quick and get “good” quickly too. I have no problem with the escalated pace of storytelling, since the last two episodes are amazing because of it. I will say though, don’t expect a lot of actual basketball matches or anything even close to that, the entire bulk of Ro-Kyu-Bu is quite literally about the girls learning basketball and getting close with their coach.Art. !!! Wooooohoooooo; I think it’s unbelievably superb. It’s cute on top of cute on top of more cute. The girls are all adorably drawn, they have huge eyes (HUGE!!), large heads compared to the rest of their bodies and all (The basketball is as big as their heads, it’s soooo cute). There are some examples of gorgeous and great background art, though I will say that most of the other scenes, especially repeated ones, aren’t as detailed or astounding. The focus, I feel like, was the girls, the basketball and things related to them. The animation is pretty good, I have no issues with it, hair sways beautifully, clothes move in ways you’d expect. The lines are really well drawn, everything is rather smooth and free of hard edges and dark lines, it’s a light show, with light colors and light everything. Though seeing as how this is an ecchi based show…. ahem… well the lines, yeah. I personally loved the art, especially the eyes and the way their rendered/shown to us, it’s unique.Music. Ahhh, it’s actually incredible. What an amazing sound track. The OP and ED are 100 % perfect, “Party Love! Party Love! Party Love!”. The BGM is phenomenal and well executed; capable of bringing hype to scenes that need it and cuteness when everything else requires it. It’s cheerful, it’s poppy, it makes you want to cheer for the on screen dilemma and then giggle and laugh and squee at how adorable everything in this anime is, it’s just amazing.Aside from all that, the supports in Ro-Kyu-Bu are really good, especially the aunt Mihoshi, but there is also Subaru’s childhood friend Aoi. The two of them alone bring in many laughs and Aoi is so darn cute with her own crush for Subaru, though her dilemma is pretty funny.Personally, Ro-Kyu-Bu is exactly what I’ve been looking for ever since I’ve seen Softenni (Think Ro-Kyu-Bu, but about Soft Tennis, more fan service and a ton of comedy). Something extra cute with cute girls playing a sport. I have actually found a few other girl sport animes to watch and I look forward to them, but Ro-Kyu-Bu is a huge hit for me, I loved every second of it and am so happy there is a 2nd season available to watch. 10/10, the cuteness overload is amazing and the girls are soooo cuuuute! basketball club.

If you liked K-on will likely identify with the characters that show the characteristics are similar.I think the major difference of this series for of basketball are other children their characters strong bond that develops between them and how the author and producers managed to create a story that can be developed in a way not so focused on the sport, when you watch two episodes of the series you will immediately realize the intention of the producers...in which they tried to create a story where you not only see the development of players in basketball as in their personalities and characteristics too, you will find yourself in a work where you will be seeing children teaching as an adult can learn from them and how you can be born a strong bond between coach and players, the passion of the girls basketball and the focus of that if it is a thing to be noted you in some moments if you will pick up rooting for them in matches and it is one thing to praise the show, who shows that can involve watched.The story of the show does not have an end goal, each episode has a different progress unless the first 3 episodes that form arch type. The introduction is well done and explains the dramas and fears of the protagonist, explores each character well and his problems but not so deep, but it is still the focus of the anime making it sometimes a slice of life, basketball is just a more ingredient in this work, would be joining the characters.The show is fun, it's interesting to see how it forms an inseparable union between the protagonists, as each one helps as each overcomes his fears, becomes pleasant to see the protagonist helping each child to develop both in sport and in their personalities.The matches of basketball has a good pace and are interesting to watch who probably likes basketball will feel good seeing.Kyu has beautiful strokes but not perfect, their sound is not the strongest point.================================================== ==============History: 8The show has a fun and engaging story, but it has a purpose, every episode is a different arc, but has a good development and not become dull but as no mystery or suspense that has no impact other series do you want know what will happen in the next episode and really think this is one of the biggest sins in this series.Art: 8The art is nice, nothing spectacular and in some angles is a bit bad but nothing to let the show boring, scenarios are well done, the movements of basketball too, the expressions are also well worked, the sense of movement and fidelity with Sport is something to mention.Characters: 7Many people will wonder why I gave 7 for the characters being who can say that they are the center of the work and they are what make her story goes.There is no problem on the issue of character development in the book, it's really fun to see the bond that is born between the protagonist and girls, including in several episodes are focused on just one character and resolution of his drama that honestly are well thought out, but they have no natural charisma, but until you can do cheer for them at times, entretando missing something in certain parts girls look very children they are okay in school but in some really exaggerated and appealing, but if repeated you liked K-On will probably love this show.Sound: 6It really is the weakest point of the show, but how about elementary school children think it fits well with the atmosphere cheerful.Enjoyment: 7There is a show that you go have fun through jokes, they are forced through and not make you laugh, I did not laugh at any moment of the show, but you'll have fun through history and basketball games! in which they tried to create a story where you not only see the development of players in basketball as in their personalities and characteristics too, you will find yourself in a work where you will be seeing children teaching as an adult can learn from them and how you can be born a strong bond between coach and players, the passion of the girls basketball and the focus of that if it is a thing to be noted you in some moments if you will pick up rooting for them in matches and it is one thing to praise the show, who shows that can involve watched.The story of the show does not have an end goal, each episode has a different progress unless the first 3 episodes that form arch type.

It\'s sweet and heartwarming and you\'ll be rooting for the girls.  Unlike many shows of this type, Subaru (the main character) isn\'t a loser or weirdo, he\'s a cool and nice guy, so it doesn\'t have to indulge in the usual harem shenanigans (though it sometimes does anyway, much to my chagrin).+ Characters have varied personalities and all get individual focus at different times to develop their characters.  When they actually play basketball games, it\'s thematically tied into...the challenges that different characters face in practice and their personal lives, allowing them to overcome them in a satisfying way.+ Nice use of background music and the OPs and EDs are all pretty catchy. Hanazawa Kana does her usual good work as Tomoka\'s VA.+ Despite the weirdly romantic vibe that it often takes, Subaru and Tomoka\'s relationship is nice and more wholesome than you\'d expect.  While it\'s clear in the subtext that Tomoka has a huge crush on Subaru, the series is never tasteless enough to have Subaru openly reciprocate those feelings, and instead he simply respects her as a basketball prodigy and as a person.Negatives:- Creepy amount of loli fanservice.  Many completely unnecessary scenes of the girls, who are 6th graders, in the bath, grabbing each other\'s breasts, etc...- Cringeworthy and unoriginal ecchi bullshit.  They even recycle the same ""joke"" multiple times, where Subaru discovers the panties of one of the girls on the floor while they\'re bathing and goes to drastic lengths to try to return them without being seen. I would\'ve rolled my eyes at this in normal circumstances, but the fact that the girls are in elementary school makes everything worse and more uncomfortable.- Aoi is an underutilized character.  A few times she gets moments to do something, like when she coaches up a timid Airi on how to get over her fears, but she gets forgotten for long stretches and her crush on Subaru goes nowhere. Mihoshi, the basketball club advisor, feels similarly wasted and rarely even gets fun moments as a side character.- The humor in general isn\'t funny and is overly reliant on Aoi or Mihoshi seeing a sexual misunderstanding involving Subaru and the girls and assaulting him like violent tsunderes.- Basketball action is occasionally well animated, but is often reduced to being a literal slideshow.  It\'s not like it looks terrible, and it actually looks nice when they put work into a particular scene, but they clearly didn\'t have the budget to animate this series properly. The overly cutesy ""every female character, even the adults, is a loli with a fang"" art style is also not ideal.- The subtitles translate ""scoop shot"" as ""floater"", which, first of all, are not the same thing, and more importantly, neither would correctly describe the actual shot, which is in fact a finger roll.

Congratz, you can stop as this is the absolute pinnacle of that. The main characters are really endearing and while the story is not exactly complicated, it does a really good job of somehow getting you invested in small girls playing basketball.The voice cast in this show is simply amazing.

Thus forth, if you\'re completely against the genre, don\'t watch it just to rant!Anyway, moving onto the show, contrary to popular opinion and the beginning in particular, this anime encompasses a nice medium between the Moe, and the sport at hand: basketball of course! It is to be expected then that since there is a division between genres, it\'s a laid back show, in fact it throws a degree of intimacy into the mix with...its ability to convey the thoughts and feelings of the characters, and even their typical Moe/SoL procrastination.The plot is not extensive, i will admit, since the show edges towards a casual approach, it prioritizes the character development a little higher, though that\'s not to say the setup isn\'t interesting - the concept of having a guy similar to my age using a lot of his time for (in an academic light) nonconstructive activity (excluding being a lazy git) is somewhat relatable for me, though i\'m a little disappointed that this setup they made didn\'t cause as much of a juicy friction (between exams and the girls whom he loves to coach) and pressure on him, hopefully his own character development might be expanded on in the second series.Come to think of it, none of the characters\' back stories are elaborated on too far, there\'s more of a ""spur of the moment"" theme, and so there\'s always something relevant going on (great for those who resist long term commitment) - what\'s going on you ask?Well, as a whole, Ro-Kyu-Bu has a unique cinematic feel, and it effectively utilities a classic shounen / movie / inspirational structure. Despite what the Loli genre implies by stereotype, it always shines through with good morals, and touches on the cohesion between a group of friends. More than anything, if i were to summarize what goes on in the show, it\'s about the (emotional) growth of the girls, well physical too if you mean training in basketball - and how it\'s thanks to Subaru\'s dedication. Aiming to take them to victory, and improve their cooperation.AWWWWWW - you say.Yes, ultimately it\'s a cute show not to be taken deadly seriously, the characters are interesting, and the obvious conflicts between Subaru and being a lolicon fill in a comedy aspect too.

I'm always confused as to what grade these kids are in.  Is the guy in High School, or Middle School.  I understand that the girls are elementary school kids, but seriously, They most definitely do not seem like elementary. they seem like late middle school kids.It was a very good anime, and I enjoyed it very much.  The anime had its funny moments, its sincere moments, and its serious moments.  It also taught that sports should not...only be played to win, but played to have fun.  Thats what its all about.The shots that some of these kids where pulling off were way too pro for them to be shots made by kids.  But their all very awesome and fun to watch.The story is easy to follow, and very entertaining.  The art had its hiccups, But it was fun to point it out, and laugh.Characters were interesting, because they all had their own individual personality.

For the most part I expected it to be pretty moe right off the bat and I was right. It doesn\'t try to hide it\'s moe-ness at all. There\'s quite a bit of fan service as well but nothing to explicit.The story really isn\'t in far enough for me to get a good opinion on it but it has potential. A former basketball player in 10th grade is tricked into coaching an elementary school\'s girl\'s club for 3 days, although it\'s obvious somehow...he will be pushed into more. The girls for whatever reason want this boy to fall in love with them.The animation is pretty well done and the voices are fitting. The basketball side of the story so far is pretty well done. Hopefully it gets a little more in depth on that part. The characters are your typical moe type characters but they have a uniqueness of their own.I plan to keep watching as it has caught my interest, but there\'s just not enough in the first episode for me to say much more. he will be pushed into more.

I realize everyone but Airi is pretty short, but man, I was pretty excited for some dunks.In any case, ro-kyu-bu! is a serviceable ecchi-loli-harem-sports show. The novelty of that combination, combined with a really catchy opening and ending theme, was what hooked me, and I wasn't disappointed. It's cute enough, the characters are endearing if typical, and though I haven't watched any other sports animes (although you could call this a harem show that uses sports as a motif, I guess) the show makes watching basketball interesting enough. Watching the girls...and their initially-reluctant coach bond though the medium of sport was touching, and woven though all the shower and beach scenes there's a sort of nice story about friends overcoming trials together and fighting for each other.The characters were very cute, which is a big selling point. This is harem on easy-mode, so there's no real tension between the characters (besides the tsundere, of course) and everyone gets at least an episode or two of 'me' time. My favorite was probably Hinata, as the loli-est loli she's pretty weird, and Maho's pretty great as the genki girl. Tomoko as the lead girl and sweet basketball prodigy is very cute, and really, there's enough here for everyone who likes basketball playing loli harems.What dragged this down to a six for me was the sense that, even with the novelty, there was a lot here making this show an uphill battle. The art is pretty rough on the eyes and the animators sometimes have trouble understanding proportions beyond the general huge-eyes-small-mouth character design. Some of the humor was pretty good, but a lot of the ecchi jokes were pretty tired - by the end we've been treated to enough 'you pervert!' high-kick-panty-shots that it felt like they were just phoning it in. Except with basketballs.Big ups for all the basketball-related innuendo, though? There's also a bit of self-awareness of all this when a character asks, before an intense game of poolside bikini basketball, 'why are we all in swimsuits?'. Why indeed.The dramatic elements, too, were pretty thin - I didn't mind the breakneck cycle of crisis-resolution-crisis-resolution-beach episode-etc. - trying to juggle five sort of main characters plus one in a twelve-episode harem show is, I'm sure, difficult.

That features a colorful cast of elementary girls who can unrealistically Michael Jordan a basketball. It’s like Kuroko’s Basketball, if the cast often played the sport in maid outfits and swimsuits. It’s an earnest fanservice series that doesn’t go too far and is family friendly; the seductive subtext is usually implied AT MOSTーif you need an added to connotation to that sentiment, this series is done by the same team AND mangaka that worked on Tenshi 3P.•\tThe characters, from the first season, are pretty memorable. There’s the lead heroineーTomokaーwho has alacritous desire to become the best basketball player...that she can be and develops a crush on her coach; this becomes a somewhat detrimental draw-back in the OVA and second season, seeing as she goes from being a sweet, forthright girl to someone who’s so thirsty that her entire motivation is making moves on the coachーan example of this is when suddenly showing up to his house to spend the night in season two, though goaded by her friendsーit’s pretty forward for a girl in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!•\tThere’s another character, out of the main cast, that’s incredibly lovableーHinata. She’s another sweet, hard-working girl and, unlike Tomoka, she seems entirely aware of her feelings for the coachーoften teasing him coyly or making one-off remarks. She’s the smallest girl on the team and because of that she works very hard to compensate for it and is able to do really neat trick moves.•\tOther characters include Maho, the rich, ojou-sama, tsundere, blonde twin-tailーgod, too many stereotypes put into one character! Airi, who has an extreme phobia of people acknowledging her tall statureーbeing a crybaby who just wants to fit in with her friends. Saki, the intuitive one, who doesn’t get as much screen time as the others, but tends to be the voice of reason. And, Aoi, the main character’s high school, childhood friend who managed his basketball team before they disbandedーshe’s feisty, cute, and also serves as an anchor of common sense, among all of the erratic lolis.•\tThis series is very good-lookingーthough, the second season slacks in budget. There’s an all-star cast of voice actors: Tomoka is voiced by Kana Hanazawa, Hinata is voiced by Yui Ogura, Saki is voiced by Yoko Hikasa, etc. The first season did an excellent job of having cute girls doing cute things in a way that kept you invested in the storyline and the struggles of Subaru’s (protagonist) complex with losing his team, despite dedicating so much time to the sport and learning how to love basketball non-competitively again.•\tI watched the OVA after the first season, even though according to the official chronology, it aired mid-way through the second season. While the characters were still adorable, the OVA had too much fanservice. I felt like I was watching Kodomo no Jikan again. Milk splatters suggestively onto a girl’s face, there are ample panty shots, sexual innuendoes, Tomoka’s mother even implies that she improves of their relationshipーdespite Tomoka being a elementary school attendee! It was certainly a disappointment after watching the first season.•\tUnfortunatelyーI was further letdown by the second season, Ro-Kyu-Bu SS; the first episode was particularly strange. The pacing was shot-gunned, there’s a dramatic insert songーwithin five minutes of hurriedly resolved drama, Tomoka’s father is built up to be this really big hard-ass that’s going to keep Tomoka from playing basketball with her friends, but all of that is resolved in two minutes because the Subaru helps him find his glasses when he drops them at a fireworks festival… so much for that! I haven’t read much of the manga yet, so I don’t know if that was supposed be a longer conflict in the original source materialーbut it sure felt like it would be!•\tThe new characters that were introduced in the second season were really underwhelming and were beaten quickly by the main girlsーI don’t even see the point of them being characters. There’s a cute, bratty girl with purple hair and a side-tail; but that pastiche was already taken by a snobby girl with blonde hair, red ribbon, and a ponytailーthat was introduced as a rival at the end of the first season…•\tThe only thing that second season does right is, in episode six, there’sーhand’s downーthe best onsen episode that I’ve ever seen in anime! It has Monogatari levels of absurdist humor and great development with Aoi and Subaru’s budding relationship, but after that brilliant trip to the hot springsーAoi’s development is completely shafted and never gets focused on again! There are really wonderful Hina moments in season two, but compared to the lack of cohesive plot and the degradation of Tomoka’s personalityーthese moments feel very fleeting.•\tOverall, if you’re into light-hearted, moe showsーthis series is a must! The girls are distinctive and likable, it’s motivational, and has nice comical moments intermingled into the loli-ocalpse! The second season should be watched with discretion, but episode six is a must-watch for people who love the first season! I give this sugary crème brûlée of a series a 7/10 for the first season, the OVA is a 4/10ーit’s practically just fanservice with a couple of cute moments, and the second season is a 5/10. that she can be and develops a crush on her coach; this becomes a somewhat detrimental draw-back in the OVA and second season, seeing as she goes from being a sweet, forthright girl to someone who’s so thirsty that her entire motivation is making moves on the coachーan example of this is when suddenly showing up to his house to spend the night in season two, though goaded by her friendsーit’s pretty forward for a girl in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!•\tThere’s another character, out of the main cast, that’s incredibly lovableーHinata. She’s another sweet, hard-working girl and, unlike Tomoka, she seems entirely aware of her feelings for the coachーoften teasing him coyly or making one-off remarks. She’s the smallest girl on the team and because of that she works very hard to compensate for it and is able to do really neat trick moves.•\tOther characters include Maho, the rich, ojou-sama, tsundere, blonde twin-tailーgod, too many stereotypes put into one character! Airi, who has an extreme phobia of people acknowledging her tall statureーbeing a crybaby who just wants to fit in with her friends. Saki, the intuitive one, who doesn’t get as much screen time as the others, but tends to be the voice of reason. And, Aoi, the main character’s high school, childhood friend who managed his basketball team before they disbandedーshe’s feisty, cute, and also serves as an anchor of common sense, among all of the erratic lolis.•\tThis series is very good-lookingーthough, the second season slacks in budget. There’s an all-star cast of voice actors: Tomoka is voiced by Kana Hanazawa, Hinata is voiced by Yui Ogura, Saki is voiced by Yoko Hikasa, etc. The first season did an excellent job of having cute girls doing cute things in a way that kept you invested in the storyline and the struggles of Subaru’s (protagonist) complex with losing his team, despite dedicating so much time to the sport and learning how to love basketball non-competitively again.•\tI watched the OVA after the first season, even though according to the official chronology, it aired mid-way through the second season. While the characters were still adorable, the OVA had too much fanservice. I felt like I was watching Kodomo no Jikan again. Milk splatters suggestively onto a girl’s face, there are ample panty shots, sexual innuendoes, Tomoka’s mother even implies that she improves of their relationshipーdespite Tomoka being a elementary school attendee! It was certainly a disappointment after watching the first season.•\tUnfortunatelyーI was further letdown by the second season, Ro-Kyu-Bu SS; the first episode was particularly strange. The pacing was shot-gunned, there’s a dramatic insert songーwithin five minutes of hurriedly resolved drama, Tomoka’s father is built up to be this really big hard-ass that’s going to keep Tomoka from playing basketball with her friends, but all of that is resolved in two minutes because the Subaru helps him find his glasses when he drops them at a fireworks festival… so much for that! I haven’t read much of the manga yet, so I don’t know if that was supposed be a longer conflict in the original source materialーbut it sure felt like it would be!•\tThe new characters that were introduced in the second season were really underwhelming and were beaten quickly by the main girlsーI don’t even see the point of them being characters. There’s a cute, bratty girl with purple hair and a side-tail; but that pastiche was already taken by a snobby girl with blonde hair, red ribbon, and a ponytailーthat was introduced as a rival at the end of the first season…•\tThe only thing that second season does right is, in episode six, there’sーhand’s downーthe best onsen episode that I’ve ever seen in anime!

It was while I was playing Degenki Bunko Fighting Climax Tomoka was in the game it was two years ago I came across it so now I finally finished ahd watched it now onto the review!WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSStory (5):first three episodes Subaru and the girls go through training everyday  but after a certain time he wanted to stop but thanks to his aunt he really couldn't cause she knew Subaru loves Basketball and there was someone on...the team that keeps him the most on there.. Later on the story kinda got better he was shown there are more people on the team then just Tomoka to think about.. Couple things that irritated and made the downfall for me that kept on repeating was.. 1): Just like in a mediocre harem (sadly it isn't classified or tagged as harem should be) the girl will get jealous mad and yada yada.. 2): Oh boy.. Just like number 1 but you have loli in a harem and you put fan service when they go in the tub at least they censored it many times but it got irritating.. Enough of that I'll get to it later.. The rest they really didn't put much effort into the anime for the rest of storyline after the boy vs girl match it felt eother rushed or not much was explained as in yes its a SPORTS ANIME but show how much you practice and the whole game not skip one frame to another..Art (6):Well its not bad I seen worse but its quite decent I wanted to pay attention to the faces a couple times to see if there were any derp faces xDSound (7):Loved the ending song then the opening though I skipped as well but listened fully through on two episodesCharacter (5):As I stated before it got handfully annoying when it started becoming a harem.. First off.. Subaru is dense and not dense he isn't aware of the situation and he is now let me move onto the harem.Aoi - She is a term of tsundere with jealousyMaho - AnnoyingHina- freaking adorableSaki - smart but yet doesnt know what to do sometimesAiri/Tomoka- they both improved quite a bit but they focused too much on Tomoka character at least Maho and Saki had a bit of development.Finally the enjoyment (5.5)There were a couple laughing points but now what I wanna mention from the beginning was the downfalls again.. So you censor it off and add bathtub scenes like 2-3 episode there are.. Quite understandable but you also have them thinking dirty minded and the lolis have a thing for Subaru?! We get it but this could've been a bit different best part of the show was when ( can't remember his name) young boy called Subaru out as a lolicon  Anyone else who said it wasn't funny... Then you have his aunt who pushed Subaru back into coaching /basketball but he felt like he wanted to for her yada yada but the plus side there always gotta be a loss so they remember it.. Now I think my rant is over I think you understand whoever reads this and understands how I feel about my little rant..Final..... !!!5!!! the team that keeps him the most on there..

This series, in my opinion, gets an instantly bad rep because of the cover of things, and you should never judge a book on it's cover. Sure it has grade schoolers in sexually suggestive situations, and yes it can be considered to be borderline softcore lolicon.But, in my very own opinion. There is a lot of character development for half of the characters. Be it minor or major, Hina, Tomoka and Airi do get better at basketball and/or improve relationships/friendships with the other players, the coach (Subaru), and even rivals.I share that while...trying not to give any spoilers. The other characters gain either hardly any or no development. But the main premise of this anime is a friend group coming together and having fun while playing basketball. And it delivers, some may enjoy the fan service aspect of the show, of which there is plenty. trying not to give any spoilers. The other characters gain either hardly any or no development.

Saint Seiya: Saishuu Seisen no Senshi-tachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1260/Saint_Seiya__Saishuu_Seisen_no_Senshi-tachi,"[""Esta review también está en español.This is the last movie from the classic age of Saint Seiya. Legend of Crimson Youth aside, this is the best, since it does everything the other two movies did, and add a little christian wackiness. Without further ado: Warriors of the Final Holy Battle.Story: The fallen angel, Lucifer (in bishonen form, like in Shin Megami Tensei) decides to attack the Santuary (in the Saint Seiya mythology, Lucifer fought against gods from various religions, including Athena, and lost), crushing the remaining Gold Saints, with the cliche objective of world destruction/domination. And he’s not alone: besides the typical minion saints (the...Fallen Angels: Seraph Beelzebub, Cherub Ashtaroth, Thrones Moa and Virtues Eligor), he's helped by Eris (from the first movie), Abel (third movie) and Poseidon (Poseidon saga). These three gods don't actually fight, but they are there. Athena tries to negotiate (cause that always work in the shonen world...) and fail miserably, so Seiya, Hyoga and Shun (Shiryu and Ikki will come, eventually) will fight once again to save the world and Athena (Hyoga is extra motivated, since he is catholic. Seiya even lampshade that).Animation: Like the TV series. This was made back in 89, so if you are used only to new stuff, you may think is old and primitive (or, in a more polite way, classic). If you started back in the 80/90, then is pretty good. Back then, it was f*cking awesome. In the character designs department, Lucifer was correctly represented as a young and beautiful angel (the catholic canon that everybody forgets, apparently), Beelzebub and Ashtaroth are pretty average, Moa is the effeminate token member, and Eligor... well, he's a weirdo. The weirdest saint ever (and that’s really hard, with Hades specters).Sound: The music is epic, as always. The voices... well, since you are reading the engrish version of this review, that means you aren't from Latin America or Spain. I assume that you are going to watch the japanese dub. It's pretty awesome, you may know the seiyūs from the Hades: Chapter Santuary (In Inferno and Elysion Toei change all the voices). Soooo, good voice acting.Verdict: this movie is a little weirder than the previous, since leaves the greek (series canon) and nordic (series filler) gods, and uses the morning star, Lucifer itself, and other christian elements. The fights are a bit more intense (with a lil more blood, something that was abundant in the Sanctuary saga, and lackluster in the Asgard and Poseidon sagas), but it suffers the problem the Eris and Dolbar movies had: way too short to do it better.The usual recommendation: if you liked Saint Seiya, you will like the movie (the third one is better, longer and more complex, but this one is pretty good too). Usually, something like this would be a six, but Lucifer and his crazy angels manages to pull a seven, by the simple fact of originality and the mess up concept.--------Esta es la última de las películas de la etapa clásica de Saint Seiya (después viene Overture, que desafortunadamente, apesta). Después de la leyenda de los santos escarlata, esta es la mejor, al menos por su pintoresco e insólito planteamiento. Sin mas preámbulos: Los Caballeros del Zodiaco contra Lucifer (Latinoamérica), o El guerrero de Armagedón (España).Historia: Lucifer (en su forma bishonen, que sería confirmada años más tarde por Shin Megami Tensei), el ángel caído (según la mitología de Saint Seiya, Lucifer lucho y fue vencido en el pasado por diversos dioses de varias religiones, entre ellos, obviamente, Athena) decide atacar el santuario, arrasando a los pocos santos de oro que quedaban, con el previsible objetivo de destruir a los humanos (recurriendo a diversas catástrofes naturales, como terremotos y tsunamis). En su cruzada no está solo: además de los típicos santos subordinados (los ángeles infernales, cada uno con un titulo angelical: Beelzebub de Serafín, Astaroth de Querubín, Eligor de Virtud y Moa de Trono), cuenta con la ayuda de Eris (Diosa de la Discordia, aparece en la primera película), Abel (Dios del Sol, aparece en la tercer película) y Poseidón (el Dios de los Océanos, aparece en la última saga del anime original), quienes no pelean, pero dan apoyo moral. Athena intenta negociar con Lucifer (como intento con cada villano), las negociaciones fracasan (como también paso con todos los villanos), por lo que Seiya, Shun y Hyoga (Shiryu e Ikki llegan un poco más tarde) deberán pelear nuevamente para salvar al mundo y a su diosa (Hyoga tiene una motivación adicional, dado que es católico).Animación: La misma de la serie. Tengamos en cuenta que esto fue en el 89, por lo que si uno está acostumbrado a lo actual, por supuesto que Saint Seiya puede parecer primitivo, o al menos, “clásica”. Para los que arrancamos en los 90, la animación es muy buena, correcta, y todo eso. Aclarado esto (que es lo mismo que puse en las anteriores películas), quería comentar el diseño de personajes. Lucifer fue representado realmente como un ángel joven y hermoso (o sea, el canon católico que según parece todos olvidan), Beelzebub y Astaroth son bastante promedio, Moa es el típico caballero afeminado que sigue los pasos de Misty y Afrodita... y Eligor... bueno, el es, sin ninguna duda, el caballero mas bizarro que apareció en Saint Seiya (y eso es difícil, teniendo en cuenta a los espectros).Sonido: La música, épica, como siempre. En cuanto a las voces, depende de la versión que viste: la versión española es correcta para los españoles, supongo. Pero el consenso americano general es que las voces de España apestan. Después, esta la versión remasterizada mexicana, en la que Jesús Barrero y compañía están presentes :D. O al menos, los caballeros de bronce, con la excepción de Shiryu (la vos de Shun puede sonar distinta, pero es el original... solo que con más años. Los más jóvenes tal vez lo reconozcan por su trabajo como Neji Hyuga). Los actores de doblaje hacen un trabajo notable, y la calidad de sonido es muy buena (COPIADO DE MI REVIEW DE LA PELICULA DE ERIS... lo mismo que con la animación, de una película a otra no varía).Veredicto: Esta película es un poco más rara que las otras, en el sentido que se sale de los dioses tradicionales (griegos en canon y nórdicos para el filler, con una breve incursión en el budismo gracias a Virgo) y aborda al lucero del alba, al mismísimo Lucifer, y otros detalles de la religión cristiana. Las peleas son un poco más intensas, y hasta hay un poco mas de sangre (cosa que para la saga de Poseidón se atenúo bastante...), pero sufre por su corta duración (al igual que las películas de Eris y Dolbar). Tristemente, esta película sufrió a manos de la censura: tanto el asalto inicial al santuario como la quema de una biblia fueron removidas. Por suerte, en la versión mexicana remasterizada, esto se arregla.La recomendación de siempre: si les gusta Saint Seiya, seguro que les gusta esta película (siendo la mejor la tercera, que es más larga y más compleja, pero esta es entretenida), y  no se olviden de buscar la versión nueva!

The Gold Saints\' deaths obviously shows how dangerous the enemies are, the previous Gods ties it...better into the continuity of the main series and previous films, but the most interesting point is drawing on Biblical lore which the series hadn\'t really delved into beyond a few references, terms and subtle parallels. Seeing the film go full-in with it and showcasing the difference between the Greek pantheon and Biblical figures is very fitting for a series that borrows equally from both and certainly isn\'t out of place when the anime gave implications towards Yahweh\'s existence and omnipotence as well as the series being very pantheistic in general.The way in which Athena is incapacitated here is also more interesting than most with her not only willingly putting herself up as a sacrifice, but her walking towards the point of sacrifice with some nice Biblical imagery puts a more solid visual ticking clock on her potential demise than any other one. It does avoid being close to as well done as those in the main series though when Athena believing the word of the being constantly said throughout the entire history of Christianity to be the father of lies and having that come back to bite her is ridiculous.Unfortunately beyond that, the film follows the typical plot structure of the other 3 I\'ve already mentioned in previous reviews, though the abilities of the Demonic Angels as well as Beelzebub\'s dialogue gives them far more going for them as characters than the previous films\' roadblocks masquerading as henchmen. The climax also has more over the top elements to make it less generic than that of the previous 3, although the part at the end of it being through the Bronze Saints\' resolve creating and miracle rather than an act of God ruins it as a battle against Satan himself is one in which a deus ex machina of the highest variety would actually be appropriate for rather than just ""something, something, resolve creates miracles.""Art-wise, there\'s nothing to say that hasn\'t been said in my previous reviews. It looks as gorgeous as the other films in art and animation, other than maybe a few shots of the side of Eligor\'s face looking a bit off with the shading.Overall, the last of the original Saint Seiya films still has a lot of problems with its script and screenplay, but overall has enough interest generated by its premise as well as its unique elements allow it to be marginally better than the previous film, despite suffering the same flaws. Could\'ve been a great story in the hands of a more competent writer and with a longer running time as either its own story or a coda to the premature ending of the anime with the Poseidon Arc until we were allowed a Hades Arc adaption in the 00s, but instead it ends up as pretty looking bad filler. better into the continuity of the main series and previous films, but the most interesting point is drawing on Biblical lore which the series hadn\'t really delved into beyond a few references, terms and subtle parallels.

This movie is about Lucifer being reincarnated thanks to the lives of Eris, Abel and Poseidon. It is worth mentioning that this movie has many biblical references and they actually name the bible. Is very interesting because never until 1988 had we followed a story that dealt with important events in the Bible in such detail. One of the references that most caught my attention was when Athena crossed the stairs full of thorns and it drained her blood, much like when they put the crown...of thorns on Jesus, which was embedded so strongly that the blood dripped, just as it happens to Athena.It's kind of ironic that in every movie so far, normally the gold saints are always indisposed and unable to help the bronze saints.I also noticed that when Hyoga the Cygnus saint someone is going to attack him and gets into his mind there will always be 3 things. His mother, Master Cristal or Master Camus. Whenever it is something mental they try to end it with one of these 3 people.This is one of the most interesting movies Saint Seiya has ever had.I make a record that this Review is based on the fact that I am watching this anime in order of release.*********************************************************************1/1 Película VistaEsta es la continuación directa después del anime de 114 capítulos y de las 3 películas anteriores.

He gets turned down by every place of buisiness he goes to, until he meets a young girl named Kosuzu.  She tells him that she works at a toy company, and if he tries on this power suit she'll pay him money.  He thinks this is all just a game, and since she's offering money he needs, he doesn't refuse.  Suddenly an old man in a robot appears and starts to destroy the city.  The little girl tells Suzuo to put on the...suit, and when he does this, he becomes the intergalactic superhero, Dokkoida.  What's strange is that the heroes and the villains both work for the same company.  And they end up living together in the same house.If you couldn't tell, this series is a satire of comic book super heroes.  You meet a lot of different heroes and villains in this series. This anime is mostly 12 episodes of complete hillarity and craziness.The artstyle is very cartoony, which fits the series well considering it's about superheroes.  The colors are very bright and bouncy which fits the mood of the series.The opening is a very fun and bouncy song.  I listened to it over and over again after watching this series.  The voice acting is great as well.  There are many great Vancouver voice actors in this series.  Such as, Brad Swaile, Paul Dobson, Ted Cole, and Nicole Bouma.  The quality of the sound was great as well, I could hear things clearly and understood everything that was said.The characters in this series are great too.  Even though this is a short series they get enough developement for you to care about them and enjoy your time with them.I enjoyed this series a lot.  There's good comedy, and despite some of it being sexual, it's still smart.  The characters are fun.  The songs are bouncy.  And the voice acting is spot-on.  I highly recommend Dokkoida?! to anyone looking for a fun comedy series. suit, and when he does this, he becomes the intergalactic superhero, Dokkoida.

It is actually much, much better.Let's start it off with the Story. The story in and of itself is really clever to the point in which the simplicity actually helps the story get much more interesting. You have 2 superheroes and 3 villains all living in the same house, but with absolutely no idea that any of them...are the superheroes or villains they fight on a daily basis, despite some of the interactions between them being absurdly obvious. It was this clever way of telling the story - and backstory - of each character that was so well done for a 2003 anime that I started recommending this anime to everyone. But that's a different topic altogether.Art and Sound - The art style is great for the time it was made in, just wacky enough that it could've been mistaken for a comic book show, based on what it was going for. The music and voice acting, both in the english dub and the original voice over, flow exceedingly well with each other, and the chemistry between actors makes this show more or less worth it.Characters - The development, the personalities, everything about these characters are pretty much on point. You have so many different personalities clashing with each other daily, and showing in other scenes about how they're all friends really sends a point home, that it doesn't matter what your friends are like on the outside, the point is that they're your friends. In this case, they're your friends until they put on their outfits and you fight each other multiple times over because that's the premise of the story.Now, I know there are flaws in most animes, but I honestly think this is the one that's just pretty hard to see flaws in. Overall, Dokkoida!? takes the point of the show and does exactly that, and does it exceedingly well. The humor is always just as good as can be delivered, and the scripting overall is guaranteed to make you laugh at least once per episode. It's a modest anime that doesn't give you more than you bargained for, just the exact amount of what you would, and that's what makes it one of the most under-appreciated animes I've ever seen. A real golden gem underneath all the fake diamonds. are the superheroes or villains they fight on a daily basis, despite some of the interactions between them being absurdly obvious.

This is my review about this… um… show… um… give me a second here…It’s just… how do I put this nicely? It was better for younger kids, not that it’s bad. There are really good parts too but its just rather childish. It’s a collaboration of a bunch of different super heroes and super villains all rolled into one and makes fun...of every single one of them. I guess a good place to start would be the characters. Suzuo is stupid little boy who gets in way over his head just because of the need for a job. I’m glad in his power suit looks like it has a diaper because he seems to really need it. Almost all the time, he seems to freak out every time they fight. Kosuzu is just a whiny little navi character. I say navi character because all she does is whine and talk to him without doing any fighting.I hate episode 8 all for the fact they bring Sister Princess into it. They change the name but yet all the designs aren’t even changed!Now the whole idea feels like a sitcom where villains and heroes live under the same roof and even though they at first think that they know each other, try to pretend that they don’t. And how does the villains have a A grade? I wouldn’t even call them F grade! They are just really bad villains.The artwork is so so, the characters don’t normally keep their shape. I guess its normal for a comedy show like this but it just feels odd. It’s much like Sgt Frog in how out of control it can be. Why does Suzuo have little pink cheeks when no one else has them? It feels out of place. Oh… and don’t worry, there are magical girl transformations that don’t take 5 minutes. The opening sadly makes it feel more like its supposed to be serious then funny. It doesn’t work right.The English voices are alright and fit to the comedy of the show rather well. Unfortunately, it was a wall of dialogue that never went any where. They speak a little to fast and just make it hard to understand. of every single one of them. I guess a good place to start would be the characters.

Sora no Method,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23209/Sora_no_Method,"['(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When a person first starts out in the world, the only connections he or she makes are between the immediate family. The mom feeds, the dad protects, and the siblings watch over the new addition to the house. But at a certain point, new bonds must be made, not within the household but within society itself. These new, usually different people that are met more often than not become ""friends."" A friend is a confidant, a buddy, a guy or girl with which things are less serious and more fun. Sadly, even if such friends are found, they...can just as easily be lost. In Sora no Method, the idea of friendship is tested, and by the end, it becomes nothing more than a stranger.STORYMethod begins with Nonoka, a middle schooler who is moving back to her childhood hometown after being away for some time. Upon arriving, a happy little girl named Noel appears to have been waiting for her for years, in the hopes that they can hang out once more.Something went terribly wrong as Method was being produced. Imagine a river, flowing endlessly and consistently. Eventually, it reaches the open ocean after much trekking and hardship. This is how drama is usually handled; stuff happens, drama ensues, build-up, and resolution. Now, imagine if every mile or so, a dam was built, providing less and less water the further along it went. And in the end, instead of reaching the ocean, it was funneled haphazardly toward a ravine to forever become lost. That is how the drama of Method is handled.Analogies aside, Method tackles its drama in a ""stop-and-go"" fashion. A problem is usually found from among the group, Nonoka tries to address it, and eventually solves the controversy. But it\'s always give and take. Where one set of issues is taken care of, a whole new set arises. It never feels as if any of the drama or any of the resolution amounts to anything significant. Characters employ physical abuse, miscommunication, avoidance, and literal refusal to unnecessarily ramp up the drama. What results is a plethora of melodramatic scenarios in which it is never quite clear if anything is ever truly being resolved. In fact, on multiple occasions, seemingly finished plot points are reinstated. The exact same drama unfolds as it had before, making the audience quite aware of the awkward repetition.In order to exacerbate the problems further, Method leaves many rather important questions left unanswered. Despite it being small in terms of a contextual universe, there are particular events that either receive no explanation or, for what is given, it isn\'t enough to justify what happens. Characters being able to find one another on a whim, how the saucer works, and how certain characters are able to remember certain events can be guessed at, but it\'s not so much clever interpretation as it is misplaced confusion.Even the overall theme receives a blow. Throughout the entire show, it runs with the idea of what being a friend and having them really means. A friend doesn\'t always have to be around; while they may go separate ways, two friends are usually so for life. Stuff can appear along the way that tests the waters, but good friends, no matter what may have happened in the past, remain so. That is to say, it\'s not the memories that matter but rather the relationship that does...or that is what we are lead to believe. The final two episodes reverse the message Method was formulating and sending. It instead latches onto the opposite venue; the memories are more important than the actual bond that is shared. The apparent shift in focus comes about due to another melodramatic moment and only serves to solidify how misguided the anime truly is.ANIMATIONThe only feature of Method that is praiseworthy is in its art and animation.The art is rather gorgeous. The backdrops are varied and filled with great lighting effects and detail. Colors are fresh and vibrant, giving the show a rather appealing look no matter where the situations are taking place. The locations vary nicely as well, with scenic beaches and gloomy lighthouses. It\'s always a feast for the eyes.The character designs are not as impressive as the art itself, but they do their job. The main cast is simple in appearance, with normal haircuts and normal outfits, usually resorting to their school uniform. Only Noel is given any uniqueness, with her light-blue hair, black and white attire, and child-like stature.The actual animation follows the art. The characters move quite fluidly at all times, whether alone or with multiple others on screen. Animation also exists for background and foreground objects, making the world look that much more alive.CHARACTERSWhere the art excels, the characters plummet. Method\'s cast range from inconsequential to infuriating, and not even Noel\'s infinite cuteness can save them.One of the worst ""main"" characters I have ever seen lies with Koharu. While kind, she acts as a literal fifth-wheel to the brother and sister combo and the other two best friends. Outside of working at the local tourist shop or being nice to the other four, she serves no purpose. Without any amount of character development or usefulness besides being the last ""friend"" needed to summon the saucer, any other person could replace her.As the only male friend, Souta stands out slightly. A bit more rational, he has a need to escape his current life and try something new. He cares a lot for his sister and the people around him, despite his often mellow attitude. He works hard, no matter the subject, but is rather easy to tease. In the beginning, he appears to look out only for himself, not wanting to deal with any of the drama taking place around him. However, he learns through Noel that sometimes the best things in life are right next to you all along. Sadly, after the halfway point in the show, he loses what little relevancy he had, becoming almost as much of a side character as Koharu did.Yuzuki is an energetic young girl. When she sets her mind on a goal, she strives to accomplish it with as much gusto as she can muster. Overreacting, protesting, and simply having fun is what she is known for. Being the first real obstacle that Nonoka must overcome, Yuzuki almost always runs away from her problems. Her refusal to deal with anyone or at least listen to what others have to say makes her out to be quite difficult to deal with, and even more so to watch. She exemplifies the notion that a friend sometimes needs more than just words to get through.Arguably the most ridiculous cast member, Shione has her name shouted more times than one cares to hear. With a stoic appearance and a simple beauty about her, she remains entirely standoffish for nearly the whole season. Her signature headphones give her a literal and personified way to drown out the ""noise"" around her. She avoids the other members, especially Nonoka, as much as possible, causing an inability in any of the friends to rectify the situation with her. Shione\'s wishy-washy behavior manifests near the end, and her development causes her to completely contrast with who she was all along. And not just by a small amount; so much so that she becomes almost too sympathetic.Taking the lead, Nonoka is the childhood friend who is seen as ruining everything. Determined and kind, her mother taught her to always smile to spread happiness where needed. She hates seeing the people she held dear succumb to sadness, so she takes it mostly upon herself to fix the ties that were made between the four of them seven years ago. Even as the star, she never improves much as a character, with her feelings being known and shown at all points without much difference. She starts off being caring and thoughtful towards her friends, and she ends the exact same way.The only memorable cast member is potentially Noel. Innocent and cute beyond measure, she constantly seeks to be with the five kids who called her. Rather carefree, she simply wants nothing more than to see Nonoka and the gang happy. Impossible not to like, mysterious to a degree, and always there at the right place at the right time, Noel is ""a diamond in the rough."" Sadly, her character is treated rather lazily, making the impact of her inclusion within the story diminished due to the ending of the tale and her rushed transition from pure cuteness to emotionally aware.What\'s interesting is, with the exception of Noel, the more difficult the person was for Nonoka to befriend, the more development that character received. While this makes sense logically, it causes the problem shown here with the characters: some of the friends do close to nothing useful in regards to the narrative. Koharu and Souta receive little attention because they\'re stable, whereas Yuzuki and Shione are compromised. This doesn\'t work, because half the cast becomes unimportant. Yuzuki\'s and Shione\'s evolution as characters could have meant something, but the overextended drama relative to the events taking place outlined them as being quite irrational. What are left are both underdeveloped and unlikable characters.SOUNDThe OP\'s beginning piano and singing start it off on the right note. When the generic beat kicks in, the rest of the song falls flat, except for the final lyrics giving it a rather touching feeling.The ED is slightly better. Again, it starts off with instruments only, and is quite pleasant to hear. Following the beginning, the vocalist works well with the violin and trailing effects. While the beat usually leaves much to be desired, the singer does her best to make the song out to be better than what it is.The soundtrack is actually quite good. The little humming tune, the tapping-and-vocal arrangement during uneasy scenes, and the harp-with-tingling-chimes piece for the more melancholic ones are performed well. They add more to the show than the story and characters are able to produce.Voice-acting sees mostly average performances for the cast. A special shout-out goes to Inori Minase as Noel.ENJOYMENTOne of the reasons why I picked this up from the beginning was partly due to it being an original and being a new studio\'s first work. It\'s unfortunate that the end product isn\'t as good as it could have been. The story and characters seem to be pieces to a puzzle. Yet, watching Nonoka get slapped (more than once, too) was less dramatic and more hilarious. Seeing Yuzuki run away every chance she got was annoying, not endearing. Watching Shione be good friends with Noel and nobody else was continuously perplexing. There are just too many moments jumbled next to one another to call the puzzle correctly put together.The only aspect making the anime tolerable was Noel. Her cute faces, constant smiling, and precious way of speaking provided some laughs and grins along the way. She in no way is capable of keeping the entire show afloat, but if she were not present at all, there would be absolutely nothing worthy coming from this one.As a new venture, Sora no Method was a gamble that failed miserably. The story and characters are nonsensical without a doubt. While the music and art are refined, there just isn\'t enough present to call this one anything but forgettable.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, melodramatic, unneeded confusion, clashing themesAnimation: Good, nice art, okay character designs, good animationCharacters: Terrible, a mix of underdeveloped and unlikableSound: Fine, bad OP, okay ED, good soundtrack, okay VA workEnjoyment: Bad, Noel is the only reason to watchFinal Score: 3/10 can just as easily be lost.

Outside of working at the local tourist shop or being nice to the other four, she serves no purpose. Without any amount of character development or usefulness besides being the last ""friend"" needed to summon the saucer, any other person could replace her.As the only male friend, Souta stands out slightly. A bit more rational, he has a need to escape his current life and try something new. He cares a lot for his sister and the people around him, despite his often mellow attitude. He works hard, no matter the subject, but is rather easy to tease. In the beginning, he appears to look out only for himself, not wanting to deal with any of the drama taking place around him. However, he learns through Noel that sometimes the best things in life are right next to you all along. Sadly, after the halfway point in the show, he loses what little relevancy he had, becoming almost as much of a side character as Koharu did.Yuzuki is an energetic young girl. When she sets her mind on a goal, she strives to accomplish it with as much gusto as she can muster. Overreacting, protesting, and simply having fun is what she is known for. Being the first real obstacle that Nonoka must overcome, Yuzuki almost always runs away from her problems. Her refusal to deal with anyone or at least listen to what others have to say makes her out to be quite difficult to deal with, and even more so to watch. She exemplifies the notion that a friend sometimes needs more than just words to get through.Arguably the most ridiculous cast member, Shione has her name shouted more times than one cares to hear. With a stoic appearance and a simple beauty about her, she remains entirely standoffish for nearly the whole season. Her signature headphones give her a literal and personified way to drown out the ""noise"" around her. She avoids the other members, especially Nonoka, as much as possible, causing an inability in any of the friends to rectify the situation with her. Shione\'s wishy-washy behavior manifests near the end, and her development causes her to completely contrast with who she was all along. And not just by a small amount; so much so that she becomes almost too sympathetic.Taking the lead, Nonoka is the childhood friend who is seen as ruining everything. Determined and kind, her mother taught her to always smile to spread happiness where needed. She hates seeing the people she held dear succumb to sadness, so she takes it mostly upon herself to fix the ties that were made between the four of them seven years ago. Even as the star, she never improves much as a character, with her feelings being known and shown at all points without much difference. She starts off being caring and thoughtful towards her friends, and she ends the exact same way.The only memorable cast member is potentially Noel. Innocent and cute beyond measure, she constantly seeks to be with the five kids who called her. Rather carefree, she simply wants nothing more than to see Nonoka and the gang happy. Impossible not to like, mysterious to a degree, and always there at the right place at the right time, Noel is ""a diamond in the rough."" Sadly, her character is treated rather lazily, making the impact of her inclusion within the story diminished due to the ending of the tale and her rushed transition from pure cuteness to emotionally aware.What\'s interesting is, with the exception of Noel, the more difficult the person was for Nonoka to befriend, the more development that character received. While this makes sense logically, it causes the problem shown here with the characters: some of the friends do close to nothing useful in regards to the narrative. Koharu and Souta receive little attention because they\'re stable, whereas Yuzuki and Shione are compromised. This doesn\'t work, because half the cast becomes unimportant. Yuzuki\'s and Shione\'s evolution as characters could have meant something, but the overextended drama relative to the events taking place outlined them as being quite irrational. What are left are both underdeveloped and unlikable characters.SOUNDThe OP\'s beginning piano and singing start it off on the right note. When the generic beat kicks in, the rest of the song falls flat, except for the final lyrics giving it a rather touching feeling.The ED is slightly better. Again, it starts off with instruments only, and is quite pleasant to hear. Following the beginning, the vocalist works well with the violin and trailing effects. While the beat usually leaves much to be desired, the singer does her best to make the song out to be better than what it is.The soundtrack is actually quite good. The little humming tune, the tapping-and-vocal arrangement during uneasy scenes, and the harp-with-tingling-chimes piece for the more melancholic ones are performed well. They add more to the show than the story and characters are able to produce.Voice-acting sees mostly average performances for the cast. A special shout-out goes to Inori Minase as Noel.ENJOYMENTOne of the reasons why I picked this up from the beginning was partly due to it being an original and being a new studio\'s first work. It\'s unfortunate that the end product isn\'t as good as it could have been. The story and characters seem to be pieces to a puzzle. Yet, watching Nonoka get slapped (more than once, too) was less dramatic and more hilarious. Seeing Yuzuki run away every chance she got was annoying, not endearing. Watching Shione be good friends with Noel and nobody else was continuously perplexing. There are just too many moments jumbled next to one another to call the puzzle correctly put together.The only aspect making the anime tolerable was Noel. Her cute faces, constant smiling, and precious way of speaking provided some laughs and grins along the way. She in no way is capable of keeping the entire show afloat, but if she were not present at all, there would be absolutely nothing worthy coming from this one.As a new venture, Sora no Method was a gamble that failed miserably. The story and characters are nonsensical without a doubt. While the music and art are refined, there just isn\'t enough present to call this one anything but forgettable.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, melodramatic, unneeded confusion, clashing themesAnimation: Good, nice art, okay character designs, good animationCharacters: Terrible, a mix of underdeveloped and unlikableSound: Fine, bad OP, okay ED, good soundtrack, okay VA workEnjoyment: Bad, Noel is the only reason to watchFinal Score: 3/10', ""When a giant saucer appears in the sky above a small town, what sort of events would you expect to follow?Sora no Method poses this question, and then follows with the most mundane answer it could have gone with: a slice of life drama that spends about five minutes of the whole series actually talking about the saucer, despite it being the source of many troubles the characters face. The fact that someone thought it would be a good idea to through in such a large supernatural element and then treat it like it was nothing worth acknowledge subsequently succeeded in creating a very...frustrating chain of events.From the same anime industry that brought you enormous headed children with trouble making friends (looking at you, Haganai), this season, this same industry introduced more enormous headed children with trouble making friends.The story does begin in a grabbing way; our main protagonist, Nonoka, is on her way to her new home with her father. This is obviously a basic scenario, but once Nonoka's car passes through a tunnel and into her new life, attention is drawn to the great glaring object in the sky.And it all goes down hill from there.After throwing the saucer into the plot, rather than choosing a story line to make Sora no Method unique from other anime, the main focus of the show becomes how badly Nonoka wants to make friends. She doesn't seem to give much of a damn about this thing that's hanging over the town constantly, but she will relentlessly bother another girl until she engages in conversation.Most of the episodes out of the thirteen are back and forth nonsense consisting of 'will they be friends or won't they', only briefly mentioning the anime's unique, floating characteristic when its convenient to make the 'will they, won't they' business continues with petty argument.It's terrible to admit, but most of the episodes in Sora no Method could probably be skipped over, as it's mostly the same mundanity--Nonoka goes somewhere, tries to make friends with someone, it doesn't work until she applies willpower, it suddenly works, on to the next potential friend.Nonoka may also be a problem here, as I've noticed one of the downfalls of many anime for me is an irritating main character, and to me, Nonoka is incredible irritating. It isn't her voice or her appearance, but the fact that she blindly assumes she can change everyone's opinion of her if she bothers them enough times. In fact, Nonoka pushes for all the other characters to change and accept her, when she does nothing to change herself. Nonoka experiences no character development and remains presently the likable moe factor, remaining the same desperate from episode one to episode thirteen.There are times where she would even blatantly prevent other characters from interacting with the saucer, which was perhaps the most frustrating part of her personality--physically watching her prevent any developments outside of her personal relationships nearly warranted a drop of the series halfway through.If the main goal of Nonoka was to make her cute and charismatic, that base was already covered by part of her supporting cast, Noel, who exhibited a much rounder version of whatever Nonoka was trying to supply. I believe other characters like Noel were made more likable because they weren't trying too hard or forcing their personality onto one another. Where the protagonist failed, the supporting cast strongly marched onward in the shadows.Being an anime new this year, as expected, the art and sound were cleanly done, and most of Sora no Method's soundtrack was very relaxing. Toward the very end of the series, there was a strange change in art style that startled me, but it may have worked to leave somewhat of an impact. That is to say, it was startling, but it wasn't bad. I especially liked the color palettes used.In the end, I suppose Sora no Method is a simple case of a plot in the hands of the wrong genre, where there are many exciting and innovative paths to choose in response to the saucer, but none of them were taken. As a drama in its own genre, the show was still a bit indecisive and wishy washy, though with so many other anime out there it isn't right to set expectations to high.As a final warning, I believe the personality of the main character takes high tolerance to watch, and if tolerated, she is compensated for by the characters that surround her. Why the title focuses on the sky is something of a mystery, because no one else seems concerned with it at all. That aspect may take high tolerance as well. frustrating chain of events.From the same anime industry that brought you enormous headed children with trouble making friends (looking at you, Haganai), this season, this same industry introduced more enormous headed children with trouble making friends.The story does begin in a grabbing way; our main protagonist, Nonoka, is on her way to her new home with her father.

These are just a few words I would use to describe Sora no Method. These days, original anime are a bit more scarce than they were about 6 or 7 years ago so hearing about the release of this, and by a new studio, excitement and anticipation welled up within me. These feelings were quickly dashed within the first few episodes.Story 6/10The story itself, albeit nothing particularly ground breaking, appears solid and, on the surface of things, rather interesting. In short, a girl named Nonoka returns to her home town from Tokyo. Upon arriving, she discovers that a huge saucer has been...present over the town ever since she left. The story progresses with her regaining lost memories, concerning her old friends, with the help of this shows poster girl, Noel. As things further progress, she soon realises that not all will be as happy compared to her first time in the town and thus she starts to walk down the path of pain and anguish. Now at first, this seems interesting and I must admit, I was thoroughly intrigued by the saucer itself but my intrigue was quickly cut down. Why you ask? Simply because the story wasn't as promising as it was set out to be. Yes, there were certain parts to the anime that weren't terrible and provided a good watch but the overall story itself quickly became predictable and boring. Watching it almost became a challenge. Not only did it become predictable, it also became quite annoying in stages. Without spoiling anything, certain plotlines just seemed out-right pointless and, in the grand scheme of things, not really an issue in the first place. These 'issues' were then solved quite easily which again proves my point. This is the classic case of drama being created for the sake of it. What didn't help the series was its array of uninspiring characters, which segways me into my main issue with the series, the characters.4/10Never have I seen a bunch of uninspiring set of characters in my life. What I want to clarify is that they aren't horrendous in any specific way, apart from Shione, they are just boring to watch. None of them make you feel anything. You don't sympathise with them, you don't feel angry for them. There wasn't one part of the anime that made me feel anything towards the characters. Even when the anime hinted at big story lines concerning character relationships, such as the one about Yuzuki and Souta. You got yourself geared up for a big reveal only to be left disappointed. Poor character writing surrounded this anime. As mentioned earlier, there is also a typical 'poster girl' in this anime called noel. She has all the traits that make certain people fall head over heels for her type such as the childish and friendly nature, the 'unique' look and so on but does this make the character memorable and lovable? Not really to be honest. All the ingredients were present to make a memorable character that whenever you think back to the series, you immediately think back to her and smile but like all characters within the series, she was like a hollow shell. I wish I could elaborate further on why, but I simply can't. The whole situation just baffles me as the ingredients were there, but they weren't used properly.Art & sound 7/10I give credit where credit is due. Considering this was the studio's first attempt at an anime, the art was pretty darn good. The backdrops looked beautiful and the saucer itself looked stunning. The music though was where they truly hit the right notes. Both opening and ending fit the atmosphere the creators were trying to create. On top of that, they were both memorable and stayed in my head for a number of weeks after the series finished airing. The ost was pretty good aswell, both concerning the sound and timing. I must say, I was rather impressed with these two aspects.Overall, this anime was a disappointment. It wasn't terrible, like some series out there, but, for me, it is far from being considered a 'good anime'. Maybe it was because of my anticipation for the series that led me to expressing fairly harsh views but one can only speculate. Some may think though that the score 6 isn't actually too bad, but considering the way I personally score anime, this is quite low. Maybe if one goes into this not expecting much and with a very open mind, this might actually be considered a good watch. Who knows. present over the town ever since she left.

Who knows."", ""Short Version of this review:This anime is over-looked and pretty underrated but in a good way. Not in the fact that its shit but in the fact that it wasn't really known when airing. This show is worth a watch and heartwarming. The only strong factor may be its story with its simplicity and way of storytelling. The art and animation are good for the most part while the characters lack in potential.The Review:The slice of life genre is like an escape goat from all the thrillers and actions out there, its like a fresh breath of air from the blood and maturity and...shows and is more of a relaxing way to watch. You could make something good out of the genre or fail terribly. Sora no Method is somewhere in about the middle. It has some good points but lack them.The story is well written for the most part and original-ish with a few new ideas to the SOL genre. So recently a girl is returning to her old town, she meets up with new friends and then finds a mysterious little girl who then relates to the MCs past. The first episode is well done in showing us the setting and what to expect in this show. When an anime starts with its first episode, it should introduce you to what to expect, Sora no Method does it perfectly. Later on the story can drag on and some of the characters can be somewhat annoying and this factor cause them to somehow drag the story on. If the parts that drag on and the annoyingness of the characters are removed, this show could easily fit 10-11 episodes. Hell, looking at its setting its fit of the 11 or 22 episodes that a show would get for its interesting setting. The story is good but can really drag on.The characters are pretty average and really don't need much detail. Nonoka, the MC, is just sloppy, she starts off well but later on seems more like a nuisance to the story, she has some good moments but the way she handles her friends is dumbwitted, you know how if you want to cheer up a friend and end up making them feel worser? Thats Nonoka but times 100 and you have one annoying ass MC. Souta is pretty ok, some of his developement scenes are pretty good and hell, he should be the MC, he knows how to cheer people up, he has his own harem (literally) so why not make him the MC? Noel, the saucer girl who is so goddamned cute, is a good one, her character developements are good and tear-worthy, overall she's a good character. Yuzuki is a average tsundre, Togawa is an annoying ass tsundre and Koharu is pretty much Friend A.The animation is pretty nice, the backgrounds are well designed and the character designs, like how hard where the studio making this trying to get people to watch this, the characters are at least 13-14 yet they look like they're 10-11, they look like f-ing lolis, like what the fuck? The CGI is meh for the most part and normal animation is much better than it. The music is nice, both OPs and EDs are kind of catchy and enjoyable to the ears. The background music really fits some of the scenes in this including the character developements, its used well. The voice acting is pretty ok.Now sometimes, this show can get a little boring. Some parts just drag on and you wonder when the hell is a certain scene gonna end. Now Yuzuki and Togawa are the main sector of the annoying characters. Yuzuki is easily offended and it should feel sad but feels more like a reason to let the show reach its 13 episode mark, she dosen't go back to normal till way later on, like I understood the situation but it dragged on. You know that annoying ass tsundre in a show that you hate but at least have some heart to them. Togawa is a flat out tsundre who I hated from beggining to end, she's a bitch (literally) and is there just to let the main cast ahave problems, if Togawa isn't in this hsow, this show would probably get a much better rating than it does now.Story: 6.7Art & Sound: 7Characters: 5Enjoyment: 4.5Sora no Method is more of a show to let time pass, if you don't have shit to watch or want something thats relaxing, watch Sora no Method.

Sora no Method gets a 6/10."", 'Sora no Method leaves an intensely illuminating image in the mind, reflective of the deep and abiding memories of its lead character, Nonoka. Sora no Method\'s visual splendor is like the prettiest fireworks in the sky, lighting up faces and hearts for both its characters and the show\'s viewers. This is one anime show that is both beautiful to behold, as well as beautiful in its emotionally resonant treatment of friendship, hope, family, and struggle against the corrosive effect that the passage of time can have on all three.However, as strong as Sora no Method\'s heart and artistry is, its story can tease and...bewilder at times, even though it is not particularly complicated. I would recommend this anime to anyone who is a fan of Key-related anime works, as well as to fans of the AnoHana anime, but I do want to prepare you for some of the show\'s weaknesses.The story often has an air of magically mesmerizing mystery about it. At its best, it can prove enchanting and engrossing. But at its worst, it can leave you raising eyebrows over the actions and choices of its characters.I found the characters to be very likeable, and well-actualized, but there are at times a questionable inconsistency to them. Their choices and emotional attachments sometimes fail to come across well, and it\'s often only later and in retrospect that they start to make more sense. So this is an anime that demands a certain type of patience. Not in a basic pacing sense, as I didn\'t find the plot overly fast or slow, but rather when it comes to how you approach the characters.The characters develop gradually, meticulously, and sometimes in a ""2 steps forward, 1 step back"" sort of way. At times, they can be exasperating, and this can undermine the effectiveness and sense of flow to the story.Nonetheless, the central characters all have a strong sense of agency to them, and it is easy to get caught up in their wondrously whimsical wavering and movement. Noel is of consistent chipper cheer, leaving her name a very fitting one given the well-known holiday that also bears that name. And so she serves as an anchor that keeps the Sora no Method ship sailing straight through the torrential storms of the other character\'s emotional typhoons and crashing waves.The high-spirited yet also high-strung Yuzuki often amuses, and the relationship between her and her brother is one of the more realistic sibling relationships I\'ve seen in anime in recent years.Shione provides an edge and sharpness to the show that helps provide a good balance to its syrupy saccharine sentimental aims. She can exasperate or even infuriate in her worst moments, but those moments are probably essential in giving the otherwise straightforward story the momentum it needs.Koharu is the pleasant poised peacemaker, who\'s generally gentle touch is supported well by a touch of iron within. She has her moments of weakness, to be sure, but her softness speaks soundly of a good and reliable friend.Then there is Nonoka, who\'s dauntless determination infuses the show with a swiftly sprinting synergy of powerful and vibrant character relationship dynamics. Nonoka is a well-balanced lead character that I found very easy to like and cheer on.And it is because of exquisite emotional engagement, that I feel comfortable in giving this show a very good rating in spite of its narrative weaknesses. If you\'re looking for a thrilling or thought-provoking show, then this might not be the best show for you. But if you\'re looking for something strongly spirited, an aspirational adventure that slowly grows under the glimmering lights of a saucer above, then this is one show that I think you will heartily enjoy. bewilder at times, even though it is not particularly complicated.

Noel is of consistent chipper cheer, leaving her name a very fitting one given the well-known holiday that also bears that name. And so she serves as an anchor that keeps the Sora no Method ship sailing straight through the torrential storms of the other character\'s emotional typhoons and crashing waves.The high-spirited yet also high-strung Yuzuki often amuses, and the relationship between her and her brother is one of the more realistic sibling relationships I\'ve seen in anime in recent years.Shione provides an edge and sharpness to the show that helps provide a good balance to its syrupy saccharine sentimental aims. She can exasperate or even infuriate in her worst moments, but those moments are probably essential in giving the otherwise straightforward story the momentum it needs.Koharu is the pleasant poised peacemaker, who\'s generally gentle touch is supported well by a touch of iron within. She has her moments of weakness, to be sure, but her softness speaks soundly of a good and reliable friend.Then there is Nonoka, who\'s dauntless determination infuses the show with a swiftly sprinting synergy of powerful and vibrant character relationship dynamics. Nonoka is a well-balanced lead character that I found very easy to like and cheer on.And it is because of exquisite emotional engagement, that I feel comfortable in giving this show a very good rating in spite of its narrative weaknesses. If you\'re looking for a thrilling or thought-provoking show, then this might not be the best show for you. But if you\'re looking for something strongly spirited, an aspirational adventure that slowly grows under the glimmering lights of a saucer above, then this is one show that I think you will heartily enjoy.', 'This show is probably one of the most underrated show of the Fall 2014 season. It is a shame that this show is going to be lost with the others of its genre. This show falls victim to the ""don\'t judge a book by it\'s cover"" scenario where at first glance, it seems like a typical moe-blob show with hints of melodrama, but it grows into something much more than that and tries it\'s best to differentiate itself from the rest of the shows this season. Sure it is no Fate/ Stay Night UBW or Parasyte, and it isn\'t even close to being compared to...classics like Kanon or Anohana, but with the right mindset, this show can easily stand its own ground.The main problem I keep hearing about this show is that it\'s ""too melodramatic."" Lets be honest, without a little drama and character conflict, this show will still get ripped on either way. The story itself starts off with a very solid premise with some shaky execution problems along the road. It should be noted that this show is really character driven, and if you hate one of the characters, the story might drag for you. Our MC Nonoka just moved into her childhood town where she reunites with some of her childhood friends. However, it might not be as easy as it seems as her friends drifted apart due to the presence of a saucer hovering over the cit, a saucer summoned by them when they were little 7 years ago. From there, Nonoka meets with Noel, a girl of unknown origin, and with her tries to reunite with her friends as they were before the saucer came in. The story itself isn\'t perfect, and it can be quite predictable at times. There are even some questionable moments such as ""why isn\'t the government doing anything about the saucer"" or ""is a certain character\'s reason for hatred towards the saucer justifiable?"" If we stand back and look at the story for what it is, a coming of age story about old friendships and new relationships, the story is quite bearable and delightful to watch.Another plus of the series is sound and art/animation department. The art style is really, how should I say, bright, cheery, and beautiful. The animation, for the most part, is pretty solid, it gets the job done. The soundtrack is quite well done. All the pieces compliments the scenes it was played too, setting the mood right, whether it is really sad, or really hopeful. The OP and ED songs are relatively good compared to shows of this genre. The OP is good but whether you want to download it ""legally"" is up to you. The ED on the other hand is agreeably great and definitely worth listening to outside the show.If there are any flaws in Sora No Method, and there are quite a few, it\'s the character department. Although some Characters. such as Shione, Nonoka, and Yuziki, had some decent character development and back story, some really didn\'t get any, like Nonoka\'s dad or Souta. If there is one character worth mentioning, its the shows mascot, Noel. Noel, in a nutshell, is ""THE MOST ADORABLE CHARACTER THIS SEASON!!!!"" Jokes aside, Noel played her part well. By that, I mean being the adorable girl everyone wants to hug and be around. Although her role in the story is somewhat disappointing as the main plot device revolves around her and the show hardly focuses on her and focuses more in Nonoka and her struggle to conform with her friends. Speaking of friends, some of her friends motivations for disbanding and conflict are somewhat shallow and could have explained upon more or at least portrayed better. There are seriously moments where you just want to facepalm and slap a certain character. Although it really didn\'t happen, what they all became in the end was really satisfactory and worth the journey.Sora No Method, sadly won\'t be remembered this season, besides that it is the ""moe-blob"" of this season. But it is just so much more than that. By the end of the series, I walked away really happy, and would love to see some more Noel cuteness and adorableness. This show is worth trying out as it is a good breather away from those adrenaline pumped action shows and hyperactive comedy/slice of life shows.  If you are looking for the next Anohana, steer clear away from this anime as it would leave you disappointed. But if you are looking for something different in the moe supernatural genre, check it out. I really hope this anime gets noticed more as it easily falls into one of my favorites this year. classics like Kanon or Anohana, but with the right mindset, this show can easily stand its own ground.The main problem I keep hearing about this show is that it\'s ""too melodramatic.""

It reminded me a lot of Nagi no Asukara or Glasslip, as all three are very heart-warming and relaxing. The opening and ending are both equally enjoyable. All of the main characters were very well written, and the story really sticks with me. I was surprised with how much better it got in the last two episodes. Shione is such an important character. The last episode must have given me chills 100 times, and I even teared up there when Shione was looking at the papers to enroll in her old school....Overall, I'd definitely recommend this show, and it was very enjoyable to watch! Overall, I'd definitely recommend this show, and it was very enjoyable to watch!"", 'Sore no Method – “That’s what I’m here for, to grant your wishes”. A simple and innocent story of a girl just trying to reconnect with all her friends so that they may all smile together again. Except it is much more than just a friendly story. It moves you in ways that you cannot explain. Emotions swell within you yet, these emotions cannot be distinguished from happy and sad. It becomes hard to differiate between heartbreak and heartwarming, or that the tears upon your cheeks are from joy or sorrow. Sora no Method takes all of these feelings and blends them together into the...happiest sad anime of the year.Story – 7Nonoka is returning to her hometown after being in Tokyo for seven years. Although the town itself hasn’t changed much the attitudes and tourists have, because now there is a giant saucer hovering right over the middle of the lake. As Nonoka starts her new life she goes back to school. Luckily she ends up in the same class as most of her childhood friends unfortunately, she forgot about them after being gone for so long leading to some of them becoming mad at Nonoka for forgetting them.  Later as she returns home to start unpacking more of her belongings she finds Noel looking through the items, and in Noel’s hands is a picture of Nonoka’s late mother with its glass covering broken. Infuriated at the thought that Noel broke this picture she yells at Noel to leave, its not until her father returns and tells her that the picture was already broken while moving that Nonoka realizes the mistake she had made. As she desperately searches around the town for Noel she remembers a promise she made to Noel before she moved away. Nonoka then runs to the abandoned observatory, there she finds Noel and apologizes. Only to have Noel say it was ok and that after Nonoka fulfilled Noel’s wish of her returning, that it was her turn to make Nonoka’s wish come true.The story can easily be described with two words: melodramatic and moving. There are tons of forced drama in the first few episodes with everyone but one of her ex-friends holding a grudge. Slowly yet surely Nonoka with the help of the ultra-cute Noel becomes friends with almost everyone. And that basically ends most of the forced drama. The last few episodes are beyond moving. The story has such a beautiful meaning and delivery no one cannot help but feel their heart getting pulled upon, and for a few tears of both joy and sorrow roll down their cheeks. With a final ending that will just melt your soul.Characters – 7Nonoka only wants to be with friends again. She is a slight tragic character in the beginning with everyone blaming her for the saucer that came and changed their lives. Through it all though Nonoka never breaks, she does get beaten back especially when trying to sway Shione to forgive her. Luckily she is always helped by the wonderfully adorable Noel. And to get it out of the way: Noel is the most adorable character this season. Now I’m sure you’ve heard others call her that too and think she’s just become an overhyped loli who does a few cute things but nothing more. Instead Noel is one of the most dynamic characters of the story. Always working hard to bring everyone together with a smile, and while all the other characters might break down and cry Noel never once stops smiling. It’s unfortunate that the other characters, apart from Shione who only comes into herself in the final moments of the season, are somewhat bland compared to the developments that Nonoka and Noel go through. But that still makes them solid characters while not as important or entertaining each can easily hold their own throughout the story and all make important contributions.For the most part Koharu never holds any grudges against anyone, and actually blaming herself for the falling out of Yuzuki and her brother Souta before the events of the story. She never makes a large impact on the story but constantly keeps pushing everyone to be friends. The Mizusaka twins, Yuzuki and Souta, are two very different characters. Yuzuki is very active in both fending off Nonoka’s early attempts at befriending her, but then adamantly trying to sway Shione into becoming friends once again. While her brother Souta really is not much of a character as he stays in the background making sure the girls don’t hurt themselves. Shione is actually a difficult character to describe as she is almost two faced. She refuses to talk to Nonoka and even threatens her at points, but at the same time acting like a big sister to Noel. This relationship goes until the very end of the series and because of key spoilers I won’t discuss the matter to that point.Art/Animation – 9It’s stunning. A very simple yet elegant art style perfectly matches the innocence of the characters and story. Beautiful background shots are used everywhere. The animation looks exceedingly good whenever they put they use the saucer as something to draw on. Also the final scenes are so beautiful and smooth the art itself was one of the reasons that it evoked so much emotion.Sound – 8Simple and innocent, the ever going theme to describe this anime. While they can’t stand out from the anime itself the beautiful background music enhances every key moment and just makes you smile. The OP and ED are very cute sounding and some of my favourite’s of the season.Enjoyment – 8The anime easily had its ups and downs. Over the course of the season it was unfortunate that this show was one of the first I would “save” until next week to watch. Until the final few episodes it was a basic slice of life, yes we saw an over-arching story and really good characters. But nothing made me think “You know I really need to watch Sora no Method this week” and it is just that unfortunate that is what the genre has us do. Now luckily what happened is that I pushed it back so much that I ending up marathoning the final four episodes which is actually something that needs to be done. Because it is these four episodes that everything comes to light, everything comes together, and everyone smiles.Overall – 7.93 happiest sad anime of the year.Story – 7Nonoka is returning to her hometown after being in Tokyo for seven years.

That\'s actually an interesting mix. And with that cute character? Seriously, that\'s how I start to watch this show.But the unusual part of this show is here. After one or two episode, you will notice that there\'s a hint of mystery here (surprised?). Not really suspenseful, though. But it will keep you tilt your head. You will be constantly pondering questions like: ""why she\'s like that? why she want that? why she do that?...why she didn\'t do that? what\'s happening here?"" Yeah, and you can only keep watching this show, bearing all the boredom, just to know the answer. Perhaps it could\'ve been great if only executed better. So is it worth as mystery? not as far as that.So how good is the slice of life part, then? Well, to tell you the truth, I don\'t think it\'s slice of life of any kind. True, there\'s some part where you see cute girls doing slice of life things, but I think that is pretty common even in non-Slice of Life anime, especially anime nowadays, right? Rather than that, mostly you will often see a lot of people crying around people\'s relationship. So it\'s more like drama rather than slice of life, correct? So is it drama? Neither. How should i say? Even when the characters are in uptight situation, it doesn\'t feel uptight enough. You see people crying, there\'s no slice of life scene there, but the atmosphere still feels relaxed enough, even made you sleepy. Strange, huh? Don\'t even ask whether this show will make you cry or not. I really doubt that.School? Well, I will say it\'s OK. they are students, and there\'s some club activities.So what about the sci-fi part? Hmm... You can\'t say it\'s sci-fi just because there\'s UFO in the show, right? I mean, there\'s nothing scientific at all. The show doesn\'t even tell you where the instruction to call the UFO came from, or explain any background explanation worth to be sci-fi. They just somehow have it there from the first place. That\'s all. If we are in literature, it\'s more like a touch of magical realism rather than sci-fi. But it\'s also not even close to be a fantasy, as the only magical thing in the show is just that crystal UFO hovering above the town.And so, i\'m sure this part where Sora no Method doesn\'t succeed on bringing the merit of any genre, is one of the reason why this show is not popular.---Next, let\'s see the story. Don\'t worry. No spoiler here. Maybe just vague minor spoiler. But still, skip this part if you want.Sora no method is about a group of a friend. They\'re very close in the past. They had a special place to gather and play around. For some reason, they started to be separated. Several years later, when they finally meet again, they are having cold shoulder to each other. Apparently, there\'s a mysterious incident in the past which makes them troubled. At first, it appears as if a certain someone is the one who\'s supposedly to blame. But actually, every each of them is secretly hiding something related about the incident. This show will be about those group of friend trying to fix their relationship and strengthen their friendship with the help of a not-so-human cute girl. But unfortunately, if that really come true, something bad might happen.Wait.Sounds familiar? Yeah. While the other named AnoHana is a so-called masterpiece of tearjerker drama in anime world, this one called Sora no Method is not so popular.Now, please note that the story I sum up above is just the big plot or main point of it. It doesn\'t mean Sora no Method is very much similar with AnoHana. Nope. The overall detail of the story will be very different. I mentioned AnoHana just to give you a better idea on the story of Sora no Method. If I may say, compared to AnoHana, Sora no Method has more positive vibes in it and much more relaxed feels. I will not spoil anything.What else is different? The ending. Again, I will not spoil anything so watch it yourself if you want to know. It might not like what you expect.The problem in the story is: it is boring. The execution is bad. The conflict cannot pull you in. You might even ask, why I even watch this?---Then, what\'s good about this show?The Art.After watching it, the character design doesn\'t really stand out to me (maybe just those twin brother and sister)But what\'s really stand out is the scenery, it\'s so beautiful. I really like the sunset, the lake, the monuments, the mossy observatory, the sunflowers, the meteor shower, and the sunflowers in the final episode. And especially, in one of the episode, you will see the most beautiful UFO ever! So gorgeous it will give you chills!---What about the music?Well, expect something sweet and beautiful from \'fhana\'. If I could describe the music in a scenery, it will be like watching glittering star in a beautiful night sky. That kind of feeling.---So, is it worth watching?Only if you have time to waste. Or maybe if you need lullaby or some boredom in your fast-paced insomniac night. why she didn\'t do that? what\'s happening here?"" Yeah, and you can only keep watching this show, bearing all the boredom, just to know the answer. Perhaps it could\'ve been great if only executed better. So is it worth as mystery? not as far as that.So how good is the slice of life part, then? Well, to tell you the truth, I don\'t think it\'s slice of life of any kind.

Or maybe if you need lullaby or some boredom in your fast-paced insomniac night.', ""Sora no Method, or Cosmic Method, was a show that, when airing begun, didn't really attract much attention, but for the people that have watched it or plan to soon, this show is a very lighthearted slice of life that won't blow your mind, and it certainly won't resonate with everyone, but for what it's worth, i'd say it did it's job pretty well.Story - 7The story isn't incredibly groundbreaking, but one word that i feel can be used quite effectively is unique, the story follows Komiya Nonoka, a girl that, at the best of times, is quite inspiring, and at the worst, annoying...as hell. She has moved back to her hometown where a saucer occupies the sky. The saucer was called by Nonoka and her friends when they were kids, and now Nonoka embarks on a emotional journey with her childhood friends, as they all become more and more entwined with the saucer and the mysterious girl that came with it.Art - 7Nothing amazing in the art department, Animation had a really nice water colour look to it in my opinion, and the hair of almost every character was something i really liked looking at, the eyes however, not really, i like big eyes as much as the next guy but i don't know, something about the lighter shades at the bottom half of characters eyes just didn't look very nice to me, but then again, i am a picky person when it comes to eyes. Everything else was so-so, as aforementioned, nothing amazing, but it certainly isn't bad to look at.Sound - 8Beautiful ED, pretty good OP, music in episodes was average, what you'd expect from the kind of show it is. That ending theme though, god that was great, I know a lot of shows do this but when I heard the start of the ED fade in at the end of each episode i got a little excited and, well, tried my best to sing along (we all do it, don't try to deny it). The OP was alright, I don't think it really displayed the right sort of scenes at time though, like when Nonoka runs onto the wharf, and turns around to see Noel, her face drops into despair it looks like for a second, i don't know, maybe it's just me but i found sometimes the OP didn't really fit the cheery song sometimes.Characters - 7Most of the characters in this show were your averagely generated attitudes and personalities, you've got the stubborn one (Shione) the energetic one (Yuzuki) the nice one who accepts everything (Koharu) and the one who seems like they don't care but they really do in the end (Souta). As much as my descriptions might not be top notch, that's how i saw most of the characters, not to say that in a negative manner though, i enjoyed the dialogue between most of them, expect for Shione and Yuzuki being absolute bitches to Nonoka at first, that annoyed me a little.Enjoyment/Overall - 7Overall this was a very lighthearted show with some magical aspects about a group of friends going through what friends go through, mix in a cute loli with blue hair who is just the god damned cutest thing ever, i mean come on, Noel carried the comedy in this show, and you've got yourself an upper average slice of life that gives you a warm feeling with each episode, a smile at the nice ending and enough cutesy dialogue to make you see it through to the end.~Xeno156 as hell. She has moved back to her hometown where a saucer occupies the sky. The saucer was called by Nonoka and her friends when they were kids, and now Nonoka embarks on a emotional journey with her childhood friends, as they all become more and more entwined with the saucer and the mysterious girl that came with it.Art - 7Nothing amazing in the art department, Animation had a really nice water colour look to it in my opinion, and the hair of almost every character was something i really liked looking at, the eyes however, not really, i like big eyes as much as the next guy but i don't know, something about the lighter shades at the bottom half of characters eyes just didn't look very nice to me, but then again, i am a picky person when it comes to eyes. Everything else was so-so, as aforementioned, nothing amazing, but it certainly isn't bad to look at.Sound - 8Beautiful ED, pretty good OP, music in episodes was average, what you'd expect from the kind of show it is.

I must admit that I did during the first few episodes wonder why I was watching it but after a little while the characters started to grow on me and the plot became more interesting.  But it is the last few episodes that make the show...worth watching.

The character and the story is so boring and stale. Most importantly stale. Even a bad story...is enjoyable. It is something to laugh at, and mix in the weirdness of anime to a bad story for a laughable story. That is the opposite of this anime though. There is just a bit too much vagueness to this anime.

I\'ve never seen this term before but aside from the fact that I\'d use the word comedy instead of drama it does appropriately describe...what this is. There is no animation in this; it\'s just a series of still shots combined with the voice overs to tell the story. I think if I\'d known this before I watched it I wouldn\'t have been as disappointed.  The lack of animation wasn\'t the only thing that disappointed me; the English actors didn\'t do a very good job either. Maybe the subbed version is better.

Urusei Yatsura Movie 6: Itsudatte My Darling,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1925/Urusei_Yatsura_Movie_6__Itsudatte_My_Darling,"['Quick take: Meh. The story is okay, but is plagued by so many problems.I hesitate to write a review for this movie. It\'s known in the UY community as one of the worst of the series. I actually waited a few weeks while I fully digested this movie to edit my review, something I normally don’t think is necessary. Honestly, the longer time goes by the more generous I usually am with a score. That wasn’t the case here, because once I started reading the synopsis, I was given a PTSD flashback. As a note, I enjoyed this movie because it is UY, not because...it is a good movie. Scores are given relative to the original series.For comparison, I loved the series, giving it a score of 10.If you\'re going for the ""Complete UY"" achievement, I suggest watching this around episode 190 in the series so that you have some decent material left to make you forget about this atrocity.The story is not a bad concept, but it just feels so familiar. I kept feeling like I\'ve seen it before. I can see some similarities to ""The Final Chapter,"" but I wouldn\'t say it\'s a direct copy by any means. However, that isn\'t the biggest problem, because if it was, I think the story would still earn a decent score. Looking at the movie, it feels like every idea put on the drawing board somehow made it into the final product. Furthermore, it feels like one giant best of segment, where the ""best ofs"" are situations and script, as opposed to just a re-airing. Seriously, the entire movie seems to do nothing but reference the series, while surrounded by a slightly different story. As a result, the story ends up feeling like a jumbled hot mess. There are a number of ""false endings,"" most notably at the 30 minute mark, where I was a bit shocked to see that I wasn\'t even halfway through yet. Then there are times where it jumps around so quickly, that coherency is broken. UY is no stranger to bat-shit crazy, but still within the madness there was some type of coherency. This movie felt like the story board director fell asleep during production and then woke up at the premier.The art was worse than the series. Sometimes faces were incredibly bland and featureless, other times main characters looked strange. The art in the series and every other movie was not only better, but cleaner. Remember when I said there was no coherency about the storyline? Well there is coherency between the story line and the art. Both are incredibly choppy and jump around. A bit dizzying, honestly. So much stuff happens so quickly that at times I felt like I had whiplash.As for sound, I can only guess that they didn\'t have the money in the budget to hire a real orchestra. Not only is the music writing generally bad, but the vast majority sounds like it was, at the very least, recorded on a keyboard. That\'s being nice, because it really sounds like they just had a computer midi program play it back. They would\'ve been better off just using the series\' original score. It would\'ve been cheap, I would\'ve still mentioned that it was a cop-out, but it would\'ve gotten a better score and actually been good. Acting is on par with the rest of the series.Then let\'s talk about how the movie\'s goal seemed to be a cameo of every character ever used in the series. Kinda like it was a cameo of every situation that happened in the series. Ten\'s mother? Suddenly on earth standing in a random crowd of people on the street. The Phantom Red Mantle? Chillin\' outside a bar on a different planet. Almost every background character was a character from the series at some point. It was ridiculous and distracting.Is there anything I like about “Always My Darling?” Sure. The very last scene with Cherry was classic UY and made me laugh. I laughed at the scene before that as well, not because it was good, but because of it\'s absurd “suddenly we\'re all friends” approach to Lupika. And therein lies the problem, if there was anything I did like about this movie, it\'s overshadowed by the blatant money grab this poorly executed movie was.I think, at heart, the storyline had potential despite being a homologation of most of the other story arcs. Honestly, had the story been executed properly and many of the reference-to-a-past-joke scenes been eliminated, I probably wouldn’t have noticed its repetitive plot.I enjoyed this movie because it is UY, not because it is a good movie. The story isn\'t bad, but it is plagued by poor execution. Along with the art editing, it just jumps around too much and is really annoying. The music is just plain bad.

To be perfectly frank, there's nothing really substantial to mention about this film, except for the fact that Urusei Yatsura Movie 6: Always My Darling was made for the ten year anniversary of the Urusei Yatsura anime. I thought that was pretty special and worth mentioning. Minor Spoilers.I'll keep this short, the storyline behind this film feels like they took specific parts of previous Urusei...Yatsura films and stitched them together to make...this. I won't summarize the plot, because I'll sound like a broken record, but if you made it this far into Urusei Yatsura and read the synopsis for this film, you know exactly what's going to happen. None of it was bad in any way, but you've seen it all before. It had some goofy moments that made laugh, and some sad moments that made me a little emotional. It's just Urusei Yatsura, that's all. The story wasn't exceptional, but it wasn't underwhelming either. It was just mediocre. I do love the scene where Ataru tricks his entire class and manipulates them into doing random stuff for the love potion. Mendo threatens to kill Ataru if he doesn't tell him where it is, but Ataru can't tell them where it is if he's dead, so he takes advantage of them. That was a great scene, but it didn't last all that long.The music is not worth mentioning. It sounds just like the other songs from the last couple of films. Something that is worth mentioning are the character designs. I love them! I briefly mentioned in my last review that over time, the character designs, with each film were becoming more refined and expressive. I think the characters look fine in any specific way they're drawn; even in the first film. Always My Darling did an excellent job at giving these characters a more updated 90's look, it fits them very well. It looks like I'm watching Ranma ½! They have the exact same character designs, and at this point, Takahashi's art style had changed a lot over a decade.This film was okay. It had it's moments, but it wasn't all that good. I'm still putting it ahead of Remember My Love, because that film feels so uninspired and dry compared to the other films. Keep in mind, the gap in quality between Remember My Love and Always My Darling is not that big. I'm giving it a slight edge, only because I found more enjoyment out of this film. And with that, I'M DONE REVIEWING THESE MOVIES! Took some time, and a few pair of eyeballs, but I'm done. This movie gets a 6 out of 10. I'm gonna go watch Ranma ½ for the umpteenth time.

"Watashi, Nouryoku wa Heikinchi de tte Itta yo ne!",https://myanimelist.net/anime/37393/Watashi_Nouryoku_wa_Heikinchi_de_tte_Itta_yo_ne,"[""FUNA’s anime adaptation follows a common trend in recent years with the flood of fantasy isekai. Abilities Average (the shortened title I’ll be referring to) doesn’t demand much on the creative side as we witness the transformation of a teenage girl into an overpowered adventurer. Joining main female protagonist Mile includes Reina, Pauline, and Reina. Are you ready to watch an adventure with these four goofballs?Clocking in at 12 episodes, the early warning flag raised is the faithfulness of the anime adaptation. Unfortunately, it’s easy to say the anime decided to condense the material in order to maintain a flow of the overall series. Rather...than following a faithful roadmap, the anime omits Mile's days at academy and instead puts her right into the 4-girls group as we are most familiar with. Needless to say, that cuts value into Mile's character as the audience will have a lesser time understanding her. As the novels consists of over 300 chapters, this decision didn’t take me by storm. Thankfully, Abilities Average make time to bring a comedic filled adventure.The Crimson Vow. Remember those words well because this entire show is about them and their adventures. Mile may be the central protagonist but she retains the common interest of an otaku that being her love of anime, manga, and video games. Applying this knowledge to her adventures and battles, the show is made effectively self-aware of its standards. Even Mile herself is aware of her personality that is addressed by her own narratives. Joining her in these adventures is Reina, the crimson mage with a dark past but became a Hunter. As a crimson mage skilled with fire techniques, she plays the role of a tactical fighter and is invaluable to the party; think of her as the mage class in one of those classic WOW raids. Reina herself does have a background story that takes the show into a more emotional direction. If you care about her as a person, you will likely feel some sympathy of Reina when told from her personal perspective. Entering the familiar isekai party tropes, we also meet Mavis von Austein, the skilled knight with a noble persona. In any fantasy stories, a knight is almost like a necessity to make its series credible. Hence, we have Mavis although the show pokes fun of her character. For instance, she often gets teary eyed by sad stories despite her masculine appearance. Finally, Crimson Vow has another mage named Pauline who occasionally shows her “dangerous side” when least expected. Brace yourself for this group because they are the embodiment, heart, and soul of Abilities Average.It makes sense that Abilities Average follows these four characters exclusively rather than developing other characters. After all, Crimson Vow is essentially the collective party of the poster characters. Even though Mile is the central protagonist, the others are featured just as much as her. FUNA’s writng of these characters puts emphasis on their personality than development. Watching their character chemistry and embracing who they are as characters is essential to enjoying the show. The more I watch these characters, the more I feel connected to them. However, I will say the show is aiming for lighthearted humor the majority of the time. There’s also satirical humor with character behaviors such as Mile’s lack of common sense at times. In other words, Abilities Life is more of a deconstruction of the fantasy isekai genre. It’s not an entirely a unique concept but does give a breath of fresh air for the Fall 2019, a season that seems to have an unusual amount of isekai.The closest Abilities Life gets to with an antagonist is the life adventure itself. The anime adaptation doesn’t truly have a Big Bad but does introduce obstacles for Crimson Vow to overcome. This includes the battle tournament these girls participates early in the show to later facing off against an Elder Dragon. We have to remember that these are still teenage girls who have yet to step into the adult world. However, all these characters are portrayed as adorable badasses. The best way to describe them would be “dynamite come in little packages”. It’s when their opponents are caught off guard and realizes it's too little, too late. Mile’s request to be “average” still turns her into an overpowered character by the Creator. By average, she didn’t expect that her own abilities far outclasses others in this new world. The word ‘average’ itself losses its meaning when you think of the Average Joe. But in essence, it’s still fun to watch their adventure to see how they overcome their obstacles.Project No.9’s transformed the light novel into anime by making it full of charms. It’s adorably cute with the characters made into teenage girls. If you look at first glance, there’s little reason to fear them until it’s too late. Character expressions is portrayed with a cartoony style of expressions with a vast majority of the time being humorous. On rare occasions, there’s more emotional reactions such as with Reina’s anger or Pauline’s sadism. The world setting is also decorated with light touches of fantasy such as the mystical and fairy tale-like creatures. Of course, dwarves, elves, and goblins exist because it’s part of the Isekai 101 formula. On a lesser scale, the battle cinematics is clean and crisp although looks average in style. Don’t go into this show looking into some high level caliber of animation quality because you won’t find it.I’d normally discard the voice acting of a cast of teenage girls because most often time or not, they all sound the same. However, I do want to mention that the character voice mannerism of Average Life is more effective than some of the other isekai shows I’ve seen. This is due to how close the character connections are with each other. It’s collected together as a union of personalities coming from different backgrounds but united as Crimson Vow. Plus, who can forget the theme song of the show? When you have an adorable cast posing in ridiculous manners and catchy lyrics, it’s hard not to get into the rhythm.Average Life always seemed like a series that would eventually get an anime and it indeed did. Here, we have an anime about a cast of goofballs poking fun of the idea of an isekai adventure. However, I do want the audience to be aware of the faithfulness of the show.

I\'ll heal up every single time, and then bring this staff down upon the head of the person who insulted my friends."" - Pauline, very cutely, and with a cute smile. I think you can see where this is going...My feelings about \'Didn\'t I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!\' (Noukin) can be summed up with four simple words: I LOVE this show! That\'s right, I fucking said it: I. FUCKING. LOVE. THIS. SHOW. Do something about it.Because there are a few aspects of this show which will displease those who...use a fine crystal wine glass to savor the aroma of their farts, here is a friendly little disclaimer:- Yes, it\'s another isekai anime.- Yes, there are plenty of tropes.- Yes, it probably doesn\'t follow the source material to the letter.- Yes, there is a beach episode... well, half-episode. And a bath scene or four.- Yes, there are quite a few boob jokes.- And yes, the plot is not 100% original.In other words, anyone who has a stick up their ass jostled by the aforementioned should instead go watch \'Your Lie in April\' or some other puke of a series that pretends to be all deep and shit. I don\'t want them sitting at my table anyways!ANYWAYS...Simply put, Noukin is ADORABLE! Seriously, everything about it makes you want to let out one of those ""aw, look at the cute puppy"" sighs and hug a giant teddy bear. The MC is just the most precious thing you\'ve ever seen, and the rest of her party is a basket of cute-itude, with varying degrees of damage. And the pop culture references? Fucking golden! There were \'Dragon Ball\' and \'Terminator 2\' references that had me in literal tears - shit, if I were tripping on mushrooms when I saw them, I might have died of laughter. Oh, and that OP is just cute with a capital Q-T! Noukin truly is a delightful surprise that is drenched in fun & cute, and is probably my favorite show of the year.So, about dem scores:Story: 7Art: 8Sound: 10Characters: 10Enjoyment: 10Overall: *9/10*In the future, I may expand this to delve into every category more thoroughly; in the meantime, though, here is my list of the notable pros & cons:PROS:- Noukin knows exactly what it is: A cute & self-aware quasi-spoof on its own genre, but without neglecting the character development or story progression.- The main characters are just delightful in every respect. The designs are somewhat familiar, yet each character still displays a refreshing uniqueness. Not only that, they flesh out each character\'s personality & backstory quite well, and none of the characters feel sidelined in any respect... oh, and did I mention their cuteness?- From start to finish, this show is fucking HILARIOUS! I was caught completely off-guard by the humor, and I couldn\'t be happier about it. There is plenty of meta-humor, well-executed references to other works, situational comedy and even a bit of black humor here and there. Every single episode had me in stitches at some point, even if ""some heavy shit was going down,"" as you hip kids love to say.- The production quality is solid, including both the animation and sound design. None of the corner-cutting seen in other recent isekai releases, such as \'Arifureta\' or \'Demon Lord, Retry!\', is present in this series. From the very first scenes, you can tell that all sorts of well-animated cuteness is in store for you.-  Romance is rarely even mentioned in the show, and sex itself is discussed even less than that, which is incredibly welcomed. While there is some pervy-ish humor and light fanservice, it is fairly benign and not at all gratuitous, which could have easily ruined this show. At no point are the girls portrayed as mere sex objects, nor are they ever overly-sexualized. Only one character ever inspires open expressions of lust from men, due to her large bosom, but those moments are few & far between and in no way define her as a character. There is a beach half-episode, a few short bath scenes and some boob jokes strewn throughout, but the execution is more tasteful than most and always seemed appropriate: the bath scenes are pretty tame; the boob jokes are usually related to the MC\'s ""breast envy,"" which actually makes sense in this case, since the MC was a young adult when she died; and much of this humor in the series comes in part from the MC\'s actions inadvertently clashing with the societal ignorance & modesty of her new world... plus cuteness.- Perhaps the best part of the ""sexual mildness,"" though, is that the girls are never subjected to any rapey behavior, much less rapey behavior presented as ""goofy antics,"" as is the case in dumpster fires like \'How Not to Summon a Douche Lord.\' Enough said. it\'s nice to watch something a little more on the ""innocent"" end of the spectrum once in a while no?- Did I mention the cuteness?- Oh, and before I forget: NO PANTY SHOTS!- None of the girls\' voices are annoyingly shrill or squeaky. Thank fucking god.- CGI is used both sparingly and appropriately. THANK. FUCKING. GOD.- That fucking OP, though! ^_^CONS (maybe):- Some of the mood shifts are a bit jarring, which is usually intentional, and the humor can seem inappropriate for the situation(s) at hand. Oftentimes, there are hilarious moments in the midst of dramatic situations, which can be incongruous with the overall mood of the scene. I myself enjoyed this aspect of the series, but I can see how it would be off-putting to some.- The show is somewhat episodic and the overall story may be a little thin. I don\'t personally find this an issue because the story is really about the friendship & first adventures of these four girls and doesn\'t need to be anything more than that; however, I can understand if someone desires more suspense or a more defined plot, so it bears mentioning nonetheless.IN SUMMATION: If you are looking for a cute, fun and accessible isekai anime about powerful magical girls that aren\'t glorified sex toys going on adventures in a Medieval-esque fantasy world, then you have hit the motherfuckin\' jackpot with Noukin! At its core, this is a heartwarming tale of a young girl\'s second chance at life and the friends she makes along the way, and it tells the story without relying on cheap gimmicks or crossing into ecchi territory. Noukin is a refreshingly adorable & guilt-free comedy about four strong female characters that has wide appeal without alienating typical anime fans, and should not be overlooked simply because it happens to be another isekai about an overpowered MC.Come for the cute, stay for the funny! use a fine crystal wine glass to savor the aroma of their farts, here is a friendly little disclaimer:- Yes, it\'s another isekai anime.- Yes, there are plenty of tropes.- Yes, it probably doesn\'t follow the source material to the letter.- Yes, there is a beach episode... well, half-episode.

The jokes are repetitive and not funny, there were close to no moments that I generally liked, and I hate myself for watching this.Firstly I wanna say what I did like, that one episode where they were around the campfire sharing stories it was wholesome and I did enjoy that, I love the OP even though I wish I didn\'t, and a few of the anime references the put in. That\'s about it.Firstly the comedy is dreadful....It\'s mainly about Adele being like, ""I just wanna be average"", and she gets her wish just not the way she wanted. She ""tries"" not to show her power to anyone, but whenever someone says flat, she turns into a rage like, ""YOU CALLED ME FLAT, NA-NANI, BAKANA"" and then proceeds to use her OP abilities and crush her opponent and at the end be like, ""OH, I did that? Teehe"", like bitch that shit annoys me so much. It wasn\'t funny the first time and wasn\'t funny after the 50th time either. Also when Adele tries to use her power but not in an OP way but still does without knowing that also irritates me, I have seen that so many times in so many different ways and that joke being like the main source of comedy really just grinds my gears. it also tries to play at being to meta and it fails a lot of the time and is generally not funny (and I love me some meta humor).The characters are bad as well. None of them stick out in anyway, never enjoyed watching them interact. They had their good moments obviously, for example, I liked Pauline just being a sadist, Mavis being a dumbass, but I didn\'t like anything about Adele or Reina. Even with Reina tragic backstory and understanding were her motivation comes from still didn\'t make me like her at all. Now because there is not much to say about the animation other than it\'s complete garbage and hurt my eyes to look at, I\'m not gonna make it it\'s own paragraph.Overall, complete garbage show, I can see why people like it and if you like parody, reference filled loli shows than I would recommend this show to you. If you don\'t however skip this show completely you will not find enjoyment in it whatsoever.

Now, I don\'t usually endorse the ""They Changed It, Now It Sucks"" line of thought. I don\'t demand them to follow the novel to the letter, and change by itself might not be a bad thing if the changes were positive. However, that is not the case. Instead, most of the changes were terrible, with only a few exceptions.First things first: they skip much of the protagonist\'s backstory and...the early events. Yes, you read that right. Why bother showing the backstory when you can just move on and not have a clue about past events? They barely get a mention early on, and the audience will have to keep waiting for short flashbacks. I suppose it would be possible to improve the pacing of the early parts of the novel, but this is not the way to do it. I also don\'t mind non-linear narration, but it doesn\'t serve a purpose here. Instead, they go straight for the comedy, some of it exclusive to the anime. Here is the thing though: Many of the jokes works better when you spend more time developing the characters. Why? Because they are heavily based on their personalities and backgrounds. With so much of it skipped, we don\'t really know the people on-screen all that well.And there are additional problems with the comedy itself. For instance, there is now also an anime-exclusive villain who only exists to be comically evil. And by comically evil, I mean the ""I\'m evil in a generic way but also wacky, so it\'s alright"" variety, not the actually funny kind. On top of everything else, she is for all intents and purposes a pedophile who kidnaps young girls to set up a harem to surround her (she literally uses the word “harem,” by the way). Related to this, there were even a few awkward jokes about the idea of children being sexually assaulted, one of them depicted with an athletic jump onto a bed. My favorite. This is allegedly funny (the show thinks so). She doesn\'t openly endorse it, but at that point there is barely any difference. Now, doing evil things can be funny, but there should be some at least remotely relatable motives to them and a more interesting personality to match. I also find it more clichéd than anything. If they want to establish a character as evil in anime, kidnapping young girls with sexual intentions or undertones is the go-to solution.What else does she have?An obviously evil smirk? Check.A bunch of generic evil henchmen? Check.Pointlessly explaining her evil plans? Check.There you go. The standard ""joke"" antagonist for your enjoyment but not actually amusing, of course. This is not funny comedic sociopathy, this is being a clichéd evil villain, no matter how wacky they are. I look forward to more of these new random nobodies.Speaking of which, the design choices of the bandits and various thugs are pretty bad. I assume they were going for parody by making them look evil in an incredibly generic way (evil smirk, very ugly, etc.), but the end result is almost indistinguishable from what they are trying to parody. It is difficult to parody generic evil villains by making them even more generic evil villains because the original idea (the target of the parody) was already close to the extreme.The design of the nanomachines has been completely overhauled, and now they look like some kind of cat-like animal spirit with the letter \'N\' on his forehead. This is obviously some kind of cheap ratings grab. Not to mention, they act as a single entity, his manner of speaking has been changed, and he is now also providing exposition for some reason. And then there are the other side characters who were cut or replaced with generic evil henchmen. Many of them didn\'t get sufficient development in the novel, but they were usually better than their replacements. Rest in peace. There was one good addition: that one guy in the graduation match running away without fighting. I give credit where credit is due.Along with the characters, many events are skipped or browsed through at breakneck speed, along with most of the introspection by the characters. To some extent, it is understandable because of the difference between anime and novel formats and limitations in episode count, but this is relatively rushed even for an adaptation. If you liked the scientific content, most of that has been skipped as well. The parts that remained are narrated more awkwardly. Also have fun with additional out-of-place fanservice. The novel had some boob jokes, yes, but now they are more frequent, in more out-of-place scenes, and more awkward thanks to the visual design.Furthermore, the jokes are often explained too much. While this also happens in the novel, the problem is greater here, mostly because of visual decisions that result in over-reactions to every joke. I got the punch-line on my own, thank you very much. No need to spell it out. Some of the better jokes are yet to appear, so maybe there is some hope, but they might find a way to ruin them too. Wouldn\'t surprise me at this point. the early events.

To be fair and give some due credit, the ""Himouto Umaru-chan"" and ""Yuru Yuri"" director has done the same treatment to those shows and others he directed, and though it may seem that the damage is written on the wall, no one saw the adverse effect coming, that no matter how vastly different the source material may be, the anime can still prove to be as good on its own, mostly as a niche.

It doesn't follow the generic isekai path and instead shows us the MC as a child going about doing what she wants. But this is where the story takes a turn.

I do like the OP and ED songs though.Characters 9/10:The characters are where the anime shines in my opinion. The cast of characters are fun to watch and they are all different from one another. The main team of four girls have all got different personalities that suite the class they are as well as the character design they have. Another thing I like about the cast is that the main team consists of four girls and no boys. I do like this a lot because I feel like it's a change of pace from the countless harem, ecchi, romance isekai with a boring protagonist that literally every human alive can insert themselves into and I feel that because of this I can enjoy the anime for what is is meant to be, an anime and not a medium to escape reality.Overall 8/10:Overall like I said I really enjoyed this anime.

This is typical CGDCT and isekai mixed together. There is almost no plot to this anime what so ever. It's just the main...character getting transported to another world and doing whatever she wants.Art 6/10:There is nothing special about the art in this anime either. If anything, the fight scenes actually look kind of poor. sword fights do not have any effects, magic aren't that epic, and the budget does not look too high. to sum it up, it looks generic, there are not any particular animation flaws except for the fighting scenes, and it goes well with the comedy aspect of this anime.Sound 6/10:The OP is cute and catchy sounding. is it the best I've seen?

Just be prepared to be disappointed when it comes to fight scenes. They're very short, and very one sided (whether are heroines are winning or losing) and all around I felt they were pretty pathetic, including their poor scripting.Essentially it's a bit rushed, and there are some missing and changed side characters, but overall I'd say it's enjoyable as light watching. see enough of their charm to stick around to get to know them, bless their chuuni hearts.For those who are - I'd certainly recommend watching this, as it's fun to see these girls come to life - like I said, they are animated (and voiced) pretty well, and the anime has a pleasantly vibrant vibe that is very faithful to the original art.

This is just not a very good show. At best, it's painfully average. I've read the LN, and it's way ahead of this adaptation.I suppose my biggest gripe with the anime is that it never quite resolves any of the problems our MC faces. Putting aside the fact that the MC is already immensely overpowered, even the character development is choppy. Whenever someone presses her on the source of her immense powers (that she barely bothers to hide) or her history, she just makes an awkward laugh and...the anime moves on. There is no real tension, and the MC comes off as someone who is not genuine. The other members of her cast are far better characters for that reason. And then there's the MC making jokes by parodying anime and manga that clearly don't exist in her world. It's meant for the audience, but it's incredibly cringe worthy. Imagine a guy doing a naruto run in front of people who've never seen Naruto.The anime is just lazy. The LN did a much better job in building up Mile as a character. This anime tries to be too many things at the same time, and ends up failing them all. It feels like an aimless meandering stream of thought centred around a hollow self-insert isekai character. And because Mile is never truly challenged, or forced to grow in some measure, even the self-insert is for the truly, mindbogglingly boring person. Even Kirito is less of an overpowered jerk compared to Mile, and Saitama still ends up having character development in the course of the series. The aimlessness would be fine if this was a slice of life anime, but it fails even at that.Seriously, who is this anime even meant for? Only a person who has never seen any other isekai anime would be interested in this. The magic in underwhelming, the swordplay is underwhelming, the characters are cliched, the plot is boring and Mile has all the charisma of moldy bread. The kindest thing to hope for in this anime is that someone will summon a Lelouch-like Japanese guy to become a demon lord and end everything. the anime moves on. There is no real tension, and the MC comes off as someone who is not genuine. The other members of her cast are far better characters for that reason. And then there's the MC making jokes by parodying anime and manga that clearly don't exist in her world. It's meant for the audience, but it's incredibly cringe worthy. Imagine a guy doing a naruto run in front of people who've never seen Naruto.The anime is just lazy. The LN did a much better job in building up Mile as a character.

Basically wacky comedies with a reliance on slapstick to get its point across. Simple, wholesome and very effective. Come Noukin however, and I honestly wondered what happened to the team.The series started out decently enough, a bit overly reliant on referential humour and running gags, but it still worked decently enough. Then...came episode 4 and oh boy after this the show was never the same again. The main problem that permeates this, (and Kotoura-san I add) is that Ohta and team can not do Drama. At all. Their attempts at drama comes across as pace-breaking and ineffectual. I could not care less as Reina described her sad backstory to us in the most boring and predictable way imaginable that added nothing to the fun and humour that came before. It was at that point where I pretty much gave up all hope on the series. After that, there was maybe one or two good episodes. One about killing a dragon and the other about Mile fearing she\'d be kicked out, but honestly the damage has been done and 4 good episodes out of a bag of 12 is a fail in my book. I don\'t understand it. I never read the original source material and never plan to, but I do know FUNA got the team to do this anime because he liked how Sabagebu deviated from its source material and provided its own unique take on the manga while being enjoyable. To that I say ""Huh?"". At no point in this misery did it even feel like a fraction of the joy that was Sabagebu.I don\'t hate drama in my comedy anime, I mean, I just watched Urahara recently and that blended surprisingly good drama with a surreal slice of life comedy pretty well. Or for a more recent example, Null Peta, where Null\'s plight does become genuinely emotional (or at least not frustrating) near the end and that was done pretty well. Hell Akari\'s time travel episode from Yuru Yuri S2 did more for me than this shitshow ever did.Just don\'t bother with this. It just shows that good directors and their teams can sometimes churn out a turd.3/10 came episode 4 and oh boy after this the show was never the same again.

There\'s no denying it. We\'ve been hit with a constant deluge of it ever since Sword Art Online entered the picture, and it\'s not going away any time soon. Some hate it, some love it, but no matter what you think of it, you\'ve gotta love a good parody.The first great Isekai parody was indisputably Konosuba, but now a contender has arrived; following in its footsteps and even giving it a few distinct nods, the ponderously named ""Didn\'t I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!"" looks like it could become a comedy of similar...caliber.""Didn\'t I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!"" (Which I am shortening to ""The Average Isekai"") is a simple, straightforward story that has shown itself more than able to deliver an abundance of hilarity and hijinks. It follows Miles, or ""Adele Von Ascham"", a girl who was hit by ""that infamous runaway Isekai truck"" in her normal life and wound up reincarnated in a fantasy world where her wish before being reborn was ""make my stats average - I want to live a normal carefree life."" Her request is granted - at least in half. Her stats are the average of the weakest creature in the world... and the most powerful, leaving her ridiculously more powerful than even the most exceptional humans in her world.The show tracks her questionably successful attempts to conceal her over-poweredness and live a normal, happy young adulthood, along with the friends she makes along the way. The hilarious 4th-wall breaking comedy with which Miles, and the show as a whole, takes on the inevitable tropes that come from being in an Isekai left me laughing continuously throughout each episode. If I were to voice any criticism of, or fears about, this show it would only be that it could get pretty predictable further in, but given that its a comedy I don\'t see this becoming much of a problem at all. I have little doubt that ""The Average Isekai"" will continue to deliver in the episodes to come and heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys laughing and can stomach some fun being poked at the Isekai genre.This show is comedic genius and I\'ve enjoyed every moment of it so far. caliber.""Didn\'t I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!""

I\'ll try to make this review as straightforward as possibly and not too stretched.Story : 8/10First half of the series is good. Though its pretty much the generic MC flexing. The comedy adds a touch to it, making it amusing and enjoying to watch.The second half of the series is an utter disappointment. It was tainted with unnecessary drama which ruins the tranquil and serenity the show had built.The story can be drastically improved if it simply becomes a full-fledged comedy show like Endro. It\'s...either that or the story has to be very good in order for the drama to be ""acceptable"".Art : 9/10Project No.9 is known for making shit isekais.

No comment.Character : 9/10Don\'t half-ass it. If you want to make an MC powerful. Make them powerful. If you want to make an MC weak. Make them weak. Sure, they can develop and become powerful later. Sure, they can even become weaker. But the story has to cover up everything and make it seem reasonable.This anime failed on that aspect. It makes me feel uncomfortable.Enjoyment : 10/10-Overall : 10/10I actually have mixed feelings for this anime. I can\'t decide whether I should give this anime a 9 or 10. But I\'ll be generous today and give it a 10 since I had a lot of fun for the first half of the series. Though the second half was disappointing.

I’m content to watch a quirky, overpowered protagonist carve a niche out for themselves in generic fantasyland with whatever twist they bring to the formula. Even if it’s narratively stale, I’m usually satisfied, and I’m likewise happy to recommend whatever I just watched to my anime-watching kindred spirits.I can’t recommend Watashi, Nouryoku wa Heikinchi de tte Itta yo ne! (henceforth abbreviated God Bless Me?) to anyone, though. It’s a shame, since it began with such a cute premise.Story: 1/10The story begins with a simple enough premise. Mile, with her freakishly high power level, does her best at the...Hunter Academy to be as average as possible. Though she blunders in hiding her skills, she succeeds in making friends and forming an adventuring party with them. Thus begins the shenanigans. Easy enough premise to run with for twelve episodes, right?Unfortunately, wrong. As a comedy-centered show, the “jokes” are weak and frequently rely on otaku pandering. This is most disappointing, because even though I’m weeb enough to understand, for example, their nendoroid and Doraemon references, it doesn’t change the fact that it’s simply not funny. The writers of God Bless Me? think that shoehorning an anime reference and ribbing the audience with a hamfisted “hey, look, we know Japanese pop culture too, look at how hip we are ;D” makes laughs. It does not. It just makes watching the events play out on screen even more awkward than they already were.An unignorable amount of “humor” also centered around Mile’s (who, I would be remiss to not mention, is around 12 years old or so) insecurity about her chest size, with gratuitous comparisons to her teammate Reina and innkeeper’s daughter Lenny, who are in the same general age range, all with lovingly gratuitous camera framing at the obviously underage chests in question. Ew. Worse yet was Mile’s occasional perverse behavior around said chests. Ew ew ew ew ew. I feel filthy even writing about it for the sake of this review.Without spoilers, I can say the final episode was incredibly disappointing and a thematic 180° to the thematic build-up of the eleven episodes before it. One would think Mile’s story arc was building up to a heartfelt show of the power of friendship. Apparently not.Art & Sound: 3/10I normally score these apart, but they share a common feature this time: they’re not atrocious, but they are absolutely lazy outside the main squad. This can be felt especially hard at the finale. Lazy design, lazy voicework.Character: 2/10The main squad, Crimson Vow, is composed of four cookie-cutter character stereotypes. While Mile’s backup crew does get a bit of time devoted to their backstories, it doesn’t feel like they grow at all during their respective spotlights. They felt like afterthoughts, with limited consequence to the actual development of said characters. Of course, a slice of life style show doesn’t need significant character development as long as the characters command presence and synergize among themselves... but the writers mostly failed to achieve that. What we’re left with is a core cast of cardboard cutouts that look like young girls.If the writers couldn’t care to carve out engaging personalities with their leads, you can be sure that the supporting and side characters were devoid of life. Lenny was memorable enough for me to remember her while writing this review, though, so I can give the show that. You deserved a better show, Lenny.Enjoyment: 1/10God Bless Me? could have gotten away with being an enjoyable-yet-forgettable niche title. It could have been a cute, Isekai-flavored slice of life, or a comedic parody of Isekai power levels. Such a shame it turned out to be otaku creep-bait, instead. Maybe when it reincarnates again, it will have a better creative team behind it.Final score: 2/10 Hunter Academy to be as average as possible.

So, when I heard it was getting an anime adaptation, needless to say, I was extremely happy. However, I quickly realised that as with many of my favourite light novel adaptations this year *cough cough Arifureta, the studio was going to butcher the source material, skip entire arcs and change the story around completely.Now, that's a big deal for me as someone who is a LN reader, but if you go into this as an anime only, you may have a totally different experience and opinion. However, for...me this was a huge let down. As for the story we do get in the anime, it is still pretty entertaining, we get a unique take on the most popular anime genre. Unlike other generic isekai protags, Adele wants to be average in every sense of the word. She does not wish to stand out or be famous, and the whole point of the series revolves around this inner struggle and conflict that she has within herself.The comedy is on point in the show, definitely have got some chuckles out, the sound design is great, the OP is great and in my playlist and the art is gorgeous. Overall, it is a truly solid series. Because of the changes they made it is not a great series. It's still worth watching for a relaxing cool down period after a long day at work or if you're in need of a laugh, but don't expect anything revolutionary here, and definitely consider checking out the source material.

And that\'s just in the first episode! The biggest FIVE problems (and yes I am judging this after watching the full thing) are 1: The ""Idol Syndrome"" 2: The refusal to tell the Crimson Vow her true backstory, 3: Skipping the school days, 4: Ruining the backstory(s), and 5: not committing to the bit.I will start at the bottom. #5: Not committing to the...Bit-Average REFUSES to let their dark characters BE dark. Basically, they want to have their cake and eat it too. They want a light-hearted romp with ""cute"" girls doing ""cute"" things to sell figurines, but they also want to be taken seriously and have dramatic tension. Their darkest character Pauline, a girl who is nightmarishly psychopathic, cannot truly be the psychotic monster that she is. They tease that Pauline is 120% down to do horrific things (like beating another girl\'s head in during an exhibition match) but her opponents always weasel their way out of danger... by surrendering... EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.And then on the other end of the spectrum, they often ruin a good set up by skipping the joke altogether. (more on that later.)#4: Ruining the backstory(s)-These characters all give their backstories in one episode. We spend so little time in their past that, even though three of their pasts are plot-relevant, we could\'ve skipped the flashbacks all together and missed nothing of value. The reason they did this is because they want us to take these characters seriously. But they spoil it because they still want to be a comedy. And Average is left in this awkward middle-ground that\'s not truly either.#3: Skipping the School Days-This one ties in with the ""skipping the joke altogether"" bit that I mentioned earlier. Average cuts A LOT of content that needed to be filled out. The six months the girls spent ""training in school"" was one of them. This was a joke waiting to happen. The teacher assigns a task, MC does it too well, her friends then go Waaaaaaaaay over the top doing the task and break every record the school ever held. And then they graduate into the lowest category of hunters...Except that\'s not what happens. Instead, all of that is skipped, they fight in an arena at their graduation, and they become top-tier hunters right off the bat.In one episode.Another example is the literal exposition at the end of the first episode explaining how MC\'s so strong even though she wished to be average! Son of a — Let us have a JOKE!!#2: The Refusal to Tell Crimson Vow her Real Backstory-So, the MC doesn\'t want to stand out. That\'s her gimmick. But she\'s also God-tier. That\'s her problem. Her closest friends won\'t stop pestering her for her backstory. Does she A: Tell them the Truth so they can all work together to make her wishes come true, involving them in wacky hijinks that the MC has always wanted to do, but the CV think is totally normal for MC, or B: Lie her ass off and only tell her BEST FRIENDS the things that have happened to her since she got to their world.If you chose B, you watched this show... Congrats? No... So sorry.#1: The ""Idol Syndrome""-These characters are not characters; their Idols. They exist for merchandising. This is an unfortunately common problem with female characters in anime. They exist to be cute so horny men will buy their stuff. And in this setting, with this premise: it ruins the show. The girls cannot be dark because that would ruin the brand. They also can\'t truly shine because that wouldn\'t be ""cute.""You end up with something that truly is: Average.

And then they graduate into the lowest category of hunters...Except that\'s not what happens. Instead, all of that is skipped, they fight in an arena at their graduation, and they become top-tier hunters right off the bat.In one episode.Another example is the literal exposition at the end of the first episode explaining how MC\'s so strong even though she wished to be average! Son of a — Let us have a JOKE!!#2: The Refusal to Tell Crimson Vow her Real Backstory-So, the MC doesn\'t want to stand out. That\'s her gimmick. But she\'s also God-tier. That\'s her problem. Her closest friends won\'t stop pestering her for her backstory. Does she A: Tell them the Truth so they can all work together to make her wishes come true, involving them in wacky hijinks that the MC has always wanted to do, but the CV think is totally normal for MC, or B: Lie her ass off and only tell her BEST FRIENDS the things that have happened to her since she got to their world.If you chose B, you watched this show... Congrats? No... So sorry.#1: The ""Idol Syndrome""-These characters are not characters; their Idols. They exist for merchandising. This is an unfortunately common problem with female characters in anime. They exist to be cute so horny men will buy their stuff. And in this setting, with this premise: it ruins the show. The girls cannot be dark because that would ruin the brand. They also can\'t truly shine because that wouldn\'t be ""cute.""You end up with something that truly is: Average.', ""Let's start by saying that I watched this in the dubbed version, and so I already know much of what I am feeling about this show relates to the version in which I watched it.Nevertheless, for me, this is what the show equates to - mehI didn't feel any kind of way about the characters. I didn't feel any kind of way about the story. I only finished it because I didn't want to bother starting a new show. I think there were just a little too many cliches and overused tropes in this story that made it feel very familiar and unoriginal to...me.I don't think I would recommend this me.I don't think I would recommend this"", 'you have to watch this super funny, full of parodies, overpowered main character anime.. yea yea.. another isekai movie, died because of truck-kun, and become overpowered.. BUT thats the whole point of this anime as it is doing funny stuff and parodies all over the episodes. The anime feels kinda like a slice of life, anime but in the last part, the story is going forward as they finally found a something to investigate.. too bad it ends right at there. hope season 2 will be announced soon! easily one of my favourite anime series of this season! super super enjoy this anime series. 9/10 ', 'Right off the bat Ive just got to say, this is an amazing series.This anime was honestly such a breath of fresh air with it being an isekai with a female main protaganist. We dont have nearly enough of those so this series was such a treat to watch. In the same vein Slice of life anime in my opinion have sort of reached a wall of originality or at least Im sort of tired of them so getting a slice of life anime about adventurer girls doing their day to day life is the perfect combination. It took my love for Isekai anime, and...my love for Slice of Life anime, and combined them making this beautiful creation.The cast is absolutely lovable and all have a quirk of some sort to give them character. Mile doesnt know about the absurdness of her powers leading to some hilarious reactions when she unleashes it, Pauline is the classic cunnning merchant and the girl you really dont want to anger as when you do you know you\'re screwed. Reina is the typical tsundere but she can still have her moments, and finally the wannabe knight girl Mavis. Not much to say on her she\'s bascially the straight man always getting left behind in which she can bring more comedy to the table. My personal favourites were Mile and Pauline which I liked equally as much as the other and couldnt decide on an absolute favourite.Comedy in this series is great. I was constantly smiling throughout the runtime of the anime and every time Mile walked up to start fighting I couldnt wait to see what she\'d do and most importantly the reactions of those around her. Luckily her party dont get used to the absurdness for a while so we get some absolutely classic reactions lol. There is some really funny reoccuring jokes throughout the series such as Mile hiding the fact that she\'s a reincarnet by saying ""Its a family secret."" everytime. The comedy in this series is just as wholesome as the series itself which made me smile throughout it all so its definitely a good comedy watch.I cant do a review of this series without talking about its OP. The OP is SOOO CATCHY!!! One thing I love about this OP and OPs of this anime season is they have some sort of quirk that makes it stand out from the rest. With this anime\'s OP its got this really funny ""Waho Waho"" that I cant stop dancing to whenever it comes on and imitating the move XD. The OP is sung by the cast which is cute and pretty standard for these types of anime but nonetheless is very enjoyable to watch and listen to. There is this one section where they have some really weird power ranger dance and I cant stop laughing everytime I see Pauline\'s dance.The art is cute and moeblob so all the girls look cute and the series immedietly gives off that wholesome slice of life vibe. Because of its wholesome content, lovable characters and really funny comedy this anime is one of the most re-watchable series Ive seen and Im happy to have more re-watchable anime for my collection.Overall absolutely loved this series. Its one of my new favourite slice of life anime and since its a fantasy Isekai with a female lead its even more re-watchable.9/10 Highly recommend to any Isekai, Comedy or Slice of Life fans wanting some cute girls doing cute things in another world. my love for Slice of Life anime, and combined them making this beautiful creation.The cast is absolutely lovable and all have a quirk of some sort to give them character.

The story of this anime was up and down sometimes good sometimes bad but, just like in the genre most of it are for comedy purposes, however, even though its comedy the story still quite caught my attention because, how the main character (or Mile) actually develops in the story, how she actually slowly shows that she is strong. And this kind of scenes really stir up my attention and likings. Really have to compliment this anime at the end it ended in such a way that you would really like for a second...season, ANDDDDD, IT ENDED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THERE IS STILL SECOND SEASON. So let us support it and have patient and wait for it. season, ANDDDDD, IT ENDED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THERE IS STILL SECOND SEASON.

The fact that this is an isekai is just a byproduct of it's light novel origins, that and it's stupid title and gimmicky premise. You can lamp shade isekai tropes all you want, it doesn't make them any less overused. Why not just have it be in a normal fantasy setting? The story doesn't even need to change, just have the main girl be so strong because she's secretly from that royal family. But then they can't make constant meta jokes about...otaku culture and other Japanese stuff.Maybe I'm just too cynical, but it's hard to come at these shows with a fresh eye every time.

However, this anime just isn't what I was expecting from the series. It seems like they completely ditched the source material when making this adaptation. Considering how good the source material was, it was extremely disappointing. Don't get me wrong, this anime is okay, it just doesn't live up to the light novel or manga. If you're...new to the series this anime would be quite enjoyable with all the comedy and the way it basically makes fun of the isekai genre.

You have to enjoy it on it's own.Overall this anime is okay, I just feel that it's missing the charm that the light novel and manga had. They cut out a lot of the backstories and details that the novels contained, and you get barely any information on Adele's (Mile's) life before she was reincarnated into this fantasy world. A lot of other side character's were just cut out of the picture entirely, like Lenny who you see for like 5 seconds.So I would recommend this series to anyone looking for a different take on the isekai genre, just not anyone who enjoyed the source material like I did.

There were lots of meta jokes pointing out how stupidly stereotypical everything happening was; these seemed to stop around episode 3 or 4, and by then I was just watching the most stereotypical isekai ever made.The story was completely lacking; there was no goal, stakes, or actual wordbuilding until the final episode. The characters were all pretty one-dimensional, the strongest of which was definitely Mile, although the ""small boob joke"" (you know the one), and her constantly breaking down...crying at every opportunity didn\'t exactly help. The boob joke has to be the most unfunny joke in anime, it\'s been reused 1000 times over, and it\'s just incredibly uncomfortable to have a 12 year old comparing her bust to a 9 year old, and this being a recurring theme in just about every episode.With the weak characters comes weak, uninspired dialogue that seems to have been copied right out of the ""stereotypical anime lines"" booklet. Ninety percent of the episode plots are predictable, and uninteresting; for example the classic ""tragic backstory"" is revealed where bandits killed a character\'s parents and such, and she hates them so much she wants to kill them. Other characters convince her killing is wrong, they cry for a little bit and the episode is over. I\'m just so incredibly uninvested I can\'t take it seriously, and it\'s painful to watch.There were things minor things I definitely appreciated about the show, but they\'re about equivalent in scale to nitpicks, so I don\'t think they\'re really worth listing out.

It was smart, funny, endlessly poking fun at overused anime tropes, a sheer joy to watch. Then it turned stupid serious for some reason. Instead of cute girls, doing cute and silly things in a fantasy world, it turned into a bog serious isekai which aside from being a mood breaker, turned the whole thing into who cares moments.  Gags that gave you lines like the above just stopped, and it would have been better if the...whole anime just stopped as well.

They get things right they get things wrong, but you just enjoy watching them on their quest.  It\'s light, fluffy and just a really nice way to kill time and treat yourself to a smile.Why was the last 1/3rd so awful. Well it kept the stupidity that was funny when played off of, from the first 2/3rds, but then instead of playing off stupidity with comedy, it tries to lay off that with seriousness, or with sad feels moments.  it just doesn\'t work. You still have the stupidly OP character who hasn\'t got any less OP and in fact gets more OP. What\'s more everything that was wrong in the world, and you could just ignore, is now shoved into your face, so you can\'t just put aside how much things cost, why they are doing things that are funny but pointless, how supporting characters go from hypercompetent to completely incompetent in their realm.  Finally you get vast swaths of ""Because that\'s the way we wrote it"", in place of actual world building.

It wasn't exactly anything new or groundbreaking concept-wise, but it knew when to use comedy at the right moments and when for when things get serious. I think the best part of it is definitely the comedy, with the many cultural references to other animes. It was silly fun. The story is unfortunately not really even there, it just seems like an episodic series of the girls going on adventures each episode with not much of a plot till the very last episode leading up to something big for next season. The art is decent, nothing special. It starts...off looking pretty with vibrant colors and well-designed characters, then kinda goes a little downhill by the end of the season. The characters work well together, all blending with their different personalities and them building upon their friendship while Mile still hasn't told them about how she is reincarnated, but they suspect something is up.

It\'s essentially slice-of-life with half-bothered storylines. Which is always fine and fun, of course, but makes it rather lackluster as it\'s not strong with its comedic flair or even its moe factor.-STORY (2)Basic premise, basic writing, and I\'m definitely not going to read the light novel after watching this. For starters, the worldbuilding is seemingly hardly constructed -- interesting, yes, but the way the writing\'s gone about things is so speedy that I imagine the light novel didn\'t expect to last longer than a handful of simple character introduction/resolution...arcs, and then had to think of a deeper story.And (very vague spoiler) that stuff at the end when Mile is struggling with a particular thing... yeah, no, that\'s dumb and completely so outta-left-field that one couldn\'t genuinely consider it moving, exciting, or of any benefit to have included. They tried to brush it off with a comedic stroke and couldn\'t even achieve that..ART (7)I\'m being kind as the series went off-model a LOT (from the smallest detail to something as obvious as Mile\'s twintails). But at the same time, their CG horses were amazing and I love them.The watercolor-like backdrops were also nice, but at times they failed to keep it consistent; one moment it\'s clear, average animation, then the next it\'s well-toned watercolor blending animation. I\'d have preferred they ditched the concept if they weren\'t willing to keep it consistent since it\'s an effect I favor..SOUND (7)Only watched the English Dub as I\'m not picky. The sound seemed solid with only one line being lackluster throughout (and a few pacing issues as with any dub), and the volume and quality of voices and sfx was pretty chill.

Both are CGDCT shows, meaning the focus are the (cute) girls doing whatever they find it fun and enjoyable. But unlike Bofuri which not only had better animation and overall better production value and story direction, this show apparently made quite a turn from the source material and ended up doing its own things. After a quick research I found out the anime production folks took all the liberties they wanted to make the show...in their view, all while it\'s supposed to have a bit darker and serious undertone, so that explained a lot of things.What they did with the anime adaptation was different, and when the anime come face to face with the abrupt change of tone and treat the whole thing with a joke I couldn\'t take it anymore.

Just as the lost are at the mercy of their memories.The harem genre is a tricky topic to discuss. The concept of numerous women flocking over a single man labels it as men’s wish fulfillment. And when you get down to it, it’s true. Harem animes are fun to watch because of the selection of girls tailor-fit for every man and the possibilities with each one (if the show’s plot direction and runtime allows it). But with all the testosterone-induced enjoyment, most harem shows lack substance, use too many cliches that sell, and allow little room for...developed relationships with other characters. As fidelity and modern cultural practices dictate, the guy can only choose one.But what if the guy already made a choice, yet felt a need to continue his search...White Album is a cold and somber take on the reality of romance and career as well as how the past can delude the present. It’s definitely one of the harder shows to watch because of the sheer amount of infidelity, indecisiveness, and emotional restraint among the characters. It hit me on multiple occasions, but I bit the bullet and kept going. In the end, I was far from disappointed. It manages not only to resolve the plot and characters but also to justify actions and intents given the show’s genre and framework.This review covers the entirety of White Album. And other than its name, this show draws no references from The Beatles’ White Album. It’s a cool shout-out nonetheless.STORY - 10Touya Fujii, a humble man of unrefined tastes, has been dating rising star, Yuki Morikawa since high school ended. From then on, everything stands in the way between the two. No shipping. No wish fulfillment. No mercy. The main character unknowingly starts a harem, but this time the plot turns it on its head and he ends up going for all the prospects while still maintaining attachment to the first girl.With this in mind, there are three key things which the story has going for it. Setting, natural uncertainty, and an ending that makes sense.The setting says a lot in White Album. For one thing, the show takes place AFTER high school for a change. With the way Touya and Yuki finally got together after their high school years, White Album shows what happens after that. ‘I have the girl, now what?’ It’s a scenario often overlooked by most romance animes out there. What makes matters more difficult is the nature of Yuki’s profession as an idol singer. Idols have fans, connections, managers, and a production studio with a tight schedule to boot. The balance between career and relationship plays out. Knowing that we always want the best for our significant other, giving each other space and time to follow their passions is easier said than done. The distance may be a common problem relationships today face but White Album takes it up a notch with its time frame.Welcome back to 1986: a time when the Internet was unnecessary, radios were the only gateway to music, cellphones were rare, phone booths were abundant, and letters and answering machines were the closest thing to text messages. Not only is White Album’s time frame detailed, it also complements the show’s storyline to a tee. The resulting social dynamic is amazing; giving communication and face-to-face contact more value and meaning. Every successful phone call and meeting becomes a blessing, while every answering machine message is tinged with undertones of doubt, worry, and paranoia. Anyone can do anything behind people’s backs without letting them know; in the same way an unanswered phone call or letter can give anyone a reason to be more suspicious. Factor in everyone’s independent activities and schedules, and we have a setting that reinforces the unfaithful tendencies of the characters.In terms of plot progression, the show is really streamlined. Though the main focus is Touya, White Album’s narrative goes through the motions of everyone’s usual business. Some people are in the idol industry, some attend university, some go through various odd jobs, some are still in high school, and some have their own hobbies to pass the time. Character actions are as natural as wanting to go out with anyone during your own free time and convenience. Anything can happen and everyone is a catalyst. That’s what kept me glued to the show besides how the relationships work. The amount of uncertainty with the characters’ freedom and independence from the plot made White Album more refreshing and spontaneous. The pacing is relaxed to the point of slice-of-life’s standards, albeit more drab and lonely as life past 20 can get, with childhood recollections and the ending credits after every episode being the show’s brighter and more ephemeral moments.I don’t have to explain how a good ending affects a show. But in White Album’s case, it ties everything in a neat, little bow. By the end, I just had to applaud the story for resolving everything and everybody in the best and most coherent way possible while making sense of all the controversial acts done in the course of the show. I had no qualms. I had no questions. And I felt great after.ART - 8White Album’s animation is of above average quality with seldom fluid motion since stage performances and action sequences are few and far between. Characters stand out with clear outlines, splotches of light and shadow adding depth. Other than that, colors of the characters are generally flat to supplement the simple palette of the background.One glaring factor with the art for White Album is its creative use of varying degrees of watercolor in its background design to depict suburban melancholia fitting the adolescent look of the cast, giving a more mature tone to the series. Add in the noticeable shifts in animation style during the more powerful scenes and flashbacks and the show really looks like an album or gallery. During these transitions, the watercolor treatment is intensified; modifying character designs and at most, reducing the entire scene to a flurry of brush strokes with choppy animation. On one hand, it could be a cop-out for the animators, but on the other, it adds artistic flair to contrast the dreariness of the show's reality with the influx of the characters’ emotions.SOUND - 8The OP and ED for both seasons fit the show lyrically and thematically, but just don’t leave a lasting impression for me. And then I heard this show had idols which slightly raised my doubts about how I’ll perceive the sound for this show.I ended up downloading “White Album” and “Sound of Destiny” which are the signature songs of the main idol heroines, Yuki and Rina, respectively.It’s the seiyuus, BGM composers and the idols who are the stars of the sound department. Aya Hirano (Yuki) and Nana Mizuki (Rina) along with the other seiyuus did an astounding job in illustrating a disillusioned cast of individuals trying to get by during the late 80’s.The BGM composers took hint of character themes in White Album and made a solid effort in translating these to music. We have some double-bass driven slow jazz representing Frank Nagase and his swanky equipment, electric guitar wails coming from Eiji’s misunderstood rock background, classical piano and string pieces for Misaki and Akira’s classical literature and theater prowess, and dissonant piano editing for the mysterious Yayoi, to name some.As for the idol’s songs, I’m glad the composers and producers made it suitable for the given time frame. They still have the usual J-pop approach but with a more funky and R&B-ish inflection with 80’s style synths and guitar-work as well as the trademark saxophone of the show’s self-titled song. Live renditions of the songs during performances with added instrumentation and acoustics are also thrown in to further enhance the sonic experience of the show. The tracklist overall (besides the OP and ED) is a catchy and passionate nod to the previous generation of pop music.CHARACTER - 10Let’s get archetypes out of the way first. We have the dense five-timer Touya, the all-too-sweet shrinking violet Yuki, Ms. Independent Rina, weird and sporty Haruka, tsundere loli Mana, motherly and capable Misaki, best bud Akira, cold and empty Yayoi, control freak big bro Eiji, uptight tiger mother Kanzaki, carefree bad girl Menou, and quiet shopkeeper Frank.With that said, plot happens and all these random individuals gain a new side to them, supported by later developments and intertwining backstories that logically influence who they are now. Nobody’s good. Nobody’s bad. Nobody’s perfect. And everyone’s misguided in one way or another. It’s these kinds of developments which flesh out the cast as people co-existing in an interesting web of relationships, instead of categorizing them to play a fixed role.Sometimes the best bud gets jealous, other times he’s cool. Sometimes Ms. Independent could be more dependent than you realize. Sometimes the shrinking violet can’t hold in her anxiety. And sometimes you can't help pity the cold and empty.As with the natural uncertainty of the plot, there’s a lot of gray area with the characters. You feel like rooting for everyone to cope with what the plot throws at them. And when they finally get through, you can confidently say they changed for the better. There are no open ends and everybody exits the stage in an orderly fashion. White Album has an abundance of relatable and well-rounded characters that change, develop, and find resolve when the curtains close. It doesn't feel like they’re in a story. It feels like we’re in their story.ENJOYMENT - 9Initially the star couple, Touya and Yuki, caught my attention and I thought it was going to be their love story. And in the course of White Album until it ended, I was reminded that it was never about their love story. It was about their relationship. It was about everybody’s relationships. Never have I seen the social aspect portrayed so well in an anime before. I enjoyed how everything played out and how personal it felt to watch them deal with it.Infidelity can be seen as a show of weakness; filling the void left by someone who means more to you than everyone you try to replace her with. You give in to anyone who shows compassion when all you wish for is the best for others and yourself. You keep yourself sane while she’s busy with her priorities, better off not knowing. Lying and hiding suddenly seem like the right thing to do.And then she starts to wonder why you don’t miss her as much as she does.What do you feel? Alienated by the very person you felt the most comfortable with. You forgot why you loved each other in the first place; to be reminded time and time again by your memories together.Before I get any more sentimental...OVERALL - 9Painful but rewarding, White Album is a harem gone wrong in the best way possible that describes the struggles any relationship goes through and the different ways we cope with those struggles, no matter how counter-intuitive they seem.It offers an unpredictable cast of characters, shaky relationships, an authentic blast from the past, a darker side of the idol industry, slightly unconventional animation techniques, an anthem of a heartfelt pop song, and a story that ends right. developed relationships with other characters. As fidelity and modern cultural practices dictate, the guy can only choose one.But what if the guy already made a choice, yet felt a need to continue his search...White Album is a cold and somber take on the reality of romance and career as well as how the past can delude the present.

Add in the noticeable shifts in animation style during the more powerful scenes and flashbacks and the show really looks like an album or gallery. During these transitions, the watercolor treatment is intensified; modifying character designs and at most, reducing the entire scene to a flurry of brush strokes with choppy animation. On one hand, it could be a cop-out for the animators, but on the other, it adds artistic flair to contrast the dreariness of the show's reality with the influx of the characters’ emotions.SOUND - 8The OP and ED for both seasons fit the show lyrically and thematically, but just don’t leave a lasting impression for me. And then I heard this show had idols which slightly raised my doubts about how I’ll perceive the sound for this show.I ended up downloading “White Album” and “Sound of Destiny” which are the signature songs of the main idol heroines, Yuki and Rina, respectively.It’s the seiyuus, BGM composers and the idols who are the stars of the sound department. Aya Hirano (Yuki) and Nana Mizuki (Rina) along with the other seiyuus did an astounding job in illustrating a disillusioned cast of individuals trying to get by during the late 80’s.The BGM composers took hint of character themes in White Album and made a solid effort in translating these to music. We have some double-bass driven slow jazz representing Frank Nagase and his swanky equipment, electric guitar wails coming from Eiji’s misunderstood rock background, classical piano and string pieces for Misaki and Akira’s classical literature and theater prowess, and dissonant piano editing for the mysterious Yayoi, to name some.As for the idol’s songs, I’m glad the composers and producers made it suitable for the given time frame. They still have the usual J-pop approach but with a more funky and R&B-ish inflection with 80’s style synths and guitar-work as well as the trademark saxophone of the show’s self-titled song. Live renditions of the songs during performances with added instrumentation and acoustics are also thrown in to further enhance the sonic experience of the show. The tracklist overall (besides the OP and ED) is a catchy and passionate nod to the previous generation of pop music.CHARACTER - 10Let’s get archetypes out of the way first. We have the dense five-timer Touya, the all-too-sweet shrinking violet Yuki, Ms. Independent Rina, weird and sporty Haruka, tsundere loli Mana, motherly and capable Misaki, best bud Akira, cold and empty Yayoi, control freak big bro Eiji, uptight tiger mother Kanzaki, carefree bad girl Menou, and quiet shopkeeper Frank.With that said, plot happens and all these random individuals gain a new side to them, supported by later developments and intertwining backstories that logically influence who they are now. Nobody’s good. Nobody’s bad. Nobody’s perfect. And everyone’s misguided in one way or another. It’s these kinds of developments which flesh out the cast as people co-existing in an interesting web of relationships, instead of categorizing them to play a fixed role.Sometimes the best bud gets jealous, other times he’s cool. Sometimes Ms. Independent could be more dependent than you realize. Sometimes the shrinking violet can’t hold in her anxiety. And sometimes you can't help pity the cold and empty.As with the natural uncertainty of the plot, there’s a lot of gray area with the characters. You feel like rooting for everyone to cope with what the plot throws at them. And when they finally get through, you can confidently say they changed for the better. There are no open ends and everybody exits the stage in an orderly fashion. White Album has an abundance of relatable and well-rounded characters that change, develop, and find resolve when the curtains close. It doesn't feel like they’re in a story. It feels like we’re in their story.ENJOYMENT - 9Initially the star couple, Touya and Yuki, caught my attention and I thought it was going to be their love story. And in the course of White Album until it ended, I was reminded that it was never about their love story. It was about their relationship. It was about everybody’s relationships. Never have I seen the social aspect portrayed so well in an anime before. I enjoyed how everything played out and how personal it felt to watch them deal with it.Infidelity can be seen as a show of weakness; filling the void left by someone who means more to you than everyone you try to replace her with. You give in to anyone who shows compassion when all you wish for is the best for others and yourself. You keep yourself sane while she’s busy with her priorities, better off not knowing. Lying and hiding suddenly seem like the right thing to do.And then she starts to wonder why you don’t miss her as much as she does.What do you feel? Alienated by the very person you felt the most comfortable with. You forgot why you loved each other in the first place; to be reminded time and time again by your memories together.Before I get any more sentimental...OVERALL - 9Painful but rewarding, White Album is a harem gone wrong in the best way possible that describes the struggles any relationship goes through and the different ways we cope with those struggles, no matter how counter-intuitive they seem.It offers an unpredictable cast of characters, shaky relationships, an authentic blast from the past, a darker side of the idol industry, slightly unconventional animation techniques, an anthem of a heartfelt pop song, and a story that ends right."", 'This is one of the most overrated anime I\'ve ever seen.  I picked it up because I\'d heard good things about it.  Like most anime, I tried to go in completely blind, so as to avoid any spoilers and get the full ""First Timer"" experience.  I had no idea that this was a show based off of a dating sim, or I probably would have picked up on that it was going to be utterly horrible from the beginning.But I didn\'t, and by the time I realized what kind of story this was going to be, I was a good seven episodes...in.  So I figured, may as well finish the story, right?  That was such a torturous idea.  Twenty-six episodes of horrible characters with no redeemable qualities, all constantly falling over one another to get banged by Sir-Cheats-a-Lot.  By the end of the show I was genuinely impressed that he hadn\'t laid moves on every character in the entire show, with the exception of the completely untouchable incel friend.None of the plot made any real sense and the entire thing just seemed to be ""How can a bunch of people be as pretentious as possible, while still allowing MC to bang everything that moves?""This was an entire waste of time, and every human being is better off skipping it.  The fact that people took so much time and effort to beautifully animate such a completely trash plotline and character base is beyond me. in.  So I figured, may as well finish the story, right?

With the change of directors, White Album took a different direction with were it went. First of all, they resolved all of the unimportant subplots from the first season quickly (as quick as the show can be..). Then, they replaced it with a few more subplots, which was tied more to the main conflict. Even then, they didn\'t side track as much as the first season. This was a great choice on part of the production team. The story for this season, was more spread out....It wasn\'t just about Touya, it gave some other characters screen time as well. As a result, I actually felt invested in the drama involving the other characters. Though, all of this is pulled down by really slow pacing. I seriously thought this season was a tad bit more slower than the first season. I was still asking myself ""when is this episode going to be over?"", and I wished they could have improved the pacing. Also, the ending also lowered my opinion for the show. While it was satisfying on a certain level, I felt like the twist at the end was out of left field. Maybe it was foreshadowed, and I just couldn\'t see it. Even then, I think the twist was ridiculous. Plus, it felt anti climatic, it made all of the build up, wasted. So, with all of the let downs, the story of the second season of White Album was mediocre.CHARACTERSThis is where things are a big ""meh"". Well, Touya is still an idiot, but I have to admit. He changes, and sees his flaws as a person, and for that I have to give credit for. Now, why do I still hate him as a character. It\'s because while he did go through some kind of development in the first season, that was all  thrown away. What he ""learned"" at the end of the first season was lost, and he ends up stumbling and making the same mistakes as before. Which is also why this season got weighted down. Now, as for the rest of the characters. Since they got some decent screen time, I actually cared about few of them. Yuki and Rina both were interesting, at many points. I liked Yuki in the second season, because they showcased her conflict (Somewhat). I felt like her conflict about what was more important in her life something that could be relatable. Though, she has a fair share of times I felt that she needed a slap. Rina, was an already interesting character from the first season, and she  keeps on being an interesting character. Though, she also has a few ""I want to slap you"" moments. Plus, Rina and Yuki had a believable friendship. I really felt for the drama and tension between the two.  As for the rest of Touya\'s whores, they weren\'t in the show as a romantic interests, but I still found a couple of them as ""throw away characters"". Though, Mana\'s little subplot was interesting, and I was surprised to how she was connected to everything else. Overall, a huge improvement, but still lacking in many ways.ANIMATIONAlso an improvement, was the animation. While it\'s only average, there were a few scenes that were animated well enough. The lighting also improved. While in the first season, things were always dark and grey. Seven Arcs actually drew the lights shining on the characters. Well, it\'s still nothing special. The lip sync during the small music segments, was better than I thought they would be. (Still crappy anime lip sync.) As, I said a few times in this section, it\'s an improvement, but it\'s average.SOUNDI don\'t think anything here was changed, I still felt like the ost wasforgettable. The pop songs, while good, aren\'t seen much. Also, I have to complain about this. I don\'t think they ever played the song White Album in this season at all. If you aren\'t going to play the song at all, then why is your show named White Album. As a result the song comes off as an afterthought. I like the use of the song Powder Snow, because it was meaningful to the story, and I like the song. (Though I like the version sung by WA 2\'s Setsuna more.) Overall, not much change here.OVERALLOverall, I feel like this season was pretty decent. It improved in most areas, but it\'s still brought down some of the same problems from the first season. I don\'t regret watching this season, but I\'m hard press to say you NEED to see this. You would have to sit through the first season to get to this, and I don\'t think that\'s worth the time. Though, I would recommend you watch the indirect sequel, White Album 2 over the original. (Not White Album second season. That\'s the show I\'ve been reviewing.).

The story itself was a good idea that may be able to make up a good romance story but the actions of the characters were so bad that at some point I just gave up trying to understand what they were trying to do. However, the OSTs and music were one of the best i heard, especially the songs that the idols perform.

It had an artistic vibe, great soundtrack, somewhat interesting plot. But what it...lacked the most was direction.

It just lacked direction and it's identity as an anime and not as a game."", ""The key issue this show has is a problem of perspective. In my review of the first season, I stated that what let it down was its protagonist, referring to Touya as an instance of a Visual Novel protagonist where the player made all the stupidest choices. After this second season, this has cemented itself. In fact, Touya's ability to make decisions (and, honestly, just his sense of self-control) spirals even further down, and it makes it difficult to engage with the story at times; our protagonist becomes increasingly difficult to sympathise with, and as such any happy ending feels unearned.The thing that makes...this more difficult is also the thing that keeps the show afloat despite him; basically any other character would have been a better protagonist. Because, to be honest, I really like almost everyone else in the cast. The majority of the primary cast of love interests are all interesting, with distinct motivations and desires, who make interesting choices, and while they're not always the best choices, they feel solid and relatable. As such, when we see where they end up at the end of their stories, it's a lot more satisfying than Touya, and I can't help but wonder how much better the show would be if one of them were the focus;A story not about some aimless loser (and serial cheater) with no real drive, but...A show about the friendship between two Idols; the upstart rookie and the successful starA story about a musician with a secret, who's trying to work out what she wants in her life, and starting to question whether she's following that dream at all.A high-school student with a complicated home life, trying to work out how to relate to her family.And these stories are there, and they're what makes this show work better than it deserves to be. But every time something compelling happens in their story, Touya is there to remind us that this story is more about some guy's weird relationship hang-ups. It's a shame, because I really do think this could have been a really good story. And I'm also not saying I didn't enjoy it; like I say, the things that are good are there, and are compelling.Plenty of shows have shoddy protagonists but make up for it with strong supporting casts. But, here, while it does a little to make up for Touya's pitfalls, it still isn't quite enough to make it great. this more difficult is also the thing that keeps the show afloat despite him; basically any other character would have been a better protagonist.

On one hand, you have a setting that is hardly ever used in anime - the mid \'80s, which means most of the convenience of today\'s life is missing. In one of the episodes this season, they even go out of their way to show how ""portable phones"" looked like back then! The art style really fits that period, and so do the clothing and cars and everything shown, and the way idols are depicted is nostalgic-they were just great singers with a bit more charisma. You also have something equally as rarely depicted, the challenges of...dating someone famous!On the other hand, you have a convoluted story at times, and what i consider to be, so far, the worst MC in any anime i watched.I previously mentioned charisma, and i feel like this guy is missing any of it. He somehow, while not being well spoken or showing wit in dialogues or actions, gets everyone to fall for him. He cheats his girlfriend with more women over the course of both seasons, and somehow. even when the girls find out, they still are ok with it.What makes the show worth going  through for me are the secondary characters (shoutout to Haruka, best girl ever) and the music and animation, but the story of a boring, good looking guy who cheats his way to the finish and gets away with it really drags the whole show down a lot. dating someone famous!On the other hand, you have a convoluted story at times, and what i consider to be, so far, the worst MC in any anime i watched.I previously mentioned charisma, and i feel like this guy is missing any of it.

Which is an anime about a man who\'s girlfriend is part of the idol business. He is confused and is trying to fill a void in his life. While making dumb decisions while involving people he loves or respects. As the story goes on.We get to see more of Touya fall right back into his dumb decisions except seem more unjustified then season 1. As well as Yuki trying to push through and try to rise in the idol business. For a friends promise. As well as a new surprise...following the Ogita business. Over all the narrative is still the same as the last season except easier to follow with more surprises, and more characters being fleshed out.I don\'t want to spoil to much about it.Art/Animation 7:The animation seems a little better then season 1.Sountrack/Music 8:The opening and ending themes are great. Especially Yuki and Rina\'s vocals.Characters 8:This is the season\'s strength. This season covers and fleshes out more of the pre-established characters of season 1. I can\'t say much because I don\'t want to spoil the characters. There are some flaws like Yuki and Touya but if you want to know check the spoilers at the bottom.Cons compared to season 1:Through most of this season Touya becomes more unlikable and less justified compared to season 1. In season 1 he is both liked and hated because you could understand and justify his reasoning. Even if you don\'t agree or like his reasoning. But in season 2 you know what he is doing but now you lose more reason to agree with him. In this season he just seems more like a leech then confused man in most cases.Then the last episode comes in and sort fixes that problem (some what). But the explanation reinforces him more as a pitiful character which does suit him if you watched through both seasons and listened to his father (check the spoilers at the bottom if you want to know what I am talking about).Pro\'s compared to season 1:The context of this season is easier to follow then season 1 even though there are still parts where you will have to remember and wait to be answered later on in the season. Such as Touya\'s fathers memory/flashback.Also more characters get fleshed out and developed.Over all:I really enjoyed the anime but as far as the main character goes he is more unjustified in this season(sort of). Don\'t drop this anime just because the main character gives you a headache. The characters and what follows on in the rest of this season is more then enough to keep watching. Watching what the Ogita siblings have to deal with in this season, as well as seeing more Mana and her family, and Touya\'s father(one of the best characters) is worth it. There\'s more but those are a few examples.While the ending itself clears up Touya\'s reasoning for what he does. I feel like the end of result of the reasoning wasn\'t fair to Yuki and what she had to endure because of his screw ups. Also I wish there was more consequence for Touya. Over all I rate this season a 7 and I rate the anime a 7.5 out of 10. For anyone confused about the reason why Touya acted the way he did proceed to the bottom for spoilers(If you watched and finished the anime but didn\'t get his reasoning).Spoilers vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv Spoiler warningThe last episode is the reason why Touya made all those stupid decisions was because he regret throwing away a special present from a special girl. Before we discuss the reason for his dumb decisions lets learn more about Touya. We get more context on Touya and his character. As well as the view point from his father. Which are key to understanding Touya and his relationship with his dad and as well the way he acts.Through seasons 1 and 2 we see Touya\'s father act more aggressive and negative towards his son but that\'s because he sees Touya as a kid even now as an adult. As a kid Touya acted more of a cry baby, seem to have low self esteem, and seemed like cowardly child. This is what I gathered when I watched the series as well as what his father thinks of him and feels about him. There is a flash back of Touya, Yuki, and Haruka as little kids and long story short they deal with bullies. After this you see Touya crying. That\'s where Yuki comes in after Touya\'s father asked her to support and help his son.Touya\'s father knew that his son had a fragile heart. So he wanted Yuki to support, watch over, and help his son because he was worried about him(it\'s referenced through some of his fathers memories and flashbacks of him talking to Yuki about his son.) Yuki goes and gives a medal to Touya that says good job. Touya throws away the medal. Then his dad told him it was a gift for him and that he didn\'t understand her feelings.After this Touya went to look for it with a sad look on his face. To him it was a special present that came from a young girls heart and he just threw it away like trash. He spent hours and hours looking for it but never found it. Not long after Yuki movied far away. So he was never able to thank her for what she did and he never saw her again or so he thought.Ever since then he\'s been regretting it and it shaped him as the person he is now. Who thought more about girl\'s feelings but also still had a fragile heart and thought more using his feelings instead of his. As he grew he ends up finding Yuki again in high school. But he didn\'t remember her nor thought she was the same little girl that gave her the medal all those years ago. As he was heading towards college his mother died.The passing of his mother upset Touya\'s father very much but not as much as Touya himself. He saw how it was going to hold back Touya and how it was dragging him down even more. So his father kicked him out of the house and got him his own place. This was done in order to try to make Touya tougher to push him and make him focus more on college. As well as trying to get him to be more independent instead of moping and focusing on his mothers death.Through the rest of the series you get hints of his father helping his son, showing disappointment, and showing concern for him right until his death. Now that we understand Touya let\'s talk about Touya\'s reasoning for his dumb decisions.

Also Rina realizes she lost to Yuki and left. Anyways that\'s all I can say. Send me a pm if you have any questions.It\'s still a good anime. following the Ogita business. Over all the narrative is still the same as the last season except easier to follow with more surprises, and more characters being fleshed out.I don\'t want to spoil to much about it.Art/Animation 7:The animation seems a little better then season 1.Sountrack/Music 8:The opening and ending themes are great. Especially Yuki and Rina\'s vocals.Characters 8:This is the season\'s strength. This season covers and fleshes out more of the pre-established characters of season 1. I can\'t say much because I don\'t want to spoil the characters. There are some flaws like Yuki and Touya but if you want to know check the spoilers at the bottom.Cons compared to season 1:Through most of this season Touya becomes more unlikable and less justified compared to season 1. In season 1 he is both liked and hated because you could understand and justify his reasoning. Even if you don\'t agree or like his reasoning. But in season 2 you know what he is doing but now you lose more reason to agree with him. In this season he just seems more like a leech then confused man in most cases.Then the last episode comes in and sort fixes that problem (some what). But the explanation reinforces him more as a pitiful character which does suit him if you watched through both seasons and listened to his father (check the spoilers at the bottom if you want to know what I am talking about).Pro\'s compared to season 1:The context of this season is easier to follow then season 1 even though there are still parts where you will have to remember and wait to be answered later on in the season. Such as Touya\'s fathers memory/flashback.Also more characters get fleshed out and developed.Over all:I really enjoyed the anime but as far as the main character goes he is more unjustified in this season(sort of). Don\'t drop this anime just because the main character gives you a headache. The characters and what follows on in the rest of this season is more then enough to keep watching. Watching what the Ogita siblings have to deal with in this season, as well as seeing more Mana and her family, and Touya\'s father(one of the best characters) is worth it. There\'s more but those are a few examples.While the ending itself clears up Touya\'s reasoning for what he does. I feel like the end of result of the reasoning wasn\'t fair to Yuki and what she had to endure because of his screw ups. Also I wish there was more consequence for Touya. Over all I rate this season a 7 and I rate the anime a 7.5 out of 10. For anyone confused about the reason why Touya acted the way he did proceed to the bottom for spoilers(If you watched and finished the anime but didn\'t get his reasoning).Spoilers vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv Spoiler warningThe last episode is the reason why Touya made all those stupid decisions was because he regret throwing away a special present from a special girl. Before we discuss the reason for his dumb decisions lets learn more about Touya. We get more context on Touya and his character. As well as the view point from his father. Which are key to understanding Touya and his relationship with his dad and as well the way he acts.Through seasons 1 and 2 we see Touya\'s father act more aggressive and negative towards his son but that\'s because he sees Touya as a kid even now as an adult. As a kid Touya acted more of a cry baby, seem to have low self esteem, and seemed like cowardly child. This is what I gathered when I watched the series as well as what his father thinks of him and feels about him. There is a flash back of Touya, Yuki, and Haruka as little kids and long story short they deal with bullies. After this you see Touya crying. That\'s where Yuki comes in after Touya\'s father asked her to support and help his son.Touya\'s father knew that his son had a fragile heart. So he wanted Yuki to support, watch over, and help his son because he was worried about him(it\'s referenced through some of his fathers memories and flashbacks of him talking to Yuki about his son.) Yuki goes and gives a medal to Touya that says good job. Touya throws away the medal. Then his dad told him it was a gift for him and that he didn\'t understand her feelings.After this Touya went to look for it with a sad look on his face. To him it was a special present that came from a young girls heart and he just threw it away like trash. He spent hours and hours looking for it but never found it. Not long after Yuki movied far away. So he was never able to thank her for what she did and he never saw her again or so he thought.Ever since then he\'s been regretting it and it shaped him as the person he is now. Who thought more about girl\'s feelings but also still had a fragile heart and thought more using his feelings instead of his. As he grew he ends up finding Yuki again in high school. But he didn\'t remember her nor thought she was the same little girl that gave her the medal all those years ago. As he was heading towards college his mother died.The passing of his mother upset Touya\'s father very much but not as much as Touya himself. He saw how it was going to hold back Touya and how it was dragging him down even more. So his father kicked him out of the house and got him his own place. This was done in order to try to make Touya tougher to push him and make him focus more on college. As well as trying to get him to be more independent instead of moping and focusing on his mothers death.Through the rest of the series you get hints of his father helping his son, showing disappointment, and showing concern for him right until his death. Now that we understand Touya let\'s talk about Touya\'s reasoning for his dumb decisions. ""It all started with him as a kid throwing away a medal that was given to him as a present and to make him feel better. It was a special present that came from a young girls feelings and he just threw it away like trash"". After that he spent hours looking for it but never found it.Then Yuki moved away and he thought he was never going to see nor thank her and apologize. ""He regretted it and decided to think more about girls/women feelings"". This is the reason why he made those stupid decisions. He wanted to fill the void with that regret he made as a kid while also thinking about those people\'s feelings. The problem is he fell in love and started forgetting about Yuki.While I understand how something from your childhood can effect you long term. I feel that Yuki went through too much pain just because of his dumb decisions. In the end there was no consequence for him cheating. Thankfully he realizes that he screwed up.

GENERAL CRITIQUES OF THE OVERALL PLOT CAN BE FOUND IN MY REVIEW FOR THE FIRST SEASON]I'm glad that White Album 2nd Season came out because I believed that the first season could have delivered more than it did. The most important thing about White Album: 2nd Season is that it brought much-needed context (the whole Menou Matsuyama, Yuki Morikawa and Touya Fujii connection) that brought clarification to several plot holes. It even managed to tie in Fujii's father, making the latter a more important character than was originally established. Although Eiji Ogata's painting fiasco brought about...some questions, I did feel as if it was a nice reflective point that brought a different level in the anime. All of these things, aside from several unravellings (with regard to relationships) that occurred, were significant in the sense that they capitalized on the mature themes of this particular anime. While I didn't come out of this anime fully convinced, it did manage to exceed my expectations (hence the higher rating for this season).Props to several songs, Koi iro Sora, Powder Snow, and Shishido Rumi's Secret Chaos. some questions, I did feel as if it was a nice reflective point that brought a different level in the anime.

Though the genre of Anime was not known at all at that time, Attack No.1 used to air with german dub throughout the 90's on german television. It is funny to see that hardly anybody seems to know it here, though most of 10-30 year old Germans have watched the series.The story is rather old nowadays, young girl joins high school volleyball team, as she gets better and better she does make some friends but also some enemies. As she plays her...way up to the world championships, new friends and new funny volleyball techniques show up.

Or as it was known to me and my fellow German speakers in the 90s, Mila Superstar.Before Sailor Moon, before Dragonball, before Pokemon and Digimon...there was Mila. This was in more ways than one my entry drug into the world of anime.While it is rather rough around the edges when you look at it today (I mean it was made in the 60s for crying out loud) but it still had all those tropes I would later come to love/hate in anime.

An underdog story with a rival bully who becomes your BFF by the end, ridiculous superpowers and the melodramatic nail biting thrills of...Volleyball. Sure there were no world ending stakes, but it I'll be damned if it didn't FEEL like the world would end whenever Mila was at the face of defeat. Every time she screamed and cried, my little 5 year old self screamed and cried along. The show had a passion that I was not used to seeing in any other show.And unlike shounen, Attack No.1 had a cast that was comprised mainly of girl characters. Surprisingly well written girl characters. A sad rarity even to this day. Mila's main concerns weren't boy troubles or looking pretty, she was a goddamn athlete. She had a dream, and my god, she was gonna live that dream if it killed her. shounen cliches you'd expect.

That\'s probably one of the reasons why I was fascinated by the tale of the courageous Mila(that was the protagonist Kozue\'s name in German), a fragile girl on a journey to overcome her health issues to become the best volleyball player there is. The theme was rather dark at times, so to...me it was a completely different experience compared to the action packed American animation shows. That said, there was enough action to be found, I remember being quite surprised as to how interesting watching something like volleyball could be and my younger self got quite invested in the sometimes episode length volleyball matches.I never was a sports guy and watching sports events on TV felt boring and dull to me, especially if it wasn\'t something like car-racing for example, where at any minute there could be a fabulous crash, I didn\'t really think about the consequences of human life\'s ruined or lost by such accidents as a kid. However in Attack No.1 there were also accidents but they were much more intimate and it had a lot of ""put your life on the line"" scenes, like most Anime after and probably before it. I don\'t want to spoil too much about the story though, not that I really could as I was watching this anime almost 3 decades ago and am planning on re-watching it in the near future.So what\'s it all about? Kozue is a transfer student at the start of the Anime and quickly finds her way into the schools volleyball team, impressing the coach with her innate talent, that naturally brings about some rivalry with the current top dog in the team. Kozue finds herself challenged by balancing school, social life and sports from the get go. Trying to make friends at a new school and also training to make her mark as a top volleyball player, while not failing in school is no easy task after all. In the later episodes, when Kozue grows up, we also see romance unfold but I can\'t go into much detail here, from what I remember it was a love triangle story of sorts, nothing special but still enjoyable I guess. So, yeah, besides Kozue\'s injuries and her fight to be accepted by her peers, there was more than enough drama to be found.I wouldn\'t consider Attack No.1 to be the perfect Anime but you will probably not regret finding the time to watch a 100+ action and drama packed episodes of Kozue\'s way to the top. She\'s truly a great main character but by no means perfect which makes her struggles all the more relatable in my opinion. me it was a completely different experience compared to the action packed American animation shows.

I find it admirable though that the manga and Anime are apparently based on the the fact that the women team of Japan won the Olympics (?) a few years prior to it's release. So this Anime is a sort of celebration for this win at the time.Once again, this Anime is very old so the artstyle and the music aren't what you would probably like...to see and hear today and the character writing is more superficial and stereotypical at times too. We have the bully who becomes the best friend of Ayuhara, our main girl, and at times the story can feel a bit ridiculous when we get to the points of extreme bullying and certain scenarios which just look a bit unrealistic at times.What I did like a lot about Attack No. 1 though is that we see Ayuhara developing her skills over a couple of years instead of just one year in high school and see how she fights and makes it big in the end. We start in the second year of junior-high-school with national tournaments and are by the end at her second year in High School where she's presenting All Japan internationally. Whilst I don't know how realistic the techniques are that they use, things like Trinity Attacks and Balloon Spikes were really fun to watch too.Older Anime easily get forgotten these days due to all the new stuff coming out each season but if you ever have time, I'd recommend trying this show out. to see and hear today and the character writing is more superficial and stereotypical at times too.

Blue Thermal,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49665/Blue_Thermal,"[""Blue Thermal, at least this movie adaptation, tried its very best to deliver an engaging and wide-ranging plot centered around a first-year undergrad. The result, however, leaves much to be desired. If you have come expecting a very emotional experience, it would be wise to hold back some of those expectations yourself. This is not a sports-themed anime. It seems to fit into the slice-of-life category, but even I would stillIn short, the movie starts with a very enticing narrative of a Tsuru Tamaki who broke a glider and was initially encouraged to join the aviation club as an act of penance. The premise itself...should have been more than enough to bribe you into watching this movie.Despite the interesting premise, the characters of this movie, including the MC herself, do not shine well, if at all. The first 35-40 minutes sets up the subplots of the three supporting characters of Sorachi, Yano, and Kuramochi. Sorachi's subplot didn't go anywhere for the remainder of the movie. Yano's conflict with Tsuru seemed to have no emotional weight at all. Kuramochi himself didn't get the proper screen time to explore his own personal and family issues.All in all, the characters seem so bland and uninteresting. The lack of interpersonal dynamics also dulls the mood and atmosphere of the movie.The story itself, especially the last 40 or so minutes, seems like another generic slice-of-life episode. The ending feels somewhat boring and tiring at the same time. While the movie prides itself with being unique in making a story out of gliding, the sports itself is not deeply explored and only seems to serve as a dressing instead of the vegetables in a salad bowl.The animation is decent, not marvelous in anyway but not horrendous either.If you're looking for something you can marvel at for weeks, then you may safely skip this piece of art.

I’ve watch nearly 100 anime at the time of writing, and this is the first anime that I’ve watched in a theater. I was quite skeptical about this show at first, as I was the only person in the whole theater, but this turns out to be quite a good show.The story writing here is quite solid. Everything made good sense, and easy for me to follow along. There’s no major turn-offs whilst watching, and I throughly enjoyed it.

I’m usually quite into drama/romance genre, which I think that the writers had done a great job of portraying these elements into the film. The romance bits mostly doesn’t make much sense to me, but it didn’t bother me all that much as there’s only a handful of them throughout the show. In a nutshell, I think there’s some great elements of story writing throughout this show.Contrasting to the story aspect, the art is a little disappointing. The character animation are quite great: their movements are natural and fluid. What I don’t understand is the background art. I think it’s very lazily done. Some shots from the sky looks like a Google Earth render for some reason?? But at least the character art and animation is fine, so I’m not going to press anymore on that front.There’s not a lot of soundtrack highlights throughout, but most of the uses of music are quite effective. The music in this show did a relatively good job of conveying the emotions of the characters. The ending was quite good… Not really much else to say.I’ve pretty much enjoyed the whole show.

The character designs were visually striking and the action sequences were beautifully choreographed. The use of CG appeared minimal, which helped to create a cohesive and immersive visual experience.

I\'m never going to tell someone their taste is bad.Unless, of course, they don\'t like Bananya.You see, Bananya is a universally appealing anime - as in, if you see a slice-of-life comedy about adorable cat banana friends going on adventures, finding love, and chasing their dreams not appealing to you,...you are literally Hitler.Every single week, Bananya manages to make the best of its three minutes by not just focusing on its cuteness factor, but having a coherent storyline and character development as well. Yes, Bananya can do in three minutes every week what overhyped action anime aimed at adults can\'t manage to do in 23.After eleven episodes, I feel like I\'ve become part of a new family. A family of bananyas.Not only is Bananya entertaining, it\'s soothing. If you\'re having a bad day, simply turn on your anime-watching device of choice and watch cat-banana adventures. Even though it\'s a kids\' show, it doesn\'t feel like it\'s dumbed down or talking down to an older audience at all, and has some jokes that will get more of a laugh out of an older audience (such as a cat being called the ""Madonnya of Bananyas"" - BTW she\'s also the best girl of the season).In conclusion, you have absolutely nothing to lose by watching Bananya. In the time you took to read my crappy review, you could have watched your first episode of Bananya and began your life-altering journey into bananya-hood. you are literally Hitler.Every single week, Bananya manages to make the best of its three minutes by not just focusing on its cuteness factor, but having a coherent storyline and character development as well.

You won't believe the glory of this anime and you shan't be able to get trough this review without finishing the whole series.Bananya, the Citizen Kane of anime. Now you'd say nah no way this anime is for little kids and mentally handicapped, also known as American college students. To that I have to say you are dead wrong. Behind the simplistic premise hides a huge amount of intrigues and mysteries.Art.Art looks like it's drawn with crayons. Now you might think it's just shitty art or maybe they didn't have enough money to animate it...better or it's a stylistic choice. In truth it's supposed to represent how judgmental our society is about appearance and how companies nowadays only care about their products looking nice. It's also worth noting that main character's design is a combination of ancient  art fusing felines from Egyptian art with ornamental arcs from Arabic one.,, Have no fear of perfection, you'll never reach it''- Salvador Dali when asked what he thinks of people who don't watch Bananya10/10Sound.Lines are delivered with so much emotion and effort. Every scene feels so real. The conflict between parents is extremely tense and culminates in a fight and father going to prison, or maybe it was just my family. See? It's so real you can't even discern reality anymore!,,The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.''-Mahatma Gandhi when asked why nobody wants to forgive the lack of LGBT characters in Bananya10/10Story.It's an incredibly paced story only rivaled by it's colorful yet  human characters. Story starts of slow as we are introduced to Bananya and have been explained his origins and goals. You'd think that it's mundane or stupid that his goal is to become a chocolate banana tho you are wrong. The chocolate banana represents rich corporate moguls as they appear to those as naive as Bananya. His simple goal is juxtaposed with extremely hard work he has to put up to achieve it. It would come as no surprise if Bananya soon had an internal conflict by learning about those horrible 1%ters on the top. This gives off an obvious political message that is so subtle you might not be able to understand it unless you are able to completely get Nietzsche work and have read all of Karl Marx.It has some major twists which I mustn't spoil otherwise they'd be ruined for you.,,A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but idea lives on.''- John F. Kennedy when asked what would happen if the writer of Bananya died10/10Character.Characters are probably the peak of this deep,well thought out anime. Our protagonist is shown as a mysterious person, his lower side always being hidden by a banana, he is shooting high and not backing up. We are also shown how releateable he is by witnessing him experiencing fear,happiness,envy. Let's not forget the side characters. There's Bananyako and  Kenaga Bananya (or Long Haired Bananya) who obviously represent shallow masses that surround you concerned only by looks who are your main drive for success and escape from such environment . I do think they are the weakest ones cause art style has already got that idea trough about looks and their struggles seem to be rather mundane. Tora (Tabby)  Bananya however is a character who despite standing by the side seems like the heart of this bunch. He is kind and caring but also deeply in love with Bananyako. His misfortune is that she completely ignores him despite his rich personality. You can see his depression growing after every turn down, at this point I'm concerned he might do something. However I'm certain his brother, Sabatora (Gray Tabby) Bananya will not allow him something like that. He is the moral support to his brother and always watches over him despite being younger. Together they share a bond that got them trough many hardships such as still unspoken about  time they spent on the streets working for a gang. The story about their addiction to heroin and how Sabatora is still struggling with it might come up but such complex arcs will probably be left for season two. There's Kuro Bananya( Black Bananya) he hasn't been explored so far but by what little we saw of him it seems as if he has history with our main character. My speculations are that they've met during the Cold War, as we can obviously see that Kuro has a Russian accent. It will most certainly evolve into a tense spy action that overshadows even the likes of Mission Impossible and Bourne franchise. Oyaji (Dad) Bananya and Tabananya (Baby Bananya) show us how much our main character cares about his family. His father is always there for both of his children. What I will spoil, so skip ahead a few paragraphs if you don't wish this masterpiece to be ruined for you, is  that they aren't even his children. They've been abandoned by their mother during the second world war and Dad Bananya found them as he was walking trough the ruins of Berlin after the Ally armies stormed the place.

All the Bananyas supposedly have their own personalities: for example, Black Bananya has a bowtie.What intrigued me early on was Bananya’s ambition to become a chocolate covered Bananya – one that was, to say the least, entirely perplexing. Does Bananya want to be eaten? Does he just enjoy it aesthetically? If, like me, you go into the show wanting an answer to this, you will...be disappointed. In fact, for the rest of the series I found Bananya’s work ethic intolerable. Instead of pursuing his ambitions, he spends most of his time asleep and eating sweets. Why, at the supermarket, did he not find the isle with chocolate sauce? How much knowledge does Bananya have of the world and its workings anyway? I was left wanting for so much more.Another aspect of Bananya’s character I found unpalatable was his betrayal in “Bananya and the Mouse Nya”. After breaking bread with Bananya, and sharing starkly honest and genuine moments of friendship and connection, Bananya turns on the mouse and tries to kill him. This is when his character arc, for me, went too far. For the people that believe he is redeemable after this, I wonder how much you truly value mouses’ life.In ""Bananya and the Balloon Nya"" Bananya and co. are trying to grab the balloon for an unknown purpose. They try to jump for the balloon string, but cannot reach, until girl bananya manages to grab and tie it to a cup. Next thing we know, Bananya is atop the balloon, after jumping up there.The physics are ludicrous and inconsistent. One minute, Bananya jumps like he\'s in zero-gravity, shooting up as high as the story requires. The next he can\'t reach the string. Similar inconsistencies are shown in ""Bananya and the Stray Cat Nya"" where he can\'t reach the window lock, after jumping to much higher places in other scenes. Does Bananya perhaps have jumping powers that easily deplete? If so, the story should have made this more clear.I hate baby Bananya.A few more points: the racial insensitivity of “Bananya Goes Out Nya”, the mysterious and underdeveloped narcissism of Long Hair Bananya (for me, one of the most compelling and open ended characters in the series), loose ended depictions of famine and child neglect.While Bananya has some positive aspects, I couldn’t ignore these glaring problems that, once fixed, I think would make for a very compelling and fascinating programme. be disappointed.

The detailing of the character's lives and backstories were unique, creative, and fun as well.Overall, this is really cute, and if you're short on time this is a fun anime you can cram in quickly.

It’s basically a couple shorts about a little kitten that lives in a banana and his many friends. The series is actually one of those very short cartoons consisting of only 3 minutes long. I consider it very similar to 4 panel strips in Comics in fact where it’s just a little taste of the characters and comedy. Because of this, this review is going to be pretty short compared. There really isn’t all that much you can talk about for a 3 minute anime that really...doesn’t have much of a story.Let me introduce the characters, there is Bananya, Tabby Bananya, Bananyako, Black Bananya, Long-haired Bananya, Mackerel Bananya… are you starting to see a trend? There are 11 characters and 10 of them are these strange Bananya creatures. There is even a little Baby Bananya as well. And each of these characters have there own little personalites to make them stand out… I really don’t know how they stand out though because I could barely remember all of the characters. I could probably pick them out by looks, but definitely not out of their personality. The other character that is not a Bananyas would be the Narrator who sounds like researcher in a documentary.The animation is really really cute though very simple. Think more like Flash animation then the high detailed cell design that you see in action packed anime. The most action we get is the Bananya figiting or getting flustered. Most of the detail that is used in it is for backgrounds and the Bananyas even if it’s pretty simple. When they do show the humans, it’s really lack luster but that isn’t really a bad thing. The center point should be the Bananya’s so any humans or other creatures around them are basically just to push whatever plot along.The music at the end is a really cute song but the rest of the soundtrack just seems a bit cutesy generic. It’s a lot of what you originally heard before in other slice of life style cute anime with nothing to make it its own. I watched the sub, not the dub (if there even is a dub of this) , and so some of the jokes seemed to slip past me as well as how slow it was for me to watch.

At the end of each of the episodes, there is a couple cute pictures of real cats.

There are 11 characters and 10 of them are these strange Bananya creatures. There is even a little Baby Bananya as well.

Each episode stands alone, and there’s no reason to see a previous episode in order to understand any other episode.The visuals are simple, with heavy outlines on the characters and not a lot of movement. I think as this series is very stylised and is aiming to be cute, this isn’t a detriment to the show.The soundtrack doesn’t especially stand out, but contains plenty of light comedic music which complements Bananya’s adventures.

But in anime\'s is fine.STORYTaking place in the mind of an overworked office worker, Banyana follows the lonely, stressed man\'s life as he imagines several ""Bananyas"" inhabiting the world in order to cope with his mundane, pointless existence. He helps cope with life by creating many different types of his imaginary banana-cat hybrids, each with their own personalities, like Bananyanko, the pink haired female one (who is, by the way, best girl), or Baby Bananya, or Banyana, the star of his stress induced dreams.I\'m...kidding about the stressed out worker part. But seriously there\'s barely any story here, each episode just have a vague story like ""Bananya has a nap outdoors"" or ""Banyana goes to the supermarket"".ARTHow do you feel about cute drawings of cats? Kinda like that Pushin cat guy that Facebook seems to love, the art in Bananya is very, very cute. If you\'re looking for a more traditional anime style this may not be for you. It honestly reminded me a little more of Western cute artwork than Japanese. Nontheless, it\'s adorable.The animation is also surprisingly good. Maybe not completely fluid but it certainly has enough animation quality to make watching it a pleasure, if somewhat basic looking.MUSICIn terms of voice acting, this show only really has one key voice, and that\'s the narrator. A slightly awkward sounding guy, he tells the audience about the Bananyas, as well as gives them advice such as ""Don\'t stick your claws into the balloon"" or ""Even when Bananya is awake, he is not awake"". Overall he\'s kinda the highlight of the show at times. The cats, predictably, just say ""nya"" a lot.There is some very inoffensive background music that sounds like that of a music box, there to simply add background noise.The ending song though, is something else. It\'s a very catch sugary J-Pop song (called ""Lucky Holiday I think, though I could be wrong). Even though it lasts all of 30 seconds I still occasionally find myself humming it. It fits the show incredibly well.CHARACTERBananya is very unique. Well, pretty unique, I\'m sure there are many short anime about cute things, so in that regard this isn\'t exactly a new concept, but it certainly embraces it\'s mix of cute and odd.Each of the characters has their own (albeit one dimensional (although that\'s kinda expected for a 3 minute episode anime)) personality, ranging from Long Haired Bananya\'s vain adoration of his luscious hair to Bananyanko\'s cute, girly nature. All in all the characters are exactly what you\'d expect, and that\'s a good thing.ENJOYMENTAs stated above, if you don\'t like cute things, then this series is going to be VERY difficult to watch. But for those of you who want a very, very simple anime that you can watch an episode or two in between doing something, then this is great.Personally speaking I enjoyed this a lot. It certainly wasn\'t high on my priorities of things to watch but it was a fun show to just dip into three episodes (especially as that only took 9 minutes) when I felt like watching something that barely took any amount of attention.

There`s not much to say as it doesn't really have a plot, most of the episodes are just them goofing around.

I know like a lot of people on MAL, we have a HUGE plan to watch list, and ""sometimes"" we ACTUALLY get to them. However, within the first episode, I felt like such an idiot for picking this show, and almost dropped the series completely. However, as I kept watching more, I soon realized that this anime has something special about it.I have never been into watching...any kids shows, or really anything that doesn\'t look a little mature.I mean, granted, we all watched some sort of kids anime or cartoon as a kid, and didn\'t even really understand what we were watching. However, I find that this anime really can appeal to the older audience, despite being targeted towards the kids demographic.Many of the jokes seen in play will get a kid to laugh, but actually have significant meaning within a adult as well. And, some jokes take mature cultural understanding to get, but kids will still think it is hilarious.The MAIN thing that sticks out to me is this: the beauty of simplicity. I\'m not talking about something like your generic ecchi harem, or your mecha action fighting series. I\'m talking about the fact, that, the series does not put out much to offer in regards to content, yet it is highly enjoyable. The creator really had this in mind, as he never goes over the top in the amount of story per episode, so it never feels rushed.

This works well when you stick them between episodes of other shows or put them beside other shorts on television, but it doesn't work as well when you binge it. Bananya is one of many anime shorts designed with one goal: introduce a cute mascot character to sell toys. Not much happens in...the show - a bunch of banana-cat hybrids goof around for 13 3-minute episodes. It's pretty much the animated version of watching cat videos online with a twist of anime's weirdness mixed in.

As a cat owner of two adorable kitties that mean the world to me - I've actually been fortunate enough to own as many 5 cats in my household between my wife and I so anytime I get to experience an anime that has kitty cats I'm pretty sure I'm going to enjoy it even if the kitty is living inside a banana.Bananya is a 13 episode series in which every episode is only 3 minutes long that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It is a series that is mainly directed towards pre-schoolers...but I assure you that if you love cats or if you love things that are obnoxiously cute you'll definitely get your enjoyment out of it.You can't really expect the most in depth story especially when each episode is only 3 minutes long but the allure of this anime is you get to see Bananya and his friends get up to mischief in various ways. I guarantee by the end your going to have a favourite bananya character. Even though it's an anime directed towards a very young audience there are actually some pretty good laugh out moments throughout the entire anime. I do have a lot of fondness for the episode where Bananya gets to interact with a mouse, and where him and his friends get to interact with a balloon.None of the Bananya characters actually talk, but each episode is explained by a narrator that gives a very detailed description of the mischief Bananya and the rest of his friends are up to in each episode. At the end of every episode the character gives us a quick and detailed description of each of Bananya's friends.I assure you that each episode will make you smile ear to ear, and some will even give you pretty epic laugh out loud moments. It even has a really adorable ending song. The series is pretty much animated with adobe flash with very minimal effort. I don't necessarily think it's to the anime's detriment though. The main allure to this anime is that it's incredibly adorable and it can make you laugh.I think one thing we can learn out of an anime like this is sometimes a minimal effort can be enjoyable if you focus on being funny and being adorable. Deep down it's a quick enjoyable watch that will be sure to cheer you up. It's a sure fire way to cure depression and add a bright side to an otherwise miserable day.With every episode only being three episodes long, it never overstays it's welcome and gives you the perfect amount of cuteness and hilarity without being too overbearing. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but it's still an enjoyable watch all the same.

You can finish the whole series in under an hour. In the anime the story was pretty good but at the same time it was all over the place. The art is really good because it really emphasizes how cute the series is. The sounds could use a little bit more work because it is really only cute nyas, music, and a narrator but not many other sounds. The characters are really cute and that is why they are really good. Even the very few people in...it look cute. My enjoyment level was pretty high because of how cute the anime was and how short it was. My overall score of it is a 9 because I think the story and the sound could us a little bit more improvement. It is a good anime and you should watch it. it look cute.

At first I didn't believe it would engage me, but what do you know?! Sometimes animated kids stories can be just as good for grown-ups too :)))Although it's that kind of series where each episode has its own story, there's also unity throughout the anime and a common idea: passing from an episode to another, a new character is introduced every time, until we get to know all of them. Also, the first and last episode have an introduction and a conclusion. The...incredibly short episodes of only 3 minutes each as well as the presence of a storyteller speaking rarely and slowly make it easy to guess this anime is addressed to younger kids. Most probably from 6 or even 4 years old some people could get bored as the plots are pretty plain. Still, it can be really fun for some of the teens and even grown-ups, perhaps especially due to its modest plots which can be relaxing, but also because of its cheerful tone. Moreover the absurd or hilarious events are simply unplugging you from your ordinary mindset, not to say that some of the jokes are unexpectedly good!Honestly, I love both bananas and cats, but not even for a second have I ever thought about combining them :)). A most uncommon species of cats in banana skins who keep their existence secret from the people, the characters are captivating in terms of both cuteness and very well defined unique traits. Frankly, since the beginning of this series I couldn't help associating the image of these adorable kittens popping up from a banana suit with a Spanish fairy tail where a prince was peeling off oranges from where real girls emerged. But even more fascinating is that the banana kittens can also hide back in their banana suit as if it were a zipper bag :)). Although they are certainly an unusual breed, we should not be fooled; the banana cats act very much like ordinary cats! What I particularly loved about them was how they were always up to something exactly like young cats jumping on the curtain gallery or even in the middle of the table plates; but just as much I adored their irresistible innocence.Slow paced motions, simple forms, pale colors and thick lines, all confirm this series is suitable for small ages, but it can be incredibly soothing for the grown-up minds tormented by the everyday stress.The soundtrack does a decent job, I can't say it got my attention in a particular way; there would be an exception, though: the ending.

This anime is one that you could easily watch within one sitting, as all of thirteen episodes are about three minutes long. The anime focuses on the Bananyas & it introduces new characters within each new episode, with each character being unique in their own way, for example, there's one that is constantly fixated with his look, so he has to comb his fur for a good amount of time. The Bananyas usually just stay in this unnamed lady's house and they are...more active when she leaves her house, as they end up playing in the bathroom sink or just being lazy and taking naps.

Cutest thing I've ever seen!Don't like long shows? worry not! the episodes are extremely short so don't worry about diving into a long adventure! It may be a short show, but it creates quite an impact on the viewers.I personally love anything cute, but if you're not into cute stuff like this...then this might not be the anime for you, but still give it a try >:3 then this might not be the anime for you, but still give it a try >:3"", 'Okay, I\'m going to be real. I couldn\'t even ironically like this.This anime is a complete waste of time, which is saying a lot since each episode has about 2 minutes worth of content. The entire time, I was bored shitless. My eyes kind of glazed over while watching this. I think the only reason I finished was because it was so short, and because i was hoping that I could find some kind of enjoyment in some other random aspect. Alas, I found none. I couldn\'t even laugh at the bad flash animation because it was so minimal.Heck this anime doesn\'t look like...it was made to be enjoyed even. Its probably was just a timeslot that needed to be filled, a paycheck that needed to be written, and a glorified toy commercial.If you like bananya or are interested in it, that\'s cool, I kinda get it. The cats are really cute and the premise is silly and fun. All I\'m saying is that I think you\'ll get a much better experience googling ""bananya"" and scrolling down for 30 minutes than watching the actual show. it was made to be enjoyed even.

Candy Boy: Nonchalant Talk of the Certain Twin Sisters in Daily Life,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4535/Candy_Boy__Nonchalant_Talk_of_the_Certain_Twin_Sisters_in_Daily_Life,"[""Candy Boy is a sweet, good natured slice of life romantic comedy.  Right off the bat you should understand that this series revolves around yuri love and an incestuous relationship between fraternal twins.  Even saying this though, there is really nothing to be offended about in regards to this series.  While normally my creep-o-meter would be signaling its alarm bells, I actually really enjoyed Candy Boy.The plot in Candy Boy is uncomplicated and revolves around twin sisters Kanade and Yukino and their high school life together.  Unlike a lot of slice of life series, Candy Boy's episodes feel like they are...all part of one large movie sized one as events flow seamlessly from each episode.  Both sisters struggle to find time for each other and both get into college.  Little happens in terms of dramatic romance, while there are very tender moments, those hoping for mushy love scenes and romantic kisses will likely be very disappointed.  There doesn’t seem to be much in the way of social consequences from either classmates or family due to the sisters’ quite obvious relationship.  In a way this is both disappointing and a relief.  Though I thought it was the right choice because, for me, it kept my attention off of the creepy aspects of the show.The characters are excellent in the series.  This is helped by the fact that the cast is extremely small and focuses exclusively on only four characters.  In fact I can really only remember a couple instances where people other than those four even spoke any dialogue.  This was an excellent decision since the series is already short and doesn’t have time to build much depth in the characters.  The sisters Kana, Yuki, and to some extent their younger sister Shi get the majority of the attention.  Kana is the most interesting of the group and feels the most complete as a character.  Most of the story elements flow through her and what she is thinking and feeling.  You get a good feel for all of their personalities and their motivations, though it does feel like of the twins, Yuki gets a bit of the shaft in terms of depth.  Sakuya is the comic relief and while she is in love with Kanade, she is never a serious love interest.  There really isn’t any angst in terms of relationships which I found a bit refreshing.  Kanade and Yukino love each other deeply and basically nothing can separate them.The art and animation is truly fabulous.  I loved the character designs and the settings and backgrounds were all wonderfully dawn and animated.  There did seem to be a bit of inconsistency though, even though it was great looking sometimes characters didn’t always look the same throughout the show.  The acting was very good and it featured a number of good musical pieces.I enjoyed Candy Boy quite a lot. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of yuri or just wants to see a sweet slice of life series and is not bothered by the subject matter.  While it may be a bit controversial to some audiences, I think it will appeal to most people. all part of one large movie sized one as events flow seamlessly from each episode.

But this slice of life anime comes with a twist: the two are romantically affected to each other. Although yuri incest is wincest, the fact stands that there are some that may be offended from the shoujo-ai and/or incest. If this combination works for you, then you\'ll have no problems enjoying this anime as much as I did.As with many other anime in the slice of life genre, the story is given to us at the beginning of the anime, but not much of a...change happens. Surely our yuri twins get closer and closer to each other in every single episode, and the romance aspect IS developed throughout the anime. We have a sweet relationship to begin with, and only a few possible characters that can affect the story one way or other. The whole imouto-san business, the twins\' college entrance and dorm changing may be of interest to some, but keeping your expectations high in the story and expecting anything ground-breaking wouldn\'t be wise. That said, from the occasional change of moods and places, this straightforward story successfully gives what it promises.As you go along the series, you will most probably find out that it contains many ""still-pictures"" that tend to be overly long and drawn out, but not that annoying; not since the art was never meant to be over the top. The character designs are cute enough to make the viewer like them instantenously. The clothes worn in the anime, which tend to bring up the ""cute"" aspect of the characters, may sometimes be fanservicey, but are presented as no big deal without much emphasis on them. Zettai Ryouiki fans will be delighted to see Yuki\'s knee-high socks completed with her mandatory skirt, much to our enjoyment.Yet another area that a slice of life anime usually fails in is the BGM. Pretty much non-existant, or rather, unimportant is the BGM in slice of life anime, yet we would all be able to understand that something is wrong if BGM simply wasn\'t in the show or if it did not fit the mood at any given time. This can be compensated by the seiyuu, who play a big role in any speech-based anime, Candy Boy being one of those. None of the voices of any character is annoying or leaves us with a bored face for any reason whatsoever. A new sense of realizm was reached in the last episode as everybody started talking together about totally different things at the same time; a situation any viewer should be able to relate to.Let me get this one thing straight; there are no boys in Candy Boy. None. If you can ever find one, please tell it to me so that I can start worshipping you. That said, do we even need boys in this anime? The two main characters, Kanade and Yukino, and the two supporting characters, Sakuya and Shizuku are interesting enough to fill out the whole anime. Although they are twins, Yuki fills in as the little sister with childish attitude role, and Kana acts more like a mature, older sister. Sakuya is there for the occasional comic relief that we all need sometimes, offered with her yuri tendancies for Kana. The imouto Shi-chan allows more of a story to develop, and is a blend between Yuki\'s cuteness and Kana\'s looks and personality. None of them being dull or plain annoying is yet another blessing.The caution from before still holds true at this point; if you don\'t like yuri/shoujo-ai, then this series is not for you. I, as an avid fan of female relationships, knew fully well that I was going to enjoy this anime as much as I expected. The interactions between the twins are cute, and usually funny; those two adjectives are enough for me to be sold to an anime. The fact that Candy Boy isn\'t a straightforward ecchi/yuri but rather a cute love story only makes things better. As long as you have that bittersweet feeling of having completed the series after you\'re done with Candy Boy, then all is fine.Candy Boy did (damn, where is my italics?) leave me with that bittersweet feeling of both accomplishment and sadness. There is not a single thing in the world that is perfect. As a rose comes with its thorns, Candy Boy may be coming with less-than-stellar story and easily-forgettable BGM, but that does not change the fact that we still like both of them. change happens.

(Please refer to the warning spoiler below for the second premise.)  It started off as a seven-minute ONA but I guess it fared well enough since we've got more episodes coming, now each being fourteen minutes long to boot.--Before we get into the review, I'd like to mention a major warning (that is fundamentally SPOILERish):  This series has incestual vibes between fraternal twin sisters.--The additional episodes don't seem to push the sisterly relations between the two protagonists as much with the shift...from calling Yukino &quot;Yuki-nee&quot; (in the ONA) to &quot;Yuki-chan&quot;, but even with episode one you can see that the fluffy overtone is a clear continuation of the ONA.Candy☆Boy is one of those series that rolls slice of life, comedy, and romance all into one, so plot is most likely going to be rather incidental.  The art is a lot more detailed and the animation much smoother in the additional episodes compared to the ONA, while the seiyuu continue to deliver a solid performance.  (You may recognise Sakuya's seiyuu as Katou Emiri, of Lucky☆Star fame as Kagami.)The comedic moments are well-timed, and serve to enhance the series overall without taking the limelight away from the relationship dynamics.Of course, it's still too early to say much in terms of character development at this time and there are many other points that haven't been expounded on yet, so I will update this when we are privy to more episodes.I do think the series is coming along nicely, however, as the motivations of certain characters weren't made too clear in the ONA.Updates*:Episode two brings more of the same defining characteristics of Candy☆Boy that makes it so lovable-- cute interactions between Kana and Yuki, with Sakuya keeping things light-hearted.  A shot or two reminiscient of fanservice cropped up, so that might be this series' attempt to draw (and maintain) the attention of its targeted demographic audience.*Will be integrated into the rest of the review at a later date when generalisations are possible. from calling Yukino &quot;Yuki-nee&quot; (in the ONA) to &quot;Yuki-chan&quot;, but even with episode one you can see that the fluffy overtone is a clear continuation of the ONA.Candy☆Boy is one of those series that rolls slice of life, comedy, and romance all into one, so plot is most likely going to be rather incidental.

However, I've also watched quite a lot of romance animes and I can say with confidence that this one blows everything else out of the water when it comes to realism.It is exactly as the synopsis says, twin sisters are in love with each other - it is an incestual relationship... but hang on is it? This is the real kicker. Their relationship is more like platonic love on steroids. If you're hoping for some Yuri action, passionate kissing etc. then you can forget all about that because these...sisters are so sweet and innocent that they could possibly melt boulders and cause volcanic eruptions. They hold hands all the time, stare into each other, talk about their feet and stuff like that. After a few episodes, rainbows will randomly start to appear in your room, you will begin to fart out leprechauns and have visions of a galloping unicorn. Seriously though, this series is very innocent and the sisters never do anything sexual. The only way we can tell for sure that they're in love is through their dialogue, which is so sweet that I nearly came down with a bad case of diabetes. However, all of that made the series more believable and if there ever were twin sisters in love somewhere out there in the real world... they'd probably behave like this.As for the characters in this show, there are only four. Kanade & Yukino (twin sisters), Shizuku and Sakuya. Shizuku is the younger sister of Kanade & Yukino while Sakuya is there to provide comic relief and nonchalantly hit on Kanade. These four characters will interact with each other on a regular basis and further reinforce the already impregnable relationship between Kanade and Yukino. All other characters in this series are only there to fill in empty spaces; they don't posses names and are mostly mute. However that is a brilliant move on the part of the makers as this is a very short anime and focusing on the main cast provides the viewer with a consistent experience.The art here is truly amazing. I don't like using the word 'amazing' because it is quite possibly the most overused word in the English language. However, when it comes to this series I can use it with honesty. The animation is staggering. The twins are flawless in their design and whenever they hold hands you can see that it's the work of professional and talented artists. If you're reading this guys, well done. I nearly had a stroke the first time I saw them holding hands.The sound is also very good. The soundtrack fits in with the series, the ending is heartwarming and the voice acting... oh boy. I'm a rookie when it comes to Japanese. I can count and only say a few words without sounding like an idiot but even I can tell that the voice actresses did a good job here. It is authentic to the core. In all the animes I've watched I'd say this anime here has got the best voice actresses.All in all, a very good anime. Relaxing, stress relieving. An innocent tale of two girls in love. I've never imagined that Yuri could be this entertaining. I admit I must have had the wrong impression of it. Or perhaps it's just this particular anime that's so soothing and enjoyable. Well either way, I'd recommend this to anyone who likes romance. A must-watch. sisters are so sweet and innocent that they could possibly melt boulders and cause volcanic eruptions.

Kanade & Yukino (twin sisters), Shizuku and Sakuya. Shizuku is the younger sister of Kanade & Yukino while Sakuya is there to provide comic relief and nonchalantly hit on Kanade. These four characters will interact with each other on a regular basis and further reinforce the already impregnable relationship between Kanade and Yukino. All other characters in this series are only there to fill in empty spaces; they don't posses names and are mostly mute. However that is a brilliant move on the part of the makers as this is a very short anime and focusing on the main cast provides the viewer with a consistent experience.The art here is truly amazing. I don't like using the word 'amazing' because it is quite possibly the most overused word in the English language. However, when it comes to this series I can use it with honesty. The animation is staggering. The twins are flawless in their design and whenever they hold hands you can see that it's the work of professional and talented artists. If you're reading this guys, well done. I nearly had a stroke the first time I saw them holding hands.The sound is also very good. The soundtrack fits in with the series, the ending is heartwarming and the voice acting... oh boy. I'm a rookie when it comes to Japanese. I can count and only say a few words without sounding like an idiot but even I can tell that the voice actresses did a good job here. It is authentic to the core. In all the animes I've watched I'd say this anime here has got the best voice actresses.All in all, a very good anime. Relaxing, stress relieving. An innocent tale of two girls in love. I've never imagined that Yuri could be this entertaining. I admit I must have had the wrong impression of it. Or perhaps it's just this particular anime that's so soothing and enjoyable. Well either way, I'd recommend this to anyone who likes romance. A must-watch."", ""Why do people like the anime? It baffles me. I picked up this anime because it was on the recommendations page for an anime I liked, so I had high hopes. Those high hopes were destroyed pretty swiftly.---Character---I am talking about character first because it is the biggest thing that bugged me about this series. Right away, I felt something wrong with this anime. At first I couldn't put my finger on it, but then I realized it was because the characters are flat as paper. Sure, they were animated pretty decently, but that doesn't matter when there is nothing memorable about any...of them. They all seemed fairly genetic. Not to mention that their sister (Shi-chan) was kind of annoying.---Story---I know that this was a fairly short series, so it didn't have time to develop a whole lot, but there was no trace of an actual story. Now, this normally wouldn't bug me, since I love pointless animes (Azumanga Daioh, etc), but the happenings of this anime were just awful. It says that the twins are in love, but are they? It seems like a fairly normal sister relationship, except for a few aspects. Their so called relationship doesn't go anywhere. I'm pretty sure normal sisters tell each other they love one another, so that's not anything special. Don't misunderstand me, though. It's not like I was in it just for yuri action and am upset because I didn't get to see any; I generally wanted their relationship to advance.---Art---This was the only thing about this anime that I enjoyed. The animation was done well. As I mentioned before, the characters were designed well, plus the scenery and background images were decent too. Not much else to comment on.---Sound---Same as art, not much to comment about. It wasn't awful though, that is for sure.---Enjoyment---This anime left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not sure if I don't appreciate it because I've never watched a shoujo-ai anime before, but either way I didn't like it. Maybe if I rewatched this anime at a later date I would appreciate it for what it is, but as of right now I stand by my overall score.

Intoxicated by exterior titles, I came into this series thinking none other than typical yuri. How wrong was I indeed, for Candy Boy doesn\'t follow such blasphemy, as instead, it is of an innocent bloom in this bizarre bouquet dubbed romance (specifically girls\' love/yuri).The premise of Candy Boy is simple, it follows two sisters and life. Really, that is all the anime spares. I suppose I could touch on the lifestyle these characters take as well, there is...a lot of referring to family relationships and concreting the ties that behold the two parties. Candy Boy also makes use of ""generic"" s.o.l moments to hold together a sense of reality, instead of a singularity on solely the main point of the narrative. I\'ve said time and time again how much I love simple anime, I have to say Candy Boy really takes the cake here. Sure, the entire anime is probably nothing new in the medium, but with writing that endeavours in its ecstasy without notice. I find it that Candy Boy is not only lucid but a fully elaborate story on its own euphoria. I\'m not one to find the most pleasure out of stories like such, with its themes of sister love, there wasn\'t really much to submerge myself into with this. However, the execution came in and absolutely hammered everything that an anime as such should have, I don\'t really have experience with the genre either, but I wouldn\'t be surprised if this was entirely believable too. It\'s strange but not surprising, just another impulse of irrationally that, yet again, has proven misleading in analysis. Efficient thinking has its disbenefits, I\'d tell all.As for the characters, I liked each and every one of them. Both lead characters, Kanade and Yukino have really good chemistry and a sense of humanity to them, they felt like normal humans and behaved accordingly, I suppose with lack of episodes, there was no room for major development, however, that is completely fine, as the characters remained intact to their fixed settings. It may sound boring, but it is a perfect fit for such an anime. Sakuya acted as the clown of the show, diverting moments into comedic relief so that the anime wasn\'t entirely monochromatic. I do believe she did a fine job at such, conveying such a personality throughout the show as one would expect without any hinders. The same goes for Shizuku and her gimmick, which was bringing drama around more often than not. The drama here is a hit or miss, but overall it didn\'t crash the quality of the show despite it being of ""generic"" order, which I will stress once more, is totally fine in an anime as such. So overall, they are relatively great characters.The audiovisuals for its time is incredible, the background was seriously well made, the designs were fresh and polished, all the other words reviewers will use to say something is great. I suppose with this being an OVA, AIC (whoever they are) had the benefits in the market, if I am not wrong, they probably could have gone wild with aesthetics and made it even more beautiful, but seriously, for the late 00s, this is amazing stuff. The same is true with the OST and voicing, more so OST in the form of OPs and EDs, sometimes this stuff sounds like something out of KEY or something. Whilst I would like to praise the in episode OST, I simply could not remember everything that played, however, if I tried, I do believe such quality could also be found throughout. I wouldn\'t have guessed such amazing production values would be brought into some original OVA no one really speaks of, which goes to show that expecting the unexpected brings pleasant surprises.When all is said and done, I really did enjoy Candy Boy a lot more than I thought I would have originally. All the lucidity, the bliss, the other big words I need to find via googling synonyms, is nothing short of impeccable. So, as said for about the 111th now, the simple stuff is good stuff, and that happened to be Candy Boy, which I enjoyed a lot. I would imagine if you are looking for a deep and intrinsic story, you won\'t find one here, if you are looking for something not ""s.o.l boring"", you won\'t find it here. Full enjoyment usually comes around to those with low expectations in an anime like this, with satisfaction levels disproportionally magnified whenever said artistic piece achieves the basics of whatever it tries to accomplish.TLDR: Candy Boy achieves apex status in its elegant writing of a simple tale of two sisters and the life events that arise around them. Great characters that fit together live hand and gloves. Amazing production values for its time, also check out the full OP/EDsOverall - 8.8 (9)----------I planned to watch this specifically in a time where I\'d binge multiple romance anime, for some odd reason, I just didn\'t with this anime, same with School Days, same with Citrus… anyway, I wholeheartedly recommend this OVA to anyone interested in some niche title or is a hardcore fan of romance, you just don\'t want to miss this presentation if you are like me who is satisfied by anything wholesome. On that note, I\'d also recommend reading ""Tamen De Gushi"" if you can, it\'s more of a feeling that vibe recommendation rather than it bonds well on an internal level, both have girls\' love though. Otherwise, I have nothing to leave off with, I will say, however, don\'t look at this anime\'s cover and jump to vapid conclusions; a treat lies ahead, maybe it will taste like candy.

You tell me.', ""A sweet, incestually implied, slice of life with two twin sisters. It delivers exactly what it promises.-Minor Spoilers-Story (7)-There isn't much of a story really. Just the life of these two sisters- Yukino and Kanade- and the challenges or events they go through. The rough plot seems to be the twins’ feelings for each other although if it hadn't been listed as yuri and incest I doubt anyone would be able to tell when watching the first couple of episodes. Saying that however, what I really liked about this anime was the gradual development that is put so subtly it makes it seem life-like and...therefore grants the anime with a somewhat messy but passable story line.Art (8)-It has very cute and appropriate animation that fits the story well. I don’t have any complaints about the character designs although sometimes the boobs seem to have grown considerable amounts one episode then revert the next. Overall it’s nicely done.Sound (6)-All the voice actors did incredible jobs for their characters with none of them sounding whiny or annoying. However the background music is unremarkable (so unremarkable I’m having trouble remembering it...) All in all it does what it’s suppose to and remains fitting for whatever certain scene.Character (8)-This is a great part of the anime with all the characters being likeable and funny without seeming too unreal.  Kana and Yuki’s relationship is a big influence on their personalities and it’s amusing to watch how their own personalities change around each other (let’s not forget to mention it’s also adorable). The supporting characters such as Shi and Sakuya are also pleasant to watch and add their own emotions to the anime. This show has a good variety of cute, realistic characters.Enjoyment (9)-I enjoyed this anime a lot and didn’t feel my eyes wandering or staring at the clock like they do most animes. The somewhat subtle fan-service and sweet interactions between characters keep me entertained through each episode.Overall (8)-Candy☆Boy is a cheerful anime focusing on the sweet relationship of two sisters who obviously care deeply for me other. I like how this show blows of all gimmicks and clichés to display a range of pure and honest characters that can make you smile. A great show, I strongly recommend it to you. therefore grants the anime with a somewhat messy but passable story line.Art (8)-It has very cute and appropriate animation that fits the story well.

Rather, I like lesbians. Alot. And these lesbians are a welcome addition to the admittedly small genre of yuri anime. And yes; I said lesbians. With a name like Candy Boy, this title exudes almost pure DO NOT WANT vibes, what an absolutely terrible name for such a series. They could have at least called it Candy Girls, or Girls Like Candy, or Candy Lesbians. Or better yet, YEAH MAN, LESBIANS MAN! in big blue letters. I\'m series; It took not one, but four recommendations for me to check this out because the name is so misleading that I felt I was...going to fall pray to the old ""watch Bible Black, feels good man"" trick. Luckily such was not the case. Candy Boy is, to clarify, actually made of 50% lesbians and 50% MORE lesbians. To get this out of the way fast, Yuki and Kana are related. Very related. Not that fake hentai related, actually biologically related. It\'s blatant incest, so if that bugs you, steer clear. But, personally, I don\'t give a damn. I think it\'s awesome, because they are attractive and fictional.Story; 8. It\'s fairly episodic, and at seven minutes an episode this is neither surprising nor bad. If you\'ve seen a slice of life, you know what will happen; just on a much smaller scope. Picture the storyline of a single episode of Azumanga Daioh (If everyone including the gym teacher were lesbians) spanning an entire series; That\'s Candy Boy. And it works, more or less. The only plot point that failed hard for me was the little sister; Hell the what now? Get off my screen, annoying not-as-hot-as-your-incestuous-sisters loli. Go hang out with those mindless girls from K-On! or something.Art; 8. Let\'s be honest here; people who watch yuri, at least to some reasonable extent, want to look at attractive girls that love other girls. How very unsurprising. That said, even series as stellar as Simoun can fall short as a yuri series by having poor or unfitting artwork. Even Strawberry Panic, the only other ""pure"" (absolutely 0% of weenie at any given time) yuri series, fell here on a number of occasions. That said, this is actually Candy Boy\'s biggest success point. Kana and Yuki are well drawn, and shockingly identifiable in the vast sea of doe-eyed, smiling anime girls that exist today. Kana has a very neat haircut, as well as two cool cartilage piercings. Yuki often wears suspenders that are left hanging, and just generally layers clothes to create a very ""realistic"" or ""modern"" stylistic look. I know this sounds silly, but these cartoon girls really are quite stylish; and when a large factor of your genre is how adorable your protagonists are, this counts quite a bit. Rest assured, the art is good, especially for the girls (and nothing else really matters anyways, stop pretending).Sound; 8. There was one theme I could type all the do-do-dum\'s to and hope one reader (if there ever is a reader even) gets it but I\'ll spare you; Suffice to say, the music here was elevator-esque anime music, no doubt, but a couple of the themes were catchy enough to stick with you till you heard an actual song. And none of them reeked of casio keyboard basement nonsense; Boring and unsurprising themes? Yes, but at least they sound like someone with good technology made them.Character; 8. Personally, I see a lot of fans who like Yuki over Kana, and perhaps I\'m just not looking that hard (scratch that-I\'m not looking at all. I\'ve just happened to notice) but I really liked Kana. I\'m sure half of it was that she, like myself is a struggling arts student dealing with poor lodgings and aggravating professors. But even aside of that, Kana had more of a mystique about her; Yuki was just cute. In a full series run however, I can very easily see Kana being more emotionally interesting. Her character model also appealed to me more, although I enjoyed both, and as aesthetic and small as it is, the cartilage piercings and quasi-hime cut as well as the darker skin really did it for me. She\'s probably the most attractive (I can\'t believe I\'m typing this, but then again, being a user on MAL already shoots my cool factor straight to hell) anime female that I can think of. The only stupid charcter is their little sister. Hot lesbian twincest, hot lesbian stalker, more hot lesbian twincest, little sister feelings and drama,....Wait. What? She greatly interrupted my enjoyment of something I don\'t always get to enjoy with my anime; girls with boobs, and as a character was made of I-don\'t-care-bitch and TOWERING depression. The stalker was awesome though, in case I didn\'t underline that previously. Three feet tall but still not lolicon? That\'s a welcome first. Sign me up.Enjoyment/Overall; 8. It\'s length makes Candy Boy very, very rewatchable. Every now and then if I just want to watch something quick and nice, or whenever I just want to replay the scene of Kana and Yuki sharing cake over and over and over (every single day, amirite?), the length is actually a very nice change of pace from the standard 12 to 26 episode series. As stated many times before, when I watch a purely yuri series about girls that love girls, I want to see pretty much nothing focused on but that; Hot girls frolicking about my screen with other hot girls, only to be interrupted by other hot girls stalking them. And Candy Boy delivers in spades; Or should I say, lacking all humor, class and wit, IN LESBIANS. And in incest.

It never turns explicit, but instead moves slowly through everyday moments. It is easy to sense that the sisters relationship is a true progression built top of many years which allows their interactions to feel natural. Best of all is their banter, which is highly enjoyable, and feels like two siblings reminiscing and having fun together.Like some slice of life shows Candy Boy meanders, but in a good way. The characters are school girls and so the story follows the trials and tribulations of their simple daily...lives. There isn’t really much drama to speak of and it’s all about the fluff. The love that the two share is never clearly defined. It is suggested to be romantic in nature but the two rarely do anything of that nature when they are alone. If anything they just seem a little closer than “normal” sisters: they hold hands and flirt with each other. Their relationship is all about living in the present; they wish to stay together for the foreseeable future but they never worry about the small things. It’s light hearted and sweetly innocent.Being so brief, you can watch it quickly; however the show easily touches the heart. It fleshes out the lives of the sisters, and is about the small moments in a relationship such as sharing an umbrella, shopping for a Christmas presents, etc. which is part of what makes it so charming. The characters don’t make grand overtures, rather they illustrate their love in small and tender ways.One sister, Kanade, is a bit shy (she’s a little bit of a tsundere) but you can sense her affection for her sister. The other one, Yuki, is the complete opposite. She’s cheerful, spirited and outgoing. The other character is the stalker underclassman, Sakuya, who provides the comic relief of the series. Her amusing fangirl ways add some spice and vary the tone.The animation looks dated but it has a certain nostalgic air. The colors are muted but cheerful and the characters are well designed. The characters eyes in particular are well detailed and convey more than what the characters say along with the movements of their bodies. Their faces always are exceptionally expressive and the backgrounds can be dazzling with natural scenery. It’s almost as if the whole show is in love like the main characters.The music is... Not the best. To be blunt it sounds like upbeat elevator music. The ending song is an outdated 90's pop ballad that seems overly saccharine for how restrained the series is.In closing, all I can say is that I really think everyone should give this series a try. While it may not be to everyone's tastes, with the way the series deftly handles everything, most should find little objection to it. It treats these two like a normal couple who are easily empathetic and lovely. Their love isn’t a flashy love, rather it is quiet, sweet and simple, and all the better for it. lives.

It fleshes out the lives of the sisters, and is about the small moments in a relationship such as sharing an umbrella, shopping for a Christmas presents, etc. which is part of what makes it so charming. The characters don’t make grand overtures, rather they illustrate their love in small and tender ways.One sister, Kanade, is a bit shy (she’s a little bit of a tsundere) but you can sense her affection for her sister. The other one, Yuki, is the complete opposite. She’s cheerful, spirited and outgoing. The other character is the stalker underclassman, Sakuya, who provides the comic relief of the series. Her amusing fangirl ways add some spice and vary the tone.The animation looks dated but it has a certain nostalgic air. The colors are muted but cheerful and the characters are well designed. The characters eyes in particular are well detailed and convey more than what the characters say along with the movements of their bodies. Their faces always are exceptionally expressive and the backgrounds can be dazzling with natural scenery. It’s almost as if the whole show is in love like the main characters.The music is... Not the best. To be blunt it sounds like upbeat elevator music. The ending song is an outdated 90's pop ballad that seems overly saccharine for how restrained the series is.In closing, all I can say is that I really think everyone should give this series a try. While it may not be to everyone's tastes, with the way the series deftly handles everything, most should find little objection to it. It treats these two like a normal couple who are easily empathetic and lovely. Their love isn’t a flashy love, rather it is quiet, sweet and simple, and all the better for it."", 'Candy Boy is an anime that puts an emphasis on the whole genre of yuri. It is about a very innocent love and how it has no boundaries (probably the most cliche line ever)  and how it plays out makes for a short but delightful to watch anime, especially for those into yuri and romance.Rather then reviewing episode 00 and EX01-02, I figured I\'d review it as a whole. As the synopsis implies, this IS about twin sisters in love and just about nothing else.In these 10 short ONA\'s, there isn\'t much of a story to build on but rather its a episodic...adventure into the lives of twin sisters living in Tokyo and their daily activities.To begin, the flow of this brief series is slow and subtle and most likely leave u with a ""cute and fuzzy"" feeling at the end of each and every episode. The story may lack a bit of realism, but who cares. Innocent love lacks realism at this day and age. Sure there may be no significant story, but it would be quite improbable to have a good in-depth story with short episodes.In the end what Candy Boy lacks for story, makes up for in terms of lovable characters, their adorable personalities, and overall enjoyment you will get out of watching them. adventure into the lives of twin sisters living in Tokyo and their daily activities.To begin, the flow of this brief series is slow and subtle and most likely leave u with a ""cute and fuzzy"" feeling at the end of each and every episode.

Candy Boy is the light-hearted, gentle paced, almost-YA romantic yuri anime you've yearned for...but with an abnormally short runtime, a stretched budget and a little bit of incest.- Now, I want to make something clear before we go any further. I'm maybe a little bit grossed out by incest. Thinking about it rationally, I shouldn't be - what you do in your own time is your own business and I shouldn't judge. But it feels...innate and I can't much help it. However, Candy Boy succeeded in never making me feel disgust; if anything, I was rooting for their relationship more than I ever expected. I can't guarantee you will feel the same, but I wouldn't put this show to bed because of that little caveat. -Candy Boy follows the art-college-life of twin sisters Kana and Yuki as they struggle with college costs and, more importantly, finding the time to be with each other. It's a rare thing, seeing a romantic story choose to develop post-honeymoon stage romance, but Candy Boy takes that challenge and is very much successful. Since they've always been together and their relationship has probably never had a honeymoon stage, it's bizarre yet enticing watching them try and inject the fun, the romance back into their... love life?Believe me, some of the scenarios are a little cliche for the genre, but I never found myself rolling my eyes. Some of the short episodes focus on walking home in the rain under a shared umbrella, shopping for Valentine's presents for each other independently and going on a surprising date. However, the core of what makes Candy Boy so charming is the light tempo, the episodic pacing which ties together to form something bigger and the depth to which it discusses it's small cast of characters and their feelings and ambitions.Kana is the younger, but in many ways more mature and practical twin. Somewhat of a protagonist, her feelings are the ones we see most of and we realise how much she cares for her lover/sister and wants to spend time with her, but is trying to balance that on top of college work and struggling to cope.Yuki, the older twin, can surprise with moments of maturity but is generally impulsive and more emotional. We generally follow around Kana, but tend to realise that Yuki is feeling the same way at the end of the episodes. It appears the Yuki has less workload, but we realise how dependent Kana is on her, even if Kana doesn't want to admit it.Sakuya is somewhat the friend's twin, and tends to function as a comic relief character. Seemingly infinitely wealthy, Sakuya harbours strong romantic feelings for Kana but is never in competition with Yuki - she knows she has already lost that battle. Sakuya is surprisingly helpful to our characters when she's not being creepy.The fourth character is introduced in the midseries arc, where the sisters go home to see their family. Unfortunately, their parents can't make it so it is just their younger sister at home waiting for them. Despite her incredible maturity that exceeds her age (and probably the main characters!), she is struggling to understand what a correct sisterly bond is, compounded by how extreme her older sister's shared bond is. This is the only time that the taboo topic of incest is actually covered, and it's sweet and gentle to see the twin's caring deeply for their sister, and learning to care more.The most important part of the series comes at the end, where Kana must make the decision of going to Summer School to prepare for a fancy prep school - thus leaving Yuki behind - or choosing a less prestigious art school and staying with Yuki. Across the last episodes, Yuki gets a part-time job to help pay for Kana's Summer School and Kana feels guilty. It feels like all of the work done to get their love-life back on track disappears.However, Yuki makes it clear that no matter what, they will always be together. Even if they don't spend as much time together or see each other every day, they will be together no matter what. They admit they love each other - romantically speaking - in a few quiet, but ordinary moments with a slow, gentle kiss in a small shelter on a snowy day. While their love may not be spread across multiple universes and timelines like a couple of the more epic yuiri romances, it is something eternal.

These girls just want to be together for the rest of their lives and damn it all if theyre siblings and it would count as incest(or in this unique case, ""twincest"") they just want to be together which in my book counts as the fucking definition of romance! some people are probably all like ""oh this cant happen, theyre siblings, twins no less, how can some sick bastard come up with this stuff"" well heres my response to that: if you truly love someone from the bottom of your heart, no matter who it is, you should pursue it and damn the consequenses to hell! it seems to me that some of the most forbidden romances (like this: homosexuality, incest, etc.) have the purest intentions and i dont think that anyone should be judged for who they love, and its because of that belief that i was a fan of this anime. and now i feel terrible for that having now seen the entire thing.

At first, many people may be turned down by just seeing that it's incest or yuri but I have to admit that this is a very innocent and sweet anime. It's quite short too so it shouldn't take up much of your time, in fact, I finished it in 1 sitting just now from 1am to 4am since majority of the episodes are only 10-20 minutes long and there's only 8+2 episodes.There really isn't any negatives to this anime. There were parts that were either positive...or remained neutral. Nothing really got me to say I disliked it. The story was very sweet in that it shows two sisters in love with each other. It's absolutely innocent and there's nothing dirty or perverted in this anime compared to other anime that contains incest. Not only is the love between these two twins sweet but the love they have for the little sister back home really warms up your soul. The characters were developed quite well as many of the questions I had were answered and it did not leave the viewer feeling empty. The anime also included a comedic relief in the form of a freshman girl and I find the comedy to be just right. It was neither too funny to ruin the touching mood nor was it too lame to really kill anything. It was also interesting to me to find out that the voice of the freshman girl was the voice of kyubey from Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Unfortunately, one thing I did dislike was that the episodes and the anime overall was much too short. I'm a slide-of-life, school life anime type of guy and I really wanted to know more about the future of these girls. I would have at least wanted to watch the anime till their graduation but at least the way the creators ended the anime left a warm, fuzzy feeling in me after watching it. Overall, I give it an 8 out of 10 because it was very innocent and sweet. Those are probably the two words I would use to describe this anime...innocent and sweet. Since the anime is short, I would not mind rewatching it as it did make me smile and for some reason, kind of provided a nostalgic feeling probably due to the countless moments one of the sisters reminisced about their past. or remained neutral.

Now, that may sound like a premise that can't be taken seriously, and to some extent, it is, but in all honesty this is actually a rather satisfying and serious anime.What makes Candy Boy so great is that the story is taken SERIOUSLY. It's not a half-assed attempt to flaunt the shojo-ai genre so teenage boys (or lesbians) can fap to it, it has the same ups and downs that you would find in any other romance anime that takes itself seriously. The story progresses like it would in...real life, but seeing as how that's how a slice-of-life is supposed to go, it's not that shocking. The problems that Yuki and Kana face are simply interesting. It has a wide range of problems that couples face from the tiniest things, like what to get each other for a birthday present, to major things, like how will one afford collage and still be together with the other. It doesn't let the fact that Yuki and Kana are twins and of the same gender effect the progression of the plot, in fact, at times, it enhances it.However, the story could have been a little better with character development. Sure, you only have a limited amount of time to develop the characters, and they do do a good job of that, but our information of the characters is limited. Sure, there are bonus episodes, which may help (I have yet to see them), but looking at just the series itself, there is some work left to be done.Another thing, at times when Kana and Yuki are talking, the screen is focused off somewhere else, like the top bunk of their bed, or an extra-long shot of the scenery, which is quite distracting. It wouldn't be so bad, if it didn't happen as often as it did, and it's not entirely bad, but it's really distracting.The characters themselves are just great. Yuki and Kana complement each other as the others opposite. Yuki is the more lightheaded one who is more joyful and does have her moments, where Kana is more smarter, but also a little more emotional at times. While these seem like complete opposite personalities, they're not as different as one might think, and the differences in the personalities are what make it more interesting. Sakuya is a very enjoyable character. She's just like an over the top villain you would find in an action anime, but applied to a romance anime. More or less, she's like the Ladd Russo of this show, where she's insane and over the top it's hard not to love the character. Shizu acts as a sort of counter active voice in Candy Boy. She shows that Kana and Yuki are not alone in their sisterhood, and would like to be almost as close to them as they are. She's an interesting character, and used for an interesting purpose.The art is rather well crafted. It's not insanely flashy, or unique, but that's what makes it work. The anime itself is not flashy or exciting, but it's still enjoyable to a standard. Like so, the art itself is like that, and replicates how wonderful the show is. The music also works on this convention. It works on how it takes itself seriously and not over the top with its premise, and adapts to it, and as a result, it's very nice, very beautiful.Overall: Candy Boy may have a premise that might not be taken as seriously as other romance animes, but it's worth watching because it takes itself more seriously than someone could imagine. It's light-hearted, interesting, and overall worth watching, 9/10 real life, but seeing as how that's how a slice-of-life is supposed to go, it's not that shocking.

As such it will be a most unformal, oral and not very informative review, as far as these things go. And keep in mind that your opinion and enjoyment will most likely differ from mine, if it doesn\'t then I\'d like to talk to you cause you seem like my kind of person. Also remember that this is the internet, the wonderful land where something is either terrific or terrible, there is rarely  room for any grey zone.I\'m just going to go right ahead and say that this anime is not one you should...spend your time on, unless you\'re adicted to yuri and have scraped the bottom of the yuri genre, and even then I\'m reluctant to recommend this as what you get is merely teasing of this incestuous relationship between these two sisters, and little else.Yes this is an incestuous yuri lovestory, is that wrong? No, absolutetly not, I\'m all for both the yuri- and the yaoi genre, does that mean all yuri and yaoi is good out of the premiss of being yuri/yaoi? No offcourse not, it still needs an interesting plot and strong characters, like most romance shows need. I feel this is an issue with most of these kinds of shows, with a possible exeption from my own anime history being ""No. 6"". But I\'m sorry, I digress.All but one of the characters seemed, to me, uninterested in making you the viewer like  the show. They\'re just sort of going along with everything that happens (which is quite little, but I\'ll get back to that later) the exeption of this is Sakuya, who\'s trying to lift the show up with an element of humor and her wacky shenanigans. To me she was the one positive point to this otherwise downright boring anime, and even she came out too strong at times making me hate her character for being the shugar-rushed masochist that she came of as in these moments. Our main characters however are the two sisters Yukino and Kanade. Kanade seemed so indifferent to what was happening in the world around her and opposite to her sister did not have a funny, mischeavous side. Yukino, while having her own charm would from time to time play along to Sakuyas shenanigans, both too Sakuyas benefit and dispair, making her an amusing character in the end, and you know that Kanade cares about her sister too giving her character some redemption too.The show was quite frankly about nothing. Nothing substational happens. I guess there is that minor subplot about their sister, but I don\'t really feel like that went anywhere. You\'d have conversations not going anywhere for a couple of minutes, then Sakuya would appear, with the same yoke over and over again getting rejected, crying, and then stand ready for her next moment to make a fool out of her self, and then the show would end with the sisters having another empty converation.The art and sound were both quite boring. The show didn\'t have an opening something that was sort of disappointing to me, and the people, not only in the background did not move at all, making it  look like they were statues rather than actuall human beings, The show is not even that old, so I think they should have done a better job with these, since this made the world feel less alive.Believe it or not I actually went into this anime with an open mind. I\'m no stranger to wierd romance situations in anime, and the phrase ""show about nothing"" had me intrigued as I am a pretty rapid Seinfeld fan. I also took heart by the fact that the episodes were so short and few, a selling point for me, even though I know those shows tend to be short for a reason. In the end, however, I was dissapointed.I suppose the relationship between the sisters is a sweet one, and their bond together is truly unseperable. And it really shows through their actions (Or lack there of). But the relationship between two rather empty characters is not enough to make a whole 7 episodes shine, when all other points of the show feel so poor. spend your time on, unless you\'re adicted to yuri and have scraped the bottom of the yuri genre, and even then I\'m reluctant to recommend this as what you get is merely teasing of this incestuous relationship between these two sisters, and little else.Yes this is an incestuous yuri lovestory, is that wrong?

The story in general is very well managed and the characters are very interesting to follow. I could call it one of those few yuri that is worth seeing (as opposed to Citrus).The romantic element of the story is very well managed and is not trivialized at all, in fact, I was almost surprised by the management of some scenes. However we are not talking about a perfect anime, obviously, it tends to be boring in some scenes but nothing serious. Personally I found the comic element of some scenes...annoying, which seemed to me to be slightly forced. Kanade Sakurai is the one I prefer most among the twins, maybe because I find the character more interesting.

The characters looked good and the art was good like basically everything was good was what I thought when I watched it. When I watched the first episode my heart was hurting since I felt jealous of how close the two sisters could be. They would hold hands every dang second, outside and inside and even sleeping.As the anime went on I still really enjoyed it. I felt the pain the third sister was feeling and I could totally understood being left out. I almost even cried. They showed the emotions really well. Every now and then they...have comedy going on.If you like or want to watch something really sweet once in a while or if you like yuri then I would definitely recommend this one. It doesn't even matter if you like yuri, if you just like romance and those kind of anime I would still recommend this since this anime was so sweet. It got me smiling like a big fool when watching it. I wished they would've made it longer than those 7 episodes and 1 OVA for me to be jealous. have comedy going on.If you like or want to watch something really sweet once in a while or if you like yuri then I would definitely recommend this one.

I don\'t mind slow slice of life anime, but there is a thin line between ""slow slice of life""  and ""no story at all"", and Candy boy ends up with the larger shoe on the wrong side of that line.I have to admit it is a gorgeously looking anime, though. The artwork...and character designs are simply stunning. Too bad it merely consists of still frames with the occational animated mouth thrown in.

If you don't like that kinda stuff, then you best stay away from this anime...(Just sayin'...)Story: Like the synopsis says, it's a love story between two sisters. But it's not ecchi or anything like that. It's the farthest thing from ecchi. It's innocent, cute, loving, sweet and meaningful. It just shows, at least to me, that love is important in anyone's life, and how we should all enjoy the beauty of love. (God, doesn't that sound cheesy?) Cheesiness aside, this anime is about...relationships and the bonds between them.Art: The art is very sweet, perfect for the story. The backgrounds and scenery were gorgeous as well.Sound: Eh, the sound was okay. The music was okay, not really my taste, and for some reason, it didn't seem to fit the anime too well either. :/ But, meh, that's just my opinion.Character: The characters went together very well, even though this anime was short. The character development went right along, and was pieced together well. (Sorry if I am repeating myself. ^^')Enjoyment: I very much enjoyed this anime. It hit all the right spots with me and made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. It was a very cute anime, and I'm sure that I will re-watch it time and again.Overall: I enjoyed it.

While seemingly odd in concept, I grew to like the show and the oddly charming nature of the relationship between the two main characters.As stated above, the story is centered around two girls, Yukino and Kanade, who are sisters. Due to a misunderstanding, Kanade confesses her love for Yukino who reciprocates her feelings. While the show focuses on their relationship, ultimately a large part of the story is about the issue of growing up, which in turn causes separation from those you care about. Because the issue of...growing up is such a relatable concept, its hard not to cheer for these girls. All these girls want is to be together forever, though sometimes wishing isn't enough. The story ends on a positive note though, with the ending implying that the two will get their wish. A refreshing aspect about this series is the romance between the two characters. With a genre such as yuri, it is easy to rely on fan-service and tried-but-true tropes but the relationship between Yukino and Kanade develops at a nice, organic pace. Yukino and Kanade's relationship isn't over sexualized either, with the two taking all 7 episodes to finally kiss. Their relationship could have been further fleshed out, however. One issue that is never explored is the social acceptability and stigma surrounding not only gay relationships but also incestuous ones. There also isn't any conflict between the two main characters, with their relationship being depicted as happy and perfect the majority of the time.The art style is mostly good, however the characters can look weird during some scenes. The music is also terrific, bringing that warm, fuzzy feeling that you would expect to feel when watching a love story. Besides the story and character depth, the only other negative aspect of this show would be is short length. This show can be finished in a couple of hours, and it'll leave you wanting more. This show is enjoyable and those who want a cutesy, happy romance can't go wrong with this one.Papa Bless. growing up is such a relatable concept, its hard not to cheer for these girls.

Another Robert\'s Too Late reviews headed your way! Check the synopsis for the rundown of the general plot, and I actively try to avoid SPOILERS, but minor ones might slip through. Apologies if this happens. I\'m for once working from the subbed version as none of the circles I run in to get my anime fix have a dubbed version. I\'ve seen that this show has been rated highly in many reviews and for the life of me I cannot understand this. Why, there\'s not hardly any candy or boys, either one, in the entire series! As...always, let\'s read to the end and find if there\'s any candy or boys either on the RTLR wall of fame, if its not immediately obvious.  Let\'s break down why I\'m recommending a pass on this.Story: 3The biggest selling point, or sticking point, for this is the idea of fraternal twin sisters being romantically linked. I trudged through this anime just to see how this aspect of the story is handled and the answer is, basically, its not at all. There are some things that seem to be coy references that the girls have a bond beyond being twin sisters, but its not something that is even really explored or explained. I\'ve known twins in my life, and I know as relatively well as anyone can, that none of them were romantically involved, and I\'ve seen my friends display equal if not greater levels of bonding between them. There\'s not anything all that provocative about twins holding hands or being very in sync with each other. I mean, come on people, twins usually spend more time together than any \'regular\' person spends with anyone in the course of our lives. Just the sheer time invested in the twin relationship gives them a chance to bond in incredibly deep ways. That doesn\'t mean anything sexual at all.I was expecting more to be honest. I am not much put off by the idea of forbidden love, and I\'m willing to admit being a huge fan of anime like Strawberry Panic, Sakura Trick, and I\'ll even admit to having seen KissxSis. Well, maybe let\'s keep KissxSis just between us. Point is, I would have probably been entertained with an exploration of the sensitive idea of so-called \'twincest\'. What I got instead was an aimless show with a creepy little stalker kid, and two boring twins. So basically there\'s not even any real overarching story, just random daily events that aren\'t even big events for the characters. At some points the twins themselves seem like they have broken the fourth wall and are bored with their own existence.Art: 8I\'ll give credit where due, I did like the art style, the overall flow of the animation. The girls are detailed and expressive, even if one\'s expression is mainly irritation and the other\'s is basically empty-headedness. (if there was such a word) So thumbs up for that aspect.Sound: 6Serviceable. Nothing stuck out, but that means nothing was overly terrible either. The twin with the deeper voice, miss bored girl, seems to mutter a little bit. I don\'t speak Japanese (yet) but I\'ve been studying enough to understand a little bit of dialog, and the words that she says that I do know sound muddled and hard for me to understand. I don\'t really take much away on that as it might just be my ignorance in regards to accent, dialect, or my lack of fluency that made me notice this.Character: 3Again, we have one dumb as dirt twin, and a bored/annoyed twin. There\'s a little bit about their younger sister being jealous of their closeness, but she\'s not represented as much more than just resentful, with no real movement in her character\'s perspective. There\'s also a comedic element in a very young girl who idolizes the bored twin and has an unhealthy sexual attraction to her. I know she\'s meant to give the anime a little lift and lightheartedness, but in the end she just seems to be creepy as Pee Wee Herman at a peep show. There\'s not really anything else to this show, and even the twins seem completely static with moments of coy winks hinting at a romantic relationship. Just a flop all around in characters too.Enjoyment: 3Yeah, you didn\'t see me not enjoying this at all did you? Complete surprise there considering everything said to this point, right? The story could have gone so many places that would have been infinitely more entertaining, the slice of life styling could have carried more weight, instead of being tacked on almost afterthoughts. They even had a solid start with the impressive art, but alas it was not to be. I wanted to like this anime very much. I tried to be forgiving as possible, hoping for it to break out and pull me in, but I was left out in the cold, and therefore there is no candy on the RTLR wall whatsoever.As Seinfeld\'s soup nazi might say, ""NO CANDY FOR YOU!""

The tricky part?  They\'re actually very romantically interested in each other.  They are very clearly dating from the start of this series.   Kana and Yuki have a hard time finding time to be with each other, due to the constraints that come with being in high school.  Together, they...try and find time to both, be with each other, and solve each other\'s problems.One very real strength of this series is that it tackles very real issues that come into play when one is furthering their education.  You may wince at some of the solutions that the twins eventually come up to, but I found myself not terribly hating the way the storyline went.  It flows really well together.  They honestly could have made this a movie and been fine.  There weren\'t any times where the sisters were super lovey-dovey into each other, but the simple stuff like hand holding were additions that I loved.Later in the series, we are introduced to a character that seems to be the ""band-aid"" to solving some of the girls\' problems and I\'ll openly admit that I wasn\'t super into how they went about it.  We have two girls in love with each other and I feel like having them solve problems in different or more interesting ways would have made for a slightly nicer story.  Once, I\'ll buy it, but they overstepped a little.Realizing that this series is actually only seven episodes with roughly fifteen minutes of runtime, each, it does obviously suffer from solving all the girls\' problems.  There will likely not be enough meat in here to satisfy people that really get into this.  And that\'s unfortunate.  It still ended off okay, but the conclusion didn\'t feel as complete as I would have liked. (7/10)Characters: There are literally only four characters worth mentioning here.  With such a short series, it does seem to work, as all the attention on Kana and Yuki is an attempt to draw out who they are.Kanade seems to be the more realistic thinker of the two.  She\'s doesn\'t seem to be overly book-smart, as we saw of her dislike for ""anything with numbers in it"".  Her dream seems to be to go to art school, but the girls aren\'t terribly well off and art school does unfortunately tend to be more expensive than more academic avenues.  Her desire to always be with Yuki is so strong though.  Yukino takes a less serious approach to life, though seems to be a lot more adjustable to being friendly with people.  She seems perfectly content with putting a burden on herself in order for her sister to succeed, as we see later in the series.  That\'s what her best trait is here.  It\'s not that Kana doesn\'t care for her, but it seems that she feels there are less limitations to be with her... if that makes sense.  Oh, and she loves to eat snack foods.Sakuya\'s character is... puzzling.  Maybe I just don\'t find her memorable, but her storyline is pretty strange.  You know why she\'s there... but you don\'t really know ""why"".  She\'s basically a plot device for certain aspects of the story, but I wouldn\'t say her character shines anywhere.  Shizuku is the younger sister of the twins and she\'s actually pretty interesting.  She is shown to have some distress in her life mounting around the twins and I really liked the angle they took to trying to repair it.  She has times where she acts younger than she is, but she does have points where you can tell that she\'ll mature really well.  I liked what they did with her.  She\'s only in a few episodes, but they\'re pretty impactful.The cast is generally pretty strong, even if Sakuya isn\'t the most memorable character or Kana\'s not the deepest.  But that\'s okay here.  (7/10)Art: Watching this in 2021 and judging it accordingly is difficult, but I thought it looked fine.  You can tell this isn\'t the most high budget show, which is fine.  There are times when they use still-photos at points of talking and this can drive some people a little nuts.  But the times they show the twins together is always awesome.  (7/10)Sound: I wouldn\'t say there was anything super special about either the music or the VA cast.  They were all solid for what this is and I didn\'t have any real complaints.  (7/10)Overall Enjoyment: With 7s across the board, count me in for a solid 7, overall!  Candy Boy doesn\'t do anything particularly special, but there wasn\'t anything wrong with it either.  It was just very good in every aspect.  The touching moments with Kana and Yuki were the definite strong points.  There were flaws here or there, but if you want a decent Girl Love anime that\'s just good all around, Candy Boy isn\'t a bad place to start.  (7/10) try and find time to both, be with each other, and solve each other\'s problems.One very real strength of this series is that it tackles very real issues that come into play when one is furthering their education.  You may wince at some of the solutions that the twins eventually come up to, but I found myself not terribly hating the way the storyline went.  It flows really well together.  They honestly could have made this a movie and been fine.  There weren\'t any times where the sisters were super lovey-dovey into each other, but the simple stuff like hand holding were additions that I loved.Later in the series, we are introduced to a character that seems to be the ""band-aid"" to solving some of the girls\' problems and I\'ll openly admit that I wasn\'t super into how they went about it.  We have two girls in love with each other and I feel like having them solve problems in different or more interesting ways would have made for a slightly nicer story.  Once, I\'ll buy it, but they overstepped a little.Realizing that this series is actually only seven episodes with roughly fifteen minutes of runtime, each, it does obviously suffer from solving all the girls\' problems.  There will likely not be enough meat in here to satisfy people that really get into this.  And that\'s unfortunate.  It still ended off okay, but the conclusion didn\'t feel as complete as I would have liked. (7/10)Characters: There are literally only four characters worth mentioning here.  With such a short series, it does seem to work, as all the attention on Kana and Yuki is an attempt to draw out who they are.Kanade seems to be the more realistic thinker of the two.  She\'s doesn\'t seem to be overly book-smart, as we saw of her dislike for ""anything with numbers in it"".  Her dream seems to be to go to art school, but the girls aren\'t terribly well off and art school does unfortunately tend to be more expensive than more academic avenues.  Her desire to always be with Yuki is so strong though.  Yukino takes a less serious approach to life, though seems to be a lot more adjustable to being friendly with people.  She seems perfectly content with putting a burden on herself in order for her sister to succeed, as we see later in the series.  That\'s what her best trait is here.  It\'s not that Kana doesn\'t care for her, but it seems that she feels there are less limitations to be with her... if that makes sense.  Oh, and she loves to eat snack foods.Sakuya\'s character is... puzzling.  Maybe I just don\'t find her memorable, but her storyline is pretty strange.  You know why she\'s there... but you don\'t really know ""why"".  She\'s basically a plot device for certain aspects of the story, but I wouldn\'t say her character shines anywhere.  Shizuku is the younger sister of the twins and she\'s actually pretty interesting.  She is shown to have some distress in her life mounting around the twins and I really liked the angle they took to trying to repair it.  She has times where she acts younger than she is, but she does have points where you can tell that she\'ll mature really well.  I liked what they did with her.  She\'s only in a few episodes, but they\'re pretty impactful.The cast is generally pretty strong, even if Sakuya isn\'t the most memorable character or Kana\'s not the deepest.  But that\'s okay here.  (7/10)Art: Watching this in 2021 and judging it accordingly is difficult, but I thought it looked fine.  You can tell this isn\'t the most high budget show, which is fine.  There are times when they use still-photos at points of talking and this can drive some people a little nuts.  But the times they show the twins together is always awesome.  (7/10)Sound: I wouldn\'t say there was anything super special about either the music or the VA cast.  They were all solid for what this is and I didn\'t have any real complaints.  (7/10)Overall Enjoyment: With 7s across the board, count me in for a solid 7, overall!  Candy Boy doesn\'t do anything particularly special, but there wasn\'t anything wrong with it either.  It was just very good in every aspect.  The touching moments with Kana and Yuki were the definite strong points.  There were flaws here or there, but if you want a decent Girl Love anime that\'s just good all around, Candy Boy isn\'t a bad place to start.  (7/10)', 'Although I\'ve only seen two episodes, I\'d like to point something out to others like me who aren\'t particularly attracted to yuri; so far, this just seems like a sweet, strong relationship between two sisters. You can freely interpret the relationship between the two main characters as something very close, intimate, and solely platonic. It isn\'t perverted or overtly sexual kissing scenes, and while watching it I didn\'t view it as ""incest"",  I just saw a very loving friendship between two sisters. :3 ', '{2021 Review} | Try giving it a shot (ノ●▿●)ノ|It\'s been 11 years (2008) or should I say 13 years (2007) since the first ONA [Candy☆Boy: Side Story For Archive] was released for this series initial startup. As I finished watching the series it does really have an impact to the genre itself which is Romance, School, Shoujo Ai and a bit of Slice of Life. The Candy Boy: Nonchalant Talk of the Certain Twin Sisters in Daily Life is without a doubt a wholesome, sweet and a heartwarming series that revolves unspoken feelings and approaches towards bond itself.If you by any chance have come...across to this anime searching for treasure like series in the past, I highly recommend to give it a try and watch it. It does not only give you a nostalgia feeling of the kind of anime back in 2007-2010, but it will also help you appreciate how upfront the story towards its message.I know its way past of its years and its quality on streaming sites are not in demand, given the fact the during those days most series are aired under 720p (Which is in my opinion is not that bad at all). Art, Character Design, Sound and all those technical stuffs will be a mind over matter once you\'ve immersed yourself in the series.Note:You should watch first the [Candy☆Boy: Side Story For Archive] so that you will have a good backgrounder of the characters backstory.Trivia:If you have watched the recently released ""Adachi to Shimamura"" there is this particular BGM in which the beginning 4 notes has the same variant as well as in the Candy Boy series, though the tempo and its flow are different it does have its similarity [If you did finished Adachi to Shimamura you will surely recognized the BGM once you\'ve watch this series.] across to this anime searching for treasure like series in the past, I highly recommend to give it a try and watch it.

Both Yuki and Kana showed obvious (non sisterly) feelings for each other and I loved the romantic moments they had. I feel like the pacing of there relationship was fairly good, but there were points where I feel like it went a little bit too slow, or a little bit too fast!Art 7/10 - The art was very typical for Shoujo type anime back then, so there wasn't really anything standing out. The colors were bland most of the time but I didn't really hate that, I feel like it...was actually pretty fitting. Overall, it was basic but good for what it was.Sound 6/10 - Nothing particularly stood out to me, but I will say the voice actors felt very fitting for each character.Personalities/Characters 6/10 - I feel like Yuki and Kana's personalities were polar opposites at times, but that was what made them fit so well together. But the reason I said 6/10 was because of Sakuya and Shizuku. To start, Shizuku was very harsh on Kana at times I feel like being harsh wasn't needed. I'm not saying Shizuku was a bad character by any means (She was lowkey cute when she wasn't being rude.) but she got annoying sometimes because of her antics. And Sakuya I feel like didn't have much of a personality other then simping over Kana, which made her a pretty bland character. Again, I don't hate her but she should've had a little more personality! (She did help Kana on the last episode, but besides that there wasn't anything really memorable she did, at least not that I remember.)Enjoyment/Overall 7/10 - I binged it in around a day, and it was enjoyable for the most part. I wouldn't necessarily say it was amazing cause it had it's bits and pieces of problems. But, it was good enough for me to binge, it was fluffy, cute, and I liked it! :3 was actually pretty fitting.

It intrigued me so I gave it a watch and I'm glad I did.TL;DR at the bottom of the review.Story - 7Candy Boy offers a light-hearted and simple story about, accurate to the title, nonchalant talk of certain twin sisters in daily life. Literally all you watch is the twin sisters (and sometimes the side characters, too) have conversation about random things. Sounds boring? If you think it's boring, then you're wrong. I don't know how they managed to make a show...about nonchalant talks to be intriguing and interesting, but it definitely is. If you're considering to watch this and expecting a ton of kiss scenes, then I'm afraid you will be disappointed. This is not about that; it's about twin sisters.Art - 7The art looks a little too, understandably, old since it's a 2008 anime, but it is by no mean bad. Expect a KissxSis level of art style and you won't be disappointed. A pet peeve of mine is that the twins don't look their age. As in they don't look like they are high school girls; they look more like college students. I even got confused on the first two minutes but other than that, no issue.Sound - 7Nothing too outstanding from the sound department. Their voices match their characters and feel natural. That's about it.Characters - 7Honestly when it comes to characters, Candy Boy does not bring a lot to the table. Most of them, if not all of them, are very simple and don't have many traits to them. However, there are moments when a character shines the most and we get to see her 'unique' sides. Almost like a character development but for a short period of time.Enjoyment - 9All the 7's I gave doesn't reflect how much I enjoy watching this series. For enjoyment, I thoroughly enjoyed every episode and could only hope that an episode would last longer or the series had more episodes. It felt too short and totally deserves more.Overall - 8In conclusion, Candy Boy is a great series and deserves to get a sequel. I recommend this series for those who enjoy Shoujo Ai or those who don't. You won't be able to tell the difference between this and non Shoujo Ai anime.TL;DRNo convoluted plot, characters are likeable, even if you don't enjoy the Shoujo Ai genre you should try this anyway. It doesn't feel like watching one so don't worry. about nonchalant talks to be intriguing and interesting, but it definitely is.

Chuubyou Gekihatsu Boy,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38390/Chuubyou_Gekihatsu_Boy,"[""This is one of my all time favorite anime. Besides the fact that it is based on a vocaloid song the energy and pure joy from this series is incredible. I'm not really one for comedy anime but this was so good, it made me genuinely laugh quite a lot. The story is well paced for the most part, sometimes things go a bit fast but nothing too major. I believe that there is potential for a second season but I doubt they will make one. Hopefully the OVA will be good. This anime is definitely not for everyone but those who love fun characters...and chuunibyou I say give it a shot! and chuunibyou I say give it a shot!"", 'Who thought that making an anime based on a 3-minute song would be a good idea?Well, whoever did, they were right. It\'s really damn funny.The art may not be the best but it\'s much better than what I expected it to be. Usually, when you watch these kind of anime that lie on the bottom of the popularity barrel each season, you can easily grow accustomed to uhh.. ""lacking"" animation and, of course, shortened lenght.I knew and really liked the song (especially the MafuMafu x Soraru version, look it up), so when I first saw this anime announced, I expected it to have like 3-minute...episodes. Well, here we are, at the standard 20-minute lenght, and I must say that the writers know how to use the time correctly.The music is fine, it uses the original song as its OP but I certainly wouldn\'t call it the best cover. The ending is really nice though!The characters are what you would expect. We have the straight (wo)man who reminds us that the whole show is, in fact, not actually about fighting demons but about having fun with the people you like.And that\'s why I think I enjoy it this much. I\'m not gonna lie, it doesn\'t really do anything new and might come across as generic to some people, but it\'s some nice make-you-feel-good fun. episodes.

For one thing, this anime reminded me a lot of Konosuba, since the boys are very similar to Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness as they all have a kind of chuunibyou complex, acting grander than they really are, which isn\'t a bad thing (theres even a reference to Megumin\'s explosion attack when Nakamura does one of his ""attacks"" :p). However, Chuubyou Gekihatsu Boy puts a refreshing spin on that aspect, giving an entire group of bishie boys...that grandiose character.Chuubyou Gekihatsu is one of the funniest anime put out by Sentai Filmworks, centered around five boys with a chuunibyou complex, part of their club called the Hero Club. The main character girl does her best to live her everyday school life around these boys, and has many funny moments in between.  Each of the boys\' personalities is hilariously eccentric, displaying their traits in the clearest way, and hradly faltering in character. The boys aren\'t always just eccentric however, they do have  moments when they really group together and connect in order to solve some problem in each episode, or simply to encourage other characters to get in their Hero Club. Seeing the grandiose complex in a bunch of guys may be funnier than you think.Art: 8/10 Sentaii Filmworks brings us great art as always. The animation and art is clear, and very colorful, even for just a comedic anime. The characters all look unique, and not bland at all.Story: 7/10 Given the anime is a comedic school life anime, it is pretty average in story line, with the anime being about the lives of the boys and main character girl, with a few side characters. Nothing too special to say.Sound: 8/10 I love the soundtrack that plays at random moments when one of the characters is being dramatic and displaying their ""power"". Especially when Nakamura has a scene where he\'s ""battling"" with his demon side and having a ""tragic"" moment. I put quotes around those words since it\'s really just him being dramatic, but in the most hilarious way. A classical organ piece comes up, and I even heard Air On G by Bach at one point lol.Character: 9/10 The characters are so unique in general and within the story. Yes, they all have the chuunibyou complex, but they go through it in different ways. The synopsis has all the traits of their complex.Enjoyment/Overall: 9/10 I enjoy this show so much. I haven\'t watched such a funny anime in a while. This anime REALLY gives me Konosuba vibes which is all the more hilarious.If you like funny, Konosuba-vibe  kind of anime, then I HIGHLY recommend watching Chuubyou Gekihatsu Boy. It\'s made by the same studio, Studio Deen, and you can really feel the similarities to Konosuba. If you like that but with pretty boys, then check this out!

But for the most part, this felt like a mix of the popular KyoAni\'s take of the Chuunibyou series with ""Daily Lives of Highschool Boys"" for a combination of some ""over-the-top"" shenanigans with decent execution but all in all, a good stress-reliever of a show.To give some context, coming from an unrecognized novel, and then converted to a Vocaloid song (which is quite immensely popular) can be said about the origins of this show, that\'s where the OP comes about, and I\'d have to say that while I\'m not a fan of Vocaloid music...(other than that Actors one which was terrible), this one was quite the funny boner, and a good one to listen to on its own (while the Vocaloid one is immensely better downright).In this show, all I\'d have to say is to expect the unexpected, even if it\'s predictable by a long mile. Getting to knows the characters (which at first glance, looks like Power Rangers or some other many-members group) takes awhile to get used to their different ""codenames"" and weird antic personalities (please read the synopsis, all info is there). In summary, getting the normie straight boy (OR girl in this case, the lone female MC Mizuki Hijiri) to face the chuunibyou-centric Hero Club is quite the predicament that absolutely no one wants to face, even if the normal life is what she desires (having normal friends and such in school).Overtime, as it turns out, this ""curse"" that she was indirectly involved with the Hero Club from the start, subseqeuently turns out to be a blessing in disguise as she begins to converse with each of the different chuunibyou personalities that these boys have. And spending time with them certainly cause a lot of hijinks that the ""other powers"" (a.k.a the Student Council) would try to prevail in almost every situation, but also, having someone contribute to others\' wellbeing is also part of the Hero Club\'s missions, so much so that having fun together in contribution is half the battle won! Expertise builds experience, and getting others to echo that influence is the other half won, and it\'s absurdly funny to see how that puts a refreshing touché into the Chuunibyou complex (at least for this show).Obviously, to make this show crazily ""outlandish"" as it looks, having Studio Deen do this isn\'t out of their reach (as is done with KonoSuba and Hozuki\'s Coolheadedness), and it shows. With such a low budget to attend to, the art and animation itself can be said as the average layman\'s production standards for the studio itself, that while this show can\'t be compared to said series and the school-set comedy itself having a lot to desire of, it is by no way the lower eschelon standards of it being bad. In fact, I\'d go to say that it is better than expected of Studio Deen itself, the production staff giving this a tad bit of push. Nice job done.As stated, the OP song itself is pretty much the inspiration for the anime adaptation, and by Vocaloid standards (of which there are a heck ton), this is passable, but to the credit of the chuunibyou boys\' VAs who did a fine job. The ending by Tomoki Takashima\'s VA was quite the surprise though, such a nice ending to wrap it all up every episode. And as expected, all those cynically-tuned background music gave the show a charm all on its own, not great but not bad either.Every seasonal will always have its fair share of ""underrated or overrated"" shows, and while I\'d say that this show breaks neither banks nor statuses, it is a concept that we\'ve seen all too well and pass it off as a generic one (heck, that was IMO for the 3-episode rule). Overall, if you\'d like to chill out to some chuunibyou-based shenangians that are not worth the exposition but the experience, this show will do.

There was some nice character development in the anime as well which isn't seen much in comedy-focused SOL...anime. I personally liked the female MC and how she went from being annoyed to actually loving and defending the guys in the club.The voice actors, animation and overall story were enjoyable and the comedy was nice.Overall I would give the anime a 7/10.

I can tell how this would throw off people but please try to stick with it till the end.The sound is amazing- not just because this is based off a music video but because the animations add up and compliment the sound. Usually in animes there is music/sound but it doesn't actually have the quality or relatableness like Chuubyou Gekihatsu Boy has. Sometimes it does sound pretty good but...it doesn't match the animations that nicely. In Chuubyou Gekihatsu Boy it does it both.There are many different character types in this anime. From the overly athletic and outgoing Noya, to the straight-guy character type, as well as 8th-grade syndrome character type. Seeing all of these characters mixed in one anime is- I'm not gonna lie- exhilarating and honestly refreshing.Every episode of this anime is priceless, because of the burst of hilariousness it brings with. Like seriously you can make a lot of memes from this anime.Overall this is a must-see anime if you want to take a break from one of the typical animes that either take forever to finish or follow one predictable style. Not that they are horrible or anything but Chuubyou Gekihatsu Boy deserves better in its own right. It captures the audience in the very first episode and its plot though short is well written. it doesn't match the animations that nicely. In Chuubyou Gekihatsu Boy it does it both.There are many different character types in this anime. From the overly athletic and outgoing Noya, to the straight-guy character type, as well as 8th-grade syndrome character type. Seeing all of these characters mixed in one anime is- I'm not gonna lie- exhilarating and honestly refreshing.Every episode of this anime is priceless, because of the burst of hilariousness it brings with. Like seriously you can make a lot of memes from this anime.Overall this is a must-see anime if you want to take a break from one of the typical animes that either take forever to finish or follow one predictable style.

It's as if instead of going with the usual formula, we're getting a weird side to it. Which actually makes this show stand out more. It would've been boring if it was the usual common school anime that so many others have done beforehand. So it'll always stick in your mind even after viewing it and finishing it down the line if you go through with it.So should you watch? I'd say give it a shot! It's weirdly interesting honestly, something different that might field towards your tastes. As who knows,...you may end up really enjoying it! I'm certainly gonna keep watching to see what other whacky things happen. So you should too! you may end up really enjoying it! I'm certainly gonna keep watching to see what other whacky things happen. So you should too!"", ""In the beginning it was quite cringey that I actually stopped watching after ep 1. But I'm really glad I gave it another shot! By ep 4 I was already rolling on the floor laughing.In the end, I got attached to the characters really well that I wanted to watch more. I love the character growth I've seen through the episodes. Noda is very amusing to watch he's like a blue, hyper version of Deku lol (doesn't surprise me since they have the same voice actor).Overall, I really enjoyed it. The comedy is indeed gold in this. I've always wondered why it wasn't very popular...but the general reviews are positive. Well, it deserves the praise it's getting! but the general reviews are positive. Well, it deserves the praise it's getting!"", 'As a huge fan of Volcaloid, you could say that watching Chuubyou Gekihatsu Boy was pretty much mandatory for me.However, did it live up to my expectations? Of course not. It\'s an overall OK run of the mill slice of life/comedy show. It features a cast of characters in the ""hero Club,"" reminiscent of the Sket Dance club. Is it better than Sket Dance? Yes, but that\'s also just my opinion. Sket Dance and Chuubyou have a pretty similar concept and plot, but honestly, Chuubyou executes a bit better than Sket Dance did. Not to say that this show was great, but Sket Dance was...just kind of bad in my opinion. Compared to Sket Dance, Chuubyou kind of has better character development and characters in general, I guess.However, I digress. Onto the review. The show has a total of three or so pretty well defined story arcs. One is the introduction to the characters, the next is just general club activity, and the last is the ""conclusion"" of the show. If I\'m being honest, the introduction to the characters was not bad. Despite having some cringy archetypal characters introduced, it\'s honestly presented in a manner which makes it watchable. A few episodes in and I realized that if they keep on going this route, this show will just be filled with reused jokes about the archetypal character traits of each person. However, contrary to my beliefs, the story takes kind of a drastic turn in terms of story arcs. It focuses a lot more on the actual club activity, rather than having the character\'s chuunibyou personalities running the show. This was definitely the move. I felt like the show was a lot more fresh as a result. Club activites were pretty alright, which is basically my entire review of the series: alright. Everything is super normal, kind of even bland, you could say. Even the conclusion arc felt really basic. This anime really just uses your average bread and butter club activity anime formula to the greatest extent. And not to say that the formula is bad, or the execution was bad. It just was OK. Just your standard sort of crisis to the club, and the resolution.I watched to the end. You could say that I definitely did not need to watch this. And you really shouldn\'t either, unless you have a lot of free time. There\'s absolutely nothing very redeemable or unique about this show. There are super archetypal characters with chuunibyou done a lot better than I thought, but it\'s still just average. The transition into general club activity is great, and makes the show watchable, but just watchable. The conclusion is just a conclusion. Probably the weakest of the three arcs, but it\'s still OK.

But I liked the way how the story goes in every episode individually, and there's not a major development in the plot overall. Some parts felt like if they have been added later to the plot, but it isn't disturbing.Art 10/10As expected from a 2019 anime, the art is good. The background art is also good. I liked how they used the colors.Sound 7/10As far as I know, the whole anime is...inspired by a song, and its opening is a cover of it. The soundtrack is not memorable, but the opening theme is pretty catchy. I even heard Bach's Air twice or so and it surprised me. Music is on point and it is pleasing.Character 10/10Each character seems to have a chunibyou complex. But diversity is what I liked. Each character has their own unique personality, so I think everyone can relate to them, which makes it more enjoyable. I also liked their designs.Enjoyment 10/10It made me smile and laugh a lot. I watched it with full enjoyment.

All of the characters are very vague and trope-ish, and none of them are memorable. The show revolves around jokes which are usually funny only 1/3rd of the time. The setting was pretty meh, and the animation was extremely basic. Eh what should one expect from an anime based on some song I've never heard before.

In truth I don’t need this show to work for me for fall to succeed as a season.  It’s strictly gravy – anything I get from it is a bonus.  That said, with a series you pick out as a potential sleeper, especially one based strictly on gut, there’s always a little extra rooting interest.  I certainly want it to succeed, even if it’s not part of the core of shows that for me carry the weight of this season on their backs.Although I did indeed set this series aside in my mind...as one to keep an eye on based strictly on a feeling, when one dug a little deeper there were a few more tangible reasons to do so.  Director Ichikawa Kazuya did the very underrated – and cleverly-directed – Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun, and writer Gotou Midori (Aoyama-kun, Hoozuki no Reitetsu) has a solid adaptation track record.  Still, in the end this is a show based on a Vocaloid song (with a manga in-between) and in truth, I’ve loved pretty much everyone as one to keep an eye on based strictly on a feeling, when one dug a little deeper there were a few more tangible reasons to do so.

My first impression of him in Episode 1 was that he was forced to join the hero club due to his on-screen reactions, but it soon became clear that the way he acted was just him being himself and he fits very nicely into the hero club, even before Hijiri came into the club, who at the end of the series, accepted herself as part of the hero club, the club that she originally found weird, nicely ending the series on the lesson that it is okay to be different and yourself, and to be true to who you are.However, the 11 episode journey has not came to an end yet, if you enjoy the show, watch the OVA which is also the final episode of the series. of a fantasy that many of us dreamed as a child, of wanting to be heroes and acting out the fantasy, and combining it with simple relatable plots, with an emphasis on the importance of being yourself and to not judge a person hastily.This combined with the character development, allowed me to appreciate each of the six main characters, with my favourite being Tsukumo aka Purple.

Instead it is all about fluff, happiness and two people realizing that they are meant to be together. Basically it's a perfect short romance!This is a good introduction to yuri series. It’s not explicit at all and it's very sweet. Normally with incest especially, a topic popularly portrayed in anime, relationships often seem unnatural and forced, but here the interactions are smooth and natural. The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be. It's about cute fluff and sisters growing together. It’s short, it’s pretty and it’s adorable.

It follows MCs Kanade and Yukino in their time at their new dorm, only for there to be a little turmoil between the sisters in a misunderstanding on love, involving a character who does appear frequently in the series, named Sakuya. It can be a little odd to see a series behave such a way without a lot to work with, due to lack of character depth, however, Candy Boy is a simple series that in actuality doesn\'t need much to make it enjoyable, that...is part of what specifically makes Episode 0 fine for the most part even if it does feel forced.The art is high quality for its time, I\'d say it looks very good, especially with background aesthetics and character design. OST through the episode isn\'t particularly memorable here, in honesty. Though ""Candy☆Boy by MEILIN"" is amazing.I watched this in release order, so I ended up watching this first when I first came into the series.

Instead it is all about fluff, happiness and two people realizing that they are meant to be together. Basically it's a perfect short romance!This is a good introduction to yuri series. It’s not explicit at all and it's very sweet. Normally with incest especially, a topic popularly portrayed in anime, relationships often seem unnatural and forced, but here the interactions are smooth and natural. The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be. It's about cute fluff and sisters growing together. It’s short, it’s pretty and it’s adorable.

It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be.

It’s not explicit at all and it's very sweet. Normally with incest especially, a topic popularly portrayed in anime, relationships often seem unnatural and forced, but here the interactions are smooth and natural. The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be.

It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be.

Instead it is all about fluff, happiness and two people realizing that they are meant to be together. Basically it's a perfect short romance!This is a good introduction to yuri series. It’s not explicit at all and it's very sweet. Normally with incest especially, a topic popularly portrayed in anime, relationships often seem unnatural and forced, but here the interactions are smooth and natural. The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be. It's about cute fluff and sisters growing together. It’s short, it’s pretty and it’s adorable.

Normally with incest especially, a topic popularly portrayed in anime, relationships often seem unnatural and forced, but here the interactions are smooth and natural. The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be. It's about cute fluff and sisters growing together. It’s short, it’s pretty and it’s adorable.

Instead it is all about fluff, happiness and two people realizing that they are meant to be together. Basically it's a perfect short romance!This is a good introduction to yuri series. It’s not explicit at all and it's very sweet. Normally with incest especially, a topic popularly portrayed in anime, relationships often seem unnatural and forced, but here the interactions are smooth and natural. The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be. It's about cute fluff and sisters growing together. It’s short, it’s pretty and it’s adorable.

The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be.

It follows MCs Kanade and Yukino in their time at their new dorm, only for there to be a little turmoil between the sisters in a misunderstanding on love, involving a character who does appear frequently in the series, named Sakuya. It can be a little odd to see a series behave such a way without a lot to work with, due to lack of character depth, however, Candy Boy is a simple series that in actuality doesn\'t need much to make it enjoyable, that...is part of what specifically makes Episode 0 fine for the most part even if it does feel forced.The art is high quality for its time, I\'d say it looks very good, especially with background aesthetics and character design.

Instead it is all about fluff, happiness and two people realizing that they are meant to be together. Basically it's a perfect short romance!This is a good introduction to yuri series. It’s not explicit at all and it's very sweet. Normally with incest especially, a topic popularly portrayed in anime, relationships often seem unnatural and forced, but here the interactions are smooth and natural. The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be. It's about cute fluff and sisters growing together. It’s short, it’s pretty and it’s adorable.

It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be.

It’s not explicit at all and it's very sweet. Normally with incest especially, a topic popularly portrayed in anime, relationships often seem unnatural and forced, but here the interactions are smooth and natural. The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be.

It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be.

Instead it is all about fluff, happiness and two people realizing that they are meant to be together. Basically it's a perfect short romance!This is a good introduction to yuri series. It’s not explicit at all and it's very sweet. Normally with incest especially, a topic popularly portrayed in anime, relationships often seem unnatural and forced, but here the interactions are smooth and natural. The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be. It's about cute fluff and sisters growing together. It’s short, it’s pretty and it’s adorable.

Normally with incest especially, a topic popularly portrayed in anime, relationships often seem unnatural and forced, but here the interactions are smooth and natural. The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be. It's about cute fluff and sisters growing together. It’s short, it’s pretty and it’s adorable.

Instead it is all about fluff, happiness and two people realizing that they are meant to be together. Basically it's a perfect short romance!This is a good introduction to yuri series. It’s not explicit at all and it's very sweet. Normally with incest especially, a topic popularly portrayed in anime, relationships often seem unnatural and forced, but here the interactions are smooth and natural. The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be. It's about cute fluff and sisters growing together. It’s short, it’s pretty and it’s adorable.

The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be.

It follows MCs Kanade and Yukino in their time at their new dorm, only for there to be a little turmoil between the sisters in a misunderstanding on love, involving a character who does appear frequently in the series, named Sakuya. It can be a little odd to see a series behave such a way without a lot to work with, due to lack of character depth, however, Candy Boy is a simple series that in actuality doesn\'t need much to make it enjoyable, that...is part of what specifically makes Episode 0 fine for the most part even if it does feel forced.The art is high quality for its time, I\'d say it looks very good, especially with background aesthetics and character design.

Watch for the fleeting ""d\'aww""s cause that\'s what you\'re gonna get.~ Cle ♥', ""If your the type of person looking for yuri.. well this isn't exactly yuri.Much more of a shoujo-ai.But its very cute !I haven't seen much girl/girl, but this is surely one of my favorites!The characters are alright, dealing with a bit of a girl love triangle, two of which are twins. But in the end, its very sweet and will make you feel very happy inside after watching it. And of course, dying for more.Hmmm.. what more can you say for a 7 1/2 minute anime? "", 'Informative Review.This is basically the start-up to what Candy Boy is all about, the direct prequel to the main series. It follows MCs Kanade and Yukino in their time at their new dorm, only for there to be a little turmoil between the sisters in a misunderstanding on love, involving a character who does appear frequently in the series, named Sakuya. It can be a little odd to see a series behave such a way without a lot to work with, due to lack of character depth, however, Candy Boy is a simple series that in actuality doesn\'t need much to make it enjoyable, that...is part of what specifically makes Episode 0 fine for the most part even if it does feel forced.The art is high quality for its time, I\'d say it looks very good, especially with background aesthetics and character design. OST through the episode isn\'t particularly memorable here, in honesty. Though ""Candy☆Boy by MEILIN"" is amazing.I watched this in release order, so I ended up watching this first when I first came into the series. I\'d advise going into the EX01 first if you want a smoother ride, though, there is nothing wrong with taking this first other than awkward transitions.

I decided it'd be a good time to clean house and watch them all since they were all pretty short.Turns out upon watching this that I actually had already seen it when I first watched Candy Boy, but now I know that for sure which feels good. My completionist mentality wouldn't let me sleep at night if I left some anime unwatched forever. I'll watch all 2000 on my plan to watch... someday.Aaaanyway this special is basically to set up the characters and central...conflict of the main series. There are these two sisters, they're gay for eachother... or maybe not it's left just vague enough that they don't get in trouble with censorship. And then a third girl gets into the mix to make in a nice love triangle. But then the twist is that the third girl likes the other sister than the one she was thought to like.If it was played for laughs it'd be a decent comedic premise, but this seems to want to be a serious drama... which is boring. 5/10 conflict of the main series.

Instead it is all about fluff, happiness and two people realizing that they are meant to be together. Basically it's a perfect short romance!This is a good introduction to yuri series. It’s not explicit at all and it's very sweet. Normally with incest especially, a topic popularly portrayed in anime, relationships often seem unnatural and forced, but here the interactions are smooth and natural. The sisters banter back and forth like really siblings but there is always that hint of underlying affection in their words and actions that clues you into their real feelings...for each other.For the short ten minute run time much is accomplished: the sisters stop being affectionate for a brief time, are conflicted over their feelings and then resolve their problems. It even adds in some comic relief which is quite well done with a stalker underclassmen.Speaking of characters this is one of the ONA’s highlights. Their design is well done and the characters are very expressive. Even though there is little dialogue, it is always easy to get a sense of the characters varying feelings from their expressions. Similarly, the acting is more expressive and is very entertaining. The actors convey a wide variety of different emotions and the sound effects are stand outs. The ending song is a bit dated, but the lyrics help frame the sisters feelings for each other and serve as a nice coda.The art is very natural looking, the colors are muted but the backgrounds are bright and cheery mimicking how the characters feel. It is almost photo-realistic. Due to the low budget, the camera angles are slightly unconventional. Sometimes there will be a few interspersed shots of perspiration or a glass of water which adds to the tone of the scene.Yes, it's nothing memorable but it doesn't try to be. It's about cute fluff and sisters growing together. It’s short, it’s pretty and it’s adorable.

It\'s sweet, cute and funny at times, thanks to the obsessive freshman, Sakuya, but, as expected, not much else comes from this ONA. Except for, you know, the Candy Boy anime series.The art is great, and, apart from the adorable-but-leaves-you-high-and-dry gl which I\'d like to see developed into something more, it\'s the biggest factor that makes me want to watch the follow-on series.The characters are designed well physically, but their...personalities are not overly shown because of the short time frame.
