Tailenders,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6162/Tailenders,"[""I never thought that a single 27 min episode would be good enough for a movie.. stunningly enough Tailenders broke the record in this case, utilizing a meager half an hour this movie gave me an unexpectedly good and entertaining experience.The story is set in future when mankind plants Terraformers on planets in an attempt to colonize them. By going haywire Terraformers produce disastrous consequences of tectonic shifts, environmental changes and 'stampede'.The protagonist, having an engine as his heart,  must now participate in a precarious race with the Terraformer as the final destination risking his life to achieve what the Loser King couldn't 100...years ago.A rapid plot development and simple sci-fi imagination about racing form the core of the movie. The plot is fast-paced but not rushed and doesn't seem to have missing/skipped parts, I'm saying that most people can easily comprehend the plot and all its sci-fi inventions and appreciate it. Though its mainly focused on racing other aspects are also glimpsed at nicely. The fiction introduced is nothing extraordinary but original enough. However sometimes too many elements are introduced all at once in a not so impressive manner, the racing course also didn't impress me much.I hope you notice the use of contradictions..  'Loser King' as a hero and 'Tailenders' as great racers.. its amusingThe art and animation are good if not great. The art and graphics have been done really well with minimal use of CG. The action scenes are somewhat lacking in both depiction and direction, what is expected is sometimes skipped and the focus, angles and timing do not come out so well in some racing scenes. The rest of the animation is much better and impressive.Sound.. what to say , your usual noise of engines revving up, tires screeching and the like, nothing more, nothing less..I'd rather not comment on characters cause 27 minutes is hardly time enough to define and develop a character. If I had to say, I suppose the main cast are introduced pretty well even though they don't have an air of originality to them.All in all I think it has a decent plot which is skilfully executed with nice animation, for a time pass its really good. The sci-fi touch given is also nice and improves the potential, if developed further it can turn out to be really good. years ago.A rapid plot development and simple sci-fi imagination about racing form the core of the movie.

This 27-minute short movie has often been compared to the phenomenal full movie Redline, either favorably or derisively for being a copy. Oddly enough, Tailenders aired a mere month after Redline’s debut at the Locarno International Film Festival. It would’ve basically been impossible for it to have been made in that timeframe even as short as it is. It’s much more likely Tailenders took inspiration from what little they saw in the Redline pilot in January 2009, because if they went completely without encountering it than this...is surely anime’s greatest coincidence because of all the similarities. I also couldn’t even find the purpose of Tailenders’ creation. If it’s a movie for the sake of making one then I find it odd it’s Picograph studios’ only work. Perhaps it was a pilot to secure possible funding for a full movie or TV series. Whatever the case, Tailenders is here and it’s all we got.Personally, I couldn’t care less about the Redline similarities, intentional or otherwise. Actually, I couldn’t be happier. Redline is possibly my favorite anime movie ever, and anyone who feels strongly about it wishes they just had more of it. Imitation is the best form of flattery, and if the people behind Tailenders saw greatness in Redline then I applaud them for recognizing what worked and doing an impressive enough job at emulating it. All art has a genealogy somewhere.In the Tailenders universe, mankind and other various creatures have been forced to live nomadic lives on gigantic moving cities due to a malfunctioned terraforming machine that’s been going around wreaking havoc on the environment for years. High speed racing has been glorified, as these “Tailenders” scope out the constantly changing Earth as they race. Among these drivers is Shiro, who gets into a life-threatening accident just as he’s about to overtake the simulated ghost of his hero and rival, “Loser King”. Shiro is revived by the mechanic Tomoe, with his body changed and heart replaced with a new special engine. Shiro himself has now become the vehicle, and he and Tomoe aim to be faster than ever in the upcoming race. But Tomoe has her own grander goals in mind…The premise and reasoning behind a dystopian future that has forced humanity to constantly move is clever and an appropriate ideology and backdrop for the high speed breathless thrills. There’s also a simple theme of human and technology evolution that’s possibly inspired by Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann when taking a look at the lightning-struck animation style that bears similarities to that Gainax work and studio Trigger. Despite this setting construction almost no time is spent showing these moving cities and other than Shiro and Tomoe’s meeting practically all other time passes on the road.This is where the action is, and the prime time to talk about what draws people to Tailenders. If you’re looking to things similar to Redline, the subject of racing doesn’t matter as much as the art style and quality of animation. Tailenders features the same beautifully bright solid colors contrasted with heavy outlines and pitch black shading covering most sides of characters and objects. It’s absolute sugar sweets for the eyes, and the jagged character designs that all look drastically different from each other keep the environment constantly fresh and always bring out the stark coloring.The animation is generally smooth but is not nearly as fluid as Redline, which reveals a handicap of time, budgeting, or talent. This is where the similarities start to become differences as it’s clear where Tailenders falls shorter. There’s much less movement in scenes than Redline, and many shots attempt to draw less frames to portray movement more simply. This leads to a lot of frames of just straight traveling cars and moving backgrounds, and basic cockpit angles. The vehicles are CG, probably because they’re easier to reuse on frames. Although the cel-shading look to them with the solid color textures make them cohesive enough to the world’s general art style, the clear detachment the CG has from the 2D backgrounds further makes them look like objects being dragged across a screen. There just isn’t as much going on in each of Tailenders’ scenes as Redline. The music is hardly adrenaline pumping with just about only an average main theme and many scenes of silence, even behind the wheel. Sound editing is occasionally weak and combines with the simple display of movement to create scenes that could do better to have more impact. A particularly shocking example is the cheap slashing sound used when Goodspeed lands on top of the missile shooters that has almost no punch behind it. It dials down the excitement.Still, these are by no means too significant flaws when being compared to one of anime’s most technically visceral achievements. Other than audio, Tailenders is still an impressive visual piece that carries a light but likably eccentric enough storyline, world, and characters. For 27 minutes it meets an all-around quality that’s high enough for it to not run out of gas and be an easy recommendation for anyone looking for more anime with bright, sharp, and kinetic art direction. It may be carried by those things since Redline also has a more empathetic main character and even a more believable romance, but I would’ve been fine watching more of Tailenders as it is. It’s a pity things stopped here. is surely anime’s greatest coincidence because of all the similarities. I also couldn’t even find the purpose of Tailenders’ creation.

The ""Movie"" gives no time for character development, so as you go through the badly explained and clichéd script you don\'t even care about the characters. Also the movie seems to be extremely scruffy, I felt seeing a reupload of an all cut movie from youtube, actually I thought that was it and right after I was done I tried to find info about his missing pieces, but in fact there wasn\'t, that was the movie. But it has some good features of the movie, like the character design, I was really hyped to see what the pink haired girl would do in the...movie (Tomoe), I really enjoyed her design and I was expecting a very crazy girl who liked running, it also let me down, but that\'s my thing. Also the art that takes inspiration from the movie Redline, which was not so well executed. I saw this movie with high expectations because of an AMV and being similar to the movie Redline. Tailenders had the potential to be a good movie, so if it had more time to develop, it turned out to be disappointing. movie (Tomoe), I really enjoyed her design and I was expecting a very crazy girl who liked running, it also let me down, but that\'s my thing.

But there was another similar highly stylized and fast paced racing anime that was released around the same time. That went relatively unnoticed due to the attention that Redline was getting. That anime was Tailenders, released only two months after Redline.The plot takes place on planet Terulus, long after terraformers were used to try and repair the environment, only for them to go haywire and ravage the surface of the planet for centuries,...creating mutations to the wildlife and devastating earthquakes. Because of this, giant cities that could drive around the planets surface were created to house what was left of the population.One of the biggest past times is a racing competition. The dream of every racer to beat the track records held by Loser King, who disappeared a century ago. Shiro, one of the top racers, is horribly injured by a stampede. A mysterious woman walks in and offers him the chance to race again by replacing his heart with the engine from his own car. Soon, Shiro finds himself trying to win the Planet Redevelopment Race and try to beat the Loser King’s record times.Even though it’s not much longer than the average episode of a TV series, Tailenders tells a satisfying enough story in it’s run time that i didn’t really mind it’s length. Sure, it’s not going to have a lot of character or story depth, but Tailenders wasn’t trying to have that. The characters are well defined enough within the constraints of the short that all of them are enjoyable despite their simplicity.The short’s world definitely feels like a world despite simply being a setup for it’s plot. Tailenders wants to tell a simple fun story and it does it pretty well. I wish it was slightly longer so it’s pacing could be a bit better, but it’s a minor issue. I can’t really talk about the plot beyond the initial premise since it’s less than 30 minutes, but it was satisfying for what it is.The art and animation is top notch. The artstyle is a little more over the top than Redline’s, which helps differentiate it enough from Redline that you won’t mistake them from each other. I could see how it could grate on someone more than Redline’s artstyle, as it seems less refined. But it comes down to personal preference, and i had no problem with it.Tailenders didn’t have the budget or development time that Redline did, and it doesn’t quite reach the peaks that Redline did, but it does fit a lot into it’s scant 27 minutes long running time. It also didn’t recieve quite the same attention either, which is a shame, because Tailenders is definitely worth a watch, as it’s can be just as fun as Redline. creating mutations to the wildlife and devastating earthquakes.

Shinmai Maou no Testament,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23233/Shinmai_Maou_no_Testament,"[""This is the closest harem to Highschool DxD that I've seen yet. That is a plus in my opinion although everyone seems to either hate or like this series.The story is rather simplistic but overall interesting to see the relationships between the demons and hero clan. I think there is much more depth to be mined in future seasons.The OP and ED are very reminiscent of Highschool DxD in both the style of animation and type of music used. The music is good and fits the show.The characters are underdeveloped which is to be expected for a harem that consists of only...12 episodes. I think more complexity will be added in following seasons especially with the revelations of the last episode which does hint at a greater depth than previously seen.I enjoyed this series. It's very humorous and entertaining. The anime is heavily censored which is to be expected. I'm sure an uncensored version will be released eventually.

The okatu-pandering, aimless and empty Shinmai Maou no Testament fits the bill and is the latest offering to leave me speechless for the wrong reasons. It’s a self-insert power fantasy featuring a sad excuse for a cast, the bulk of which whose sole purpose is attempting to procreate with a main character who has the charisma of beige wallpaper. Perhaps the most laughably bad aspect of Testament is that there is an attempt to weave a plot into...the show, because the sole purpose of the events that take place is to force characters into cringe-inducing sexual acts with each other. It’s repulsive. Not a skerrick of Testament is memorable and not one facet of it gives it any redeeming qualities. It is an example of the dregs of what the anime industry has to offer.Shinmai Maou no Testament follows the story of Basara who has two “step-sisters” (you be the judge of that), Mio and Maria, move into his house. When Basara’s father departs overseas it leaves the three alone in the house and who knows what wacky adventures our trio will get up to! There’s more than meets the eye when it comes to the new arrivals and Basara gets caught up in a world of boobs, magic, swords, boobs, heroes, demons and more boobs quicker than you can say “Oh god why did I start watching this train wreck?”. There is honestly little more that can actually be said for the story. Seriously. That synopsis I gave you might actually be myself overselling the complexity of it. Some opposing force shows up against our characters but there’s little to ever worry about because you know that fanservice is number one on the agenda – not story – meaning there is no way the ‘writers’ (a term I’d use loosely) would risk doing anything to put a dint in the harem.I have no sense of what the characters are even fighting for. There’s some ham-fisted backstory plus a generic ‘redemption’ driving force for our main character. Apparently we’re supposed to empathise with a group of people we know practically nothing about. That’ll work, for sure.The solution to every complication is predictable. Literally every female character in the show is eye candy and nothing more. Any attempt at the storyline in becoming more ‘serious’ is instantly cancelled out by a laughable plot point that leaves every female character degraded and at the mercy of our MC’s libido. All Shinmai Maou no Testament does is act as a lowest-of-the-low sexual fantasy that positions men as an all-conquering force, who without women cannot function or find their own sense of direction. It’s demeaning and insulting. Many anime have been guilty of such a thing in the past but this show has found a way to kick it up to a new level.Speaking of those female characters, they’re all there to fulfil a particular fetish that exists in the audience. Hair colours, statue, breast size, personality traits – all of which feel cookie cutter and like you’ve seen them 57 times before. The fact that there’s not an inch of depth to them only makes this laziness in their design all the more prominent. Make sure you include the infallible MC to really sell how much effort you put into making something of merit!I did not have a single positive experience upon viewing Shinmai Maou no Testament.Do not watch Shinmai Maou no Testament. the show, because the sole purpose of the events that take place is to force characters into cringe-inducing sexual acts with each other.

Basara is told by his father to protect his ""sisters"" because they are now family. All seems well until all 3 ""siblings"" discover that none of them are who they appear to be.  Basara and his father are actually exiles from the ""Hero Clan"" and are natural born...fighters whose mission is to stop and destroy evil demons. Meanwhile Mio is actually the daughter of the former Demon Lord, and Maria is a succubus who is protecting her. Basara decides to keep his promise with his father and protect his ""sisters"", which being that Mio is a demon lord\'s daughter, means that many other powerful demons are trying to get a hold of her....Oh! and Maria has Mio and Basara perform a master-servant contract that backfires causing Mio to become Basara\'s servant, who if she ever disobeys will be overcome with lustful desires until such time that he sexually pleasures her and calms her down...yeah... I know...Animation and sound quality aside...which were fine by the way, I thought. Definitely the least of my problems with this show.My issue with Testament is it just couldn\'t seem to decide what it wanted to be. Now there is no problem with mixing ecchi harem comedy with action... but the thing is Testament just did it so poorly, or rather I should say didn\'t mix them at all. They are almost like two completely separate entities to the same show... I mean here you have an awesome set up to a plot with an actually really great male MC. As a matter of fact I thought character wise he was so good I felt bad that he was wasted in this show. Then you add the concept of Maria being a playful succubus obviously calls out the ecchi in this (if you don\'t know what a succubus is it\'s a demon whose powers revolve completely around sex)... but to the extent that it does so and it\'s reasoning behind it is just completely unjustified. It just seems really out of place...Not to mention I feel it is extremely necessary to warn you that when an ecchi...or really ill say soft-core hentai scene takes place... be prepared for over half of your screen to be beamed with white or have a ridiculous picture covering up half the screen distracting you completely from whatever was supposed to be happening. Now DON\'T BE ALARMED! that\'s not your computer screwing up, it\'s just the animation company\'s idea of ""censoring"". Now I don\'t know if they did that on purpose for ""humor""... but it was definitely annoying.In terms of enjoyment I would have to split it into two different categories.As an action anime, honestly I loved it. I\'d give it a 8/10. It had really cool fight scenes with high intensity that really drew me in.However as a ecchi comedy I\'d say It was mediocre. 6/10 maybe. I thought all that stuff only took away from the story itself and just distracted me from what was important.Would I recommend this show? Maybe... depends on what you\'re looking for. Action? Yes if you can deal with the poor comedy and ecchi parts in between.Ecchi Harem? I mean... honestly no, simply because you won\'t be able to enjoy it because of the ridiculous censors... fighters whose mission is to stop and destroy evil demons.

I mean... honestly no, simply because you won\'t be able to enjoy it because of the ridiculous censors...', '(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)The Testament of Sister New Devil seems like a rather generic anime. And for the most part, it is: there is no shortage of magic, nakedness, and harems within it. But it at least attempts to play with the theme of protection. Which is funny when you think about it; in an anime whose strongest aspect is the very “ecchi” it thrives on, you’d think that “protection” would be the furthest idea from its mind. Regardless, this is what the show hones in on. Protecting the things you love, especially those people dearest to you, is...something that we all do whether we know it or not. And while this one tries its best to flaunt this motif, the majority is mediocrity that suppresses any sense of worth it may have.STORYTestament pits Basara Toujou as the male lead. One day, he obtains two new “relatives,” Mio Naruse and Maria Naruse. As events pile up and paths cross, it’s revealed that Mio holds the greatest demonic power within her, Maria is her succubus servant, and Basara is an exiled man of the Hero Clan.If Testament does anything correctly, it is in the “ecchi” service that it provides. While nearly all of it is censored, what is shown and what can be inferred is some of the greatest to grace the medium. The show refuses to hold back; it never shows full-blown genitalia but it gets rather close to crossing that line, making the anime nearly pornographic in its presentation. Not just kissing but make-out sessions; not just showing breasts but fervently fondling them; and not just holding hands but hip grinding, butt squeezing, and even orgasms. Testament revels in the sex that permeates the show, going so far as to make one of its key plot points follow down this path. This plot point of course being the “master-servant” pacts that cause a disobedient servant to undergo immense pleasure. And then, in order to strengthen said pact, going through with these perverted actions “deepens” the relationship, making both people come out for the better. Literal and figurative hot shower scenes, body-on-food eating, a succubus whose proportions grow; the diversity of the “ecchi” scenes and the originality of many of them easily demonstrate its overall execution in the genre it itself made a pact with.As talked about in the introduction, Testament’s prominent – and only – theme is the idea of protection. Or more specifically, protecting the ones you love. Many of the characters have this sense of righteousness about them: Yuki wishes to protect Basara, Maria wishes to protect her mother, and Basara wishes to protect everyone. Surprisingly, the show here as well showcases quite the range in relation to its theme. Protecting someone sometimes means doing what has to be done as opposed to what is the right thing to do. Maria’s betrayal to save her mother is an easy example. It may also involve a sense of self-lost protection; Basara, through his actions, protects those around him but makes others incapable of returning the favor. The structure of the series follows essentially three separate arcs, each focusing on one of the main girls and their reason for protecting. The developments therein always lead to the same outcome – Basara adding one more woman to his ever-growing harem – and the actual exploration of the theme isn’t expansive – the morality mentioned previously isn’t discussed nor is there ever any “bad” conclusions – but Testament is at least consistent in its thematic presence from start to finish.ANIMATIONTestament’s art is a testament to boringness. While the protection theme was inching towards the generic field, it’s here where the anime begins to fully find itself in. Many of the locations visited are typical, tried, and tired: a school classroom here, a dark forest there; the anime, despite having all of these characters from various backgrounds, never provides the audience with a look at anything even remotely interesting. And while the “ecchi” moments are top-tier, most of them are sadly censored. Not so much that it is impossible to discern what is occurring behind the miniature caricatures they use to hide it, but enough to make you frustrated that all of the goodness is being kept just out of reach.The character designs fair a bit better in comparison to the art style that surrounds them. Sticking to its sexy roots, the women are often clad in such a way as to make their signature assets that much more appealing to look at. Mio’s black-and-white school outfit with long, red hair helps to magnify her breasts that much further. Yuki’s skirt is just short enough to reveal her butt when needed. And adult Maria’s garb is black-and-pink – a sultry combo – that doesn’t leave much room for the imagination. Basara’s design – cuts and scars across his entire body – provides him with the physical evidence needed to demonstrate just how much he is willing to protect those he loves.When looking at the show’s actual animation, it’s a tougher call. The anime can bring its game during certain action sequences, and especially so during the “ecchi” material. But since these are usually seen about once or twice per episode, the majority of what the anime offers in terms of movement is average.CHARACTERSWhen it comes to Testament’s cast, many don’t see a huge amount of development. Basara is far and away the weakest character and isn’t an interesting person in the slightest. He’s the super strong, super nice, and super gung-ho guy who exists as nothing more than the leader of the harem. He’s the same from start to finish, seeing only minimal investigation in the form of a small flashback. Meaning, while he exemplifies the theme that the anime focuses on, his actual character suffers through monotony and severe lack of development. The majority of the cast is treated the same way; that is, as not really changing over the course of the season despite having their own “arcs.” Part of the problem is due to the segmentation of the season itself and due to their overall powers. The characters being a trained succubus, a renowned sword fighter, a daughter of the Devil, and a man who is capable of reversing any attack against him are unfortunately written into the corner of “no improvement” rather early on. However, all is not completely lost on the girls, for Basara does aide each of them in becoming a better person.Maria is a mommy’s girl; she is conflicted given the position she was forced to take, and attempts to do everything on her own. But Basara proves that sometimes, it is necessary to rely on others, because it just isn’t possible for us to do everything by our lonesome. Yuki fights the demons due to her Hero Clan status, but she isn’t blind. She’s honorable, following her own heart when dealing with the situations she faces instead of mindlessly following the “rules” set around her. This thinking was directly inspired by Basara who, as her role model, does the same; fights for what is right as opposed for what is “correct.” And Mio starts off pretty dependent, leveraging other people’s good-will to get her through the day, but still refrains from connecting with anyone too seriously due to her own dark past and familial loss. So through Maria’s guidance, Yuki’s friendship, and Basara’s love, she realizes that she doesn’t have to be alone. In essence, she “opens up” to those around her, becoming closer to those who had been close to her the entire time.While the show doesn’t put too much thought into nearly all of its characters, it still manages to inject a bit of direction when looking at each of their move-sets. In essence, their outward actions symbolize their inner person. Maria uses hand-to-hand combat because she’s very hands on in her dealings with people as a succubus. Instead of fists, Yuki uses a sword that mirrors her personality: sharp, direct, yet extremely elegant. Mio’s fiery magic is easy to see; it reflects not just the immense power she has within her, but also the passion she has for her closest friends. And Basara’s “Banishing Shift,” his ultimate move, defines who he is deep down. That is, his ability to completely give back any move thrown his way matches how much he gives back to others through his constant need to protect the ones around him. The rest of the cast can be looked at in a similar fashion, demonstrating that the anime can appeal not only to our hormones but to our brains, too.SOUNDTestament’s weakest component is arguably the sound that makes up nearly all that it does. The opening theme isn’t so much grating on the ears as it is just painfully boring. And it knows this; it tries to make it more enticing by adding in faux-nakedness here and there, but the visuals aren’t enough to distract the audience from having to listen to the generic beat and overdone guitar playing. The ending theme is even worse, containing a lot of singing, choirs, and drums that all mash together in such a way that nothing seems to be working. In other words, it’s at this point that the anime’s inability to focus on what it does well – the “ecchi” and sexiness – begins to easily show.Much of the original soundtrack contains pieces that are mired in heavy use of “powerful” instruments and group singing, in order to give everything a grandiose feel. It could even be said that the direction of the music is meant to sound “church-like,” given that the anime is entitled after portions of the Bible. At the same time, many of the tracks contain guitars, saxophones, and other, ambient instrumental effects that heighten “the mood” and therefore the sense of sexuality that permeates the anime during most scenarios. There are sad piano pieces for the melancholic times, flute arrangements for the laidback ones, and mysterious string tracks that fill those unknown moments. Unfortunately, like the OP and ED it finds itself between, nothing within the OST is memorable, let alone impactful, making much of what it sets out to do go unappreciated and therefore ends up unappealing.And in order to round it all out, the voice acting for the show is average at best. There are no special shout-outs to be had.ENJOYMENTThis one is all about the “ecchi” content. Being a fan of such material myself, it was definitely a pleasant surprise when the show decided to go as far as they were going with nearly all of its offerings. It was nice to witness not just the daringness of the show but also the uniqueness of the content, contrasting hard with the rest of the generic aspects of the anime. I’m a big fan of Mio, adult Maria, and especially Yuki, so watching them on-screen being lewd every now and again was never a sight for sore eyes.But while such promiscuity is very well-done, I never found myself to like anything else. The action sequences are a lot of explosions here and there, the emotional events never moved me, and while it tries to be comedic at times, it isn’t that funny, with maybe an elicited laugh at very specific moments. A large portion of the anime are long stretches where these kinds of developments occur, and when they were going on, I really just wanted it to back to doing what it did best – employing Yuki and the other girls in the “ecchi” antics.While The Testament of Sister New Devil finds itself muddied by mediocrity, not everything within is entirely lost. The sexual content is executed nicely, its theme remains relevant both with the narrative and the development of the characters, and the designs of the girls are enticing to see. But it’s all dragged down by a less-than-stellar main male lead, an uninspired art style, and lackluster music that, when all combined, concocts a show that is simply run-of-the-mill.SUMMARYStory: Good, fantastic “ecchi” elements, and consistent yet unexplored themeAnimation: Fine, boring art style, very nice character designs, average actual animationCharacters: Fine, Basara is bad, Maria, Yuki, and Mio experience some development, and everyone has purposeful abilitiesSound: Bad, lame OP and ED, below average soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Fine, the “ecchi” is great to watch but nothing else isFinal Score: 5/10 something that we all do whether we know it or not.

You have been warned.Also, this review is a review for the whole series uptill now (Season 1 and OVA + Season 2 and OVA)Where do I even start with this anime...Story: 2/10Season 1: It\'s been about a week since I\'ve finished this series, so I don\'t remember the exact story very well. Here\'s what I know. Mio\'s (MC) parents (apparently Demon Lords) abandon her to keep her safe from threats and let their friends(?) raise her. Things go on smoothly until some devil finds out that Mio is being raised by someone else. They find out who and kill them....Mio is once again left alone, and runs away, but this time with the help of a newly met servant. After that, she meets a guy who knows who she is and agrees to raise her along with Basara (his son). From then on, there\'s a nude scene in almost every episode. And don\'t blame me for getting some parts of the story wrong. I\'m a guy. How the hell can I concentrate on the story with the show these \'siblings\' put on.OVA 1: Oh boy, shit gets real here. Basara is invited home by his hot teacher. She tries to seduce him, both get into the bath and you know what happens next. ""But wait Ryan, I am pretty sure I\'ve heard a story like this before"" - You, the reader say. Yes you have. It\'s the story of every teacher/student porn.Season 2: 13 episodes in and I thought I knew what to expect from the series in season 2. But they still surprise you. In episode 7, they have a full-fledged orgy before battle. As if the anime wasn\'t hentai enough already.OVA 2: OVAs nowadays exist for fanservice. That\'s all this OVA was. Except that it was extremely close to being a hentai, as was the whole franchise.Art: 3/10Sound: 2/10The art and animation were pretty mediocre, except in Season 2 and it\'s OVA. They put little to no effort in animating the Giant Spirits well. And in some scenes in the OVA, Mio\'s face was distorted.Character: 1/10I dislike many Harem characters, but this series takes the cake. Every harem has girls trying to seduce the guy. But this one.... it has them butt naked trying to do so. The girls were so dense. Everytime they have an orgy, they call it \'getting stronger\'... It sounds absolutely pathetic imo.Enjoyment: 2/10Overall: 1/10I guess this was more of a rant than a review. Anyways, the excessive nudity and borderline hentai in this anime makes it one of the worst anime out there. You would be better off watching real hentai.

Not only was the story unoriginal, but they also made the anime before Highschool DxD BorN's first episode. Though, a lot of people do enjoy these types of stories (mainly because of the fan-service and harem, duh) and personally I do too, but without too much fan-service. The ecchi was basically borderline-hentai and...overdone. If you want to watch ecchi, you might as well just watch a hentai. The action was actually quite decent, because the main character had a special ability. I do wish that the dad had more screen-time, because he's a total badass. The anime doesn't just start with a massive harem, but it starts to progress throughout the anime.Art: 7/10To me, the art looked like it was illustrated back in 2006 and someone found them in the drawers and decided to make that into an anime in 2015. Though, the animation was quite smooth and one thing that bothered me was how similar Issei and Basara looked a like. Mio looked a bit like Rias, but  Mio looks younger. Also, there was one part where they censored a FUCKING TONGUE-KISSING SCENE. What the actual fuck?Sound: 7/10The OST was quite nice, sometimes it made the scene epic or made it more sad (or even more erotic). It fit the scenes nicely and wasn't overused or loud. I actually liked both OP and ED, but the OP more so than the ED. The OP is rock mixed with piano that fit the theme of the anime. The ED has a very calm and happy tune mixed in with rock. The episodes I didn't watch had subs for the ED but I'm sure they were talking about dreams and love (also, the ED animation had titties without nipples. If you're putting titties at the end, then you might as well either censor it or put nipples on it, or else they look like some hybrid alien.)Character: 5/10Toujou Basara, the hero and the protagonist of the story. A very cliche character for a harem anime. If you're a hero and the protagonist, then you're likely to have 5 million chicks sucking you off every minute. Basara is a man who does anything to protect his 'sisters', thus making him a very kind person. As the anime progresses, he gets stronger. 'Naruse Mio, the soon-to-be Demon Lord. Well well well, another cliche character. I've seen a lot of anime where the demon lord and the hero aren't fighting each other. In fact, sometimes they both fall in love with each other. She relies on Maria a lot, thus making her weak, even though she's a Demon Lord. Sometimes, whenever she's enraged, she does use her real strength. She grows much more attached to Basara as the anime progresses. Mio is really fucking useless though.Naruse Maria, the loli-succubus. Aren't succubus supposed to have the desired body to attract male?? Why does Maria have a childish figure?

Don\'t get me wrong, I really like High School DxD. But I like this one better. Why, you ask?Story is okay. It makes more sense to me than the HS DxD one.

And out of the blue, he tells him that he got with a new woman and that she has two daughters and now he has two...sisters.

I suppose the thinking was that actual hentai is too gratuitous, so I wanted to see the titties of actual characters that have personalities in more serious shows – I wanted to feel like I’m getting away with something. It’s been a while, so I can’t really relate anymore, but I kind of get it.As it stands, Shinmai Maou is tied with Masou Gakuen HxH...as the most openly lecherous show I’ve ever seen that stands on a knife’s edge. A light breeze could tip it over into being hentai. That said, unlike Masou Gakuen, I did in fact not hate it. The basic notion of how the fanservice works is almost identical, but again, it feels less gratuitous, which makes it a touch more enticing, and additionally, the fact that the first softcore scene is not literal sexual assault on an unconscious girl helped – a lot.Insofar as the cast of girls is concerned, I appreciate the fact that the protagonist goes on a type of Pokémon hunt collecting girls of every kind, from every species, the best ones from each arc. Unfortunately, unless this is baby’s first ecchi anime, this harem is unlikely to be memorable enough to monopolize your fantasies for years to come. There’s not a single girl that I didn’t feel I hadn’t seen before, written better elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the notion that you will be tempted to adopt a permanent waifu from this anime is a dubious proposition at best.For starters, the main heroine is nothing to write home about. She’s the same flame-wielding tsundere with red/pink hair and pigtails I’ve seen in several other shows. Stella Vermillion from Chivalry of a Failed Knight could very well be her literal clone. Even their school uniforms are practically identical. The one thing unique to her is her extremely irritating catchphrase: “I’ll kill you a hundred times over!” Sure enough, that could be a badass line if she were in any position to be able to actually do it, but for most of the series’ run, she’s surprisingly weak and useless, so it just rings hollow, and she repeats it ad nauseam.Furthermore, the secondary heroine that gets introduced is somehow even more uninspired. I swear, every fucking show has this exact character, the frigid childhood friend with short(er) light blue hair, a (white) ribbon above her bangs, typically unemotional, but very aggressive in her flirtations with the MC, extremely possessive of him, and generally has some kind of ice powers of some sort. It’s baffling how many characters fit this exact description, down to the cosmetics.Most of the other waifus run the gamut from meh to okay, with 2 meaningful exceptions, one of them being the absolute Best girl with a capital B. You cannot change my mind.The protagonist, for a nice change, is actually kind of interesting, being that he is an actual badass, and I don’t even mean that he is a Kirito-clone who is overpowered simply because the author wants wish-fulfillment. You can immediately tell that this dude is not an average Joe from his design alone. The guy is full of scars all over his body, so you get a sense that he can throw down from more than just the fact that he has a spiky haircut. His power escalation is full of ass-pull, of course, but at the very least, he never feels unbalanced. He is always just about as powerful as it’s appropriate for him to be at any given point in the narrative.By far the most surprising thing about this series was the OST. In the main, it was pretty forgettable, but it surprised me with some pretty fantastic orchestral crescendos in the show’s more climactic moments. I’m going to lay this out as plainly as I can, an anime as trashy as Shinmai Maou had no business having music this good. The OST was composed by Yasuharu Takanashi, the same guy who composed the music of Fairy Tail. This smut did not deserve him.The premise is thus. Basara lives alone with his dad. One day, daddy-o drops a bombshell on him. He’s getting remarried! But wait, there’s more. Basara is getting 2 younger step-sisters out of the deal, Mio, a redhead with huge tits, and Maria, a silver-haired loli. Surprise, though, daddy-o was magically brainwashed and the whole remarriage jazz is a lie. It turns out that Mio and Maria are demons, Mio being the literal daughter of the previous Demon Lord, and they fled to the human realm for reasons of political persecution. Having already brainwashed the dad, they try to do the same thing to Basara and have him permanently leave the house. Hold on, double whammy! It transpires that Basara is also not a regular human, but a member of the Clan of Heroes, so he hits them with a hard pass and tells them to get the fuck out of his house. Alas, once outside, they get attacked and in their moment of need, Basara takes pity on them, saves their lives, and decides to let them back into his home and they all lived happily ever after!Naturally, Basara’s dad was fully aware of what was happening, he just played along with the brainwashing theatrics for the sake of offering Mio asylum. You find out later that the guy is the literal strongest Hero to ever live and he is famous among the Demon Realm as a sort of apocalyptic figure, so it makes literally no sense that, of all the humans in this world, they would pick this guy to scam, but here we are. The point is made very clear that Basara and his pops being heroes comes as a surprise to Mio and Maria, which would explain everything, but given how legendary you later find out big poppa is, it’s hard to believe they wouldn’t have known. Like, you would think that the moment they decided to flee to the Human Realm and find some poor son a bitch whose house to steal, their #1 priority would be to make sure “Ok, but whatever we do, let’s make double, triple, quadruple, quintuple sure that we do not fuck with the literal singular one (1) human on this planet we should never fuck with under any circumstance.” Well, whatever, I guess this isn’t the kind of show you’re supposed to think too deeply about.So far you might be thinking, welp, that sounds like a pretty standard set-up for a fairly generic action show. Where’s the porn come in? And to be fair, Shinmai Maou almost manages to be a decent action show. I always say that my litmus test for lewd anime is whether or not I would watch them in the absence of the lewd content, and while I would personally not watch this, there’s no doubt in my mind that there are people who would enjoy it and get really into it. That is to say that there is an actual story there, such as it is.The lewd aspect comes from the nature of his relationships with Mio, Maria, and the other girls who eventually join his harem. To begin with, the series is as basic as they come. Basara is constantly accidentally walking in on the girls while they’re changing or bathing, always tripping over their tits or panties, the works. The introduction of the honest-to-God main heroine is Basara inadvertently walking in on her while she’s on the toilet taking a piss – I wish I were joking. It essentially starts out as an as middle-of-the-road ecchi show as they come that transparently has no interest in stepping even a single toe outside of the conventions of the genre. If that sounds just as tired and exhausting to you as it does to me, then feel free to not give this a second thought and skip it. That said, generic as though the writing may be, it does treat you to a litany of fairly generous scenes of top nudity, so if that’s what you’re looking for, by all means, you will find what you seek.Still, “accidents” can only go so far in keeping the fanservice fun and sexy. As such, before long, we get to the actual in-universe mechanic that turns the softcore scenes into an actual plot device. Through some kind of pretzel logic, the narrative puts Basara in a position of having to form a magical Master-Servant bond with Mio. There’s nothing deep or complicated about it. It’s a conspicuous attempt to satisfy a dominance fetish, and if you’re into that, you’ll have fun. The spicy part is that the greater the level of trust between Master and Servant, the stronger the magical bond becomes amplifying both of their power levels. How do you strengthen this magical Master-Servant bond? What a silly question! Why, you make your magical slave waifus cum, of course! Whenever it is convenient for the plot, the magical bond will make the girls pant like bitches in heat, feeling levels of sexual arousal to the point of being physically painful, and Basara has to attend to them in order to ‘relieve them’ – for their own good, you understand – and they’ll incessantly say stuff like “Dominate me!” and “Please make me submit!” to him. Like I said, Shinmai Maou sets out to scratch a specific itch, and, oh, me, oh, my, does it ever scratch it.As a quick sidenote, the initial in-universe reason that is given for Basara forming his first contract with Mio is in order for him to, uh, always be able to know where she is in an emergency, 'cause they're, uh, at war, and you never know when she might, uh, get kidnapped, so this is, uh, a totally reasonable and necessary precaution. Ok, that’s all fine and dandy, but then a demon shows up and actually kidnaps Mio and takes her to the Demon Realm. When Basara tries to use his magical slave GPS to locate her, he remarks that he can locate his other waifus, but not Mio, because she’s inside some kind of barrier or some such contrivance. To which, I must ask, then what the fuck is the point of the magical slave contract in the first place? To be sure, the trust-level-power-up gets added later as an additional mechanic in order to justify his other magical slave waifus, but for the first one, the main heroine, the given reason is the magical GPS, so he can always find and save her, and the very first time that becomes necessary, it doesn’t work. Good on you, brodie, you can slave GPS locate all the waifus except the literal solitary one you've made a contract with with the express purpose of locating her. Winning!Fortunately, the magical slave waifu mechanic serves to make all the girls explicitly be part of Basara’s harem, so they stop bickering and just indulge in their polygamous relationship. This is probably just a consequence of me being too old for this shit, but I no longer have any patience for long, drawn-out sequences where the girls just stand around and argue about whom the dick belongs to. It’s like, give me a break, it’s an ecchi harem show, just shut up and show me your tits. Word of warning, there is a fair amount of that infantile quarreling going on in the first couple of episodes, and I considered deleting myself in fear that this would be the status quo going forward, but it goes away fairly quickly.The same can be said about Mio’s tsundere shtick. From the moment I mentioned she’s a tsundere, if you know the first thing about the archetype, you might have had alarm bells going on in your head. Does this mean that in spite of her liking him and him saving her life numerous times, she still acts like she hates him and becomes violent towards him every time she’s embarrassed? Yes, and it’s just as stupid and cliché as it sounds, but like I said, that goes away fairly quickly, too. After about 4 or so episodes, she mostly mellows out and becomes a loving harem centerpiece. She still occasionally has her obligatory tsundere outbursts, but they’re not directed at Basara. You’ll see.The only one who bothered me fairly consistently, ironically, was Basara himself. I’m talking about the way his sexuality is portrayed. Shounen protagonists are generally portrayed as mostly asexual, presumably because the worry is that Goku and Naruto would otherwise teach young boys to be overly sexually aggressive and harass girls. Let’s table the discussion about whether or not that holds water for another time. The point here is that this is not a typical shounen. This is explicitly a harem story about engaging in lewd acts with multiple women. What bothers me is that the anime wants to have its cake, and eat it, too, by trying to have Basara’s sexuality simultaneously accommodate the young shounen audience and the adult audience, so he will evidently be turned on and enjoy himself during every lewd scene, but maintains a quasi-puritan attitude towards any mention of lewd behavior during every other scene. At times, he seems genuinely scandalized by the suggestion that he ought to ‘advance’ his relationships with the girls by being even lewder and kinkier with them, clutching his pearls. He often comes across as beleaguered whenever he has to ‘relieve’ the girls, like it’s somehow a chore, as if he doesn’t actually want to do it, but ugh, fine, *eye roll*, it’s for a noble cause, so he’ll do it because he has no choice. But then whenever it comes down to it, he’s greedily sucking on their titties within 2 seconds flat and transparently having the time of his life. The fuck is up with that?Again, I understand why Ichigo doesn’t openly thirst for Inoue – as he should, mind you – but like I said, I get it. However, that kind of restraint has no place here. This is an explicitly sexual show. Nobody is confused about what they’re here for. It's ok. Just let him be openly horny for them. There’s nothing weird about it. Ain’t nobody here for moralisms about sexual modesty.When it comes down to it, the ultimate question is just how sexually explicit is Shinmai Maou? As it so happens, it might surprise you to learn that the source material, the light novel this is adapted from, is just straight up porn. In order to increase the rank of their Master-Servant bonds, he has sex with all of the girls, creampies, all manner of kinks, the whole 9 yards. Shockingly, that’s not really kosher for TV broadcast. Consequently, all of the sex is removed from the anime and all you get is just endless rubbing and fondling of erogenous zones, because like any worldly gentleman would know, if you grab a chick’s tits and just sort of, uh, move them up and down, she will totally scream in extasy and cum. That’s totally how it works. I think I heard Andrew Tate explain that in a podcast. Source: Just trust me, bro.To be fair, nipples are fair play and there are copious amounts of nipples sucking, even a scene where a chick lactates, but that’s about as explicit as it gets. You can easily tell the scenes where they were originally supposed to have sex, because they’ll be on top of each other in missionary or doggy, but still wearing their underwear or pants, so no penetration, not even implied. This begs the question of why they didn’t just adapt it into a straight-up hentai, but I suppose there’s more shekels to be made from TV broadcast.There are only 2 instances of implied oral sex in the show, one in an OVA, one in the main show. In the OVA, one of the girls kneels in front of the MC, she grabs her own tits, and starts moving them up and down in midair, simulating a titty fuck, after which the screen quickly fades to black. Next scene, the MC is just coming to, indicating that he had passed out. I checked the LN, and she does indeed blow him at that point, and I think it’s fair to consider it anime canon, as well. The other scene is a fleeting shot in season 2. While Basara is having a rubbing and fondling orgy with all of his waifus – in preparation for an upcoming big fight, of course, it’s all in order to power up, get your brain out of the gutter – there’s a momentary shot of him with his face deep between one of the girls’ legs and she’s not wearing any panties. Again, I would submit that we can consider that another anime canon instance of oral.Like I said, I didn’t hate it, but I also did not enjoy it. With the sole exception of the OVA oral scene, I found nothing in this show exciting enough to, so to speak, take me there. One scene is a poor trade for 9 hours of my time, but it felt longer. Your call.P.S.: I mentioned that Mio becomes Basara’s step-sister. To be absolutely crystal clear, there is no relation between them whatsoever, so there are no incest concerns. However, Mio insists on calling him onii-chan during their tender moments. Given how popular step-something-or-other porn has become in recent times, chances are good to fair you would be into that, but I just thought I would mention in just in case. I can imagine that it could be jarring depending on how averse you are to it, but I was able to reasonably easily ignore it, especially given that Mio wasn’t the best girl I was rooting for, anyway. as the most openly lecherous show I’ve ever seen that stands on a knife’s edge. A light breeze could tip it over into being hentai. That said, unlike Masou Gakuen, I did in fact not hate it. The basic notion of how the fanservice works is almost identical, but again, it feels less gratuitous, which makes it a touch more enticing, and additionally, the fact that the first softcore scene is not literal sexual assault on an unconscious girl helped – a lot.Insofar as the cast of girls is concerned, I appreciate the fact that the protagonist goes on a type of Pokémon hunt collecting girls of every kind, from every species, the best ones from each arc. Unfortunately, unless this is baby’s first ecchi anime, this harem is unlikely to be memorable enough to monopolize your fantasies for years to come. There’s not a single girl that I didn’t feel I hadn’t seen before, written better elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the notion that you will be tempted to adopt a permanent waifu from this anime is a dubious proposition at best.For starters, the main heroine is nothing to write home about. She’s the same flame-wielding tsundere with red/pink hair and pigtails I’ve seen in several other shows. Stella Vermillion from Chivalry of a Failed Knight could very well be her literal clone. Even their school uniforms are practically identical. The one thing unique to her is her extremely irritating catchphrase: “I’ll kill you a hundred times over!” Sure enough, that could be a badass line if she were in any position to be able to actually do it, but for most of the series’ run, she’s surprisingly weak and useless, so it just rings hollow, and she repeats it ad nauseam.Furthermore, the secondary heroine that gets introduced is somehow even more uninspired. I swear, every fucking show has this exact character, the frigid childhood friend with short(er) light blue hair, a (white) ribbon above her bangs, typically unemotional, but very aggressive in her flirtations with the MC, extremely possessive of him, and generally has some kind of ice powers of some sort. It’s baffling how many characters fit this exact description, down to the cosmetics.Most of the other waifus run the gamut from meh to okay, with 2 meaningful exceptions, one of them being the absolute Best girl with a capital B. You cannot change my mind.The protagonist, for a nice change, is actually kind of interesting, being that he is an actual badass, and I don’t even mean that he is a Kirito-clone who is overpowered simply because the author wants wish-fulfillment. You can immediately tell that this dude is not an average Joe from his design alone. The guy is full of scars all over his body, so you get a sense that he can throw down from more than just the fact that he has a spiky haircut. His power escalation is full of ass-pull, of course, but at the very least, he never feels unbalanced. He is always just about as powerful as it’s appropriate for him to be at any given point in the narrative.By far the most surprising thing about this series was the OST. In the main, it was pretty forgettable, but it surprised me with some pretty fantastic orchestral crescendos in the show’s more climactic moments. I’m going to lay this out as plainly as I can, an anime as trashy as Shinmai Maou had no business having music this good. The OST was composed by Yasuharu Takanashi, the same guy who composed the music of Fairy Tail. This smut did not deserve him.The premise is thus. Basara lives alone with his dad. One day, daddy-o drops a bombshell on him. He’s getting remarried! But wait, there’s more. Basara is getting 2 younger step-sisters out of the deal, Mio, a redhead with huge tits, and Maria, a silver-haired loli. Surprise, though, daddy-o was magically brainwashed and the whole remarriage jazz is a lie. It turns out that Mio and Maria are demons, Mio being the literal daughter of the previous Demon Lord, and they fled to the human realm for reasons of political persecution. Having already brainwashed the dad, they try to do the same thing to Basara and have him permanently leave the house. Hold on, double whammy! It transpires that Basara is also not a regular human, but a member of the Clan of Heroes, so he hits them with a hard pass and tells them to get the fuck out of his house. Alas, once outside, they get attacked and in their moment of need, Basara takes pity on them, saves their lives, and decides to let them back into his home and they all lived happily ever after!Naturally, Basara’s dad was fully aware of what was happening, he just played along with the brainwashing theatrics for the sake of offering Mio asylum. You find out later that the guy is the literal strongest Hero to ever live and he is famous among the Demon Realm as a sort of apocalyptic figure, so it makes literally no sense that, of all the humans in this world, they would pick this guy to scam, but here we are. The point is made very clear that Basara and his pops being heroes comes as a surprise to Mio and Maria, which would explain everything, but given how legendary you later find out big poppa is, it’s hard to believe they wouldn’t have known. Like, you would think that the moment they decided to flee to the Human Realm and find some poor son a bitch whose house to steal, their #1 priority would be to make sure “Ok, but whatever we do, let’s make double, triple, quadruple, quintuple sure that we do not fuck with the literal singular one (1) human on this planet we should never fuck with under any circumstance.” Well, whatever, I guess this isn’t the kind of show you’re supposed to think too deeply about.So far you might be thinking, welp, that sounds like a pretty standard set-up for a fairly generic action show. Where’s the porn come in? And to be fair, Shinmai Maou almost manages to be a decent action show. I always say that my litmus test for lewd anime is whether or not I would watch them in the absence of the lewd content, and while I would personally not watch this, there’s no doubt in my mind that there are people who would enjoy it and get really into it. That is to say that there is an actual story there, such as it is.The lewd aspect comes from the nature of his relationships with Mio, Maria, and the other girls who eventually join his harem. To begin with, the series is as basic as they come. Basara is constantly accidentally walking in on the girls while they’re changing or bathing, always tripping over their tits or panties, the works. The introduction of the honest-to-God main heroine is Basara inadvertently walking in on her while she’s on the toilet taking a piss – I wish I were joking. It essentially starts out as an as middle-of-the-road ecchi show as they come that transparently has no interest in stepping even a single toe outside of the conventions of the genre. If that sounds just as tired and exhausting to you as it does to me, then feel free to not give this a second thought and skip it. That said, generic as though the writing may be, it does treat you to a litany of fairly generous scenes of top nudity, so if that’s what you’re looking for, by all means, you will find what you seek.Still, “accidents” can only go so far in keeping the fanservice fun and sexy. As such, before long, we get to the actual in-universe mechanic that turns the softcore scenes into an actual plot device. Through some kind of pretzel logic, the narrative puts Basara in a position of having to form a magical Master-Servant bond with Mio. There’s nothing deep or complicated about it. It’s a conspicuous attempt to satisfy a dominance fetish, and if you’re into that, you’ll have fun. The spicy part is that the greater the level of trust between Master and Servant, the stronger the magical bond becomes amplifying both of their power levels. How do you strengthen this magical Master-Servant bond? What a silly question! Why, you make your magical slave waifus cum, of course! Whenever it is convenient for the plot, the magical bond will make the girls pant like bitches in heat, feeling levels of sexual arousal to the point of being physically painful, and Basara has to attend to them in order to ‘relieve them’ – for their own good, you understand – and they’ll incessantly say stuff like “Dominate me!” and “Please make me submit!” to him. Like I said, Shinmai Maou sets out to scratch a specific itch, and, oh, me, oh, my, does it ever scratch it.As a quick sidenote, the initial in-universe reason that is given for Basara forming his first contract with Mio is in order for him to, uh, always be able to know where she is in an emergency, 'cause they're, uh, at war, and you never know when she might, uh, get kidnapped, so this is, uh, a totally reasonable and necessary precaution. Ok, that’s all fine and dandy, but then a demon shows up and actually kidnaps Mio and takes her to the Demon Realm. When Basara tries to use his magical slave GPS to locate her, he remarks that he can locate his other waifus, but not Mio, because she’s inside some kind of barrier or some such contrivance. To which, I must ask, then what the fuck is the point of the magical slave contract in the first place? To be sure, the trust-level-power-up gets added later as an additional mechanic in order to justify his other magical slave waifus, but for the first one, the main heroine, the given reason is the magical GPS, so he can always find and save her, and the very first time that becomes necessary, it doesn’t work. Good on you, brodie, you can slave GPS locate all the waifus except the literal solitary one you've made a contract with with the express purpose of locating her. Winning!Fortunately, the magical slave waifu mechanic serves to make all the girls explicitly be part of Basara’s harem, so they stop bickering and just indulge in their polygamous relationship. This is probably just a consequence of me being too old for this shit, but I no longer have any patience for long, drawn-out sequences where the girls just stand around and argue about whom the dick belongs to. It’s like, give me a break, it’s an ecchi harem show, just shut up and show me your tits. Word of warning, there is a fair amount of that infantile quarreling going on in the first couple of episodes, and I considered deleting myself in fear that this would be the status quo going forward, but it goes away fairly quickly.The same can be said about Mio’s tsundere shtick. From the moment I mentioned she’s a tsundere, if you know the first thing about the archetype, you might have had alarm bells going on in your head. Does this mean that in spite of her liking him and him saving her life numerous times, she still acts like she hates him and becomes violent towards him every time she’s embarrassed? Yes, and it’s just as stupid and cliché as it sounds, but like I said, that goes away fairly quickly, too. After about 4 or so episodes, she mostly mellows out and becomes a loving harem centerpiece. She still occasionally has her obligatory tsundere outbursts, but they’re not directed at Basara. You’ll see.The only one who bothered me fairly consistently, ironically, was Basara himself. I’m talking about the way his sexuality is portrayed. Shounen protagonists are generally portrayed as mostly asexual, presumably because the worry is that Goku and Naruto would otherwise teach young boys to be overly sexually aggressive and harass girls. Let’s table the discussion about whether or not that holds water for another time. The point here is that this is not a typical shounen. This is explicitly a harem story about engaging in lewd acts with multiple women. What bothers me is that the anime wants to have its cake, and eat it, too, by trying to have Basara’s sexuality simultaneously accommodate the young shounen audience and the adult audience, so he will evidently be turned on and enjoy himself during every lewd scene, but maintains a quasi-puritan attitude towards any mention of lewd behavior during every other scene.

Down to the presentation, character design and, to some extent, the storyline.  As such, Shinmai Maou no Testament basically includes devils, a harem for the MC, and the obligatory fan service.I would be lying if I say that I didn't enjoy the show it its entirety, there were some aspects of the show that were noteworthy at most. But overall, the story is just generic, bland and predictable. The fan-service, though obligatory in this kind of anime, does somewhat annoy me. There are even scenes that's...just borderline hentai! Speaking of which, I can't really blame the producers of the show of the amount of hentai present, since it is an 'indirect' element in the story. There are some decently presented fight scenes, but that alone just can't put this show in good light.CHARACTERSI don't know if it's the author's intentions to base of the show's characters to that of High School DxD, down to their designs. Either way, the characters are flat and are nothing really noteworthy, except for the fact that it's really similar to that of High School DxD's.AESTHETICS AND AUDIOThe visuals for the show are decent, to say the least. The characters are designed nice and the animation is mostly good. Overall just great.Same goes for the soundtrack.

Voice acting is also decent, fitting well into each respective character.CONCLUSIONI mention High School DxD numerous times in this review because that's the overall impression I had before and even after I watched Shinmai Maou no Testament, but to the lesser extent after watching since it has some originality.

And I even admire it for having planned a second season."", 'For the past couple years, the idea of Ecchi has changed dramatically, and what anime is allowed to showcase over the course of their runtime.  As the years went on, the idea of what is ecchi and what is hentai has been blurred to the point of almost crossing over into one another.  And here, I believe that we have an example of that right here.  Here it is, a review of Shinmai Maou no Testament, or The Testament of Sister New Devil, a show that I believe, like many others, could\'ve done better as hentai.Story (6.11/10): The story of...Sister Testament as I call it, follows the life of a boy named Toujou Basara, a boy who has a father who is remarried, gaining two little stepsisters in the process.  However, not is all that it seems, as it is later revealed that the two ""sisters"" that he now has is the budding demon lord, and a succubus.  In addition, Basara is hiding his own secret, hiding the fact that he is from the hero village, a place where they regulate the demons of the world.  With the two sides now coming together, what challenges will they face with demons seeking the demon lord\'s power?At first glance, sister testament seemed to be a little bit more than what the synopsis led one to believe.  The first episode wows you and honestly, surprised me with a complete 180 on the show\'s comedic feel by putting in an action scene that made me for a moment, rethink the entire series altogether.  It was that value of shock factor that really made me think for a moment that this was going to be a good show, and that I was in for one hell of a ride.  Quickly though, that idea became less and less prominent as the holes began filling up with regret rather than joy.While not only a series about action and the conflicts between protecting the new demon lord, Mio, Sister testament proudly shows itself (quite shamelessly might I add) to be an ecchi show in the worst possible way.  In the show, there is a technique or plot device known as the ""succubus curse"", where one person becomes the ""master"" over the other, allowing the two to become bonded and grow stronger together.  This one little detail manages to completely screw over the show plain and simple.  Because this plot device exists as the basis for the show, the actual plot for the series I feel becomes jaded more than anything.  Basically, the show makes it so that character strength is equal to the intensity and frequency of any kind of sexual act (as pointed out by the show\'s own characters) which can lead to, well...you get the idea.The biggest flaw that I felt about this series was just purely about how frequent and how starkingly intense this show\'s ecchi moments actually were.  They were done in such a way that they had to do a Tokyo Ghoul-style censorship involving censor bars that basically blocked so much of the screen that you can\'t see anything, and above all, made any sense of the actual storyline completely disappear.  In this show, it seemed like the perverted moments took priority over anything, and for a show that actually seemed to have a decent plotline and story elements, it just really felt disappointing cause all of that stuff that makes a good anime is put in the trunk.  (Not in the backseat, the trunk.)  In terms of actual story, the progression was moderately well done.  Because of just how often you\'ll see fanservice, ranging from a casual stripping of the clothes to full-on foreplay, the story won\'t come as often as one might think, and just isn\'t fleshed out as well as it should\'ve been.Overall, sister testament just failed to be any sort of proper story.  Because of its way of ""getting more powerful"", the show showcased sexual foreplay more than anything, making that the first thing anyone thinks of whenever they talk about this show.  In fact, I strongly believe that this series could\'ve done better, and should\'ve been a hentai more than anything.  In the end, the story suffered a lot from the show\'s ""other half"" and would\'ve done better had it not had the amount of fanservice that it did have.Overview:+  Decent story idea-   Story suffered greatly-   Fanservice overpowers the show GREATLYCharacters (5.55/10): The characters in sister testament similar to the story, don\'t really feel as fleshed out as they possibly could\'ve.  Rather, each one of them except a couple few don\'t get what they should\'ve gotten.First, we have Toujou Basara, our harem/main protagonist of the series.  As a member of the hero clan, Basara has the ability to summon down a weapon that he himself can wield, and uses it to fight the demons if need be.  Basara is more or less your standard harem protagonist.  While he does get a sort of backstory to explain his overpowered ability (cause every harem protagonist these days is either useless, or OP), Basara follows your cookie cutter troupe of the ""nice/good guy.""  Even though the girls he now lives with deceived him, he, throughout the series, makes a VERY conscious effort to protect them as their older brother.  (Even though that idea becomes completely redundant and useless by episode 2.)  He gets nervous in ecchi moments, he tries to protect his loved ones, you get the shtick.  Moving on.Naruse Mio is the main female protagonist in this series, aka the tsundere (cause main girl ALWAYS is one)/damsel in distress/one with the big breasts.  As the upcoming demon lord who had her throne taken after having to run away when her father was usurped, Mio serves more of the Zelda/princess Peach character of this series because she very often can\'t fend for herself, relying more on Basara for that job.  Since Mio follows the tsundere troupe to a certain degree, there really isn\'t much to say about her since it\'s such a stale troupe.Apart from these two, we have the succubus character, Maria, who is both one of the better characters in the series for having some slight character development, and the ultimate reason why this series went down the drain so fast.  (That\'s cause the curse was suggested and inflicted by her, ergo, it\'s her fault.)  In addition, we also have Yuki, the character who serves as the childhood friend of the MC with a stone cold face, as well as Takamine, the one character who I thought was really the only shining glory in this cast of tired, old troupes regardless of how little he shows up.In the end though, the cast of characters for Sister testament were more like a troupefest more than anything.  Characters aside from the ones I have already mentioned barely get any substantial screentime, so there\'s not much to mention there.  Because of this, aside from Takamine, the characters in this show really aren\'t anything special aside from being called what they are, troupes.Overview:+  One decent side character-   Tired anime troupes for charactersArt and Sound (6.50/10 and 7.00/10): The art for this series isn\'t really much to write home about.  There really isn\'t any standout animation for this series aside from maybe the magic casting circles, and the series overall doesn\'t really have much of an impact art-wise.What the art does have an impact on is simply how much of the series you can watch.  Because this show is so ecchi centered, the show wants to tell you that, a lot, like at least ten minutes per episode.  As I have mentioned before, the fanservice in this show is REALLY fanservicy to the point of it actually being sexual foreplay and should be considered hentai more than anything.  Yes, my dear readers.  This isn\'t ecchi, this...is hentai.  And because of this, the show as of right now blocks any form of watching it because you get censors, flashes of light, and darkened areas that essentially cover up the whole screen, not allowing you to witness of what is going on behind the chibi versions of the characters.  Because of this, watching this show can be quite frustrating because half of the time, you won\'t even get a clear picture as to what is going on.Sound for me was a sort of solace for this series, as we have Sweet Arms make the opening for this series, which is a track that I feel like was rather good.  While the show that it was tied to isn\'t really all that good, the opening itself is actually a rather good and actually somewhat memorable.  Of course, upon mentioning this, the rest of the soundtrack is mediocre at best and really doesn\'t stand up too much.Overview:+     Good Opening+/-  Standard animation-      Ecchi.  (Normally, I don\'t complain all that much about fanservice, but this is just simply too much.)-      OST didn\'t stand up on its ownPersonal enjoyment (5.00/10):  While I admit that I was wowed in the first 23 minutes of the series, the next 5.5 hours didn\'t really prove to be anything that I would bother rewatching or care for.  As the weeks went on, I was more disappointed in this show than anything because without all of the foreplay, this show actually could\'ve done really well.  It had groundwork that it could\'ve used, and a curse that was more of a curse on the show more than anything.What did I like about this show?If anything, it would have to be 1.  Takamine (cause honestly, he\'s the only character in this show I give a damn about).  And 2.  The action sequences.  While the animation was standard at best, the action sequences managed to for a moment, forget that you\'re watching a show that about a guy molesting his stepsisters (wait a second...that sounds familiar.), but rather one that also centers around the idea of action and heroes vs. demons, to some degree.What didn\'t I like about this show?The bland characters and the execution were really some big issues.  The story was never fleshed out enough for it to be different than any other hero vs. demon story, and the idea of the damsel in distress was really more of a bore than anything cause it just added another member to the useless female group, a group that we seriously don\'t need to add more characters into.  Above all though, I have to say, like what I\'ve been saying this entire review, the fanservice by far is the worst thing to come out of this series.  Not only is it prominent, so prominent that it\'s both ruined the story and my viewing experience, but because of the way it\'s presented, you probably won\'t be able to see it until a blu-ray release.Would I recommend this show?Honestly, I feel like this show is a waste of time.  Throughout its runtime, there wasn\'t anything that stood out.  The story wasn\'t made to be interesting enough, the characters were bland to all hell, and there wasn\'t anything fantastic aesthetic-wise.  Because of how strong the fanservice was, there really wasn\'t much to make note of, thus creating this series\' downfall.  (I still don\'t know why they\'re making a second season.  It boggles me.)  If you want some hentai-esque material, go ahead and watch this.  Make sure to get the DVD uncensored version because if you\'re watching for ecchi, I can guarantee that you that as of this review, you won\'t be able to anything but censor bars.Overview:  5.00/10 Sister Testament as I call it, follows the life of a boy named Toujou Basara, a boy who has a father who is remarried, gaining two little stepsisters in the process.  However, not is all that it seems, as it is later revealed that the two ""sisters"" that he now has is the budding demon lord, and a succubus.  In addition, Basara is hiding his own secret, hiding the fact that he is from the hero village, a place where they regulate the demons of the world.  With the two sides now coming together, what challenges will they face with demons seeking the demon lord\'s power?At first glance, sister testament seemed to be a little bit more than what the synopsis led one to believe.  The first episode wows you and honestly, surprised me with a complete 180 on the show\'s comedic feel by putting in an action scene that made me for a moment, rethink the entire series altogether.  It was that value of shock factor that really made me think for a moment that this was going to be a good show, and that I was in for one hell of a ride.  Quickly though, that idea became less and less prominent as the holes began filling up with regret rather than joy.While not only a series about action and the conflicts between protecting the new demon lord, Mio, Sister testament proudly shows itself (quite shamelessly might I add) to be an ecchi show in the worst possible way.  In the show, there is a technique or plot device known as the ""succubus curse"", where one person becomes the ""master"" over the other, allowing the two to become bonded and grow stronger together.  This one little detail manages to completely screw over the show plain and simple.  Because this plot device exists as the basis for the show, the actual plot for the series I feel becomes jaded more than anything.  Basically, the show makes it so that character strength is equal to the intensity and frequency of any kind of sexual act (as pointed out by the show\'s own characters) which can lead to, well...you get the idea.The biggest flaw that I felt about this series was just purely about how frequent and how starkingly intense this show\'s ecchi moments actually were.  They were done in such a way that they had to do a Tokyo Ghoul-style censorship involving censor bars that basically blocked so much of the screen that you can\'t see anything, and above all, made any sense of the actual storyline completely disappear.  In this show, it seemed like the perverted moments took priority over anything, and for a show that actually seemed to have a decent plotline and story elements, it just really felt disappointing cause all of that stuff that makes a good anime is put in the trunk.  (Not in the backseat, the trunk.)  In terms of actual story, the progression was moderately well done.  Because of just how often you\'ll see fanservice, ranging from a casual stripping of the clothes to full-on foreplay, the story won\'t come as often as one might think, and just isn\'t fleshed out as well as it should\'ve been.Overall, sister testament just failed to be any sort of proper story.  Because of its way of ""getting more powerful"", the show showcased sexual foreplay more than anything, making that the first thing anyone thinks of whenever they talk about this show.  In fact, I strongly believe that this series could\'ve done better, and should\'ve been a hentai more than anything.  In the end, the story suffered a lot from the show\'s ""other half"" and would\'ve done better had it not had the amount of fanservice that it did have.Overview:+  Decent story idea-   Story suffered greatly-   Fanservice overpowers the show GREATLYCharacters (5.55/10): The characters in sister testament similar to the story, don\'t really feel as fleshed out as they possibly could\'ve.  Rather, each one of them except a couple few don\'t get what they should\'ve gotten.First, we have Toujou Basara, our harem/main protagonist of the series.  As a member of the hero clan, Basara has the ability to summon down a weapon that he himself can wield, and uses it to fight the demons if need be.  Basara is more or less your standard harem protagonist.  While he does get a sort of backstory to explain his overpowered ability (cause every harem protagonist these days is either useless, or OP), Basara follows your cookie cutter troupe of the ""nice/good guy.""  Even though the girls he now lives with deceived him, he, throughout the series, makes a VERY conscious effort to protect them as their older brother.  (Even though that idea becomes completely redundant and useless by episode 2.)  He gets nervous in ecchi moments, he tries to protect his loved ones, you get the shtick.  Moving on.Naruse Mio is the main female protagonist in this series, aka the tsundere (cause main girl ALWAYS is one)/damsel in distress/one with the big breasts.  As the upcoming demon lord who had her throne taken after having to run away when her father was usurped, Mio serves more of the Zelda/princess Peach character of this series because she very often can\'t fend for herself, relying more on Basara for that job.  Since Mio follows the tsundere troupe to a certain degree, there really isn\'t much to say about her since it\'s such a stale troupe.Apart from these two, we have the succubus character, Maria, who is both one of the better characters in the series for having some slight character development, and the ultimate reason why this series went down the drain so fast.  (That\'s cause the curse was suggested and inflicted by her, ergo, it\'s her fault.)  In addition, we also have Yuki, the character who serves as the childhood friend of the MC with a stone cold face, as well as Takamine, the one character who I thought was really the only shining glory in this cast of tired, old troupes regardless of how little he shows up.In the end though, the cast of characters for Sister testament were more like a troupefest more than anything.  Characters aside from the ones I have already mentioned barely get any substantial screentime, so there\'s not much to mention there.  Because of this, aside from Takamine, the characters in this show really aren\'t anything special aside from being called what they are, troupes.Overview:+  One decent side character-   Tired anime troupes for charactersArt and Sound (6.50/10 and 7.00/10): The art for this series isn\'t really much to write home about.  There really isn\'t any standout animation for this series aside from maybe the magic casting circles, and the series overall doesn\'t really have much of an impact art-wise.What the art does have an impact on is simply how much of the series you can watch.  Because this show is so ecchi centered, the show wants to tell you that, a lot, like at least ten minutes per episode.  As I have mentioned before, the fanservice in this show is REALLY fanservicy to the point of it actually being sexual foreplay and should be considered hentai more than anything.  Yes, my dear readers.  This isn\'t ecchi, this...is hentai.  And because of this, the show as of right now blocks any form of watching it because you get censors, flashes of light, and darkened areas that essentially cover up the whole screen, not allowing you to witness of what is going on behind the chibi versions of the characters.  Because of this, watching this show can be quite frustrating because half of the time, you won\'t even get a clear picture as to what is going on.Sound for me was a sort of solace for this series, as we have Sweet Arms make the opening for this series, which is a track that I feel like was rather good.  While the show that it was tied to isn\'t really all that good, the opening itself is actually a rather good and actually somewhat memorable.  Of course, upon mentioning this, the rest of the soundtrack is mediocre at best and really doesn\'t stand up too much.Overview:+     Good Opening+/-  Standard animation-      Ecchi.  (Normally, I don\'t complain all that much about fanservice, but this is just simply too much.)-      OST didn\'t stand up on its ownPersonal enjoyment (5.00/10):  While I admit that I was wowed in the first 23 minutes of the series, the next 5.5 hours didn\'t really prove to be anything that I would bother rewatching or care for.  As the weeks went on, I was more disappointed in this show than anything because without all of the foreplay, this show actually could\'ve done really well.  It had groundwork that it could\'ve used, and a curse that was more of a curse on the show more than anything.What did I like about this show?If anything, it would have to be 1.  Takamine (cause honestly, he\'s the only character in this show I give a damn about).  And 2.  The action sequences.  While the animation was standard at best, the action sequences managed to for a moment, forget that you\'re watching a show that about a guy molesting his stepsisters (wait a second...that sounds familiar.), but rather one that also centers around the idea of action and heroes vs. demons, to some degree.What didn\'t I like about this show?The bland characters and the execution were really some big issues.  The story was never fleshed out enough for it to be different than any other hero vs. demon story, and the idea of the damsel in distress was really more of a bore than anything cause it just added another member to the useless female group, a group that we seriously don\'t need to add more characters into.  Above all though, I have to say, like what I\'ve been saying this entire review, the fanservice by far is the worst thing to come out of this series.  Not only is it prominent, so prominent that it\'s both ruined the story and my viewing experience, but because of the way it\'s presented, you probably won\'t be able to see it until a blu-ray release.Would I recommend this show?Honestly, I feel like this show is a waste of time.

Derp)TL:DR: Testament of Sister New Devil is ecchi at its most ecchi &amp; not in the least bit ashamed of it. It\'s the kind of show that validates every criticism &amp; concern non-ecchi fans have of the genre &amp; non-anime fans have about Japanese cartoons in general. But aside from that, it\'s pretty fun, albeit in a masochistic, I can\'t believe what I\'m watching but I can\'t look away kind of way. Not to be watched with other people in the room...or within hearing distance.Boobs. If there is one thing teenage...boys &amp; lonely authors love, it\'s boobs. Boobs can be big; they can be small; sometimes they\'re not there at all. But one thing is for sure, where there are women, there are boobs. &amp; where there are boobs, there are good times to be had.Our story begins with one Basara Toujou. For reasons that don\'t matter, he is accompanying his father to a restaurant to meet his two new stepsisters, yet only one of them seems to be waiting at the table. Needing to pee, he excuses himself &amp; makes his way to the toilet, where he shockingly encounters a busty red head mid business. As you would expect of someone whose just been walked in on while on the toilet, she makes to scream, &amp; being a male of strong character &amp; morals, he does the reasonable thing of pinning her against the wall to stop her doing so, for fear that they might cause a scene in a public place.It only gets better from here.To cut a long story short, said red head is by hilarious coincidence his other new stepsister. Only they\'re not really his stepsisters, as that was just a story contrived by his father for no reason. In fact, red headed Mio is the daughter of the recently deceased Demon Lord &amp; is on the run from those within the Demon realm who want to capture or kill her for her power. Maria, her loli goth companion, is actually Mio\'s succubus bodyguard. A rather pointless attempt by them to get rid of Basara reveals him to actually be a Hero, the enemies of Demons (but in that yin yang kind of way where they\'re more concerned with keeping each others powers in balance than defeating each other) with magic powers of his own. This awkward business out of the way, it\'s time for the show to get what it\'s really about, a guy &amp; several girls who all insist on calling him onii-chan while the line between ecchi &amp; hentai gets pushed to its limits.Yes, Testament is one of those shows that, to put it in a sentence, basically takes the setting, characters &amp; general plot of High school DxD &amp; sets about seeing how far they can push it before the censers tell them to go straight to DVD. The story is your basic angels (heroes) vs demons affair with the main characters caught in the middle while they just try to live normal teenage lives. The characters are barely worth mentioning for anything but their aesthetic qualities. In addition to the main trio, we also have Yuki, Basara\'s aloof childhood friend who apparently hasn\'t been talking to him until now but boy is she going to be a third wheel in his &amp; Mio\'s ""romance."" Takigawa fills the role of the one other male character who isn\'t a one episode antagonist or parent. Would it surprise you to know he likes talking about girls? Actually that\'s selling his character a bit short as he does play a more significant role in the story that most token guy friends do in anime. Oh &amp; I guess there is Basara\'s aforementioned father, but he makes his excuses to leave his son alone with Mio &amp; Maria in the first episode so we need not mention him again.But lets face it, we\'re not here for the characters or indeed the story. We\'re watching for that other kind of “plot” that hides behind clouds of steam &amp; light beams, &amp; boy does Testament have that in spades. One of the more contrived ideas introduced early on is the master – servant contract Maria convinces Basara &amp; Mio to sign in the second episode. Nominally, the idea is that it will let them know where each other are &amp; help them both get more powerful, but there\'s a sexy twist. You see, because Maria\'s a succubus, &amp; because the contract goes a bit wrong &amp; makes Basara the master (they never actually properly agree to the contract, but lets not sweat the small stuff), Mio now finds herself cursed to go like your mum did at fraternity parties whenever she thinks mean thoughts about him. The only prescription for this fever, it turns out, is for Basara to molest her repeatedly. He doesn\'t want to, of course, but his manly man duties as both a male &amp; her brother (seriously he makes that point about them being family a lot) mean he has no choice but to grope &amp; grapple with her cleavage until the curse is lifted. The first time this happens, we fade to black (with many a “no onii-chan” screamed) only to see Maria cleaning up a puddle on the floor while commenting about how many times Mio came. 10/10 IGN best plot ever.The show feels like it\'s constantly trying to one up itself as its ecchi scenes come ever closer to crossing into hentai as the series progresses. Yuki, naturally given this is anime we\'re talking about, upon learning about the contract between Basara &amp; Mio decides she wants in on that too. So once again poor old Basara has to go through the oh so unhappy job of finding her erogenous zone as well. In case you were expecting it to also be her breasts, more fool you. She\'s relatively flat chested you see, but she got da booty &amp; that\'s where the booty be stowed, so to speak. You can imagine how little of that scene was viewable. Weirdly (or not), Yuki signing a contract with Basara is not so much a source of jealously to Mio as it is the start of Mio &amp; Yuki becoming friends, or at least frenemies, I guess due to their both being in bondage together. Porn logic, I guess. &amp; if you were worried the final episode might try to take the high road, fear not. I won\'t go into details, suffice to say we get hentai\'s favourite motif: sexual assault that turns into consensual fun times because she totally wants it, really.It\'s hard for me to really explain what watching Testament is like. The best I can come up with is that it\'s a bit like reading The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs from South Park. The ecchi scenes are so...well ecchi &amp; so creepy that it\'s impossible to watch without audibly groaning in discomfort. Yet watch I do, cursing myself for it but doing it all the same. It isn\'t erotic in any sense, although I think it\'s supposed to be &amp; I might think it was if I was 14 &amp; hadn\'t discovered internet porn yet. The censorship is pretty heavy, as you\'d expect, &amp; pretty in your face about it, especially after the first few episodes when they introduce chibi versions of the characters to cover up the goods. Some people may find that annoying but personally I actually prefer that kind of censorship. It\'s funny to me when the makers pretty much cock-block the audience with a “buy the Blu-Rays, perverts” chibi stamp. It\'s not like you don\'t know what breasts drawn by someone whose never seen a real pair look like, anyway.Of course you don\'t just want to know what the show has, but how it looks. Well the art itself is pretty good, if nothing beyond standard. I have seen others comment on characters going off model at times but tbh I\'ve not really noticed it yet. What I have noticed is that the overall animation quality is pretty poor. Jerky movements, apparent jumps between key frames with no in betweens, reused footage &amp; other little things occur with enough frequency to make me question the editorial skills or resources of whoever was in charge of proofing everything. It stands out in particular when compared to the opening animation, which is surprisingly well made, with smooth character movements &amp; a rare sight of characters slowly rotating without looking jerky or weird as their perspective changes. It is perhaps unfair to compare an opening credits sequence with the show as a whole, but the difference in quality between them is noticeable.So there you have it. Thus far (&amp; I don\'t expect anything to change) Testament is an ecchi for the sake of ecchi high school fantasy with no real redeeming qualities beyond cheap titillation &amp; attempts to push the boundaries between what is &amp; isn\'t allowed on TV. That it\'s the most popular new show of the winter season according to Crunchy Roll doesn\'t fill me with confidence of the anime fandom, but then again shows like this have been bizarrely popular since at least the 90s, so it\'s not like its anything new. It doesn\'t try anything new but it also doesn\'t ask its audience to think with anything but their genitals, which makes it pretty easy viewing if you can switch your brain off enough to get past the really creepy when you think about it context to a lot of the ecchi stuff going on. There\'s much better ecchi shows out there, but you could do worse than watch this one. boys &amp; lonely authors love, it\'s boobs. Boobs can be big; they can be small; sometimes they\'re not there at all.

People have their own reasons for not liking it, but if I had to say what one big reason for why people didnt like it, it would be the DAMN CENSORSHIP OVERLOAD.I actually started watching this series when it aired, I watched the first episode then immediately gave it a 4 and dropped it.Why?Because the censorship was so ridiculous I couldnt take this anime seriously, the censors ruin any mood that is built up.But then the uncensored version was released, and so I gave it...another try and was not disappointed.Story: 6Its fine, protagonist protects girl from baddies. Honestly not much, pretty generic but done right.Art: 7The characters look good, the backrounds are solid, but nothing overly eye popping. Except for, you know, ""Those"" scenes. Animation in ""those"" scenes very smooth. The fight animations are well, what you would expect, theres nothing top notch but still good.Sound: 8The OP and ED are okay, nothing special, after seeing it once I would then proceed to skip them in other episodes.The ost however, fits the  mood in whatever is happening.A silly scene, a catchy upbeat theme.An intense scene, a badass serious themeHere we go, the VA\'s are top notch.Mio\'s squeals are refreshing, its not the usual ""Kyaa"" it actually sounds like a woman screaming.Basara\'s voice definitely fits, a nice manly voice which changes to the situation. I know his VA as characters who are silly, so it was surprising how well it fit in the serious scenes.Another I would like to mention is Takigawa\'s voice, his VA I never would think would suit him but I was wrong as he thoroughly pulled it off. I underestimated his abilities as he did a beautiful job doing him.Character: 7Basara is a great harem protagonist. When compared to others such as Rito (To-Love-Ru) or Issei (High School DxD), this guys in a league of his own.He acts just as a normal man would when a hot chick comes on to him.He has self control but also a realistic breaking point.And one great thing about him is he\'s not one of those characters who would defeat a really trashy enemy and not kill him. Like ""Oh yeah, im not gonna kill you so you can come back and cause more trouble that could potentially harm someone important to me""Basara gets stuff done.Im not going to review all the girls but I will say that none of them are unlikable.Usually in a harem, there will always be one girl that annoys the hell out of me, but not here. Every girl here is great in her own way.Enjoyment: 8I enjoyed it a lot. To the action packed scenes to their daily lives theres not a dull moment. The last episode didnt end badly either like some other series im thinking of.Overall: 8In conclusion,With censorship: 4Without censorship: 8DONT WATCH IT CENSORED.IT WILL RUIN IT. another try and was not disappointed.Story: 6Its fine, protagonist protects girl from baddies.

Every girl here is great in her own way.Enjoyment: 8I enjoyed it a lot. To the action packed scenes to their daily lives theres not a dull moment. The last episode didnt end badly either like some other series im thinking of.Overall: 8In conclusion,With censorship: 4Without censorship: 8DONT WATCH IT CENSORED.IT WILL RUIN IT.', 'Shinmai Maou no Testament is definitely an interesting series. Evidently, a range of inconsistent reviews render it to the category of ""you either hate it or love it"".The overall story is simplistic at best. The character development offers nothing unique; a hot red-head is presented as the primary love interest, a long lost childhood friend is introduced almost immediately after, former enemies develop feelings for the main character, and so on. Most of these clichés are now well-established fragments of the harem genre.The battle scenes are not exactly terrible, nonetheless they offer nothing special. The overall animation and sound quality are also quite ordinary...and not memorable.Well then, it begs the question; why is an average, mediocre series rather interesting? Bluntly speaking, the sexuality in this series is beyond over the top – make no mistake, if you happen to be watching the uncensored version, the ecchi and fan service scenes turn into borderline hentai. I found myself questioning whether I was watching an ecchi/comedy or hentai on numerous occasions. Further, the show takes itself very seriously into catering the “step-sister” fetish. By the 3rd episode, I realised it was a guarantee that a serious scene will be followed by “onii-chan I need you touch me” scene.And this reviewer feels the poor juxtaposition of such two scenes is the downfall of Shinmai Maou no Testament. The willingness to push into hentai boundaries leaves little in the comedy to be desired. The attempt to connect the sexuality into the story is rushed and poorly executed. Granted, the story is neither thought-provoking nor original, however at least the comedy could have been much better appreciated overall if the show didn’t emphasize the “I must pleasure my sisters” element so seriously.Nevertheless, much of the series is entertaining enough for harem/fantasy fans. If you can tolerate borderline hentai, I would encourage you to check out at least the first 3 episodes and see the interesting juxtapositioning for yourself.For what it’s worth, here’s a summary:DO WATCH IF:- Enjoy watching a likeable MC slowly acquire a harem- Enjoy demon – fantasy settings that are not gloomy but rather comedic- Interested to see an ecchi series pushing the borders into hentai and not memorable.Well then, it begs the question; why is an average, mediocre series rather interesting?

With focus on powers, ecchi and girls, this is the typical classic harem, just better. Definitely recommended for everyone who likes a good story.Story: 7/10Surprisingly, this is one of the stronger parts of this show. While many harems tend to have a very brainless story, the plot is just secondary and mostly disappoints. However Shinmaoi Maou manages to introduce quite a lot of interesting plot twists and introduce mysterious characters masterfully, while still keeping faith to the usual harem tropes. It also set a good...basis for the second season. Sadly, the big picture of the storyline remains predictable and a tad generic.Art: 9/10While mainly used to animate boobs and censor unwanted body ares, I was pleasantly surprised by the art style. Especially the MC and his father had some badass looking scars and overall style. The enemys and monsters aswell were quite an improvement from certain other shows who decide to simply not animate those. Ecchi is all censored, but imagination is the best artstyle amirite?Sound: 8/10With fitting male voices, good battle music and really good OP, this department also did their work. I didnt quite like the battle effects and the exaggerated moaning, it mostly felt unnecessary and out of place.Character: 9/10What? A harem gets 9 in character? Yes, its true. For the first time ever, we have a quite intelligent and not just plain dense MC who annoys the hell out of us, he actually takes the initiative and gets to town himself. THe girls of course are simpler, but more independant and powerful than what you'd actually expect.Enjoyment: 10/10Yes,I love harems. But this show has so many good things. We finally see some damn villain die, we see an MC that does dirty things with his harems and we get the feeling of a more natural approach to the whole ecchi theme. Of course, in the censored version we get to miss a lot of the interesting things - if you know what I mean - but as soon as the blu-ray is released this will turn to the better side.Overall: 8/10Honestly, a quite funny and well done show who's also suited for a non-harem lover. While this may not apply to everyone, I'd suggest waiting for the uncensored version - like with Highschool DXD, while its pointless, it somehow just makes it better.The next season is gonna start in october, so I'd suggest everyone to have watched it until then - with an appearant high budget and big fandom, we can only expect that the second season is even better! basis for the second season.

Its plots are a bit platitudinous; just ordinary protecting endangered girls. However, it tells a continuous story without significant logical failures, which is kind of rare in such ecchi harem genre. Also, the plots provide the characters with reasonable motivation to do the ecchi activities, while some of competitor anime make characters love and f**k each for no reason.The ecchi scenes are wonderful. They are the Essential parts with the best animation in the anime. However, that there...is no f**king scene is a bit sad.Plot(4/7)/Animation & Art(1/2)/Action(1/1)/Erotica Extra Points(2)Total 8/10 is no f**king scene is a bit sad.Plot(4/7)/Animation & Art(1/2)/Action(1/1)/Erotica Extra Points(2)Total 8/10', 'Gods I don\'t know why I watched this anime as long as I did... I probably would\'ve dropped it so SO much earlier if it weren\'t for the amount of censoring that was in it... The problem is that with anime like No Game No Life (which is still fairly ecchi without going over the top... might be a bit of a stretch to say) and this being the same rating on here (R+ Mild Nudity), I was going in expecting not to have the shock that I actually got...Then I realised how f***ed up this anime actually was around episode six or seven... I\'m...one of those people who impulse skip certain moments to forget that they ever happened, so it took me a while to realise how many moments I was impulse skipping before I went \'okay, this is over the top.""The story starts out with a premise that tries to be unique, but, when I look back on it, it really was quite f***ed up to begin with. Extremely awkward moment where the two main characters meet (And like Leonard from the Big Bang Theory when meeting Sheldon for the first time, this should have been my first warning to how the anime would go.)I will admit that the story was interesting. A runaway demon lord, a hero exiled from his village, some people on both sides who don\'t want them to live in peace... Sounds familiar, but the execution was done poorly. There is a different anime that has a similar plot that is much more interesting. The main detraction from the story has to do with the fact that one of the main characters is a succubus who puts the two characters in this awkward bond that doesn\'t let any moment in the anime stay normal for more than three minutes...The character designs and art, not much I can say about it. Generic, but not terrible. Music a bit less than good.

Basara is actually a former hero from the opposing clan?!? WHAA-? As you can see, these *cough* innovative *cough* introductions basically...plot out the course of the show, with the introduction of new characters at frequent intervals, and the big finale practically writing itself. The story isn\'t bad by any means, but the depth is worse than the shallow end of the kiddy pool. I can\'t say a huge amount more without spoiling the outcomes for some characters and how they fit into the final battle but I will say that plot-wise, it kept me watching, and probably will keep you watching as well, that it because 90% of your attention will be set on the abundant fan-service scenes with lots of uncensored boobies!Art: 6So the art is average, characters are very generic looking, and as much as it looks alright, it\'s easy to get bored looking at it. If you\'ve seen any other magical, demon, supernatural, ecchi show like this, then you\'ll instantly recognise the magic insignia\'s that appear when attacks are launched, the sparkling effects of weapons appearing and dissipating, stuff like that. Not to say it hinders the art style, but it\'s not hard to say it\'s overused. Animation is about on par with a lot of shows involving a story such as this one, it\'s good enough, but won\'t blow your mind. Also boob jiggle physics animation is on point.Sound: 8So the opening of this show is fucking amazing, absolutely loved it, the ending is fairly good as well so you\'ve got that to look forward to when you start each episode. SFX is as expected, metal clanging sounds and magic blasting sounds can be picked out and heard in various other anime but really it still sounds good and adds the intended effect. Voicing for most characters was fitting, one character though I wish had more dialogue simply for his voice actor is Jin Toujou, Basara\'s father. Keiji Fujiwara\'s voice is music to my ears. His voice and the OP managed to bump the sound up to a solid 8.Characters: 7Well, shall we go through the list of generic characters that populate this and hundreds of similar shows? Yes? OK THEN! We have the shy, yet totally in love with MC girl. Perverted girl, who happens to be the loli character AND the comedic relief character. We have the cold-monotone voiced character who also plays the role of childhood-friend character. There\'s the hot sensei who gives MC advice. And there\'s a few more I really shouldn\'t have to list just because you know them already. These persona\'s respectively belong to Mio, Maria, Yuuki and Hasegawa. Oh, and there\'s the main character, Basara. Who is a lot like other MC\'s in that he would NEVER, EVER do anything lewd to his harem members, and gets all embarassed and what not when walking in on them, but he is very powerful from the beginning of the show, something that is used nowhere near as much as the good old ""weak at the beginning and then gets stronger as more and more women begin to appear and fall in love with him"" strategy most harem, ecchi, action, magical anime use. But it does work for our MC Basara in this case as he is actually a very good character with a mildly tragic backstory with a lot of experience, and they do show his experience throughout the show, which I did enjoy very much.Enjoyment: 7I\'m gonna explain my enjoyment of this show with an analogy, imagine your really hungry, like starving, like about to keel over due to your stomach attempting to digest itself. You spot a fast food outlet, and next to it, a gourmet restaurant. They both cost the same amount of money. you can either go to the fast food place and get a quick, alright meal that tastes pretty good and satisfies your hunger, or you can go to the restaurant and order a magnificent 3 course smorgasbord of food that will take you to another world, but it will take a long time to prepare, and your hunger is getting worse with every passing second. You opt for the first option, this show is the first option. Shinmai Maou will satisfy your hunger for lovely pairs of uncensored boobs and fan-service, you\'ll get it quick and easy because they\'re in almost every episode, and in the end you know you could have gotten something better. But you don\'t regret getting the fast food, because it did it\'s job, it could have done it much better, but you are no longer hungry. Hopefully that made an ounce of sense to some of you reading this because I really do think it was a viable option in judging my enjoyment of this show.Overall: 7All in all this show was good, but it wasn\'t very good, or great, or a masterpiece, just good. I enjoyed watching this show and I am going to watch the second season simply because I don\'t regret watching yet another tit-filled harem with generic characters, as odd as that may be, i\'ve seen a fair amount already. If your looking for something like what the synopsis describes, and don\'t mind the bountiful fan-service, then watch it, but for those who can look at the cover art, the characters and the synopsis and can already predict the story of each episode, this show might not be for you, unless of course you\'re into this kind of thing then by all means watch away with pride. Like I said at the beginning of this now much longer than I intended review, this show hits some buttons well, and others not so much. And it won\'t resonate well with everyone regardless of how many similar shows you may have seen already. But for what it\'s worth, Shinmai Maou no Testament will make you laugh at it\'s stupidity, and then make you laugh more at it\'s boob physics. And once it achieves that smile from you, it\'s done it\'s job well enough I say.~Xeno156 plot out the course of the show, with the introduction of new characters at frequent intervals, and the big finale practically writing itself.

Enter Basara, a seemingly ""normal"" high school student, who, in reality, is an ex-member of the Hero Clan. Two demons enter his life - Mio and Maria - who will forever change the course of his life.Seems pretty straightforward, right? Not.The Testament of Sister New Devil\'s plot is foremost its weakest point. Without going into too much detail, there are too many plot elements that are unexplained or weakly developed. For instance, we...do not know much about the Hero Clan except how it centers around Basara and his father. Its purpose is briefly mentioned, but the anime doesn\'t go into any further detail beyond that - which then makes it seem like the Hero Clan is only there for no particular purpose but to establish a dichotomy among multiple warring factions.Furthermore, this show has way too much fan service - up to the point where it significantly detracts from the enjoyment of this show. Fan service is practically present in every single episode, and it is usually presented in some overly exaggerated fashion that is completely unnecessary. Additionally, the censoring is done horribly - it mostly consists of patches of light or some random drawings/figures/animations to block out nudity - but you can still kind of infer what is going on. Don\'t get me wrong - some fan service is generally okay, especially if there is a reason behind it - but this is just beyond disgusting. All in all, pretty much every female character is treated as more or less a sex object in this show. Which is absolutely horrible.Lastly, the theme is poorly incorporated into the story. If you\'ve been carefully paying attention to this anime (or if you\'re about to start watching this, which I don\'t recommend to), there is one common theme that unites the plot: family. Everything Basara does in this series is to protect his family - again, which is a pretty good reason for someone to act the way he does. However, given this, this theme is constantly being shoved into the viewer\'s face. Every time after Basara does anything, he literally stops and then takes a second to explain that ""it\'s to protect my family."" By the time you hear this the second or third time, you can basically figure the pattern out.Everything about this show is poor. Don\'t watch this. Please. I watched this garbage so that you don\'t have to. Save your sanity, I\'m sure you have a lot of better things to do.tl;drPros- Can\'t really think of any, lol, unless you\'re really into fan service I guess...Cons- Horrible character development- Poor thematic incorporation - themes should unite a plot, not be randomly thrown into the plot when the main character feels like it- Inconsistencies within the plot line- Plot does not flow well- Excessive fan service that treats the female leads horribly and detracts from the plot do not know much about the Hero Clan except how it centers around Basara and his father.

Save your sanity, I\'m sure you have a lot of better things to do.tl;drPros- Can\'t really think of any, lol, unless you\'re really into fan service I guess...Cons- Horrible character development- Poor thematic incorporation - themes should unite a plot, not be randomly thrown into the plot when the main character feels like it- Inconsistencies within the plot line- Plot does not flow well- Excessive fan service that treats the female leads horribly and detracts from the plot', 'This is my first review so please don\'t hold a grudge.It is a harem anime, so if you like harems i would recommend you to watch this anime if not DON\'T.This Anime has a lot of mixed feelings, some are scoring it a 6 and some an 8. The anime that is a lot like is Hischool DxD, though in my opinion it is better. It has better fights and the MC isn\'t an annoying horny kid who isn\'t getting any stronger after 2 seasons but the characters are in both anime\'s equally good.Story: 7The story is good but don\'t expect anything from it. In...this world exists demons and a clan that is called the heroes clan. A girl that is the daughter of the former demon lord is being chased after by the new demon lord. The MC right in the beginning of the first episode is told that he is getting 2 step sisters. And right from there is your typical ""I have to protect them"" thing. But I don\'t dislike these sort of stories.Art: 7The art isn\'t anything special but the character models are pretty cute so that\'s why i give it a 7. BUT the one thing that annoyed me was that when they where ""having sex"" the frrikking screen was overloaded with censored prictures. They could have just uncensored it like DxD or just throw the echhi part away. It was pretty pointless to watch it when the only thing you could see where the characters faces.Sound: 7I never really draw my attention to the music, but sometimes when i did pay attention it did have a pretty good soundtrack and the opening is also pretty good. Most of the characters voices do fit with the charaters imo, but the only VA I wasn\'t really fond of was the MC\'s. I think it is because I hear in a lot of anime\'s and have become tired of his voice (that is just what i think).Charaters: 8The characters are pretty good. The MC isn\'t a wuss like the MC of DxD so that is a +1 in my book. There are 3 main girls. One is the former demon lord\'s daughter who is you typical tsundere BUT she isn\'t annoying like most tsundere characters in most anime. Tsundere characters are one of the most annoying type of characters in anime\'s because they most of the time are valiant who are always abusing the MC of beating the crap out of him, luckily it isn\'t the case in this one. The other girl is a succubus who is always scheming to get the MC in a horny situation. And the last one is the girl of the Hero clan who happens to be the MC\'s childhood friend.Enjoyment: 9I did enjoy myself pretty good.Overall: 8 this world exists demons and a clan that is called the heroes clan.

To add on without spoiling it too much they make a pact and it kinda is if she acts in a weird way or what not lust takes over her body and he has to calm her down..... thats the main fanservice in all of this a decent story not really good but good enough the really bad censoring ruins alot of the story and makes what was something serious a stupid funny matter even though its not gonna make you laugh.Art- As far as everything visually its really decent and by that i mean good nothing out of the oridnary good fight visuals just nothing bad about that but... because this is an ecchi and it has the dxd type of feel you expect those awkward weird kinda perverted moments which you do get you really wanna see em but then the ridiculous damn censorship ruins it i mean like really ruins it just a giant chibi version of a character blocking the screen a blinding white light or a giant caution tape with pictures of the characters faces on it i mean its so damn ridiculous why make it like a Soft H-anime and then ruin it by the ridiculous censors at least make the censors smaller or just do what kiss x sis did..... like really it ruins alot of the scenes in the showSound- Nothing bad like at all decent opening meh ending song good background songs during the fight scenes it was good no complaints.Character- The main character is good as far as im concerned but no character development but what can you do its a harem all the dude main characters are usually the same..... Mio the daughter of the demon lord is cute.... to say the least her character kinda changes in certain scenes when shes angry or when the effect of the contract between her and basara occur shes likeable and maria the succubus is also likable does super lewd things but thats what she does thats the type of demon she is nothing about the main characters turn you off but as you get deeper in the show you will find more you like and more you hate and others your unsure about.Enjoyment- i guess as a fan of anime like dxd this caters to my liking i dont hate this anime i mean its got its goods and bads.... Decent story, good art, nice battle music, likable characters but the bads or should i say bad* being the censorship kills the pure enjoyment that you are hoping to get from the show id love to give this show a review of  8/10 - 9/10 based on my enjoyment but the dang censorship is way to much and absolutely ruins the ecchi experience of the show its just disappointing to see the ANIMATION company really were trying to troll the viewers with how bad the censorship were and how much they blocked too much just too much.....Overall- A decent show killed by The animation Company's censorship thats all that really killed the show if the censorship wasnt in the show it would be quite good if it didn't have the hit or miss comedy it would be a good show but the hit or miss comedy and terrible censorship hinders it from being a good show so i think a 6/10 is fair..... especially for an ecchi lover the animation company failed with the terrible censorship so i cant blame the makers of the anime only the people who decided to make the censorship so bad.....Final judgement- would have made for a good harem action anime with decent characters but terrible comedy that is hit or miss and just bad censorship it made the show just fair so a 6/10 is fair as for me. 2nd season later this year lets hope the censors arent as terrible demon lord and the other a succubus a succubus is basically a demon that makes you do lewd things so sexual and perverted stuff in a sense..... To add on without spoiling it too much they make a pact and it kinda is if she acts in a weird way or what not lust takes over her body and he has to calm her down..... thats the main fanservice in all of this a decent story not really good but good enough the really bad censoring ruins alot of the story and makes what was something serious a stupid funny matter even though its not gonna make you laugh.Art- As far as everything visually its really decent and by that i mean good nothing out of the oridnary good fight visuals just nothing bad about that but... because this is an ecchi and it has the dxd type of feel you expect those awkward weird kinda perverted moments which you do get you really wanna see em but then the ridiculous damn censorship ruins it i mean like really ruins it just a giant chibi version of a character blocking the screen a blinding white light or a giant caution tape with pictures of the characters faces on it i mean its so damn ridiculous why make it like a Soft H-anime and then ruin it by the ridiculous censors at least make the censors smaller or just do what kiss x sis did..... like really it ruins alot of the scenes in the showSound- Nothing bad like at all decent opening meh ending song good background songs during the fight scenes it was good no complaints.Character- The main character is good as far as im concerned but no character development but what can you do its a harem all the dude main characters are usually the same.....

If you like going into anime without knowing anything specific about them, I suggest skipping the STORY and CHARACTER sections, and go straight to ENJOYMENT after reading ART+ANIMATION.ART+ANIMATION:Animation is good, but nothing to put it in its own category. A few scenes were notably lacking in smoothness while a few others were noticeably smoother than average. One or two scenes were worthy of being called epic.Art is good, interesting real use of shadows on characters that I haven’t noticed in the genre before - its a really little thing, but it made it feel slightly...higher quality. The ultra-form-fitting clothing and lifted chests is no big surprise, but is not overdone.The in-show music is good and matches the theme and mood. Sound effects are good but not amazing. Theme song is standard-issue.The version I watched was heavily censored to the point of being annoying. Some uncensored scenes were arguably more worthy of being censored than ones that were. Considering the audience and purpose of the show, I don’t really see the point of rays of light or chibi characters covering half the screen whenever those scenes occur. With all the moaning and other noises, the censored version isn’t all that more appropriate than the uncensored for those below the maturity level. Uncensored version shows all the tongue action, nips, and panties.STORY:Could be best described as a demon-ecchi-harem with above average plot and battle sequences. The concept itself isn’t all that interesting. The focus on ecchi thankfully isn’t so strong that everything feels stupid or forced. There are quite a few generic motives used but they are not unrealistic or rampant.There is some BS for the sake of sexual humor and fan service. Basara has some pretty strong plot armor. For a light-hearted anime such as this one I’m willing to overlook some of the BS. There are no major discontinuities, but there is some withheld information in the beginning that made the lead’s easy acceptance of the events to be hard to believe. At the end of the season it is still not certain what that information is.It was never made clear why some demons choose to be peaceful, but one can assume it is because there are non-violent ways to obtain magic or power. As in other series, the demons may just be a magical race that exists in the world of humans but aren’t necessarily evil.Battle choreography is good, but surprisingly communication within battles is better than most. The mood of battles is done much better than others in the genre that focus mainly on putting the hotties in the most compromising viewing angles possible. Characters in the battles are not simply forgotten about or wasting opportunities like in some less thought-out series.The scene to scene mood shifts are handled pretty well and there is a good feeling of tension in the right parts.There are some meaningful quotes made throughout the show. By the end, it feels as though almost every interaction had a story-driven purpose behind it.Basara makes a strange turn of character towards the very end – maybe to avoid showing that side to the others. Thankfully the season ends overall in a light-hearted way, with a perfect draw-in to a second season.CHARACTERS:OP hero lead, tsundere demon girl, loli succubus, and hero girl are the main characters. They are not flat, with a decent amount of proper backstory and justifications for their actions and feelings. The overly-conscious male, tsundere, and pusher dynamic is nothing new but considering their roles and backstories it doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Being a mix of heroes and demons, the main characters are subject to enemies from both sides.The lead and his father have been exiled from their hero village due to the son – strongest boy in the village – causing a huge accident. This allows some other hero characters to come in later holding grudges against him. This doesn’t, however, explain why one particular hero he is reunited with doesn’t hold a grudge but instead is quite cozy with him. The lead is inexplicably able to free himself from even the strongest mind control or sleep agents, and has the ability to nullify or deflect close to all magic with enough yelling and face-scrunching.The demon girls are attractively designed without being too overwrought. Male demon designs seem underwhelming. The heroes all have a similar uniform but otherwise look like more normal people.Voice acting is good but nothing special.ENJOYMENT:My inner 15-year old likes ecchi-harems with action, so I enjoyed this. There were moments where I was rolling my eyes from the lack of justification or plot armor, but the humor allowed me to overlook many of those. Helping to prevent it from feeling tedious is a decent balance between the everyday lives with humor and fan service, the character development, and the battle scenesThe battle scenes are nothing compared to my absolute favorites, but they are enjoyable enough here. The characters change enough during the season to feel invested in them.OVERALL:Most of this anime’s traits lie just above average for the genre. The concept is a little weak in my opinion, but the story aside from its occasional unrealistic justifications is enjoyable as long as you aren’t looking for a psychological thriller masterpiece.The story is ever so slightly too fast-paced but care is taken to properly portray the moods.TL;DR:All around better than average action-ecchi-harem about demons and heroes. Feels slightly forced as is the norm, but is light-hearted and still full of fan service – especially uncensored. higher quality.

I am only human... and thus I am enticed by the images of attractive women. Almost all other men are the same as I am in this regard  and thus, the genre of ""ecchi"" is highly successful. Generally, ecchi anime, whether blended with action, mystery, comedy or anything else will lean heavily on the ecchi side and disregard story, setting and characters.Shinmai Maou no Testament is not one of those anime titles.I will not spoil details of it so I will give a general summary;The story revolves around the main character and his...two female acquaintances who become his \'little sisters\'. Their interactions are the basis of the entire show, but this is supplemented by surprisingly good animation/action scenes and strong characterization (Ex: The Maria character is a great example of a multi-faceted , unique character the serves as a microcosm for the whole show;  A lot of ecchi but can keep it serious when it needs to... with a lot more to it than the superficial aspects).  The plot moves at a brisk pace, not too quickly , not too slowly but just right. The dialogue is effective and there are twists/turns that are legitimately well executed as the show progresses.To put it in simple terms;This is a show HEAVILY mired in ecchi situations (Borderline Hentai) but if you removed the ecchi entirely, you\'d still be left with a fairly good  show, not great but good.If you like  ecchi (Sexual situations/content minus the actual sex) this goes highly recommended. The ecchi is very effective.If you like action, this is recommended; The action is good and has a lot of variety.If you want plot/story/setting, this is recommended; The plot is deeper/more intriguing than the average ecchi anime.If you dislike ecchi, disregard show entirely.One more observation;I have found that a surprisingly high amount of women like this show, I have no idea why that is... because I was originally going to end this review with ""If you\'re a woman don\'t even bother"" but that would be wrong. Apparently a lot of women like to watch Mio/Maria/Yuki get ecchi\'d./Boggle, sometimes I do not understand. two female acquaintances who become his \'little sisters\'.

Need a dosage of hero? Check. Need a loli succubus? Check. Need a childhood friend? Check. Need a horny little sister? Check. Need a cleavage upgrade? Check. Need contractual weapons/relationships? Check. Need an overtly aggressive school nurse? Check. Need a demon world? Check. The list goes on but I\'d rather not bore you further. In comparison to other shows, it is closest in my mind to High School DxD in terms of setting as well as ecchi levels. It does borrow heavy from numerous other shows such as Touma\'s...nullification power (Index), the hero with demon theme that we\'ve seen in numerous other shows (Yusibu, Hataraku Maou-sama, Maoyuu), and the need of a hero to check heroines\' powers (Date a Live).Our protagonist, Basara, has always wanted a little sister and so his father goes and finds him two before taking off.Unfortunately, for Basara, these are no ordinary sisters and soon they soon use magical powers to try to kick him out of the house. Unfortunately, for them, Basara is a former hero and the son of virtually a war god and thus puts them in their place. However, learning of their true past, he decides to cave in and live the life of a harem king instead. This is the story of that harem and how Barasa continues to defeat foes in order to earn the right to continue fondling girls. Yes, because this is a TV show this is as far as it goes folks- granted it amounts to what is essentially soft core porn with just as much pleasure-based groans and orgasms.[b]Animation:[/b]The show is drawn in a rather saturated palette for a modern piece and features average backgrounds and shading. It\'s a typical setting for this type of a show so expect a fair amount of scenes in the house, city, and school. Characters are pretty well drawn though you shouldn\'t expect too many emotions other than embarrassment, elation, and anger.There is a fair amount of action in the show ranging from melee to swords and magic. The effects are pretty good overall and you\'ll see multiple characters emit colorful auras. All of the characters in the show have distinct abilities and styles so you\'ll see a good mix in the fights. There is definitely a fair amount of blood and implied gore scenes, though they spare the viewer from the juicier details. With a perverted succubus as one of the main characters and a protagonist who\'s not too ashamed of putting his hands to action, you\'re sure to get a season\'s worth of ecchi. You pretty much get your full range of ecchi here from accidental peeping to seriously trying to dominate a partner. Surprisingly, considering the sheer amount of cliches here, there is no beach scene so a swimsuit scene will have to suffice.[b]Sound:[/b]The show starts with a light-rock OP with a fair melody. The ED is by a different artist though maintains the same feel as the OP. The BGM is fairly wide in instrumentation and ranges from orchestral to rock to vocals. It\'s a fairly active BGM though it stands out the most during tension-building and action scenes; there is one theme in particular that\'s pretty good.The VA cast is rather mixed in experience, as there are relative newcomers such as Mio\'s VA Ayaka Asai working alongside VAs rising in popularity such as Sarah Emi Bridcutt. Regardless of prior experience, Ayaka Asai does a pretty good tsundere and an especially effective ""oniii-chan"" in dere mode. An above average performance overall, helped in part by strong, veteran male VAs as well.[b]Story:[/b]As in Hagure Yuusha, the former demon lord has died and now the vulnerable daughter needs protecting. Thus, our protagonist Basara steps in to fill in the role of protector, as well as abuser; as for some rather aloof reason they need to fondle each other to gain trust and grow stronger. However, Mio\'s former succubus guardian, Maria, wants in on the action too. And not before long, a childhood friend, Yuki, likewise seems to want to join in on the action.The main strength of the show in my opinion is the same as that in Taimadou, the show is able to successfully develop the characters without sacrificing plot fluidity. There are rather intricate relationships built through the course of the show, which are really the intellectual\'s only haven in this show that is more meant for the carnally-inclined. The show follows a single progressive storyline where our protagonists face a series of ever-growing threats from various groups. This ultimately culminates in a multi-episode long battle involving a rather lecherous antagonist.Despite the impressive use of multiple cliches and plot fluidity, there are some issues in the execution. For one, there are way too many ""gotcha"" moments used as a plot device to get characters out of sticky situations; whether it\'s a secret alliance or a hidden power it\'s just overly abused. The larger issue for me is that the show attempts to paint a very bleak picture with our protagonists facing virtually insurmountable odds. However, this serious and rather dire mood is broken constantly by scenes of fondling; almost as if to say oh well we\'re screwed we might as well screw each other (soft core style) in the meantime. This greatly reduces the tension that was used very effectively in other successful shows such as Shana, FSN, and the first half of SAO; what I\'m trying to say is that the show could have been much more entertaining plot wise if it had toned down the frequency of the ecchi.[b]Character:[/b]If catfights between harem members are your thing, this show has a lot of it. Testament has a rather limited harem compared to many other shows in the category but you get more development with each harem member. Despite this, Mio is really the only dynamic character in the group, going from a defensive and dismissive stepsister to a dependant and loving imouto. Despite not really being dynamic, Maria is probably the most interesting  character in terms of her ability to manipulate others be it Mio or Basara.Speaking of our protagonist, expect him to take a beating repeatedly for his harem members. I\'d liken this to Unbreakable Machine Doll in the sense of constantly getting near-fatal wounds and yet magically recovering enough to resume fighting only moments later. He\'s a mix between the overly-perverse Issei from DxD and the levelheaded Raul from Yusibu. It\'s a pretty good mix actually and a great step up from the throwaway protagonists of the last decade.There are a fair amount of supporting characters that don\'t really seem to matter outside of their particular plot sequence. However, a good number  of them eventually take on roles that are more significant in the second season.[b]Value:[/b]Though definitely at the high end of the spectrum ecchi-wise, Testament is a fairly entertaining show in its own right notwithstanding the ecchi. It combines a fairly intricate plot with a good dosage of character interaction. If you\'re looking for a fun, action-oriented ecchi-based harem and don\'t mind either ridiculous amounts of censored screens or almost constant topless nudity if you go Blu-Ray then definitely give this a shot. nullification power (Index), the hero with demon theme that we\'ve seen in numerous other shows (Yusibu, Hataraku Maou-sama, Maoyuu), and the need of a hero to check heroines\' powers (Date a Live).Our protagonist, Basara, has always wanted a little sister and so his father goes and finds him two before taking off.Unfortunately, for Basara, these are no ordinary sisters and soon they soon use magical powers to try to kick him out of the house.

You pretty much get your full range of ecchi here from accidental peeping to seriously trying to dominate a partner. Surprisingly, considering the sheer amount of cliches here, there is no beach scene so a swimsuit scene will have to suffice.[b]Sound:[/b]The show starts with a light-rock OP with a fair melody. The ED is by a different artist though maintains the same feel as the OP. The BGM is fairly wide in instrumentation and ranges from orchestral to rock to vocals. It\'s a fairly active BGM though it stands out the most during tension-building and action scenes; there is one theme in particular that\'s pretty good.The VA cast is rather mixed in experience, as there are relative newcomers such as Mio\'s VA Ayaka Asai working alongside VAs rising in popularity such as Sarah Emi Bridcutt. Regardless of prior experience, Ayaka Asai does a pretty good tsundere and an especially effective ""oniii-chan"" in dere mode. An above average performance overall, helped in part by strong, veteran male VAs as well.[b]Story:[/b]As in Hagure Yuusha, the former demon lord has died and now the vulnerable daughter needs protecting. Thus, our protagonist Basara steps in to fill in the role of protector, as well as abuser; as for some rather aloof reason they need to fondle each other to gain trust and grow stronger. However, Mio\'s former succubus guardian, Maria, wants in on the action too. And not before long, a childhood friend, Yuki, likewise seems to want to join in on the action.The main strength of the show in my opinion is the same as that in Taimadou, the show is able to successfully develop the characters without sacrificing plot fluidity. There are rather intricate relationships built through the course of the show, which are really the intellectual\'s only haven in this show that is more meant for the carnally-inclined. The show follows a single progressive storyline where our protagonists face a series of ever-growing threats from various groups. This ultimately culminates in a multi-episode long battle involving a rather lecherous antagonist.Despite the impressive use of multiple cliches and plot fluidity, there are some issues in the execution. For one, there are way too many ""gotcha"" moments used as a plot device to get characters out of sticky situations; whether it\'s a secret alliance or a hidden power it\'s just overly abused. The larger issue for me is that the show attempts to paint a very bleak picture with our protagonists facing virtually insurmountable odds. However, this serious and rather dire mood is broken constantly by scenes of fondling; almost as if to say oh well we\'re screwed we might as well screw each other (soft core style) in the meantime. This greatly reduces the tension that was used very effectively in other successful shows such as Shana, FSN, and the first half of SAO; what I\'m trying to say is that the show could have been much more entertaining plot wise if it had toned down the frequency of the ecchi.[b]Character:[/b]If catfights between harem members are your thing, this show has a lot of it. Testament has a rather limited harem compared to many other shows in the category but you get more development with each harem member. Despite this, Mio is really the only dynamic character in the group, going from a defensive and dismissive stepsister to a dependant and loving imouto. Despite not really being dynamic, Maria is probably the most interesting  character in terms of her ability to manipulate others be it Mio or Basara.Speaking of our protagonist, expect him to take a beating repeatedly for his harem members. I\'d liken this to Unbreakable Machine Doll in the sense of constantly getting near-fatal wounds and yet magically recovering enough to resume fighting only moments later. He\'s a mix between the overly-perverse Issei from DxD and the levelheaded Raul from Yusibu. It\'s a pretty good mix actually and a great step up from the throwaway protagonists of the last decade.There are a fair amount of supporting characters that don\'t really seem to matter outside of their particular plot sequence. However, a good number  of them eventually take on roles that are more significant in the second season.[b]Value:[/b]Though definitely at the high end of the spectrum ecchi-wise, Testament is a fairly entertaining show in its own right notwithstanding the ecchi. It combines a fairly intricate plot with a good dosage of character interaction. If you\'re looking for a fun, action-oriented ecchi-based harem and don\'t mind either ridiculous amounts of censored screens or almost constant topless nudity if you go Blu-Ray then definitely give this a shot.', ""This anime is very similar to Highschool DxD. My review might be biased because I loved Highschool DxD, but this anime fulfill my beliefs. As a Junior in High School, I can tell you that this anime is the best. The main characters are really well developed and viewers get to see each characters background. The second season to this anime fulfills that even further. The battle scenes aren't that bad, and the music isn't half bad. I liked the animation quality because I found it to be fluid. The story is similar to DxD and the Enjoyment is definitely there.

Please, it\'s ecchi for purpose. In this way my enjoyment fell from 8-9 to 2... If that was just a trick forcing to buy DVD/BD version producers failed all the way. I can change my opinion when DVD/BD ver will be released.EDIT:After 2 uncensored eps I can say...that there are things that makes me enjoy this anime. Now ""PLOT"" is better if you know what I mean, So uncensored version scores 8/10 because there finally is ecchi in ecchi part of this anime, still I hope that 2nd season will be better than this and all signs are trying to show us that late autumn will bring quite good continuation of Shinmai Maou no Testament that there are things that makes me enjoy this anime.

I expected her to at least show him some love, which we couldn\'t see at the beginning and the middle, and well, since it\'s a Harem anime, even when they could do a romance-supporting scene, the harem had to push itself in.Enjoyment- 7/10 and I would give about 5.5/10 if I watched the CENSORED one, the Ecchi was pretty much the only good thing in it.[Side note- a supporting character in my opinion can be the girl that sees the MC is fighting for her, so she supports him as well, always checks on him, loves him, hugs him, I won\'t go far to kissing and things like that (even though the supporting lover is the best character in my opinion, and this anime didn\'t have it.)]Bottom Line: I would recommend to those who seek for cheap Ecchi scenes and want a bit of cheap action with it.And for those who don\'t, I don\'t recommend.Thank you for reading :D romance in the series- it looked like the creators tried really hard to put romance in it, but the Harem was too overwhelming, so it was really hard to make a good romantic scene between two characters.Every episode had the same routine, which I found tiring after a bit.Important thing about the Action- the fights weren\'t exciting at all, each character had maximum of 2 skills, while the MC had only one, same weapons to everyone, not a lot of skills, and the skills that exist are lame.Ecchi- the whole anime idea was with Ecchi in the center, which was fine, but every Ecchi scene was the same, over and over again, you\'ll just see a lot of breast rubbing and massaging.Story was given 6/10, since many things weren\'t explained and were just thrown at us, and the story was predictable and nothing special.Art with 6/10The art felt lame- hastened and rushed,  but I\'ve seen worse.Sound with 6/10Nothing that I could remember but the battle soundtrack was... fine I guessThe OP and ED weren\'t good.Character 6/10Since I got disappointed with the romance part (which affects the development of characters ) and their fighting skills, I found thw characters unoriginal and boring.The Male MC, Basara, showed us some spine at the beginning but he became lame afterwards, a pathetic idiot with no spine.This anime didn\'t have the character who ""supports "".Like in MOBA games, when every team should have a Support, this anime didn\'t have one [Side note, look at the end], so much help was given to the red haired MC- Mio, but she doesn\'t support Basara back?

The only memorable character was Maria because she had more personality than our generic MC and heroine.The art style was... Okay. The BGM and OP/ED was... okay.  Did I enjoy myself? Well, it was okay. But since it\'s an ecchi/harem anime, I liked it. But I really don\'t recommend it to those who dislike fanservice (believe me, there are a lot).

Where do I start?This is the type of anime you watch to turn off your brain because if you don\'t, you will have a terrible time.If you\'re expecting a good plot, character development, music or animation, I\'d look for another anime, as this anime performs poorly in all those categories. However, unless you enjoy poorly written anime and want to see shitty hentai, in that case, you\'ll get a kick out of Shinmai Maou no Testament.Story Synopsis: Shinmai Maou no Testament is about a teenage boy and his adopted ""sisters.""The story itself is inconsistent as it jumps from themes of...family, being horny, questionable incest, more speeches about family, generic hero clans (good guys) vs generic demon clans (bad guys), high school slice of life, back to being horny, more incest, and unnecessary drama to drive the generic plot forward.Speaking of the drama, it feels as forced as the cringe-inducing sexual scenes which arguably define this anime.Here\'s a non-spoiler example of what to expect.Character A (Boy) is with Character B (Girl) at school. They\'re having a conversation, and suddenly the Girl becomes jealous, which causes her to become very horny because she sees him looking at another girl and gets mad. So she angrily leaves the room.The Boy then follows the Girl to resolve the drama, which leads to a sexually driven scene/situation where the Boy needs to harass the Girl to calm her down sexually... BUT WAIT, THERE\'S MORE. Another girl enters the scene. Let\'s call her ""Girl #2,"" She then says, ""I WANT TO BE TOUCHED TOO, ONI-CHAN."" Naturally, this causes conflict between Girl #1 and Girl #2, and now they suddenly have to deal with demons or heroes who want to capture Girl #1 because she has a unique hidden power within her.The plot follows a pattern like an example above.It feels like it was written for angsty teenage virgin boys who desire the sexual attention of several women at once without effort just because they exist.This anime is the definition of a male power fantasy, where women throw themselves at you simply because you\'re a ""nice"" guy and try to respect them, and by ""throwing,"" I mean the girls are literally fighting and drooling over this Boy who has the personality of a cardboard box, not because of skill or anything cool like that but simply because he\'s a ""nice"" and good-looking guy who talks a lot about his family values and how he wants to protect them, while also trying to harass them sexually.If Sigmund Freud were born in Japan, his theory would revolve around siblings trying to have sex with each other because of mommy and daddy issues. This anime would be his justification for this theory.Like it\'s absurdly incestuous; you might as well call the anime Alabama the anime.Shit-talking aside, this anime does get some brownie points. It\'s an okay slice of life once you get passed all the dumb jokes and unnecessary drama. But, sadly, that good aspect gets overshadowed by all its negatives.Two more points:#1: This anime attempts to compete against High School DxD and copies the character designs and personalities of Issei, Rias, Xenovia and what I\'m going to dub ""discount Akeno aka Maria.""It also attempts to reverse certain aspects of High School DxDs story (such as pawns and control ""Master and Servant"" concepts.)Unsurprisingly, it fails badly, mainly because the copy of Rias is ironically a submissive tsundere who\'s overly emotional for no reason, and the copy of Issei is OP af and never really has to work to obtain his power as he\'s magically born with it because of.... ""backstory"" reasons.The only defining trait of his character is that he\'s a good guy who does things like saving people and not killing.His power is linked to his emotions, and the more emotional he gets, the more powerful he gets; this generic stereotype also applies to ""Discount Rias."" No matter their situation, emotion and the power of friendship will always save them.Lastly, I would only recommend this anime to people who are okay with bad stories or those who want to laugh at how bad this anime is. Trolling a friend with this anime might also be funny, as you\'d get to see how triggered they get by how appalling incestual soft-core porn is. Just don\'t expect much from Shinmai Maou Testament, and you\'ll have a good time.Also, don\'t think too much, or you\'ll find yourself writing a lengthy review like I am ;)Happy anime hunting! family, being horny, questionable incest, more speeches about family, generic hero clans (good guys) vs generic demon clans (bad guys), high school slice of life, back to being horny, more incest, and unnecessary drama to drive the generic plot forward.Speaking of the drama, it feels as forced as the cringe-inducing sexual scenes which arguably define this anime.Here\'s a non-spoiler example of what to expect.Character A (Boy) is with Character B (Girl) at school.

As an avid anime enthusiast, I had high hopes for ""Shinmai Maou no Testament,"" but alas, my expectations were crushed by its numerous shortcomings. This anime tries so hard to fit into the harem, ecchi, and fantasy genres, but it ultimately ends up as a jumbled mess of clichés and tasteless fan service.First and foremost, the storyline is painfully generic and unoriginal. We are presented with the all-too-familiar plot of a shy, ordinary protagonist, Basara, who finds himself living with not one, but two attractive demon sisters. While I appreciate that anime often relies on...certain tropes, ""Shinmai Maou no Testament"" takes it to a whole new level of predictability. The narrative lacks depth, and every plot twist is so foreseeable that it fails to engage the audience in any meaningful way.Moreover, the character development is practically non-existent. The female characters, Mio and Maria, are reduced to mere objects of desire, existing solely to satisfy the male gaze. Instead of empowering them with genuine personalities and motivations, the show forces them into embarrassing and uncomfortable situations for cheap laughs and fan service. This approach undermines any potential for meaningful relationships or character growth, ultimately leaving us with hollow and unrelatable figures.While some might argue that ecchi elements are commonplace in this genre, ""Shinmai Maou no Testament"" takes it to an uncomfortable extreme. Gratuitous scenes of sexual innuendos and explicit content seem to be the primary focus, overshadowing any chance of a coherent or compelling storyline. Instead of investing in developing the world or exploring its unique fantasy elements, the show relies on cheap titillation, making it difficult to take the series seriously or appreciate any potential merits it might have.Furthermore, the pacing is all over the place. It switches haphazardly between serious moments and slapstick comedy, making it challenging to connect with the characters or the overall tone of the anime. This inconsistency disrupts the flow of the story, leaving viewers confused and disinterested in the plot\'s outcome.Lastly, the overall production quality is lackluster. The animation is mediocre at best, and the fight scenes lack the intensity and fluidity needed to make them memorable. One would expect a visually stunning display in a fantasy anime, but ""Shinmai Maou no Testament"" disappoints in this aspect as well.All in all, ""Shinmai Maou no Testament"" is a prime example of how an anime can falter by relying solely on shallow fan service and neglecting crucial elements like plot, character development, and world-building. The excessive ecchi content and lack of substance make it hard to recommend this series to anyone seeking a fulfilling anime experience. Save your time and watch something that respects its viewers\' intelligence and offers a more captivating story and characters. certain tropes, ""Shinmai Maou no Testament"" takes it to a whole new level of predictability.

"", ""I loved this series from beginning till end of first season then it fell short in the second season. Mainly because of the way Maria was treated. I am just going to say it I am in love with Maria Naruse and she was my favorite character in the entire series however the series treated her badly. First of all she was the only female character that had little to no one on one relationship development time with Basara our main protagonist and barely any fan service scenes with him I counted them 5 in season 1 demoted to a disrespectful 2 in the second...season, from which her scenes were short compared to the other fan service scenes and nowhere near as passionate as the other female characters. Basara seemed to never want to do anything with her when he was completely active with all other female characters. Not to mention the fact that her best fan service scene in season 1 was not using her characters actual moe model and was done not because Basara wanted to but without giving anything away because of some stupid reason to try and justify the plot. In the second season Maria was barely involved in anything and Basara paid even less attention to her that completely broke me and made me hate the series because as I said I love Maria. She was one the best developed characters in the series with a very unique personality that made shine and steal every scene she was in which is why I feel even more angry on her lack of fan service scenes. The series took fan service to far and I got sick of it after a while but I would have still loved it had Maria been the one involved. The second season also showed that Maria was the character that basara cared least about as he very rarely came to her aid which once again killed me inside. I love Maria and the series. If they make a season 3 my only request is that Maria and Basaras relationship blossoms and Basara shows me that he truly loves her just as much as the other girls especially when she is one of the longest reigning characters as she has been involved since the very first episode along with Mio. So please in season 3 my only desire is for double the Maria fan service and Basara and Maria loving each other more. With my rant aside I enjoyed the series but the fan service needed to be cut down (except Maria's) and the relationships need to be better developed (especially Maria's). I do hope there is a season 3 and I hope they take my opinion into account at the least (probably not gong to happen). Would I recommend this series. Well if you love fan service and harem, comedies then I highly recommend this if you don't then find something more your taste. My apologies that this is not really a helpful review I just needed to vent my frustrations towards a series that I have a major love hate relationship with. Thank you for taking the time to read this I appreciate it.

HALA MARIA NARUSE THE GREATEST FEMALE ANIME CHARACTER OF ALL TIME (ALONG WITH KOTORI ITSUKA FROM DATE A LIVE)"", ""This is a fine example of what's wrong with the vast majority of light novels.  It's nowhere near as bad as other titles but the shoe horned cliches make it obvious this series lacks any substance. Basara Toujou meets his two new step sisters who turn out to be demons. Basara himself comes from a tribe of heroes but went Rouge after a freak accident and now heroes and demons alike have a vendetta against the family.  With that premise, you'd expect something great but this show rather have otaku pandering than well written story .The amount of easily...avoidable cliches in here is just ridiculous.  Mio is the basic red headed agressive tsundere who is prone to perverted misunderstandings. Maria is a loli character who is constantly sexualized.  The fact that she's a succubus doesn't give the author an excuse for placing his perverted fetishes on a underage girl.  Yuki is a better childhood friend. There's also the incestuous moments between Basara and his sisters. It's clear the demographic for Shinmai Maou no Testament is the depraved deadbeat otaku variety.The excuse of a story is obviously an after though here. A few demons attack the basara family,  they have a perverted moment,  basara swears to protect them and repeat.  Things do get interesting once the past of the hero tribe comes into play but it doesn't last long.  The author clearly has no creativity and fails to properly expand on his own story.  He's much more interested in pleasing the lowest common denominator.One thing this show actually manages to do correctly is the music and character design.  The soundtrack is composed  by Yasuharu Takahashi  who is responsible for a plethora of outstanding songs over the years  The original character design Is done by ookuma nekosuke who despite his extreme amount of ecchi work, his art is still great.  Its a shame their talents went to waste here.The last positive statement I have for this crap is that basara toujou has above average characterization for a light novel protagonist. avoidable cliches in here is just ridiculous.

LOL well that is non existant unless you consider fog/clouds covering the ENTIRE SCREEN Ecchi.

Sure, they\'re both fantasy/action stories involving demons, and ecchi elements, but Highschool DXD is waaaay more tame than this. I genuinely had to check to make sure that this didn\'t have ""hentai"" as one of the tags after one of the early ecchi scenes. The levels of nudity, groping/fondling are extreme to say the very least on the matter. The major issue with this is that...the extreme differences make you feel like you\'re watching something pornographic one second, and a battle shonen the next second, without any attempt to blend the two together. Highschool DXD does a significantly better job, by not being as extreme with the ecchi elements, and transitioning from those scenes to other scenes in a much more natural manner, where\'s Shinmai Maou literally just jumps from one to the next without a care in the world.Story: 2, I knew this was gonna be a dumpster fire within the first 30 seconds of the first episode, but who knew it was going to get this bad. Everything in the story is orchestrated in the most BS manner to get as many women living in the MC\'s house with him, and to top that off, we also get the classic ""I need to go overseas for work"" BS from the parental figure that we always see in these kinds of shows. Additionally the MC refers to the two initial girls as his sisters (even though they aren\'t actually related) just to satisfy those of you with incest fetishes, but I digress. The only times the story isn\'t predictable is when it\'s making random asspulls for the sake of getting women naked/fondled.Art: 5, You\'d think a series that is focused on trying to give you an erection would have better art, but whatever. The fights are boring as can be, with all of the budget going into making the ecchi scenes up-to hentai art standards, which is not a compliment. At the very least, the quality of the art stays pretty consistent, though that isn\'t much of a compliment either when the quality is this low.Sound: 2, I think this is the lowest I may have ever given sound, but the OP and ED are garbage; I ended up skipping both in every episode because they were unbearable. The VA\'s were subpar at best, every girl sounds like a damn squeaky toy.Character: 2, There is absolutely no character development to speak of, and no one in the show has an ounce of personality. MC is the worst for being so inconsistent in his behavior; one second he\'s groping nude girls, about to have his way with them, the next he\'s acting like some incel.Enjoyment: 3, I only completed this because I had nothing else to watch, so as background noise its okay, I guess.Overall: 3, Was originally planning to give this a 5 overall, but writing this review really made me reflect on the true level of garbage I had just wasted my time on. They really should\'ve dropped the fantasy elements and just made a hentai. I don\'t understand what the author\'s mentality was other than ""well sex sells, so lets pump this fantasy/action series full of as much sex without getting it labeled a hentai that way it hits a wider audience"". I wasn\'t expecting there to not be ecchi elements, but I have never seen this level of ecchi, and I won\'t be surprised/disappointed if I never see these levels of ecchi again. Ultimately, if you want an action/fantasy series there\'s better shit than this, and if you\'re looking to beat your meat, well there\'s still better shit than this, so I wouldn\'t waste your time on this. the extreme differences make you feel like you\'re watching something pornographic one second, and a battle shonen the next second, without any attempt to blend the two together.

But regardless, it is a critical element of the anime, so if that puts you off you simply will not enjoy this anime.In terms of the story there isn't really much of an overarching plot yet, rather the various arcs...are focused more around world building and introducing the characters, with the first two arcs being decent enough but the last getting much more intense and being quite awesome with an amazing payoff for the finale. There are a number of characters that are quite interesting. The protagonist is pretty awesome, in that he's a hero, and as usual believes in the virtues of justice, family, etc. but at the same time he seems to very much have his stuff together, and won't object to getting his hands dirty when necessary. In terms of the heroines Maria felt the most interesting, in that she has a personality that automatically causes a never ending string of hilarious events, but she also gets a decent amount of depth in the last arc of this season in terms of how she deals with difficult situations. Mio was also interesting in that she's a tsundere but not at all, which is kind of fun, and also interesting in that she has a lot to deal with. Yuki got a good amount of development, and her character is pretty interesting with her being so singly minded, but she hasn't really grown on me yet. There were also a number of interesting side characters introduced as well that are likely to become more important in the future. In terms of world building, there's a lot but it's pretty basic so far, so breadth instead of depth, with some basic background on the demons and hero clans, but it carries the story well enough. An area I especially felt it needed more focused world building though was regarding powers and combat, because though these sequences were cool there wasn't much explanation to them mechanically so there wasn't much depth to them.The art and animation are really good. The character designs are mostly excellent as well. The OP was decent enough and the ED was quite good. The soundtrack was more intense and better than I expected. are focused more around world building and introducing the characters, with the first two arcs being decent enough but the last getting much more intense and being quite awesome with an amazing payoff for the finale.

Ecchi that have a decent plot and or character development and use the ecchi as a hook or gimmick to get more views.2. Ecchi that use the ecchi part as a suppliment to replace a good plot and character development.This anime is the second category. a more in depth review would be pointless as the show is basically a really bad hentai. Thats all.The characters are horribly horribly bland and generic, mio is basically a boring...version of Lala/Rara from To love-ru. in fact the show is basically a bland more unoriginal version of To love-Ru.

They try to juke him, he jukes them, randomly says to protect them,...and now he\'s protecting them.Extras may include: (especially if you watch the uncensored version)-MC pulling salvation out of his ass-Pretty much incest-Lots of switching between saving the imoutos and imouto bath time-Rituals that if done wrong give you neck tatoos that make you horny-nipple sucking-Dense MC-thirsty childhood friend-MC is perfect and apparently has no human personality flaws-MORE nipple sucking! (one part even with maple syrup :D)You see right there, what a package!Honestly, this is the most borderline hentai anime I have ever watched, MC trying to create a stronger ""bond"" with his step-sister and also ""slave"" technically.You know this anime trash, when the only reason you watch it, is because your bro would give you a crispy $5.But anyway, enough ranting, (well maybe a little bit more)Opening, ok, not memorable though.I actually liked the art style, but some of the animation was lazy (especially in some fight scenes)I actually did find the MC attractive, till I saw his steadily growing and competitive harem along with his Mary Sue personality. Though I did want to know more about him and childhood friend\'s backstory.Didn\'t get much of course tho :PI won\'t lie, the last couple of episodes had me actually interested and ""into it"" but still, the anime leaves you unsatisfied, as we find out Naruse Mio AKA No-Life-No-Bra Maple tits and Naruse Maria AKA ProcreateWithYouInACorner loli are still being sought after.And OTP Nonaka Yuki AKA KuudereChildhoodfriendWithThatBootyTho and MC never sailed, OBVIOUSLY.Overall, not really anything special.

Mio one of the main girls she is the demon lords daughter and honestly she can be a perv and also not she is pretty sweet and what not. Maria is another main girl of the anime and the succubus of the anime and she basically like Mio in a sense but she is like hella pervy in the anime and even recording the lewd thing happening.

For many other shows it feels like ""good"" or ""bad"" is just painted on them.You could\'ve made this about anything really, heroes and demons was something that didn\'t matter to the story, you could replace it with any sort of faction that didn\'t have a clear divide between good or bad.They didn\'t really talk about the heroes or demons much but I don\'t think that\'s a...bad thing, but I guess there are a few people who like their story to be filled and have every gap be ironed out, but I kinda like that they left out all the history crap. And I don\'t think it would\'ve been at all important.It just leads to bad intros like we\'re kinda used to where there\'s a character that suddenly without any prompt starts a monologue of 20 minutes filling you in with what happened in the past.2) A less naive dominance dynamic.This anime also features a more realistic subtle dominance relationship between the characters, which is something others shows are very brunt with.A good example of that is the relationship between Basara and Takigawa, there\'s no conversion of good or bad but just mutual benefit, actually almost all of the characters are permitted to have their own choices even when there is a master slave dynamic.The relationships with the women are more subtle in the way that it\'s not that they have to obey, I mean there\'s still the usual protagonist\'s aversion to perversion but the master is actually the one who is more a slave to his slaves having to protect them from all their problems. I\'m not sure if many harem anime do that, but I\'ve seen many where it\'s just: ""now I can make you do my bidding, but I\'m scared of being a bad guy so I won\'t""Here it\'s like: ""I\'ll free you from your worries, fix your problems, just build a trusting relationship where you let me act perverted.""I don\'t know but it seems more realistic that way.There was a joke about chocolate that I hurt my cheeks with by smirking. There are some nice details in the conversation dynamic. The sexual aspect of the story kinda hints at a mature writer who had some experience in the field, (at least compared to other anime of this genre) but you may disagree.Another nice ""realistic"" touch was the timing in the ""fanservice"" scenes, while they were quite hard to watch, I kinda like how it speaks to the imagination, and I guess that was more of the point behind them. It gave you ample time and a good idea for you to imagine the rest with.3) Smart characters.It cringes me in a lot of anime that obvious links aren\'t made and it makes the characters seem dumber than they should be, I was impressed at least two times where they were able to put links together that I didn\'t notice myself but would\'ve made perfect sense.4) The ""mistakes"".They do the above right but then at other moments in the story it feels forced like the scene isn\'t built up enough for them to go a certain direction, I think that\'s in line with other reviews saying it\'s ""all over the place"" but I\'m not sure because that\'s not a very detailed opinion.Other stuff that they did bad (IMO) was the brother sister thing, I don\'t think it was necessary in this story, and it feels more as catering to a wider audience.Simply saying ""you\'re part of our family now"" would\'ve sufficed, especially when they have an orphan backstory going for a lot of the characters.Also Mio\'s character.. I don\'t know.. she was annoying, there\'s like no good thing about her, she\'s kinda useless really, it\'s not very clear why from a human standpoint why anyone would want to protect her, but I guess love is blind and she\'s got those boobies and her hidden power as a motivation to keep her around. She made me emotional with her cries for help but I didn\'t like her, as is clear with these words.5) the ending.The ending scene was very powerful.I mean It just felt like a guy who was comfortable with his more darker side in that scene and it took me by surprise to see that in the father since at the start he acts normal and more like a typical good guy. But it all fits since he\'s earned some sort of god status. It\'s nice that they convey it like that.The same with Basara becoming more of a sadist, they are showing a wider more mature spectrum of good and bad as explained at the start of this review, it provides something unique and that\'s why I would recommend it.now go watch it, you ウィーブ bad thing, but I guess there are a few people who like their story to be filled and have every gap be ironed out, but I kinda like that they left out all the history crap.

Demon Princess Mio’s life is under threat, and because reasons, a member of another clan which is considered their worst enemy takes her on as an adopted daughter. But wait! He has a son! Also, this dad is given the moniker ‘War God’ for being super broken or something, and guess what! So is his son! Also for some reason there is a servant to Mio named something I can’t remember,...who also happens to be a Succubus because of course she is! Why they’re his adopted daughters is unclear but don’t worry about it! There are lots of boobies! And isn’t that all that matters? I’m pretty sure this was the pitch the writer gave to the anime studio who produced this, and the studio exec asked, well, will there be more? And he’s like, yeah! We’ll put a childhood friend in there too! Done! Apart from that, the plot is simple. Mio has to get the demon throne (become the demon queen) and this guy’s son, despite being a member of the clan dedicated to hunting demons is like, “yeah sure. I’ll help.” I genuinely could not bring myself to care about the story because I have seen better plots in actual Hentai. But there have been hentai with worse ‘plot’ if you know what I mean.Art: 2/10: apart from the sex scenes, nothing was good. Even those scenes were mainly static, so the animators just used some cuts to silhouettes and background voices to avoid doing anything. The fight scenes were bland and uninteresting and there was no variety in the colour palette.Sound: 5/10: you might think this is high, but I genuinely don’t remember anything about the OP or ED, and I’m pretty sure I don’t remember the voice acting either. So to be fair I just gave it a middle ground rating.Character: 1/10: MC- <Insert OP protagonist who has a harem here>(eg. Kirito)Main girl - <Insert traditional big-boobed tsundere here>Succubus servant - I don’t actually rememberChildhood friend -literally just a childhood friend.There might have been more characters, but they’re all irrelevant because they haven’t had sex with our MC yet.Enjoyment: 3/10 : I’m not sure if I’m allowed to say I enjoyed this. I enjoyed this in the same way I enjoy a Hentai anime. If you don’t count the turn your brain off watch, then no. There’s nothing to enjoy. There are no stakes in the fights, and even when the story tries to introduce some we all know MC-kun will win because Kirito cannot lose.Overall : 1/10 : Watch it whenever you feel like watching a Hentai. who also happens to be a Succubus because of course she is!

Because of this, I had to take my time to evaluate this, among other things.The story is rather simplistic, but its contents help push it forward. The use of Demons and Heros really reminds me of Highschool DxD, with both their aspects and relationships with one another. They both also use lewd situations to progress, which is fun. I believe that there is much more that can be done with this, and I hope to see more be explored in the future if...possible. Besides this, this anime is very humorous and entertaining, which is good in an ecchi anime like these.The characters are all fine, but a bit underdeveloped which is unfortunate. Despite this, they are still lovable, and you are bound to find one you like. Sometimes, the characters really feel straight out of Highschool DxD, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Oh also, Mio and Zest are best girls no doubt.The animation is pretty average and is what you'd expect from an anime that aired in 2015. The art is sometimes a bit odd-looking but is usually passable. This anime is pretty censored which is to be expected, but the good parts are still good nonetheless (if you know what I mean).Overall, a surprisingly good anime. I went in thinking it wouldn't compare to Highschool DxD, but I was shocked to be proven wrong. I really enjoyed this anime more than I thought I would, which was a pleasant surprise.

Not actual sex but in every episode, erotica is all over the place. Which isn\'t bad, but at times was completely unnecessary.Storywise it was very intriguing and kept me interested till the end which proves we\'re talking about a good anime.The characters were a bit mess, mainly because they never bothered to show their past. They kept mentioning it and showed important scenes from the past but they never told us exactly what happened, why or how it affected the characters.Basara is a...good MC, with good and bad moments that makes him the master and the rest of the girls his servants who he must help them release their sexual tension in order to become stronger (just go with it...). Mio is the main girl, but i think her role could have been way more important and not ust the hot redhead with big boobs heroine. Wasted potential here for sure. The other girls are just different enough to tell them apart but generic in terms of personality.Overall, this is a show with many flaws that i enjoyed. good MC, with good and bad moments that makes him the master and the rest of the girls his servants who he must help them release their sexual tension in order to become stronger (just go with it...).

one can very much see why everything on two legs around him wants to get into the pants of this handsome, smart, suave, strong, reliable, battle-hardened action hero that would literally travel through hell and back for one of his chicks.On the other hand the harem is ramped up here, and made even less believable than usual — this dude is seriously having sex with all of them in the same room [reluctantly...of course, as any true harem protagonist]; there is a ridiculous plot device that basically requires him to touch their erogenous zones periodically to alleviate some curse, and all of them are just standing and watching as he reluctantly does them one by one, waiting there turn — the sex scenes basically show all nudity but genitals; indeed the opening sequence is full of nudity with Barby-doll-anatomy.Apart from that, the plot is actually not bad at all and unlike most harem series it has some interesting male characters, some of which border on flirting with the protagonist but not quite; the action sequences are fairly good and the protagonist looks pretty cool wielding a sword with his parent somehow looking even cooler.The romance between Basara and Mio is also not that bad; Mio is your typical tundere at first who is quickly won over by Basara\'s awesome-at-everything, especially being your adopted onii-tyan — to make it even more delicious Mio only refers to him with ""onii-tyan"" during the sex scenes.Which brings us back to this clusterfuck harem full of sex scenes; it just distracts so much from what is actually worthwhile about the series; it could have been a good plot-driven romance–action, were it not for the harem and the sex scenes constantly distracting from that; I don\'t even think the sex scenes are that good; they\'re super standard sex scenes that don\'t really have that Masahiro Itosugi je-ne-sais-quoi to them which actually makes them not detract from the plot, probably because he makes characters talk and say interesting things during sex, and the sex is also just far better.And the harem really detracts from the main Basara–Mio romance; Mio is the one whom everyone is rooting for; the others are just side-interests at best; none of them really have the compelling backstory that Mio has; exemplified the most in one scene where your shipping balls get bluer than the face of an oxygen-deprived smurf when Basara and Mio share a moment and then the rest of the harem just walzes in to ruin the moment and fuck with you.Maria as ""part of the harem"" can stay; he\'s just a troll succubus that would fuck anyone anyway and he\'s mostly just funny and adding to the fire and watching, but the rest is so obnoxious.If the rest of the harem were just characters rather than getting in the way of the main romance, if the sex scenes were better or just not there, this could have been fairly good. of course, as any true harem protagonist];

It was the most... intriguing echii series I have ever seen in my entire life.I've grown up watching a lot of harem echii shows and I'm pretty accustomed to the amount of fanservice that they provide, but Shinmai Maou no Testament is a different beast all together. I remember the scene where they use maple syrup and... I was actually disturbed by it. It's the first echii show where I felt like I was watching some actually messed up stuff, and that made me very uncomfortable. That's only...about half of the fanservice though, so it wasn't absolutely bad.Plot wise it's about a dude who's a hero protecting his adopted sister (who also happens to be the demon lord, who knew?) from other heroes, demons, and whatever else happens to be coming out today. Basically, It's like Highschool DxD, but the fanservice is much more... extreme, if I'm going to be honest.The protagonist is pretty generic and bland, to the point where I don't remember his name, so I'm just gonna call him Kirito because well... what's the difference. His main role is to break the show's villains over his knee due to plot convenience, and touch his sister in various... ways. He gets all the ladies (because this is a harem show), and he's got them traditionally good protagonist morals.His sister, the demon lord, is a tsundere red-head who usually gets kidnapped. She's the protagonist's servant due to stuff involving a succubus, and is the main fanservice character for the entire show. She's also generic, so let's just call her Asuna.Look, if you haven't figured it out already, this show is painfully generic. The only thing that sticks out is the over the top fanservice... but, why did I give it a 5 and not something lower? Well, for one thing, it looks nice. The aesthetics aren't too special, but they were relatively nice. But also, I just plain enjoyed the action. I know it's not the main calling card of the show, but when the action pops up, it is pretty fun to see.So there you have it folks, Shinmai Maou no Testament. It's a generic show, with a little bit of action to spice things up, but a lot of disturbing fanservice to bring it way down. about half of the fanservice though, so it wasn't absolutely bad.Plot wise it's about a dude who's a hero protecting his adopted sister (who also happens to be the demon lord, who knew?) from other heroes, demons, and whatever else happens to be coming out today.

It's just a very ordinary anime with ordinary characters. Basara's motivation is just... unbelievable. And not in the good way. I mean, I wold give 3.5 stars out of five for this anime because it tried. And failed. It seems like an alternate version of Highschool DxD, and would be great if it wasn't a low budged project AND everybody's motivation weren't so mediocre.The first episode is OK, which means I thought it would be a great idea to buy every volume of the original manga. Well, I didn't regret that, because I had met this story in...a way better point of view. The anime sucks. Hope the second season is better. a way better point of view. The anime sucks. Hope the second season is better."", 'Welcome to Robert\'s Too Late Reviews! Today we\'re going to be doing, as always, the dubbed version of this anime, and of note is the fact this review covers season 1, the extra episode (OVA, what have you) and the second season, subtitled \'Burst\'. The quick of it is if you need more boobs in your anime life, or are like me and dig the supernatural angle, then go watch (or rewatch, whatever the case may be) Highschool DxD, as this is nothing but a cookie cutter rip of that series. Nevertheless, there might be a new entry on the RTLR wall of sexy 2d...gals, read on to find out more!Story: 4As I said, this is probably literally as close as one can legally get to outright copying another, somewhat better, series. They lift insane amounts of material directly from DxD\'s playbook and just slightly alter it and serve it back to us. I\'m going to run down some of the similarities for ya here, beyond of course the fact that they are both ecchi harems. Both feature a male lead that has a weapon that disappears when not in use, and starts as only covering part of their arm. Later both has the male lead developing his weapon and arm protection into a full blown body transformation. Both times we have the full body transformation being very dangerous to the guy, with them nearly losing control and injuring members of the harem, specifically the primary female. Both are saved from making this terrible mistake by the power of love (or tits, one of the two I guess) and both come back from the edge at the nick of time, of course not before beating the ever loving shit out of the bad guy.The primary female is a redhead, and related to the Devil/Lucifer/Demon King, basically demon royalty in some manner or the other. Both redheads have insane levels of power inside themselves that is only tapped when the male is in extreme danger. Both are built like porn stars and seem to have an irrational love of the male lead for reasons that aren\'t ever really explained all that well. The primary female is desired by otherworldly forces, particularly to exploit her power and standing.There are present in both series characters that are in diametric opposition to the demon forces who turn and end up joining the hero\'s cause. In fact both shows come to a point where they both have two of these girls in each. To clarify because this is perhaps less obvious, the church exorcists in DxD, and the hero village girls in Testament. All four girls from both series are swordsmen, and know powerful techniques. They are also all in lust for the male lead. In a slightly different but yet same characterization, both the primary female from the opposing force (the first hero girl and the former nun in DxD) feel like they are in competition with the demon princess for the affections of the male lead. They both will follow the princess\' lead and try to get the male to do to them what he is (or appears to be) doing to the princess.Random similarities being that there\'s another male in the series, yet they are not in competition with the male lead for the interest of any of the girls, and is always around to lend the male lead a hand when the cards seem to be down. Of course they both are kind of mysterious in their backgrounds. There is a character that joins the harem because her original allegiance to another person/group is broken, Asia in DxD with the church, and Zest in Testament from the other demon dude. Both feature a character that has issues with their older sister (Koneko and Maria).This is just a VERY small start on the similarities, there\'s lots more to be found throughout both seasons. I mean, I\'m surprised they didn\'t have to drop this show from ever being made due to intellectual infringement. Let\'s cover the primary difference between the two series: in DxD the male lead wants to have sex with his harem members but totally wimps out before anything happens, whereas in Testament, the male lead basically bangs every member, and sometimes all of them at once. While only breast groping and ass (through their panties) is explicitly is shown, it is *heavily* implied that there\'s full penetration sex happening and even some hints of oral sex going down as well. The characters are all put into several different sexual positions and are making all the correct movements for doing the nasty yet either the camera never pans down, or when it does, they toss on a token pair of undies on everyone. Make no mistake, this show is MUCH dirtier in my opinion than DxD. And of course, conveniently, having sex with his harem not only powers up the hero, it also increases the power of the girls as well. Therefore \'training\' is nothing more than an excuse to get some more sexy time onscreen.The basic lay is that the primary female has some demon power in her that everyone wants, and the male has to fight off those that wish to harm her. They even take a trip into the demon realm and face down enemies there. The male lead also has multiple references to a difficult past, something about an accident that happened when he was a good bit younger that either hurt or killed some of his fellow members of the hero clan. This is repeatedly referenced yet there\'s no satisfactory explanation as to exactly what happened, what the direct results were (beyond his obvious exile) and why it happened to him. It\'s implied, and easily assumed, that this is a power he has inherited from his father, who is referred to repeatedly as being the \'war god\' and being shown to posses a power level that would warrant such a title.There\'s also a few remarks about the power the male lead carries being related to Brunhildr, which made me interested in hearing more about this power and the mythology surrounding it, similar again to DxD\'s Red Dragon Emperor power, which of course we get lots of info on, but for Testament, we never really explore the lore around Brunhildr. There\'s some kind of throw away stuff about it being the power the Valkyries used to gather souls, but it\'s basically mentioned in one or two lines in one episode, and basically that\'s all we get. I was left wanting to know more about the lore and mythology of the show. Instead we get like a third to sometimes nearly half of the show focusing on nothing more than sex. While titillation has it\'s place, and can be enjoyable, we really don\'t need every last episode just about featuring extended sequences of naughtiness. Yes, we get it, you bang the girls to get everyone stronger. Tell me about more about the gods/devils/powers related to the occultic and/or supernatural elements of the anime. No dice, really, on that point.The story just basically falls a few inches from hentai and seems to think that\'s all anyone wants to see. There is better hentai out there that isn\'t so contrived and convoluted, and there are better ecchi series that balance the fanservice with interesting details and world building. Instead we get one of two basic version in each episode: either they have sex to power up, beat bad guy or lose to baddie, sex to power up, beat baddie. Really that\'s about all we get overall. Disappointing.Art: 8The show looks really good, as one might expect, and one might even say that\'s another aspect aped from DxD, but I\'d like to think quality is something that everyone works towards. The characters are well drawn, though the breasts are, as usual, a little on the ridiculous side most of the time, especially during the ecchi sequences. Overall we have lots of detail and smooth animation, and some of the fights are pretty nice. Of course we get the usual sword problem that I just hate, the idiotic shooting of energy from melee weapons. If you\'re going to shoot each other, manifest guns, not swords. Getting to be a pet peeve of mine. This show does better than most in that for the most part, swords are used as swords, but when the power levels go through the roof, we get powers deployed through energy beams and waves. Otherwise I have no complaints, it looks like what you expect masturbation material for young men to look like. Beware the censored version, however, as I\'ve seen it reported that they are a bit heavy handed in covering the objectionable material. And with the amount of tit onscreen a lot of the times, I can see why they had to cover most of the screen during those shots.Sound: 7The themes are not bad, but not really very catchy, less so for Burst compared to the first season. They serve their purpose and have an appropriate \'rock\' sound to them. The music in show is properly dramatic in battle sequences and such, and is I guess properly \'chika umm bow wow\' during the ecchi scenes as well.The voice acting is pretty well done, for the most part. The princess sounds pretty good, and the nurse, oh goodness, the nurse sounds amazing in the dub. The succubus\' voice is a bit annoying a fair amount of the time. She\'s a big part of the knock on the score, and the fact that both the first hero girl and the \'rescued\' demon girl both sound about as interested in what was going on as a rather bored rock. Also the obvious problem, the over the top moaning and carrying on, which while expected in the sex scenes, still seemed way over the top for me. I can\'t imagine how it must be like to record those sounds. I would be embarrassed to even be part of the audio crew during those sessions, let alone the VA in there hamming it up. So yeah, there\'s a fair bit of the time that it sounds like a straight porno. I\'d recommend headphones.Character: 6I found the characters mildly interesting, but every time I wanted to know more about them, the show would stop for an obligatory 10 minutes of bouncing boobs. They could have expounded a bit more on the characters themselves and still fit in enough nakedness to get the point across. Why does the hero girls fall for the male lead? They were supposedly resentful, and rightly so, of the guy and the dangerous/deadly incident that happened years beforehand. If he accidentally released his powers and killed a bunch of people (which I believe is what they say between the sessions of moaning) why would they forgive him so easily? Why is there a reference here and there to the succubus being a virgin (seriously) when she\'s well, firstly, a sex demon, and secondly obsessed with porn and getting the various characters into banging? In one episode she literally masturbates (and orgasms) with a towel in front of the male lead. Virgin, yeah right.I also wanted to know more about how the princess got her demon powers. They offer that she\'s inherited them from the previous Demon Lord who was her father, but how did that work? How was the upstart lord vying for power over the demon realm able to do so without a comparable power? Why did she get the power if she wasn\'t prepared to take over rule of the demon realm? How did daddy die? There\'s a million neat details about the operation of the demon lore and such that they could have given us that they just leave out.There\'s a good foundation for the characters (for the most part) laid, but they never follow through, opting instead to jump to the \'training sessions\' instead.Enjoyment: 5I\'m a sucker for anything that has demons/angels/gods/devils or mythology in it (send recommends if you know of any good ones, please!) and I wanted to like this series so much, but they just went overboard with the sex. Now I don\'t mind naughtiness in the least, I might be middle aged, but boobs is one of those topics that I think is absolutely ageless (heh) yet they had me groaning when the porn music started, and I knew it was about to go into yet another extended ecchi sequence. I think I actually enjoyed DxD\'s system much better, where the male lead is a bit bumbling and is too awkward to actually accomplish getting it on, this version where the guy easily and frequently bangs the girls just smacks of some kind of softcore hentai. It\'s like watching Cinemax at 2 a.m., sure there\'s boobs, but the rest of the fun isn\'t actually shown. Forget that noise, if I wanted actual porn, I\'d go watch it. Make the point about the connection between sex and their power levels and move onto cool fights or something. I don\'t need endless softcore crap as long as the internet exists, ya know?As I said, I don\'t mind the sexual element at all, but if you\'re going to offer a story along with it, make sure the story is actually *good*. Either that or go the route of those \'70\'s pornos where they speak two lines ""Here\'s your pizza"" ""do me good big boy"" and off to the races. They tease much more with copying the interesting elements of other shows than they do with the fanservice. Basically it fails at being actual porn, and then fails at being a story as well. We\'re left wanting all around.Best Girl: The nurse Chisato, in the dub at least is one damn sexy sounding woman. Yeah, they give her corny lines, but damn if she don\'t sound good delivering them.Your time would be better served finding the shows that they ripped off (primarily DxD) and watching them instead. If you need \'gratification\' material, there\'s better versions of that out there as well. I was irritated that it was just interesting enough that I wouldn\'t drop it. I kept thinking \'well next episode they\'ll skip the lewd time and do more character development\' and was let down over and over. Mediocre at best. Nonetheless the nurse makes the RTLR of nastiness, just cuz I loved her voice actress. I don\'t think it\'s worth the bother. gals, read on to find out more!Story: 4As I said, this is probably literally as close as one can legally get to outright copying another, somewhat better, series.

In one episode she literally masturbates (and orgasms) with a towel in front of the male lead. Virgin, yeah right.I also wanted to know more about how the princess got her demon powers. They offer that she\'s inherited them from the previous Demon Lord who was her father, but how did that work? How was the upstart lord vying for power over the demon realm able to do so without a comparable power? Why did she get the power if she wasn\'t prepared to take over rule of the demon realm? How did daddy die? There\'s a million neat details about the operation of the demon lore and such that they could have given us that they just leave out.There\'s a good foundation for the characters (for the most part) laid, but they never follow through, opting instead to jump to the \'training sessions\' instead.Enjoyment: 5I\'m a sucker for anything that has demons/angels/gods/devils or mythology in it (send recommends if you know of any good ones, please!) and I wanted to like this series so much, but they just went overboard with the sex. Now I don\'t mind naughtiness in the least, I might be middle aged, but boobs is one of those topics that I think is absolutely ageless (heh) yet they had me groaning when the porn music started, and I knew it was about to go into yet another extended ecchi sequence. I think I actually enjoyed DxD\'s system much better, where the male lead is a bit bumbling and is too awkward to actually accomplish getting it on, this version where the guy easily and frequently bangs the girls just smacks of some kind of softcore hentai. It\'s like watching Cinemax at 2 a.m., sure there\'s boobs, but the rest of the fun isn\'t actually shown. Forget that noise, if I wanted actual porn, I\'d go watch it. Make the point about the connection between sex and their power levels and move onto cool fights or something. I don\'t need endless softcore crap as long as the internet exists, ya know?As I said, I don\'t mind the sexual element at all, but if you\'re going to offer a story along with it, make sure the story is actually *good*. Either that or go the route of those \'70\'s pornos where they speak two lines ""Here\'s your pizza"" ""do me good big boy"" and off to the races. They tease much more with copying the interesting elements of other shows than they do with the fanservice. Basically it fails at being actual porn, and then fails at being a story as well. We\'re left wanting all around.Best Girl: The nurse Chisato, in the dub at least is one damn sexy sounding woman. Yeah, they give her corny lines, but damn if she don\'t sound good delivering them.Your time would be better served finding the shows that they ripped off (primarily DxD) and watching them instead. If you need \'gratification\' material, there\'s better versions of that out there as well. I was irritated that it was just interesting enough that I wouldn\'t drop it. I kept thinking \'well next episode they\'ll skip the lewd time and do more character development\' and was let down over and over. Mediocre at best. Nonetheless the nurse makes the RTLR of nastiness, just cuz I loved her voice actress. I don\'t think it\'s worth the bother.', 'So... yeah... this is basically the poor man\'s Highschool DxD. Whereas that series had fan service and excess nudity, it also had a wicked story plot, excellent characters and mixed in raw emotion and logical fan service into their story. This on the other hand, is frustrating.The good:Art looks amazing, this is on par with some of the best looking modern anime.If you\'re a fan of essentially softcore porn, this is the closest thing you\'re going to find.The plot can be OK at times, the main characters are likeable enough and the voice acting is done well.The fight scenes are cool and diverse.The bad:If...you\'re not a fan of softcore porn, you will find the ecchi scenes weird and uncomfortable; if I wanted porn I would watch porn, this was just silly and weird.The way the ecchi is rammed into the story made me frustrated; it is trite and annoying and the fact that MC is so quick to just accept that he needs to ""service"" his harem makes him unlikable.The way characters gain power and can always be strong enough at the right times didn\'t make sense; it was too convenient.Story 7, Art 9, Sound 7, Character 5, Enjoyment 7, Overall 6/10 you\'re not a fan of softcore porn, you will find the ecchi scenes weird and uncomfortable; if I wanted porn I would watch porn, this was just silly and weird.The way the ecchi is rammed into the story made me frustrated; it is trite and annoying and the fact that MC is so quick to just accept that he needs to ""service"" his harem makes him unlikable.The way characters gain power and can always be strong enough at the right times didn\'t make sense; it was too convenient.Story 7, Art 9, Sound 7, Character 5, Enjoyment 7, Overall 6/10', 'I really want to like this anime but I just can’t and here’s why.The story: I won’t explain it but already it’s a bit overused but still never the less could be good since there are many good shows that have very basic concepts, but this show is just soooo bad, not in concept, but in presentation. Which really sucks because I feel like this show had potential but it just fell down the crapper.The characters: this part of the show I actually felt like they did somewhat decent however after lewding the absolute crap out of them, they feel almost as tho you...can’t take them seriously.Which again sucks because both the characters and the story in the beginning were good and had potential but because of poor writing it feel apart. It just feels like instead of giving these characters good personalities and trying to get the watcher to invest in the characters. Instead they just gave them basic personalities and said: yeah but they have tits so it’s okay.And last but not least is pacing. I don’t know if anyone else had this problem or if it was just me but the pacing is wayyyyyyy off. It’s just like this happens and then right after that something else happens and as that was happening this was being done and it’s just like. Hold on, stop calm down, do something else, I don’t care.I really wanted to like this show and like sao I think it had a lot of potential, but just didn’t hold up. I will say I did enjoy the op but as far as everything else 👎. can’t take them seriously.Which again sucks because both the characters and the story in the beginning were good and had potential but because of poor writing it feel apart.

I guess....The animation was definitely not a priority when it came to figuing out the budget. I felt like I was watching a cheesy 90s Saturday morning cartoon (for those that are old enough to remember them.) Colors weren\'t too bad, backgrounds were ok, but man, the rest of it was just...sad. Probably the best animation came when there were tongues mashed against each other.Sometimes scenes shift blindly. You\'ll go from being in one place and then you\'ll suddenly be in another, almost as if they were crunched for time restraints due to it running too long....There needed to be some sort of reason and definition without alienating the current segway.

Avoid this if hentai isn\'t your thing. I mean, I don\'t mind boobs and stuff, but this really pours it on.Stereotypes are all on display here. Good looking protagonist with the trope of a ""male protagonist with a shameful and broken past renews himself and proves to not be a bad guy, ultimately becoming the hero we know - no - deserve."" Then there\'s there the ""big boobed, male dependent female."" There is one character that seems to have her head screwed on straight for most non-hentai themed storylines (Yuki), but falls into the stereotype of being part of a harem and totally jealous, though the way she handles that aspect is again stereotypical. She has to have him for her own and will do anything to make it happen! Despite that, she\'s my favorite character of the who she-bang because she\'s straightforward and resolut. She speak for herself and without reserve.

Obviously it\'s not to be taken seriously and it\'s a bit pointless to analyze its plot and characterization deeply when it is clear this piece chose the easy path to entertaining a large amount of viewers, partially including myself, through ecchi, unrealistic romance, some ridiculous comedy and to be fair the plot progression could be worse. The cliches are not only anime cliches worth criticizing but they are also worthy of being called plagiarized from other similar shows with like-minded authors. Compared to such titles, I thought some parts of the narrative were intriguing albeit not very intricate or...that developed inside 12 episodes. Specifically, I was entertained by the dilemma of the MC, member of the ""hero"" faction or whatever, hosting a devil (enemy faction) that both factions actually come hunting for as they seek her inherited power. Beyond that obviously most choices are predictable as far as the plot goes - Basara winning the battles that he has to, the girls not going full strength on him or even joining him against their own faction, Takigawa and the way he joins forces with the MC as well, everything remotely romantic was totally bruteforced, exaggerated, unrealistic but nevertheless expected especially in a harem context when all the girls have to like the protagonist somehow, at least eventually. And in case my tone sounds a little disappointed or critical, that is not the case, since I have come to expect this level of writing from shows under these categories (and, to an extent, I seek them out myself since they manage to entertain me in the end). Obviously compared to better shows it is fair to reduce a significant amount of points here, but after all the purpose is to be entertained and I can\'t say this was too much of a negative experience.Not sure all of that ecchi action was necessary, although seeing a ""succubus"" type being included in the story from the start was a big enough indication that that would happen. Even then they went pretty hardcore, for my standards anyway. As much as I can\'t say I dislike those scenes visually... how long can they entertain me for, when there\'s no progression and no romance to them? Just easy, blind entertainment through ecchi in a show that tries to tell a story about all these heroes and devils, too. Without even talking about how weird it is to make a show where a ""lewd succubus curse"" is such a big plot point.Obviously that was intended. The author was pretty cheeky with all those noises, ""onii-chan""\'s, kinks, putting those characters in those positions when it practically made no sense only to literally include the word ""service"" in the dialogue (referencing fanservice). Sheesh...If I were to analyze the other part of the plot - that should be slightly more consistent or at the very least make sense, that is the heroes vs devils storyline, Basara\'s past, his fights, basically everything that wasn\'t romance related. Then I\'d say some of the action was cool, specifically Basara\'s sword fights and probably some of Mio\'s power. The rest of it was average and uninteresting, and I again felt that a show like this didn\'t need this much action in the end. In particular, compared to other shows, this feels as though both the ecchi part and the fighting part make each other not fit in the show, because they ruin the vibe for each other to an extent, and certainly because they are quite extreme/developed in parallel. You see a lot of ecchi and think - when\'s some consistent plot gonna come? Then you get your fights and think - first of all, is this consistent plot? And most importantly, was it actually good to do it this way in a show like this which clearly isn\'t serious otherwise? The balance in this is quite weird therefore. Regardless, I was not very interested in the fights or their results as they are predictable and of lower quality than the dozens of shonens I\'ve watched anyway so if I wanted some action I\'d watch those.Nothing that concerns the romantic plotlines is realistic, just forced in order to fulfill the ecchi/harem appeal, and probably the same could be said about the main storyline, although that requires a little more thinking. Specifically I am wondering why the hero faction handled the situation as they did instead of actually trying to do their job in eliminating their target. How the devils acted similarly and sent only weaklings. One was instantly destroyed by that hero guy, the other 2 literally betrayed the bad guys. Generally if you think about it most of the plot is nonsensical although that side of it is bearable, and the narrative in itself was sort of intriguing in my opinion, as mentioned. That includes Basara\'s cool power too, which, to be fair, was also unexplained and a little cliche making him sort of an overpowered cool guy MC (especially when he kept easily recovering and not seeming injured after using powers or taking hits that they said should leave him totally knackered).The worldbuilding is not very in depth, and I didn\'t expect a detailed expanded universe to be described inside 12 episodes with all the show\'s ambitions (fighting, ecchi, harem), but we certainly don\'t learn a lot about the heroes or devils. Only surface level knowledge, like the current heroes, Basara\'s own past, his dad\'s status (that is only one generation back), and on the other side the same: the current devils and their standings and maybe the situation one generation back (including Mio\'s backstory). That does not go very deep into their history does it. That\'s the main reason why I claimed that that side of things was not that developed. Not that they make it seem like there would be a whole lot more to it though.The characters are obviously walking cliches, from all the shallow girls that inevitably end up liking the protagonist, to the cocky & weird-looking devils, to the equally unoriginal heroes, to the main guy, although his nature is worth exploring a little bit. I didn\'t necessarily feel repelled by the characters, the worst ones didn\'t last long and the better ones were pretty hot or at the very least involved in that kind of stuff. Jokes aside, the only one that has some sort of intricacy to his character is Basara, and not through his backstory or ambition to protect the girls, but because it\'s not always clear what his stance on the situation is. Specifically in terms of romantic acts. For example, he starts off so hesitant that it\'s a little surprising to then see him touch the girls like that, fantasize about it and stuff like that. It\'s made even more confusing with his slightly inconsistent feelings and facial expressions across episodes. So I wonder if it\'s some more deeply-rooted contradicting personality worth analyzing, or simply the author\'s fault for not really showing his feelings (unintentionally - just bad writing). I\'d say the latter is more likely.There is some direction to this, though, which is only made obvious if you\'ve watched some worse shows in this category. The pace is quite good and keeps giving you progression every episode on a sort of coherent path, and although the different sides\' actions were a little nonsensical as mentioned, I can only say I was entertained by the narrative for the most part. Aside from the fights and certainly before the final fights of the show that took a couple consecutive episodes, I had been kept relatively intrigued by the (shallow) plot and somewhat entertained by the more-than-occasional ecchi. I appreciate the fact that although the story is quite simple, it doesn\'t fall off as much as other shows as the season progresses. I feel that these 12 episodes were well-organised, so to speak.The vibe is good, probably mostly due to the characters being as spicy as they are, and the entertainment factor is there. So even with a story and characterization this shallow/cliche/unoriginal/simple I am tempted to give a sort of positive rating.

Interesting stuff as it does bring inspiration from High School DxD.Story: Good, you never know if Lars or Basara will reign supreme over the other throughout the series.

The reason I rated it so low is considering the other animes I've watched, it's not that this anime is absolutely garbage, it's just that when it's compared to other anime or even just other harem animes, it's subpar in storytelling and overall the weak characters don't help this show.Story(2/10) - Typical and generic harem plot.Art(5/10) - It really depends, the animation quality overall isn't bad, and of course animating...both ecchi scenes and action scenes will be incredibly hard for studios. Overall, I think it's executed pretty well, of course, I can be nitpicky if I want to, but generally, the animation is quite smooth, especially the animation in the opening.Sound(9/10) - Voice acting was on-par with most other harem shows, and for an ecchi show, this is way better than most of those out there. As for the music, I absolutely love Blade of Hope, the opening of this series. Thus I am giving this section a tremendously high score, I think for an ecchi harem anime this show fairs very well against its competitors.Character(2/10) - You got your cool guy with brown or black hair, and of course, you also have your cast of low self-esteem yet overpowered girls. In there, you have a hot-headed tsundere with big boobies that always gets fondled by the male MC, a blue-haired girl who is great at using katanas, because no action anime doesn't have your classic katana that in reality, not many samurais bring around everywhere due to its size and weight. Then of course you also have your white-haired lo--uh girl with incredibly short height. Thus, with the great harem of MC, he is unbeatable.Enjoyment(10/10) - Although it has an endless amount of issues, I can't stop but love this show for somewhat reason, there is just something about this show that is so bad that makes me want to watch this show.Overall(3/10) -It's safe to say if you don't enjoy harem or ecchi shows, you won't like this.

The two opposites that will always have that of problems...in the past, but with the power of camaraderie everything will be resolved.The lord / king / demon lord is a beautiful girl with big breasts with a shallow personality and who basically serves the hero, in this case a random adolescent who possibly enjoys incest, having his pleasure, with the justification of ""strengthening"" her for battles  .  Such battles again have more people to occupy space in the drawer of those who basara would like to make a pact to massage or lick a random part of the body.  It was even possible to laugh how easy that childhood friend of his left the revolt aside to start the duel.I got sick of the opening the first time and the closing is really cool in the last 3 seconds.  I think that in terms of art or sound, the environment is even more alive in the screams of pleasure of one of the women there.Ps: Please, do not call people ""your family"" and you have great ties, just because you like me saying ""yamete onii-chan"" in your strange training in the past, but with the power of camaraderie everything will be resolved.The lord / king / demon lord is a beautiful girl with big breasts with a shallow personality and who basically serves the hero, in this case a random adolescent who possibly enjoys incest, having his pleasure, with the justification of ""strengthening"" her for battles  .

And while even the anime makes High School DxD look like HeartCatch Pretty Cure in terms of raunchyness, the fact that Basara is related, in some way, to half of his harem makes it even more awkward.The biggest flaw with this series is that the characters are just so generic. Basara\'s basically your typical...light novel/harem/hentai protagonist, whose sole character motivation, it seems like, is to protect the girls. While Basara has more of a backbone than, say, Issei Hyodo, at least Issei was a much more interesting and unique character with cooler powers than ""magic sword"" and ""The excuse for the sheer amount of softcore porno scenes in this series.""The same can be said for most of the main cast. While Mio shares more than a passing resemblance to Rias Gremory, she\'s not nearly as likeable or interesting as her, being just a typical fiery tsundere who wears out her ""I\'ll kill you 100 times"" catchphrase faster than you can say it, and Yuki is your typical childhood friend character/Rei Ayanami clone who spends the entire series making Mio jealous. However, I actually really liked Maria a lot. Her trickster personality was actually quite endearing and Kira Buckland really nailed her performance as her.A couple of the side characters were actually some of the standouts in the series. The position of best girl easily goes to the school nurse Chisato, who strikes a nice balance between cool and flirty, not to mention catering to all the right fetishes, except for the one where she\'s, you guessed it, related to Basara. I also really liked Yahiro, who\'s a really good ""best friend character"" and has some really cool moments near the end of Season 1 and also has a great performance courtesy of Ray Chase.Overall, Testament of Sister New Devil is a really mixed bag of some decent ideas and a pretty solid fantasy action series, but its extremely generic overall, and it doesn\'t tickle that certain spot as much as its content wants you to. If you enjoy shows like High School DxD and Date A Live, you can get some enjoyment out of this series, but otherwise there are much better alternatives that do what it tries to do better. light novel/harem/hentai protagonist, whose sole character motivation, it seems like, is to protect the girls.

All girls in the show are likable in their own way; all of them have some flaws which makes them even feel a bit realistic.Story stops consistently developing further; mostly noticeable around episode 9/10, when the story is getting unnecessarily complicated (especially in second season).Villains are here...just for the sake of having villains. Fights with them are pretty boring and lengthy. The element of magic is fine and divided simply into two factions – heroes and demons.

Tsukumogami Kashimasu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36654/Tsukumogami_Kashimasu,"[""Tsukumogami Kashimasu is a slice of life set in 17th century Japan told in mystery format. At the heart of the story are Seiji - serving as Nick Carraway equivalent (see Great Gatsby), and the tsukumogami - everyday objects turned sentient. Each episode features a nuance on human relationships, while building towards the main mystery surrounding Seiji's sister's (Oko's) past. The tsukumogami themselves, though initially wary of humans from insecurities of a previous ownership, face the respective realities of their past, and slowly come to terms with their existence and role in the siblings' lending shop.While the mysteries themselves aren't something to write home...about, the underlying character development of the lending shop's clients between the start of each mystery and the end has a certain allure. That said, the character development of Seiji himself is lacking - though one may argue that's just the way he was written.I found the series overall a gentle and charming experience, each mystery had a meaningful (albeit sometimes obvious) plot twist, and the character relationships felt genuine. Solid 8.P.S. My bias is that I think Tsukumogami is deserving of a higher score than its current score of 6.61 at the time I penned this review. about, the underlying character development of the lending shop's clients between the start of each mystery and the end has a certain allure.

The story is kinda based in either a old year in japan or a place in japan where it looks old. Its all about a store that lends these so called Tsukumogami to solve mysteries.

The characters are all different and give life into the story.Love how the story flows, from 1st episode with the 1st customer that we see, till the last, and it all came back to their main story...or past history, the incense burner,Suou.

Toriko 3D: Kaimaku Gourmet Adventure!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10074/Toriko_3D__Kaimaku_Gourmet_Adventure,"['So takes place before Toriko ever meets Komatsu but after this he does. Overall good movie with nice epic fighting. The boy running crying just reminded me of Komatsu running and crying and yelling for Toriko. ', 'This is the 1st Toriko movie serving as a prequel to the anime series. For a debut film its pretty as it holds some differences from the tone found in the anime.The story starts off with a boy named Peck searching for Toriko to request his aid to stop a beast from attacking his village. Toriko eventually caves in to help the village & along the way battles an Elephant Bear.These ongoing shonen films tend to be about battle & nothing other than marketing for a new audience to be persuaded to watch the anime series. Honestly, it\'s an okay debut but the problem...is that only Toriko is featured with no mention of the other Heavenly King. While the Toriko movie does follow a standard formula it does have its own charm to it.There\'s just something about the character designs having this more intimidating look that gives this different tone than the anime. For example, Toriko constantly has this grin displaying his fangs giving this more tough & masculine design while in the anime his smiles tend to look more friendly. It\'s a subtle change but manages to maintain its presence in the whole film. To further elaborate on this slight change in tone, the few beasts featured in this movie seemed a bit more gritty with having their fangs fully exposed. Toriko as a character also comes off a bit more as a lone hunter where he initially was reluctant to help Peck\'s village & seems to be slightly hotblooded due to this facial expression. Not a big change in character but comes off as very appealing.In short the film doesn\'t show any blood or very violent content, however the mood found in this movie seems ""kid friendly"" but not to the point where it feels watered down to a lower age group. It\'s difficult to explain, but there is something about this Toriko movie that feels closer to the tone expressed in the manga. The only negative aspects is Toriko is followed by the boy Peck which helps express Toriko\'s character, but I\'ve always wondered how a movie would be if Toriko was completely solo on an adventure; will he be more stoic or aggressive?Toriko 3D Gourmet Adventure is 40 minutes in length with the credits featuring new animation of the regal mammoth arc. Within those few clips, it seemed that it was being closer to the manga due to mimicking certain panels. Also the characters featured in credits seemed to have a more intimidating look much like the subtle Toriko design featured in this movie. The music for the film are tracks from the Toriko anime OST & from the first Tina CD. It\'s an alright movie for anyone, but to those who really like Toriko can appreciate this film for what it is. is that only Toriko is featured with no mention of the other Heavenly King.

UFO Princess Valkyrie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1127/UFO_Princess_Valkyrie,"[""This story has a pretty cliche' storyline. Guy meets girl, then other girls suddenly appear in droves. Seen it before, right? Well UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie has a few twists that set it apart form other romantic comedies. First, because the main female protagonist has shared her soul with the male lead, she has regressed mentally and physically to the level of a six year old, which presents a whole new challange when it comes to romance. Secondly, the story is dramatic and serious when it needs to be, so  the series has just enough drama in it to make it believeable.The artwork is very...clean and bright, which compliments the atmosphere nicely. And be careful all you delicate types out there; all but three or four episodes in the entire franchise (around fifty episodes) shows certain female body parts, so be warned. clean and bright, which compliments the atmosphere nicely. And be careful all you delicate types out there; all but three or four episodes in the entire franchise (around fifty episodes) shows certain female body parts, so be warned."", '""To the bath house and beyond"" or maybe that\'s what they should have called this psycho circus called Ufo Ultramaiden Valkyrie..And if you\'re not impressed by the title alone let me give you some more useful details that will arouse your...Mind.What? Did you think i was gonna say your pants? What anime do you think this is anyway? This is a serious love story about a little 8 yr old girl and a child molester, who found one another under the worst circumstances possible.You see our little Valkyrie crashed her spaceship right on Kazuto\'s(the child molester)bath house, killing him in the process. And if this...was one of those ridiculous ecchi anime Kazuto would somehow be brought back to life and that\'s fucking exactly what happens when-the adult then-Valkyrie decided to give him half her soul to revive him. Of course giving half your soul-as we all know-makes you revert back to your 8 yr old self, so she got stuck on earth not only as a child but as a prisoner of Kazuto\'s as well.So, if one wondered what the moral of this story is then it would probably be ""if you are a bad driver and you kill a pervert let it be, don\'t whatever you do stop cause the guilt will take over and you\'ll end up as a sex slave"", or something like that. That\'s a life lesson you won\'t get in the school books so be grateful this anime exists.At this point you might think that this sounds ok-ish, sure there\'s a child molester but the 8 yr old should be at least a bit cute, right? Right?................WRONG WRONG AND WRONG. Valkyrie as an 8 yr old is the most annoying character i\'ve seen to date and not only that she takes incredible pleasure in animal torture as she\'s seen in many occassions riding a poor little alien dog and stretching his ears to the other end of the galaxy. BUT here\'s the catch..Valkyrie can go back to being an adult once she kisses Kazuto..Yeah...As if this wasn\'t braincell killing enough they thought it would be a nice touch to have an 8 yr old kissing a 17 yr old. And there\'s a nicer tough to this whole bang and blow bussiness which is the transforming-almost Sailor Moon-esque-scene where we get to witness Valkyrie in all her godly goodness, boingy breasts and an ass so beautiful it can kill you..But don\'t worry there are plenty of them babes in Valhalla.So we have covered pedo\'s and nudity..What else is there? Well, to add some madness to the mix we also have a catgirl. Yup your brain isn\'t sending you wrong signals there\'s a catgirl straight outta Valhalla...And that isn\'t the end of her story as we are shown in her own episode that she is in possession of a ray gun that turns humans into slave cat girls that answer to her and her only..How bloody brilliant is that? And why science hasn\'t produced this marvelous weapon of mass erection?From there the 3 of them along with Kazuto\'s sister, run the bath house which is the new spot for all the weird looking aliens to gather and have a nice bath which in turn means that the average otaku has one more reason to watch this show..Nude aliens of all sizes and shapes. For god\'s sake there\'s a banana alien with legs..But all was in vain cause everything is ruined by the 8 yr old Valkyrie raiding the place and being absolutely annoying to the point of destruction..And she...She won\'t shut up cause she\'s the main focus of this show..Well along with stark naked aliens and all..This show then, is all about fanservice, catgirls, nude magical girl transformations, opening and closing songs from a kids party from hell, an annoying main female character, a generic and bland as fuck male main and generic as fuck rest of the cast..And almost non existent humour.. Animation was good if by any chance you didn\'t close your eyes and ears everytime Valkyrie was ready to open he damn mouth..The show sure picks up some speed towards the last eps but it\'s not enough and the end of the series left me with a gaping wound in my left hand, a result of me stabbing my self with a fork.All in all i think you should avoid this one like you would avoid leprosy. was one of those ridiculous ecchi anime Kazuto would somehow be brought back to life and that\'s fucking exactly what happens when-the adult then-Valkyrie decided to give him half her soul to revive him.

Hell, you know it’s been a long time when aliens have even become commonplace in a racially exclusive country like Japan...  And they’ve become such a normal part of our everyday lives that nobody questions the slug monster sitting in the seat  in the back by the window, just waiting to star in his own anime.  But this story isn’t about that slug, it’s about the far more human looking aliens from the planet Valhalla.  There...are eight princesses on Valhalla, each more beautiful than the last...  But none of them are more fair, or more elegant, than the blonde bombshell Valkyrie.  And thus, none of them are more suitable for political marriage.With her long, loving link to one loser of a lothario looming in the immediate future, Valkyrie jumps ship, and then crashes that ship into the planet of Earth...  Whereupon her reckless flying has cost the life of one Japanese youth with a bathhouse to run and what should have been a long, happy life to run it.  Feeling guilty for her actions, Valkyrie gives the young man half of her soul, resurrecting him as good as new...  although, due to her own sacrifice, she’s reverted back to a loud-mouthed brat of a toddler!  With the two of them now bound together by a promise much stronger than the red thread of fate, will their newfound romance survive in the face of...  Wait, romance?  How the hell did they get a romance out of that?  Screw this, plot summary over.UFO Ultramaiden Valkyire was produced by Media Factory Inc. from 2002 to 2004, around the same time that they did such great looking gems as Ikki Tousen and Green Green.  Yes, this was indeed a dark time for them.  This company HAS produced some great looking shows in both it’s earlier and later years, but the early 2000’s saw Media Factory release some of the cheapest, ugliest looking anime I’ve ever seen, and while Valkyrie’s not even the worst one, it was produced by a company that, at the time, was pumping out consistent crap, a load from which it was no exception.To be fair, there are a few impressive looking scenes in this show.  There’s an early scene that features Valkyrie in both child and adult forms dancing in the rain that’s actually kind of beautiful in it’s simplicity.  The transformation scenes, while kind of creepy, are also well done.  But shots like these are few and far between, as the rest of the show just looks awful.  I’ve complained about characters being frozen in the background before, but most shows have the brains to put those frozen characters in positions where they’re standing still looking at either each other or the main characters.  In Valkyrie, extras are frozen all over the place, sometimes in situations where it would be physically impossible to stand perfectly still, like in the pool.Action on screen in minimal, and what action we do get is often repeated shot for shot as recycled stock footage, and I’m not just talking about the transformations.  For the most part, the art is just as bad, with characters constantly off-model, moving in unnatural ways through even less natural spurts of activity.  Their designs are generic and bland looking, at least in terms of the human characters.  The aliens actually do look quite inspired and creative, especially with the awesome designs of the princesses of Valhalla, despite obvious resemblances to Ah My Goddess.  Yes, I noticed.. There is some creativity here, though...  This is a world where giant bananas walk around with legs, and quite frankly, Space Dandy would have a field day here.The music, on the other hand, is fine.  It’s not great, but it’s also makes for a pretty pleasant listen out of context.  The variety of beautiful harp and rock-orchestral background tracks work really well with what little material the show gave them, and it was even pretty damn clever how many different versions of the tune Ride of the Valkyries you can spot.  The one they used as the theme for Child Valkyrie is, on it’s own, a lot funnier than the character it was assigned to.  The opening and closing, unfortunately, are nowhere near as impressive.  I don’t hate either of them, there’s really nothing substantial about them to justify more than a couple of watches before just skipping them outright.  I think the biggest problem either one has, despite the catchiness of Itoshi Kakera and the decent groove of Save, is the metallic sound quality applied to both vocalists, which just gave me headaches every time I listened to them.The English dub was a decent enough effort by ADV Films, and god bless these actors, they were really trying to make their characters work.  well, most of them were...  I have no idea what Cynthia Martinez was doing, other than overacting and trying to project as much emotion as she possibly could.  Greg Ayres was surprisingly boring in the lead male role of Kazuto, especially considering what he’s been proven to be capable of in other shows.  I honestly blame bad direction for that one.  Monica rial varies up her delivery a little bit, but it’s still a cookie-cutter performance from her.I used to be a huge fan of Kira Vincent Davis back in the early 2000’s, back when she was still active and did more roles than just Strike Witches reprisals.  She plays dual roles in this show, both the adult and...  Ahem, child form of her title character, but her performance falls far short of what she was able to pull off in Elfen Lied.  She plays the roles as they’re written...  Boring in her adult form, and nightmarishly obnoxious in child form, which is pretty much on par with the standard the legendary Megumi Ogata set in the Japanese track.  I can SAY that a better actor could have made the character in both forms sound more interesting, but if somebody like Ogata couldn’t do it, then I guess Davis did a serviceable enough job.On the other hand, there were a few performances I genuinely did enjoy.  I’ve made fun of Nancy Novotny in the past...  And after Elfen Lied, she deserves it in endless portions...  But she is awesome in the role of the cantankerous Princess Hydra, and the best part is that she even manages to make her character’s child form sound a lot more tolerable than Valkyrie’s.  Some of the only laughs I got from this series were from Christine Auten’s over-the-top turn as Miss Sanada, an obsessive, single-minded maid who has devoted her entire life to serving Valkyrie, especially now that she finds her highness’s child form so damn cute.  I’m honestly not sure how I feel about that, since she’s kind of a terrible character, but we’ll get to that later.  Chris Patton is also on point and very funny as Valkyrie’s louse of a fiance, Prince Triam.I’d say what’s most impressive about this dub are the in-universe songs, all of which were translated into English.  It’s no Beck, by any means, but whoever was in charge of writing these deserves to be commended for their effort.  The director involved also did a great job on these, as they got one hell of an awesomely bad recording of Cynthia Martinez rocking out like there was nobody in the room but her bathroom mirror, which...  Believe it or not...  Was the original intention.  The catgirl songs led by Miss Sanada were also really funny, despite the troubling implications behind them.  There weren’t a lot of huge changes to the script...  The company was still a few years off from Ghost Stories starting that unfortunate trend...  But it’s still pretty impressive.  I would personally recommend the Japanese, but if you’re a fervent dub fan, this one is pretty good.Now, having read my thoughts on the English dub, you may have come to the conclusion that I don’t like the two main characters of this series very much.  well, you wouldn’t be wrong.  There are just over a dozen regular or prominent characters in this particular season, and I like a grand total of four of them...  One of which, surprise surprise, is actually in the main cast.  But getting back to Kazuto and Valkyrie, well, they don’t have a single interesting quality between them.  Adult Valkyrie does get some explanation of her personality, insofar as the fact that she bottles up her emotions and pretends to be strong, but that really only comes through in the first episode.  We barely get to see her as an adult, and as a child, she’s just an insufferable whiny little brat who abuses her alien dog, throws tantrums, breaks things, and says creepy things about her relationship with Kazuto that seem specifically designed to be taken the wrong way.And as for her knight in yawning armor, Kazuto falls into a very special category for me.  A seriouis pet peeve of mine is when the main character of a story has only one goal:  to preserve the status quo.  I want my protagonists to want something, whether it be love, status, or something they don’t yet realize they don’t need.  Kazuto owns his bath house, and he wants to serve his community with it, and...  Nothing.  The only conflict he ever faces is the possibility of change, which, thanks to constant coincidences, never truly occurs in ways he can’t handle.  New characters appear, shit gets wrecked, and weird things happen to his friends, but as long as his own personal routine isn’t changed, he’s a fairly inactive character.Their relationship, too, is extremely troubling in the message that I sincerely hope I’m misreading...  Kazuto and Valkyrie are in love, despite having nothing in common, no chemistry and him showing no affection whatsoever towards her, and in order to turn her into a much more mature and voluptuous adult, all they have to do is share a magical kiss.  So, if I’m reading between the lines properly, This series is trying to tell us that all it takes to turn a little girl into an adult woman is some intimate contact.  sounds kind of pedophilic to me.  All things considered, I should be rooting for the underdog, Kazuto’s childhood friend Akina...  Because let’s just be honest, the childhood friend is always the underdog in these shows...  But Akina’s only personality trait IS her unrequited love for Kazuto.As much as I loved Christine Auten’s acting, and as funny as Miss Sanada’s obsession over Valkyrie’s well-being may be, I just can’t over the fact that she is a literal slave driver.  The first thing she does after landing on Earth is take out a transform an entire legion of unassuming teenage girls into cat girl, complete with ears, a tail, and a complete brainwash to go with them.  She turns them into slaves whose only purpose in life is to serve their extraterrestrial leader without question and likely without payment.  I can’t laugh at this without wondering how their families are being affected by it.  Also, I like the fact that Kazuto’s sister is an over-achiever who tries to manage money to make up for her brother’s sinking of their finances into the bathhouse, and there was some potential for depth with her attempt at having a modicum of a social life, but the series did absolutely nothing with it!So who were the four characters I liked?  Well, the most important one was Princess Hydra, the blue-haired fireball who came after Valkyrie when the marriage duty was shifted onto her shoulders instead.  She was turned into a child herself, and from there, she became one of the only characters in the show who had the audacity to call little Valkyrie on her behavior...  And since she’s the only one who’s not in love with Kazuto, she’s the only one who’s able to antagonize her without an ulterior motive.  She’s a lot more entertaining than Valkyrie, in the same way that Donald Duck is more entertaining than Mickey Mouse...  Yes, the latter may be the star and icon of the series, but the former actually faces consequences and does amusing things.Even on a less comedic note, while Valkyrie may say that she was tired of facing the stress and expectations of royal life, it’s a lot more subtle in Hydra’s case, as soon after being turned into a kid, she calms down and accepts it, developing a love-hate sort of sisterly relationship with Akina.  As for the other three?  I’m talking about Marduke, Spottenheim, and Mur, the three little white aliens that I’ve taken to calling The Three Marshkateers.  As soon as I heard that they had a backstory that extended back to some intergalactic war that the three of them were notoriously a part of, I instantly wished I could have seen a spin-off OVA series about them, instead of the piece of shit they were introduced in.In any case, let’s get back to my problems with Kazuto and Valkyrie.  Because really, the setting and concept aren’t horrible...  The characters really do comprise at least 80 percent of my beef with this show.  If the pedophilic relationship between them and Kazuto’s refusal to accept change weren’t bad enough, both of these elements are cranked up to the extreme as this season builds up to it’s climax.  I don’t want to spoil the ending for you, but...  No, you know what?  I don’t care if I spoil it.  I’ll spoil, at least, the penultimate episode.   Not how it ends, but how that ending is set up.  If that’s still too much for you, skip the next paragraph.While Miss Sanada is making some purchases online, Valkyrie screws around with her laptop and accidentally orders an asteroid.  In their attempts to return it, they find out that there’s a hot spring inside, so they open a hot spring on the asteroid, drumming up brand new business!  But here’s the problem...  The bath water has unexpected healing properties that are giving her her soul back!  And while the rest of the cast struggle to accept this as the good thing that it is, they can’t lie to themselves.  If Valkyrie turns back into an adult permanently, their relationship will stop being a pedophilic, passionless, chemistry-free romance based entirely on guilt over a manslaughter, and they'll have to carry on as actual adults without supernatural obligations to each other.  This is about the part when my bemusement at how stupid the series was turned into raw anger.  Yes, I know harem shows like to be as chaste and asexual as possible while shoving fanservice in our faces, but this is a depth I wasn’t expecting them to stoop to.  I won’t tell you how this conflict is resolved, but it does in fact involve random convenient coincidences.  Because of course it does.Now, hopefully, I’ve already turned a good amount of you off from ever watching this show, but there’s still one group that I know I haven’t reached yet...  The booby hunters.  Yes, fanservice is abound in the anime medium, but explicit fanservice...  AKA, nudity with actual female nipples...  Isn’t that easy to find outside of hentai.  Well, anybody who came into this show through ADV’s advertisements know they were promised lots of naked girls, and if that’s really enough to make a series worthwhile to you, then yes, you’ll find that here.  You can find it in bucket loads...  Provided that you don’t mind naked little kids, badly drawn characters, and constantly recycled animation of random bathing girls with horns on their heads.  Oh, also?  I know the nipples are going to be a big draw for this group of viewers, so let me clarify something else...  There is never any variation in skin tone between areola and breast, making the actual detail you were looking for extremely hard to make out in several scenes.In the time that I’ve been reviewing anime, I’ve often heard people telling me that I’m too hard on the medium, and that I take it too seriously.  When I bring up problems, I’m told that i’m nitpicking, and that of course I won’t enjoy a show while I’m taking a negative attitude into it.  When I watch a harem show like this, or Haganai, or Girls Bravo, I’m not supposed to focus on the fact that a creepy woman is filming kids in the changing room, or that she’s basically producing child porn, or that the manager readily accepts her offering of a bribe.  I’m supposed to laugh at how silly the situation is.  In regards to Kazuto and Valkyrie’s relationship, I’m not supposed to pay any attention to the fact that she fled one forced marriage just to fall head over heels for her own reckless driving victim, or that she’s traded one forced loveless romance for another, or that anybody she landed on could have reasonably taken the brunt of her affections...  I’m just supposed to root for them because they’re the main couple.Well, I’m sorry it looks like I take my anime seriously...  But I do.  I have standards, and even if you don’t agree with them, I enjoy picking apart a show and experiencing it on a deeper level than most will be willing to reach for.  I like writing down my thoughts, and if I’m proud of how they turn out, I like to post them online for people to possibly read.  That’s why I stick to my guns through a show no matter how much I might hate it.  To be fair, if I’m enjoying a show enough, I may overlook or even forgive it’s flaws.  I saw Yuki Yuna is a Hero a few weeks ago, and I liked the characters, animation and tone so much that I was ultimately able to forgive it for being dumber than a box of hammers and a complete rip-off of a superior series.  I like to pick apart a series without being disgusted by what I find, and i’m sorry, but this series just makes me sick.  Maybe if Kazuto had started the series resenting Valkyrie for barging into his life and forcing the burden of her soul and child self on her, but then learned to love her over time...  well, it would still be creepy, but at least it wouldn’t feel so forced!UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie is available stateside in way too many formats.  It was originally released in individual four episode sets, each of which ran for about thirty bucks apiece,.  The series was rescued by Funimation for some ungodly reason...  They probably knew that they could make a mint off of the booby hunters in their audience...  And can be found in thinpack sets, as well as two SAVE sets that cover it’s third and fourth seasons, as well as it’s one terrible OVA episode.  The manga is not available stateside.  I haven’t seen the third or fourth seasons, but I have seen the second, and from what I remember, it was a slight improvement over the first.  I might review it at some point...  Hell, I should, since I bought both seasons.In truth, I saw this series ten years ago, at which point I considered it the worst anime I’d ever seen.  It no longer holds that title a decade later, but it’s remained very faithfully in the bottom ten ever since.  In the years since I saw it, I’ve been happy to see it lost in eternal obscurity, and hell, one of the few people I’ve spoken to who’ve seen it was even aware enough of it’s flaws to call it The Pedophile anime.  Others have defended it, calling it funny, which I don’t get.  Maybe these jokes are new to you if you’ve never seen them before, but I have, and they all fell flat for me.  It’s a dreary, uncomfortable series that I knew I’d eventually have to revisit, and yet I still can’t call it completely awful, as it does have a pretty good soundtrack, some much appreciated creativity, and if I’m being completely honest, good pacing too.  But those few good points just don’t save it.  I give UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie a 2/10. are eight princesses on Valhalla, each more beautiful than the last...  But none of them are more fair, or more elegant, than the blonde bombshell Valkyrie.  And thus, none of them are more suitable for political marriage.With her long, loving link to one loser of a lothario looming in the immediate future, Valkyrie jumps ship, and then crashes that ship into the planet of Earth...  Whereupon her reckless flying has cost the life of one Japanese youth with a bathhouse to run and what should have been a long, happy life to run it.  Feeling guilty for her actions, Valkyrie gives the young man half of her soul, resurrecting him as good as new...  although, due to her own sacrifice, she’s reverted back to a loud-mouthed brat of a toddler!  With the two of them now bound together by a promise much stronger than the red thread of fate, will their newfound romance survive in the face of...  Wait, romance?  How the hell did they get a romance out of that?  Screw this, plot summary over.UFO Ultramaiden Valkyire was produced by Media Factory Inc. from 2002 to 2004, around the same time that they did such great looking gems as Ikki Tousen and Green Green.  Yes, this was indeed a dark time for them.  This company HAS produced some great looking shows in both it’s earlier and later years, but the early 2000’s saw Media Factory release some of the cheapest, ugliest looking anime I’ve ever seen, and while Valkyrie’s not even the worst one, it was produced by a company that, at the time, was pumping out consistent crap, a load from which it was no exception.To be fair, there are a few impressive looking scenes in this show.  There’s an early scene that features Valkyrie in both child and adult forms dancing in the rain that’s actually kind of beautiful in it’s simplicity.  The transformation scenes, while kind of creepy, are also well done.  But shots like these are few and far between, as the rest of the show just looks awful.  I’ve complained about characters being frozen in the background before, but most shows have the brains to put those frozen characters in positions where they’re standing still looking at either each other or the main characters.  In Valkyrie, extras are frozen all over the place, sometimes in situations where it would be physically impossible to stand perfectly still, like in the pool.Action on screen in minimal, and what action we do get is often repeated shot for shot as recycled stock footage, and I’m not just talking about the transformations.  For the most part, the art is just as bad, with characters constantly off-model, moving in unnatural ways through even less natural spurts of activity.  Their designs are generic and bland looking, at least in terms of the human characters.  The aliens actually do look quite inspired and creative, especially with the awesome designs of the princesses of Valhalla, despite obvious resemblances to Ah My Goddess.  Yes, I noticed.. There is some creativity here, though...  This is a world where giant bananas walk around with legs, and quite frankly, Space Dandy would have a field day here.The music, on the other hand, is fine.  It’s not great, but it’s also makes for a pretty pleasant listen out of context.  The variety of beautiful harp and rock-orchestral background tracks work really well with what little material the show gave them, and it was even pretty damn clever how many different versions of the tune Ride of the Valkyries you can spot.  The one they used as the theme for Child Valkyrie is, on it’s own, a lot funnier than the character it was assigned to.  The opening and closing, unfortunately, are nowhere near as impressive.  I don’t hate either of them, there’s really nothing substantial about them to justify more than a couple of watches before just skipping them outright.  I think the biggest problem either one has, despite the catchiness of Itoshi Kakera and the decent groove of Save, is the metallic sound quality applied to both vocalists, which just gave me headaches every time I listened to them.The English dub was a decent enough effort by ADV Films, and god bless these actors, they were really trying to make their characters work.  well, most of them were...  I have no idea what Cynthia Martinez was doing, other than overacting and trying to project as much emotion as she possibly could.  Greg Ayres was surprisingly boring in the lead male role of Kazuto, especially considering what he’s been proven to be capable of in other shows.  I honestly blame bad direction for that one.  Monica rial varies up her delivery a little bit, but it’s still a cookie-cutter performance from her.I used to be a huge fan of Kira Vincent Davis back in the early 2000’s, back when she was still active and did more roles than just Strike Witches reprisals.  She plays dual roles in this show, both the adult and...  Ahem, child form of her title character, but her performance falls far short of what she was able to pull off in Elfen Lied.

I haven’t seen the third or fourth seasons, but I have seen the second, and from what I remember, it was a slight improvement over the first.  I might review it at some point...  Hell, I should, since I bought both seasons.In truth, I saw this series ten years ago, at which point I considered it the worst anime I’d ever seen.  It no longer holds that title a decade later, but it’s remained very faithfully in the bottom ten ever since.  In the years since I saw it, I’ve been happy to see it lost in eternal obscurity, and hell, one of the few people I’ve spoken to who’ve seen it was even aware enough of it’s flaws to call it The Pedophile anime.  Others have defended it, calling it funny, which I don’t get.  Maybe these jokes are new to you if you’ve never seen them before, but I have, and they all fell flat for me.  It’s a dreary, uncomfortable series that I knew I’d eventually have to revisit, and yet I still can’t call it completely awful, as it does have a pretty good soundtrack, some much appreciated creativity, and if I’m being completely honest, good pacing too.  But those few good points just don’t save it.  I give UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie a 2/10."", 'Oh god, this show is for real, isn’t it? Welp, this is going to be an interesting review. It’s about an alien girl that crashed into a house, almost killed the person, then gave the person half their soul to save him. She also crashed right in the middle of the bathhouse, separating the men’s and the women’s side. You would think that with that much accuracy, she could of landed fine instead of crashing.What is with aliens not knowing how to land and crashing into buildings? Seriously, does no one know how to land a spaceship? It happens almost all the time during the...show which makes me wonder if any alien should really be flying at all. If the real world was like this one, then I am scared when we actually end up meeting beings from other worlds.Can someone explain to me if this is a dating sim, because it really did feel like it. All the characters that showed up were pretty much stereotypes of characters I have seen in other shows, just not all in the same show. We have the catgirl, the princess who has dedicated herself to our main character, the rival character, the childhood friend, the little sister, and so on. They may not all be fighting for Kazuto’s love but they sure do act like they do sometimes. Actually, sometimes I wonder if Sanada wants to romance Val herself half the time with how upsessed she is with her.So the main thing they keep on saying over and over and over again is that ‘Valkyrie gave Kazuto the most precious thing that a girl could give someone…’ AND IT ISN’T THAT PERVERTS! The most precious thing is half of her soul actually but every time they say that line, it just makes me want to face palm. And most of the time they wonder why people get the wrong idea when they say it too. It makes it sound as though they had sex.There is one character that I never really understood. It’s that of Kazuto’s… sister… friend… other relative…? They say younger sister on the wiki but they never really explain this well in the show until episode 5. She barely gets any screen time and when she is on screen, it’s just to talk about money until then and we get more of a slice of life story that episode. She is a very average character that really doesn’t stand out at all. Average nerdy girl looks, average nerdy girl problems, and average nerdy girl personality. Example, gets asked by the cutest boy in school (That they say anyway… he looks average to me) but says no because she has to study for entrance exams.The artwork is… well it doesn’t look like something that came out in the 2000s. I see it more on par with Ranma or Oh My Goddess more in art style; it’s very typical of that time period. The opening slates seem to be more like Oh My Goddess and I do find some things very similar to that art style but then we get the bubbliest looking scenes that just felt strange. I think this was done with cel drawings because there are many little mistakes I see at times that I think the only way they would have that problem is with cel art. Things like little areas not being colored in right or images that seem to end up looping more then normal. There is also the fact that the foreground is more distinct then the background. When the magical girl thing happens during the transformation from kid Val to Adult Val, we get a little to much detail to her naked body. And this happens at least once an episode it seems weather it is Val or one of her kind. I understand it being a bathhouse, but even outside the bathhouse it seems we are not protected from that. Actually, come to think of it, none of the girls must wear bras as you can see their nipples through their outfits. This is very distracting as they would make me get distracted and not in a good way. Also not really sure about the design of Spottenheim (Shirokenhaimu). Just what the hell is he? Dog/bunny hybrid or something?The music is actually really good. I’m surprised that it’s that good compared to the other things in this show. It has the right music to make the scene feel just right. The bad thing about that is that they are unmemorable. I wouldn’t be able to pick them out from any other shows. The opening and ending songs aren’t that bad but they are not memorable either. The only thing that through me off was that in the ending, they had some rather classical music playing over some intense scenes which I’m not sure why. The voices are… interesting. None of them really stood out except for one of the surprisingly deep voice of Shirokenhaimu. There are a couple well known voices in this show like Monica Rial and Luci Christian but they kind of don’t stand out at all. Most of the characters have this rather high pitched voice so I just cringe on every one of them. Greg Ayres actually does a decent job with Kazuto Tokino’s voice as he wasn’t all that bad, just bland. His voice like his personality and his looks do not stand out which seems to be a thing when it comes to harems.Now, there are 4 more seasons to this show, and I’m not sure if it was really even needed. The ending of this first season had an ending that could have been perfect to finish it off.

I have bought every album I could find. I would have bought this anime purely to enjoy the flow of the musical track. The music is not only great by itself, but it is utilized to full effect, imparting whichever atmosphere is called for. Though the story does falter from time to time, the music is solid throughout the show. I truly feel this is a pretty good anime, but without the quality of its music, it would not be worth watching. For instance as princess Valkyrie decides to fly off into space in her UFO the music cut...in is moving. Of coarse some of the battle scenes make use of ""The Flight of the Valkyries"", and other variations on that music by Wagner. I highly recommend this anime, and I recommend the soundtrack even more highly. in is moving. Of coarse some of the battle scenes make use of ""The Flight of the Valkyries"", and other variations on that music by Wagner. I highly recommend this anime, and I recommend the soundtrack even more highly.', 'UFO Princess Valkyrie is an anime that exists. Unsurprisingly, it\'s an adaption of a manga (never heard that one before...). It feels weird saying this ""means something to me"" since I heavily dislike this show. I would only say that because this (and its sequels) was the first anime I ever watched, beyond random episodes of DBZ, Naruto, and so on that were on Toonami and similar. I got a friend to watch it with me earlier this year, and he wanted to quit almost at the end. I don\'t blame him. This show is awkward. That, which for me was a rewatch, was interesting...because I realize how little I actually remembered of this show, and how much I probably blocked out of memory. Let\'s start with the positives.The music isn\'t too bad. The opening is fine, though not a favorite. The ending is fine too, but I almost always skipped it and the opening, as I usually do, so that\'s not really saying too much of its quality. The music that plays during the episode is fine too, though I never really felt it was super good. So, I guess to sum it up, it\'s average. Not bad, but not great.The dub is fine. The actors try with the strange script and cardboard cutout characters, but their performances sometimes fall flat. My big annoyance with the dub is that things written in Japanese aren\'t subtitled in any way, so when the camera lingers on a note, or heck, even the title of the dang show, if you can\'t read Japanese, then you have no way of knowing what it says. It\'s not the worst thing ever, since papers affixed to doors can usually be figured out what they say based on what happens immediately before or after the note is shown, and if you don\'t know what show you\'re watching... one might be in for a big... ""surprise.""The art is passable. I didn\'t think it was all that bad, but some of the character designs are questionable. At least, I don\'t find unrealistically skin-tight fabric on the boob area terribly appealing. Not to mention, bras don\'t seem to exist in Valhalla so (adult) Valkyrie and Hydra have their nipples poking through their clothes as well. Because of course. Anyway... the environment art was good and the character animation itself wasn\'t all that bad. There are a few standout scenes here and there, but it\'s sandwiched between several episodes worth of blegh. And that brings me to the story and characters.Let\'s start with the story. As is common with other anime, there\'s an alien that crash lands and kills our unwitting protagonist. He gets revived through alien magic, this time around, it\'s half a soul. As everyone knows, when you give half of your soul to someone else, that ages you down into an 8-year-old nuisance. Our protagonist, whose name is Kazuto, is then forced into a marriage with her by our alien (name\'s Valkyrie by the way) and her psychotic catgirl maid Ms. Sanada. Despite how often it\'s talked about, this marriage never actually happens, and Kazuto seems to actually fall in love with the child Valkyrie. By the way, to transform Valkyrie into an adult, she and Kazuto have to kiss. What follows is a very creepy transformation sequence of naked child Valkyrie changing into her adult self, complete with zooming in on her breasts and butt as they grow. Yikes. Hydra gets a similar transformation sequence (oh yeah, she crash lands too, but into the shrine of the childhood friend Akina) and it\'s no less creepy.So after all that setup, what happens? Nothing. What happens is a boring slice of life that likes to forget all this set up even happened in the first place. There\'s a whole episode dedicated to Rika\'s school life which also serves as a completely pointless recap episode since it\'s like the fifth episode. Then later on, there\'s a beach episode. It wouldn\'t be an anime without a stupid, meaningless, completely filler beach episode. Even if this is in the manga, it\'s still stupid. Why are beach episodes such a common trope... Now let\'s talk about the characters.Kazuto, the protagonist, is very bland and boring. He has a massive fixation on his grandfather\'s bathhouse, which is understandable for things that mean a lot to people. But when most of the things he says is related to the bathhouse or Valkyrie, it gets boring. Rika is his sister, but she\'s even more forgettable. All she ever talks about is money, money, money. And studying. That\'s it. Ms. Sanada is completely insane. The very first thing that she does in this show is (really, it\'s that she shows how worthless the space airport security is) brainwash an entire legion of completely innocent, teenage girls  into actual catgirls that are her slaves. All because Kazuto had the most meaningless of interactions with them. Child Valkyrie is very annoying and abusive of her... pet dog? I\'m not really sure what he is, because it\'s never really talked about. She rides him and constantly pulls his ears and throws him. Adult Valkyrie is ""cool"" but still eh. Hydra and Akina are there too, and Hydra is constantly trying to prank or do mean things to Valkyrie. Akina goes along with it for no reason.I actually liked this when I first watched it. I\'m not really sure how, but I guess this is just a shining example of how people\'s tastes change. I might rewatch the later seasons and review those too, but that means sitting through more of this crap. Stay away from this garbage, unless you like this sort of stuff.

None too positive ones at that.', 'Recommendation: Inconsistent romantic comedy that is at its weakest when dealing with the romance elements, but can be quite funny when it\'s going pure comedy. Not terrible, but skippable. Review covers all 3 seasons plus OVAs.Positives:+ Full of the kind of insanity that you can only get from anime. Where else can you see a tank armed with a laser that turns things into catgirls? Or a magical bath that turns adult women into lolis? The series is full of the most ridiculous things you can imagine and a lot of the comedy is built around this unrestrained wackiness.+ Most of the characters are fun....Laine was my personal favorite, but most get their time to shine at one point or another.  I was also fond of the trio of little mascot characters (Shirou, Marduke and I forget the other one\'s name) and their side adventures as hard-boiled war veterans.+ Makes the most of its ecchi tag.  There are so many uncensored tiddies in this show that you stop even noticing that characters are topless at points.  If you\'re in it for the cute alien girls, you won\'t be disappointed.Negatives:- Main romance is poorly developed and can feel uncomfortable. Valkyrie is not just physically transformed into a little girl, but has regressed in mental age as well.  She can become adult Valkyrie, but only by kissing Kazuto, which leads to the very offputting sight of a 5 year old girl, in both body and mind, kissing an adult man on the lips. Leaving aside the pedophile vibes, Valkyrie just spends so much time as a child, and with Kazuto treating her more like a daughter than a girlfriend, that there is no romantic spark or chemistry between them even when she\'s an adult. You never really get a good sense of why they love each other.- The main couple is just generally boring and lacking in personality.  It\'s hard to root for such bland characters to get together.  Kazuto is a generic nice guy, and Valkyrie has no personality beyond ""likes Kazuto"".  She\'s often described in dialogue as cool and fiercely independent, but you never really get a sense of any of that from the show itself.- Stumbles badly whenever it tries to get serious or tragic. Season 2 in particular is marred by this with the December Nocturne arc, which is so tonally imbalanced that it\'s hard to take any of it seriously.- The art has not aged very well and it extensively re-uses previously animated scenes to cut corners. This is especially noticeable with the magical girl transformations, which are often repeated in full multiple times per episode.- Too much stalling with the romance. It has a sitcom-like tendency to always reset to the status quo, with Kazuto and Valkyrie\'s marriage being called off multiple times in increasingly improbable ways, and still remaining unresolved after 3 seasons. For a couple that already lacks heat, this makes it even harder to care about them Laine was my personal favorite, but most get their time to shine at one point or another.

A pilot for an anime should showcase the basic idea of the theme in which the show would like to maintain, and showcase all of the character designs the creator would like to use.The theme being an urban take on what seems like a 15th century ""Sengoku jidai"" taking place in a more modern world. Where de facto Samurai made names for themselves through their skill. We got to see most of the characters, but none were given any back story... there wasn\'t even any dialogue (""there are spoilers""...LMAO).

That being said, on with the review:]The original 2003 Afro Samurai pilot from Studio Madhouse is only around three minutes....but oh, what a three minutes it is!  Before anime studio Gonzo took the production of the anime to final product four years later, Takeshi Koikei directed and animated this promotional under the Madhouse banner.  If you have seen the Spike TV miniseries and thought it was extremely stylized, this...pilot promo cranks it up even more so.Plot-wise, this pilot really has none (as to be expected for short promotional created for funding purposes).  It is basically a three-minute fight scene of Afro dueling his way through all the major antagonists of the main series and sequel film.The art of this promo is gorgeous and flowing.  The finished project was ultimately very well-done, but this pilot leads me to believe if Madhouse had followed through with the production, it would and could have been even better (in the art department anyways).  Unfortunately, Takeshi Koikei became busy with the production of the delayed anime film Redline and Afro Samurai fell by the wayside before changing studio hands and becoming a Gonzo production as it is known as today.  Ultimately, the most this pilot does is show what potentially ""could have been"" if Madhouse had made the show.In short, enjoy this artifact if you want a few more drops of Afro Samurai before you\'ve exhausted the related media.  If you\'re going through withdrawals at the fact you have ran out of hip-hop samurai goodness, wander on over to Shinichirō Watanabe\'s Samurai Champloo and get a solid (less gory) extension to soothe your craving a little longer. pilot promo cranks it up even more so.Plot-wise, this pilot really has none (as to be expected for short promotional created for funding purposes).

If you\'re going through withdrawals at the fact you have ran out of hip-hop samurai goodness, wander on over to Shinichirō Watanabe\'s Samurai Champloo and get a solid (less gory) extension to soothe your craving a little longer.', 'Disclaimer: I am NOT a PROFESIONAL reviewer I’m only a anime fan trying to give feed back to other anime fans with that said one to the review.I saw this pilot after watching the movie adaptation of the anime and for a pilot its really bad the point of the pilot is to start off or begin the story but this was sort of a short summary of what happens I DON”T RECOMMEND YOU WATCH THIS BEFORE WATCHING THE ANIME because it shows scene from the ending so this pilot is the only pilot I’ve seen that actually contains spoilers.Other then the fact that it...has spoilers its alright I guess, although I don’t think rap music really goes with the whole samurai theme. has spoilers its alright I guess, although I don’t think rap music really goes with the whole samurai theme.', 'Watch only this if you just want a drop more of Afro Samurai or if you are considering to watch Afro Samurai (duly note that this is very short with no real plot, it just showcase what the anime might bring both with the art, action, music and story line, a little tiny glimpse, therefore there is no real spoilers in this one.)I really understand why that this pilot without any doubt convinced the producers and studio to make Afro Samurai into an anime. IT MADE ME SO HYPED! even though I have seen the series and the following movie :) It makes me wanna...crave for even more! I would love to be a sequel with other characters but in this setting :3 ^^ crave for even more! I would love to be a sequel with other characters but in this setting :3 ^^', 'The Afro Samurai Pilot is an interesting little short for a few reasons. Firstly it\'s a pretty insightful look into the story, concepts and character designs that the main show would end up using or dropping. Second, its a great showcase of Takeshi Koike\'s animation style and aesthetic sensibilities.As for the short itself, it can be described as a three minute long sakuga filled hip hop music videos involving the titular Afro Samurai tearing through his enemies, with all the slick action and hyper violence one would expect from the franchise. In a sense it captures the essence of Afro Samurai. An artistically excellent action...piece punctuated by hip hop beats.I\'ve been raving a lot about the art and animation, so what would one expect. It\'s a mostly monochrome piece with the main colors being black white and grey. This is complemented by intense bursts of red blood spray and wrapped up in Koike\'s characteristic dark and one tone shadows and you get a slick looking project. The minimalist color palate and background design also makes things feel pretty abstract at times. The animation throughout is just as smooth. The backgrounds having low detail just helps to emphasize the action, making it stand out quite a bit.The music is an important aspect of the short as well. There are two tracks used in it, the first being ""400 Years"" by CYNE. Its a great opener for the short, using a very Japanese sounding guitar sample and punchy percussion accompanied by lyrics about emancipation. The last half is accompanied by ""Next Time"" by Gang Starr, a jazzier track with a verse about the artist\'s unmatched skill on the mic, much like Afro\'s skill in a fight. There isn\'t any dialogue in the short, but the music helps tell as much of the story as the visuals.So who is this short for? I would recommend it for three  types of people. The first kind of person is the Afro Samurai super fan. If you haven\'t seen this yet, it\'s invaluable because you get to see the similarities and differences between the original and final products. The second type of person is for the sakuga and staff list nerd. Its an interesting little footnote in Takeshi Koike\'s career, and a showcase of some of the best animation he\'s put to screen. The last sort of person is the lover of both anime and Hip Hop. What it offers to them are cool action scenes, cool character designs and a good selection of tracks to boot. If you are any of these three, I\'d strongly recommend checking this short out! piece punctuated by hip hop beats.I\'ve been raving a lot about the art and animation, so what would one expect.

Akuma-kun (ONA),https://myanimelist.net/anime/48425/Akuma-kun_ONA,"['Akuma-Kun (2023) is one of the four new projects announced in 2021 to celebrate Shigeru Mizuki’s 100th birthday. To the uninitiated, Mizuki is an incredibly influential figure in Japanese pop culture. Being a Youkai researcher, his interests in the world of folktales and how they affect the society they encompass influence the works he writes. His most popular work is Gegege no Kitarou, which made a huge step into the western anime community back in 2018 with its most recent adaptation simulcasting on Crunchyroll. However, 34 years after its initial adaptation and 60 years since the publication of its first manga, Akuma-Kun takes an all-new...step into the modern era of anime, airing a new adaptation on Netflix finally allowing this series to be accessible to the western community.The story of Akuma-Kun is similar to that of Gegege no Kitarou, but instead of episodic stories about Youkai, Akuma-Kun is about, well, Akuma. “Akuma” means an evil spirit; however, they’re also synonymous with devils or demons, which Akuma-Kun references a lot since hell is a place where these evil spirits go. These Akuma prey on human desires, usually perfectionism and greed, and use those emotions to control and manipulate humans; creating the conflicts for each episodic story. Akuma-Kun (2023) is similar to its 1989 counterpart in storytelling; however, it\'s important to remember that it is not a re-adaptation. Akuma-Kun (2023) takes place after the events of the main series, with the two main characters being the children of the original Akuma-Kun and his companion Mephisto-II. With this being said, you don’t need the context of the original series or original characters to understand this adaptation, as not only do the previous main characters get their own development as parents, but also because this series is its own thing in many ways.(This review contains slight spoilers, however I have a spoiler-free TL;DR at the end)The biggest difference between the two adaptations is tone. Mizuki’s adaptations are often childish in appearance while being morally complex and gruesome in storytelling. Gegege no Kitarou (2018) is a great example of this: bright childish designs and comedic moments with very gruesome tales of death and suffering interspersed between. However, Akuma-Kun (2023) takes this idea a step further by conveying these themes through its visual style. Akuma-Kun often gets very grim, conveying its brutal deaths in an honest but gruesome way. While the character designs are similarly childish in appearance, lacking any depth in detail with soft, round faces and eyes, the backgrounds are in complete contrast to this. Backgrounds are rough and gruesome in appearance, with rugged linework and impressively detailed designs. The shading is bold and has only one tone of dark black, encompassing every inch of detail in the backgrounds. Shot composition is used to highlight this beauty, with many close-up shots showing the detail on surrounding objects. This depth of detail is in every way impressive, as it is beautiful, and it\'s reminiscent of Shichirou Kobayashi’s work. The backgrounds are supported by a great understanding of colour composition, blending everything together and having light bounce off of characters in a very satisfying way. This can be attributed to the colour designer Kunio Tsujita at the helm, who has worked alongside Shichirou Kobayashi on Utena as well as many Toei projects such as Ojamajo Doremi, Gokinjou Monogatari, Mali & Gali, and Hakaba Kitarou. The backgrounds are just jaw-droppingly gorgeous and do a wonderful job at selling the dark and gruesome tone of Akuma-Kun.In many ways, Akuma-Kun (2023) can be compared to Hakaba Kitarou (2007), an adaptation of the original 1950s Kitarou Kashi-hon that Mizuki published before Gegege no Kitarou. This version of Kitarou is violent, not afraid to show death in its purest and most gruesome form. The 2007 Hakaba Kitarou adaptation takes a similarly differing approach to its visuals by having a rough art style to help convey its darker themes. Similar to this version of Kitarou, Akuma-Kun (2023) isn’t afraid to be as gruesome as possible, straying away from the more kid-friendly tone the 1989 adaptation had. I\'m not sure what the original manga for Akuma-Kun was like since the 1989 anime isn’t an adaptation of the original manga. However, I assume it’s similar to Hakaba Kitarou in that it has a much darker tone compared to its subsequent releases. In Akuma-Kun (2023), we’re shown violent murders and deaths, and it doesn’t shy away from how horrific they are. However, this cynical portrayal of human life isn’t just for the sake of shock value. The gruesome deaths we are shown are interwoven with the core themes of the series and, in almost complete contrast, convey the value of human life.The core themes explored in Akuma-Kun (2023) are the human desire for perfection, greed, and jealousy. There are stories like a mother “accidentally” murdering her own child because her child went against her perception of her, so she made a contract with a devil to impersonate her daughter in a way she wanted her to be, or like when a rich bastard, who has a goal of trying every food in the world, blindly murdered his maid because he wanted to summon Satan to be the first to taste his flesh. As absurd as some of these stories can get, Akuma-Kun never fails to deliver these stories through great mystery and intrigue, tying everything to the ideas it\'s trying to convey. The idea of “selling your soul to the devil\'\' is a key component of the stories told in Akuma-Kun, as we see many characters throughout the series make contracts with Akuma out of a desire for perfection. However, making these contracts always ends in misfortune because the devils only want to manipulate humans by preying on their desires. One of my favourite episodes, episode 9, was about a writer who wanted to create the perfect script and sold his soul to an Akuma to do so. He was obsessed with making a masterpiece, he was obsessed with that ""perfection"", but that desire eventually led him to abandoning his wife and child due to frustration in himself. Even when he makes amends with them years later he believes he failed as a father and doesn\'t deserve to be one. But what does ""being a good father"" even mean? What does that look like? And just because you\'re imperfect that means you don\'t deserve these things? Akuma-Kun tells the audience that you should always value what you have in your life and never let greed or the desire for perfection get in the way of what’s truly in front of you.These themes and ideas are very common in Mizuki’s works and adaptations; however, Akuma-Kun (2023) takes it a step further by questioning the morals of the main characters. In episode 6, the newly introduced antagonist ‘Strophaia’ questions Mephisto’s claim that everything that happened is the fault of the Akuma, implying that they would’ve lived happily if it weren’t for them. Throughout the series thus far, Akuma-kun and Mephisto are the heroes that save humans from the Akuma that possess them; however, Strophaia questions this moral, saying “It\'s easier to blame someone else. But the more you do so, the more painful it gets.” Are Akuma-Kun and Mephisto really protecting humans from Akuma, or are they protecting humans from their own internal horrors? Episode 7 presents us with an Akuma who was rescued and raised by a human, a human who offered up all of his kindness to save others but ultimately succumbed to the weight of it all. This kindness he received growing up led to him forming a “human” heart, becoming a politician with the goal of helping others. Yet this strong desire leads him to kill those who oppose him, letting his inner Akuma take over his body. At the end of the episode, however, he chooses to give himself up to the police instead of attacking Ichirou, because he truly does want to do what’s right and have a “human heart”. Akuma-Kun (2023) is inherently about the internal horrors of ordinary people, with the Akuma serving only to exacerbate these horrors. Throughout the series, we\'re made to question the true meaning of these morals while the mystery continues to build with each subsequent episode, and it’s very entertaining for that reason. At the helm of series composition is Hiroshi Oonogi, who most notably worked on the 2018 Gegege no Kitarou adaptation. I believe Oonogi has a great understanding of the themes of Mizuki’s works and is able to portray them superbly. His work in Gegege no Kitarou (2018) is similarly impressive, so I’m very happy he worked on Akuma-Kun.Not only is the thematic writing for Akuma-Kun (2023) on point, but the character writing is also great. Ichirou is such a fascinating main character because, despite sharing the same role as “Akuma-Kun”, he isn’t at all righteous like his father. His goal isn’t to befriend demons or to unite demons and humans together, nor does he have any interest in the millennium kingdom, the thing that his father was looking for in the original series. In actuality, he doesn’t care at all about those things. He has a disregard for common courtesy and just about everything expected of him in social interactions. Like how he ignores Gremory’s blatant attempts at getting with him, or when he calls out the mother’s taste in history books in episode 1. In many ways, Ichirou doesn’t act very “human” nor like an “Akuma” either, and he seems to rebel against the idea of what it means to be an “Akuma-Kun \'\'. I find this characteriszation to be very interesting, especially when taking into consideration his relationship with the people who’ve looked after him. Mephisto-III is also a very interesting character. Despite sharing many traits with his father, Mephisto-II, he is much weaker because he’s a half-human, half-demon, with his half-human part holding him back. Yet despite this, he doesn’t resent his half-human self, as it’s often what defines him as a person. He’s very empathetic and respectful of others, which is in complete contrast to Ichirou. Because of this, he’s often quick to call out Ichirou whenever he does something morally questionable. Like in episode 1, when he tries to stop Ichirou from explaining what happened to Hina’s friend because he’s concerned about her mental wellbeing. There are also times where Ichirou has a disregard for his own life, which Mephisto-III gets very upset at him for, like in episode 3, when Ichirou almost dies trying to summon Satan. Many of these situations end up with Mephisto-III being frustrated with Ichirou; however, this often comes from a genuine concern for Ichirou, which is a reflection of the kind of relationship the two share. I really like the dynamic Ichirou and Mephisto-III have with each other. This relationship they share is important in contrast to the other important figures in his life, as he was abandoned by them both. However, this is going into ending-spoiler territory, so I won’t expand on this point as it’s something worth watching yourself. However, the takeaway from this is that the relationship Mephisto-III and Ichirou share is one of genuine concern for one another, something Ichirou feels he lost growing up. Because Ichirou was abandoned by both Akuma and humans, he lacks traits to be defined by either. Instead of valuing human life and fighting to protect lives, he’s seen calling out humans for being “fundamentally untrustworthy” and appreciating how faithful the Akuma are to their objectives, despite the fact that being an “Akuma-Kun\'\' means to fight for humans. This was influenced by the Akuma who raised Ichirou, ‘Strophaia’, who also constantly questions the morals of Akuma-Kun, and it’s intriguing to see this development unravel throughout the anime with how it affects Ichirou. Mephisto-III, on the other hand, is the complete opposite, despising Akuma who manipulate human lives. The relationship between Ichirou and Mephisto-III is incredibly entertaining to watch and a highlight of this anime for me.The villains of Akuma-Kun are equally entertaining to watch, as their overwhelming force of pure evil intent overpowers every scene they’re in, and I always felt a genuine sense of fear whenever they appeared. They waltz around the main characters with a calm yet passive aggressive demeanour, poking fun at and questioning their every action. Because of this, slowly learning more about who they are throughout the anime is very entertaining to watch. Even the episodic antagonists, as in the Akuma who possess humans, are fascinating to watch. Because they prey on human desires and manipulate those feelings, a huge focus is put on exploring what these desires are. The big reveal at the end of each episode is always exciting, not only because the mystery building up to it is intriguing but also because the thematic exploration is always on point. I’m not going to talk about the last couple of episodes because they are worth going into blind, and I just don’t really want to spoil the ending in this review. However, everything that Akuma-Kun (2023) builds up towards in the first 10 episodes is handled incredibly well. The ending does leave a lot to be desired and was definitely the worst part about this anime, however, to me, it didn\'t ruin what it built up towards. The ambiguous ending somewhat implies there\'ll be more to the story, so I\'d love to see a second season some day.With that all being said, themes and character writing aside, I just love the overall writing of Akuma-Kun. Each episode is very entertaining, as both the mysteries and slice-of-life moments are written very well. I especially love how the slice-of-life moments are intertwined with the main plot of most episodes. It was fun seeing Mephisto-III’s home as he sat and discussed with his parents what\'s going on. It’s adorable to see how much Mephisto-III relies on his parents for support. Even the moments where Ichirou and his father were together. We get to see that, despite Ichirou being resentful towards his father, he still cares about him and what he tells him. These slower moments sprinkled through are much welcome, as they help develop the characters away from all the crazy, gruesome shit that goes on in each episode. Episode 10 is one of my favourite episodes for putting aside the detective conflicts and Akuma fights to focus entirely on the relationships between the characters, which I really appreciate. I enjoy how Akuma-Kun (2023) handles these things more than Gegege no Kitarou (for which I’m currently watching the 2018 season as of writing this) because it feels like Gegege puts way more focus on the battle scenes than character moments, whereas in comparison, Akuma-Kun (2023) has battle scenes that go by very quickly. It’s why the episodes in Gegege 2018 with the least amount of fighting (or none at all) are some of the best. That’s one pet peeve I have with Mizuki’s adaptations, and I’m happy to say that Akuma-Kun does a great job of balancing its action scenes with the episodic mysteries and character moments. The episodic mysteries in Akuma-Kun (2023) are genuinely suspenseful and often subvert my expectations in a way that works well, and as I’ve said before, it does a great job of intertwining the themes of the series with these mysteries. The overarching mysteries were also very interesting, with antagonists I found myself genuinely fearful of, and I was always excited to get to the next episode to see what happens. Akuma-Kun (2023) is an incredibly entertaining show that’s supported by overall great writing and awesome characters.The music and sound design are worth mentioning too, for a few reasons. The music does a great job of adding to the atmosphere and setting the mood in unique ways. Akio Izutsu was listed for creating the music, and while I don’t know much about him, I can definitely say that he’s a great musician and was able to create some very fitting pieces for Akuma-Kun. The sound design is equally great. One of my favourite moments in episode one was when Ichirou looked under a bed and found an Akuma under there. There was a pause on Ichirou’s face with the BGM continuing to play like normal in the background, but as it cuts to the creepy Akuma, the music suddenly cuts. This little detail made an already creepy scene even more disturbing, as it helps take the audience by surprise when the creepy figure suddenly shows up on screen. Little details like the ominous whispering and creepy sound effects during the horror scenes work great at building tension, and there was never a moment where I felt anything was out of place. Much like the art style, the music fits the atmosphere of Akuma-Kun perfectly. I also liked the inclusion of the OG voice actors for Shingo and Mephisto-II returning in this adaptation. Mephisto-III also shares the same voice actor, and it feels like a treat for the fans because of how iconic his voice is. I also really like the voice actor for Ichirou; he does a great job of portraying his personality with his monotone voice.I’m surprised I’ve gone this far into the review without mentioning him (which, mind you, required an extreme amount of restraint), but you can’t talk about Akuma-Kun without mentioning the prolific anime director and self-proclaimed Iyashikei-king (don’t quote me on that): Junichi Satou. Junichi Satou sat in the director\'s chair for the original 1989 adaptation of Akuma-Kun and reprised his role for this adaptation. Knowing he was working on this adaptation is what got me interested in it in the first place, because Junichi has been somewhat on a roll recently when it comes to revisiting his older works. In 2020, we were blessed with ‘Majo Minarai wo Sagashite’, a movie based off of the Ojamajo Doremi franchise, which did an incredible job of revitalising the core themes of Ojamajo Doremi and building off of them to tell an incredibly touching tale. I feel similarly about this Akuma-Kun adaptation, as it too calls back to the ideas explored in the original and builds off of them to create something special. One thing very noticeable about Junichi\'s work is the thematic density and the staff’s ability to tie many different ideas together. While a lot of what makes a Junichi anime great doesn’t directly relate to him, since the creation of anime is basically like a massive group project, I believe Junichi does a fantastic job of keeping everyone’s ideas together. You can see this in a lot of his most recent works: Majo Minarai, the new Aria movies, and Hugtto Precure, with Akuma-Kun being no different. Junichi Satou is a phenomenal director, and I’m super happy he worked on this. He deserves all the praise he gets.-- Conclusion/TL;DR --All in all, Akuma-Kun (2023) is an amazing adaptation of the story, utilising the themes and ideas established in the manga and original adaptation and expanding on them to create a very unique experience. Its gruesome portrayal of death is one that is utilised superbly and watching the episodic mysteries unfold is very entertaining. All the way from its gorgeous art style to its ability to intertwine these themes with its mysterious plot line, I consider Akuma-Kun (2023) to be one of my favourite Mizuki adaptations. Great story and very entertaining characterization that constantly forces the viewers to question the anime\'s morals. Considering this adaptation was conceived as a celebration of Shigeru Mizuki’s 100th birthday, it feels like a celebration of the themes and ideas he explores in his work. Not only that, but it also feels like a gift to the fans. Akuma-Kun is a great introduction to Mizuki’s works, and I highly recommend watching it if you\'re interested. You can watch Gegege no Kitarou (2018) as it\'s on Crunchyroll; however, to watch his other adaptations will require watching fan-subs, of which fortunately there are plenty out there for both Gegege no Kitarou and the original Akuma-Kun. Thank you so much for reading this review, if you’ve made it this far, and I hope you decide to give Akuma-Kun (2023) a try! Or if you’ve already seen it and like it, my recommendation is to watch Hakaba Kitarou as it provides a similarly unnerving and gruesome experience. step into the modern era of anime, airing a new adaptation on Netflix finally allowing this series to be accessible to the western community.The story of Akuma-Kun is similar to that of Gegege no Kitarou, but instead of episodic stories about Youkai, Akuma-Kun is about, well, Akuma. “Akuma” means an evil spirit; however, they’re also synonymous with devils or demons, which Akuma-Kun references a lot since hell is a place where these evil spirits go.

In episode 6, the newly introduced antagonist ‘Strophaia’ questions Mephisto’s claim that everything that happened is the fault of the Akuma, implying that they would’ve lived happily if it weren’t for them. Throughout the series thus far, Akuma-kun and Mephisto are the heroes that save humans from the Akuma that possess them; however, Strophaia questions this moral, saying “It\'s easier to blame someone else. But the more you do so, the more painful it gets.” Are Akuma-Kun and Mephisto really protecting humans from Akuma, or are they protecting humans from their own internal horrors? Episode 7 presents us with an Akuma who was rescued and raised by a human, a human who offered up all of his kindness to save others but ultimately succumbed to the weight of it all. This kindness he received growing up led to him forming a “human” heart, becoming a politician with the goal of helping others. Yet this strong desire leads him to kill those who oppose him, letting his inner Akuma take over his body. At the end of the episode, however, he chooses to give himself up to the police instead of attacking Ichirou, because he truly does want to do what’s right and have a “human heart”. Akuma-Kun (2023) is inherently about the internal horrors of ordinary people, with the Akuma serving only to exacerbate these horrors. Throughout the series, we\'re made to question the true meaning of these morals while the mystery continues to build with each subsequent episode, and it’s very entertaining for that reason. At the helm of series composition is Hiroshi Oonogi, who most notably worked on the 2018 Gegege no Kitarou adaptation. I believe Oonogi has a great understanding of the themes of Mizuki’s works and is able to portray them superbly. His work in Gegege no Kitarou (2018) is similarly impressive, so I’m very happy he worked on Akuma-Kun.Not only is the thematic writing for Akuma-Kun (2023) on point, but the character writing is also great. Ichirou is such a fascinating main character because, despite sharing the same role as “Akuma-Kun”, he isn’t at all righteous like his father. His goal isn’t to befriend demons or to unite demons and humans together, nor does he have any interest in the millennium kingdom, the thing that his father was looking for in the original series. In actuality, he doesn’t care at all about those things. He has a disregard for common courtesy and just about everything expected of him in social interactions. Like how he ignores Gremory’s blatant attempts at getting with him, or when he calls out the mother’s taste in history books in episode 1. In many ways, Ichirou doesn’t act very “human” nor like an “Akuma” either, and he seems to rebel against the idea of what it means to be an “Akuma-Kun \'\'. I find this characteriszation to be very interesting, especially when taking into consideration his relationship with the people who’ve looked after him. Mephisto-III is also a very interesting character. Despite sharing many traits with his father, Mephisto-II, he is much weaker because he’s a half-human, half-demon, with his half-human part holding him back. Yet despite this, he doesn’t resent his half-human self, as it’s often what defines him as a person. He’s very empathetic and respectful of others, which is in complete contrast to Ichirou. Because of this, he’s often quick to call out Ichirou whenever he does something morally questionable. Like in episode 1, when he tries to stop Ichirou from explaining what happened to Hina’s friend because he’s concerned about her mental wellbeing. There are also times where Ichirou has a disregard for his own life, which Mephisto-III gets very upset at him for, like in episode 3, when Ichirou almost dies trying to summon Satan. Many of these situations end up with Mephisto-III being frustrated with Ichirou; however, this often comes from a genuine concern for Ichirou, which is a reflection of the kind of relationship the two share. I really like the dynamic Ichirou and Mephisto-III have with each other. This relationship they share is important in contrast to the other important figures in his life, as he was abandoned by them both. However, this is going into ending-spoiler territory, so I won’t expand on this point as it’s something worth watching yourself. However, the takeaway from this is that the relationship Mephisto-III and Ichirou share is one of genuine concern for one another, something Ichirou feels he lost growing up. Because Ichirou was abandoned by both Akuma and humans, he lacks traits to be defined by either. Instead of valuing human life and fighting to protect lives, he’s seen calling out humans for being “fundamentally untrustworthy” and appreciating how faithful the Akuma are to their objectives, despite the fact that being an “Akuma-Kun\'\' means to fight for humans. This was influenced by the Akuma who raised Ichirou, ‘Strophaia’, who also constantly questions the morals of Akuma-Kun, and it’s intriguing to see this development unravel throughout the anime with how it affects Ichirou. Mephisto-III, on the other hand, is the complete opposite, despising Akuma who manipulate human lives. The relationship between Ichirou and Mephisto-III is incredibly entertaining to watch and a highlight of this anime for me.The villains of Akuma-Kun are equally entertaining to watch, as their overwhelming force of pure evil intent overpowers every scene they’re in, and I always felt a genuine sense of fear whenever they appeared. They waltz around the main characters with a calm yet passive aggressive demeanour, poking fun at and questioning their every action. Because of this, slowly learning more about who they are throughout the anime is very entertaining to watch. Even the episodic antagonists, as in the Akuma who possess humans, are fascinating to watch. Because they prey on human desires and manipulate those feelings, a huge focus is put on exploring what these desires are. The big reveal at the end of each episode is always exciting, not only because the mystery building up to it is intriguing but also because the thematic exploration is always on point. I’m not going to talk about the last couple of episodes because they are worth going into blind, and I just don’t really want to spoil the ending in this review. However, everything that Akuma-Kun (2023) builds up towards in the first 10 episodes is handled incredibly well. The ending does leave a lot to be desired and was definitely the worst part about this anime, however, to me, it didn\'t ruin what it built up towards. The ambiguous ending somewhat implies there\'ll be more to the story, so I\'d love to see a second season some day.With that all being said, themes and character writing aside, I just love the overall writing of Akuma-Kun. Each episode is very entertaining, as both the mysteries and slice-of-life moments are written very well. I especially love how the slice-of-life moments are intertwined with the main plot of most episodes. It was fun seeing Mephisto-III’s home as he sat and discussed with his parents what\'s going on. It’s adorable to see how much Mephisto-III relies on his parents for support. Even the moments where Ichirou and his father were together. We get to see that, despite Ichirou being resentful towards his father, he still cares about him and what he tells him. These slower moments sprinkled through are much welcome, as they help develop the characters away from all the crazy, gruesome shit that goes on in each episode. Episode 10 is one of my favourite episodes for putting aside the detective conflicts and Akuma fights to focus entirely on the relationships between the characters, which I really appreciate. I enjoy how Akuma-Kun (2023) handles these things more than Gegege no Kitarou (for which I’m currently watching the 2018 season as of writing this) because it feels like Gegege puts way more focus on the battle scenes than character moments, whereas in comparison, Akuma-Kun (2023) has battle scenes that go by very quickly. It’s why the episodes in Gegege 2018 with the least amount of fighting (or none at all) are some of the best. That’s one pet peeve I have with Mizuki’s adaptations, and I’m happy to say that Akuma-Kun does a great job of balancing its action scenes with the episodic mysteries and character moments. The episodic mysteries in Akuma-Kun (2023) are genuinely suspenseful and often subvert my expectations in a way that works well, and as I’ve said before, it does a great job of intertwining the themes of the series with these mysteries. The overarching mysteries were also very interesting, with antagonists I found myself genuinely fearful of, and I was always excited to get to the next episode to see what happens. Akuma-Kun (2023) is an incredibly entertaining show that’s supported by overall great writing and awesome characters.The music and sound design are worth mentioning too, for a few reasons. The music does a great job of adding to the atmosphere and setting the mood in unique ways. Akio Izutsu was listed for creating the music, and while I don’t know much about him, I can definitely say that he’s a great musician and was able to create some very fitting pieces for Akuma-Kun. The sound design is equally great. One of my favourite moments in episode one was when Ichirou looked under a bed and found an Akuma under there. There was a pause on Ichirou’s face with the BGM continuing to play like normal in the background, but as it cuts to the creepy Akuma, the music suddenly cuts. This little detail made an already creepy scene even more disturbing, as it helps take the audience by surprise when the creepy figure suddenly shows up on screen. Little details like the ominous whispering and creepy sound effects during the horror scenes work great at building tension, and there was never a moment where I felt anything was out of place. Much like the art style, the music fits the atmosphere of Akuma-Kun perfectly. I also liked the inclusion of the OG voice actors for Shingo and Mephisto-II returning in this adaptation. Mephisto-III also shares the same voice actor, and it feels like a treat for the fans because of how iconic his voice is. I also really like the voice actor for Ichirou; he does a great job of portraying his personality with his monotone voice.I’m surprised I’ve gone this far into the review without mentioning him (which, mind you, required an extreme amount of restraint), but you can’t talk about Akuma-Kun without mentioning the prolific anime director and self-proclaimed Iyashikei-king (don’t quote me on that): Junichi Satou. Junichi Satou sat in the director\'s chair for the original 1989 adaptation of Akuma-Kun and reprised his role for this adaptation. Knowing he was working on this adaptation is what got me interested in it in the first place, because Junichi has been somewhat on a roll recently when it comes to revisiting his older works. In 2020, we were blessed with ‘Majo Minarai wo Sagashite’, a movie based off of the Ojamajo Doremi franchise, which did an incredible job of revitalising the core themes of Ojamajo Doremi and building off of them to tell an incredibly touching tale. I feel similarly about this Akuma-Kun adaptation, as it too calls back to the ideas explored in the original and builds off of them to create something special. One thing very noticeable about Junichi\'s work is the thematic density and the staff’s ability to tie many different ideas together. While a lot of what makes a Junichi anime great doesn’t directly relate to him, since the creation of anime is basically like a massive group project, I believe Junichi does a fantastic job of keeping everyone’s ideas together. You can see this in a lot of his most recent works: Majo Minarai, the new Aria movies, and Hugtto Precure, with Akuma-Kun being no different. Junichi Satou is a phenomenal director, and I’m super happy he worked on this. He deserves all the praise he gets.-- Conclusion/TL;DR --All in all, Akuma-Kun (2023) is an amazing adaptation of the story, utilising the themes and ideas established in the manga and original adaptation and expanding on them to create a very unique experience. Its gruesome portrayal of death is one that is utilised superbly and watching the episodic mysteries unfold is very entertaining. All the way from its gorgeous art style to its ability to intertwine these themes with its mysterious plot line, I consider Akuma-Kun (2023) to be one of my favourite Mizuki adaptations. Great story and very entertaining characterization that constantly forces the viewers to question the anime\'s morals. Considering this adaptation was conceived as a celebration of Shigeru Mizuki’s 100th birthday, it feels like a celebration of the themes and ideas he explores in his work. Not only that, but it also feels like a gift to the fans. Akuma-Kun is a great introduction to Mizuki’s works, and I highly recommend watching it if you\'re interested. You can watch Gegege no Kitarou (2018) as it\'s on Crunchyroll; however, to watch his other adaptations will require watching fan-subs, of which fortunately there are plenty out there for both Gegege no Kitarou and the original Akuma-Kun. Thank you so much for reading this review, if you’ve made it this far, and I hope you decide to give Akuma-Kun (2023) a try! Or if you’ve already seen it and like it, my recommendation is to watch Hakaba Kitarou as it provides a similarly unnerving and gruesome experience.', ""On the positive side of things, this is one of those sequels viewers don't need to see the prequel material to get. On the not-so-positive side, the show may leave viewers actually wanting to check out the prequel material, which may not be something viewers may have access to. Akuma-kun is certainly a long waited delight for those who are into the older series, perhaps even more eclectic styles of Anime/Manga, albeit this isn't a reboot let alone an older Anime finally getting a dub.Of course, Akuma-kun is difficult to explain, beyond the fact it is of the supernatural mystery genre which can in itself...be super-niche. And on top of the supernatural horror elements, which are mild compared to some of the others going for the psychological pull rather than the gore out, although the show doesn't shy away from blood and gore when needed, there is also comedy, not to mention interpersonal relationships some are craving, the latter I personally enjoyed a lot. be super-niche.

I think it was a nice decent filler show that you watch between bigger shows. Or just a little bite sized nibble to wean you back into anime if you’ve been gone for a while. I enjoyed it, but I couldn’t help but feel as though I’d enjoy it more if I watched the 1990s version before it. You don’t HAVE to watch its predecessor, but the original had 42 episodes whereas this series only has 12. I can’t help but feel as though there’s a lot of useful backstory, specifically with the previous...Akuma-kun. Imagine watching Boruto without watching Naruto, you know? Sure, they can include vague and cryptic allusions to the past, but you’d have to see and feel, you’d have to BE there, in order to get why certain things are so important and meaningful.What I liked the most about this series is that it focuses on parents, specifically fathers. Good fathers, bad fathers, fathers just doing their best. I think we’ve become way too accustomed to absent parents or single mother homes that we don’t get to see how different variations of fatherhood also affect children. I really loved watching the duo solve mysteries and using those mysteries to implement them into their own lives. What does it mean to be a friend? Can you love your child too much? How can humans love and hate one another at the same time? So many complex human emotions being examined by demons while warding off evil.Perhaps I’ll watch the original version or search high and low for the manga. In the meantime, give this anime a try.

Tenkuu Shinpan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/43690/Tenkuu_Shinpan,"[""The first 4 episodes got me intrigued into this anime that aired today in Netflix. But a bit of loose writing I would say, with unnecessary moments of comedy and displaying panties and stuff made me off of High Rise Invasion.The only thing I can say that was constant was the art. The animation was pretty good by Zero-G. The story started pretty well but I felt that it was way too rushed which impacted the quality of the latter episodes disastrously.In my opinion, it deserves 1.5/5 stars overall and I don't plan to watch or wait for a 2nd season, whatsoever.. "", 'Don\'t make a drinking game out of the random panty shots in Thigh-Rise Invasion (pun intended). It won\'t turn out well for your health.High-Rise Invasion has an interesting premise and a very strong start, filled with mystery and suspense, but as it went on, those aspects decreased and the flaws of the show became more apparent.This anime is about a group of people who are suddenly thrust into a bizarre world and need to find a way out. This is actually very similar to the live action Japanese TV show that aired on Netflix a little while back called Alice in Borderland. Definitely give that...show a watch, as it\'s very good (it also has an English audio option). The immediate mystery creates a huge draw for the series, and you are instantly put into the character\'s place trying to figure everything out, just like the characters are.One of the aforementioned flaws in this anime was the animation. Studio Zero-G isn\'t a well known giant in the industry. In fact, I haven\'t seen any other anime from that studio so I can\'t say how well it matches compared to their previous work, but the animation for High-Rise Invasion, while clean, was a little lazy. Both in and out of action sequences. Nothing looked bad, but it is a shame that this show couldn\'t be given to a more well known animation studio. There were no flashy moments of sakuga and even regular movements seemed off sometimes. There were also some bad CGI integrations that really seemed out of place. That being said, the character designs were nice at least.Animation alone doesn\'t always make or break a show though and while the animation by itself might not have been the shows strong suit, it wasn\'t the only flaw in the show. The characters themselves weren\'t that well developed. Some were given backstories that took themselves too seriously considering some of the shows goofiness and other characters backstories were somehow too ridiculous even considering the rest of the show. On that note, the tone of the show was all over the place. The show at times doesn\'t know if it wanted to be taken seriously or not. One minute a person could be beheaded in a supposed to be sad moment, and the next, there is an ""accidental"" panty shot.That brings up the biggest flaw, the fan-service. I don\'t mind fan-service if there is a point to it in the narrative, but there really wasn\'t any point to it here. It was just a way to reach a certain viewing audience and sell better to that crowd. Every episode there were multiple panty shots and there were a few nearly nude scenes thrown in though nothing explicit is shown. There is also some Yuri subtext in between the two main leads which leads nowhere but will appeal to a large viewership nonetheless.The music in the anime did its job. The OP is done by Empire, so those who watch Black Clover might recognize the artist. It took a few listens, but I ended up really liking the OP. The ED is mostly forgettable though. The OST did its job and really hyped up the scenes to be epic when needed. The voice acting (English Dub) was pretty good as well.While the story starts off really strong, as it goes on, the plot sort of becomes a mess, many things don\'t make sense, and since it ended off unfinished and needed a second season, lots of questions remain to be answered.All that being said, this show was a lot of fun. Some of the lines in fact would have fit right in an abridged series. Like ""I recognize those panties anywhere"" (paraphrasing). High-Rise Invasion is just a funny brainless popcorn flick at times, and a suspenseful thrilling mystery at others. The sum of its parts don\'t equal out to the whole for this anime. While there are big flaws and not so many strengths, it really is an enjoyable anime. Whether you enjoy it ironically or not is up to others to decide for themselves, but I had a blast watching it. I might even watch it again with my siblings and laugh with them about it.In the end really, the over-the-top ridiculousness may be what makes or breaks the show for you. Some people might think of parts of the show as too dumb while others might think of it as dumb but fun.Overall, I am rating High-Rise Invasion an 8. There were too many flaws to score higher than that, but it was also too enjoyable and fun to give a lower score. I haven\'t watched an anime as enjoyable as this in a while, so I guess that is my recommendation. Watch it and then either praise it or bash it, as long as you have fun doing so then you got something out of it.P.S.

I was curious, how it all would turn out in the end? Would Netflix censor everything?What attracted me in the manga was the whole dark and lonely premise of being trapped in a skyscraper maze with dozens of killers. Okay, we got a high school girl wearing skirts as the MC (be prepared for many random panty shots), but that was not a problem to me, actually, I was curious about how a defenseless girl would survive in that...world.Considering all that, I was expectating an equally dark atmosphere in the anime, something like Hellsing Ultimate, maybe? but no, it was not. We recieved a colorful anime, I mean, a REALLY colorful anime, it is something that I would expect in a comedy show, not in an ""horror"" tagged one. But okay, I mean, ""If you want a grey color pallet, go read the manga"", right? So yeah, ignoring that, I was hoping that at least we could get some cool gore scenes with terrifying killers and breathtaking situations, did we recieved this? You right, no. I mean, in the first encounter of Yuri with a killer (ep 1 minor spoilers), the man point a katana to her face and the girl puts out the SAME expression that a rom-com girl do when the MC says something lame. Like, hello? you\'re about to be decapitated by a katana, girl, wtf.While watching it, I couldn\'t feel Yuri\'s fear, I couldn\'t feel any emotions at all, I think the approach taken by the studio was not the best for this show. What should be a story filled with thriller, mistery and blood, ended up as an ""okay"" show with some dumb comedy traces.And don\'t get me wrong, Yuri really is a tough girl, however she took some chapters to put everything togheter in the manga, but in the anime the girl is already playing midgames with killers in the first episode, and that happened cause the pace is awful, so awful that you can say it\'s an original story, they JUMPED from chapter 3 to 21 in the first episode, I\'m not even joking, it\'s like they wanted to put 250 chapters into 12 episodes.The animation is ok, the art is ok, the dub is ok, the OST is ok, but looks like a SOL studio was not the best choice for an horror anime. In the end, Tenkuu Shinpan is an average manga that got an even more average adaptation, it\'s sad cause they could\'ve pulled out something amazing, but that dumb, ""funny"" and - panty shots - atmosphere plus the rushed pace are just lame. world.Considering all that, I was expectating an equally dark atmosphere in the anime, something like Hellsing Ultimate, maybe? but no, it was not.

I mean, in the first encounter of Yuri with a killer (ep 1 minor spoilers), the man point a katana to her face and the girl puts out the SAME expression that a rom-com girl do when the MC says something lame. Like, hello? you\'re about to be decapitated by a katana, girl, wtf.While watching it, I couldn\'t feel Yuri\'s fear, I couldn\'t feel any emotions at all, I think the approach taken by the studio was not the best for this show. What should be a story filled with thriller, mistery and blood, ended up as an ""okay"" show with some dumb comedy traces.And don\'t get me wrong, Yuri really is a tough girl, however she took some chapters to put everything togheter in the manga, but in the anime the girl is already playing midgames with killers in the first episode, and that happened cause the pace is awful, so awful that you can say it\'s an original story, they JUMPED from chapter 3 to 21 in the first episode, I\'m not even joking, it\'s like they wanted to put 250 chapters into 12 episodes.The animation is ok, the art is ok, the dub is ok, the OST is ok, but looks like a SOL studio was not the best choice for an horror anime. In the end, Tenkuu Shinpan is an average manga that got an even more average adaptation, it\'s sad cause they could\'ve pulled out something amazing, but that dumb, ""funny"" and - panty shots - atmosphere plus the rushed pace are just lame.', ""This show definitely set itself up high in expectations. But that didn’t stop it from plummeting down on the same level as any other bottom-tier fiction. Tenkuu Shinpan is yet another proof of how short a high concept can take you if there’s nothing else of value.The premise of Tenkuu Shinpan is quite attention-grabbing and creates a basis for something promising. Following a bunch of teenagers who’re trapped upon a sea of skyscrapers that stretches as far as the eye can see. Where they have to find a way to stay alive before zany mask-wearing maniacs get to them. It sounds like a fun...time if anything, yet the show falters due to underwhelming execution and a lack of identity.The show wants to be a lot of things and tries to balance it out during the short runtime. As such it doesn’t fully succeed in anything it sets out to do. I’ll do my best to address the issues I have with most of them.Dull Characters:The story of Tenkuu Shinpan is centered around it’s main leads and their journey through the high-rise landscape. Yet they feel hollow, with nothing but their thickness as meat on otherwise bare-bones characteristics. Which the show likes to show off with panty shots aplenty. The show rarely takes time to further explore who they are and why we should care about them getting back to the real world. We don’t find out how their lives were before they were transported, so it’s impossible to do so. It creates a distance between the characters and the viewer which is a deathblow when a show relies on you caring about their survival.High-Rise Survival:Survival becomes priority as soon as our protagonist Yuri enters the high-rise landscape. But just as quickly fades away into the background due to there being little urgency to find necessary provisions and places to sleep. Even basic hygiene is of no concern. So the only real hurdle they have to overcome is to defeat the mask-wearing lunatics and I suppose to not accidentally sleepwalk off the roof. It’s a shame that they didn’t take advantage of the setting, and maybe have our protagonists fight other humans for necessary resources. It would certainly help give more weight to the fights, rather than have it just be kill or be killed scenarios. As is, the battles that ensue lack a compelling reasoning as to why they happen, making them quite dull. Doesn’t help that the animation is clunky and stiff. The visuals overall looked rushed and were quite straining on the eyeballs. It’s also extremely bright and colorful for what is proclaimed to be a horror. Although to be fair you can barely call it one.Sloppy Horror:Calling this show a horror in any way other than horrifyingly bad would be quite wrong as it isn’t terrifying in the slightest. So don’t be tricked into thinking otherwise. It does have horror elements but due to how tensionless it often feels, you quickly forget they exist. You see, the characters suffer from this sickness called plot armor, which hinders them from actually being in any danger whatsoever. Every time a situation starts to become too dire, the writers pull something out of their asses to fix it. If a character is in need of rescuing, a convenient person or item appears. When a character needs some quick information, someone responds with a quick exposition dump. It’s not as much of a fight for your life scenario as it is just overcoming an annoyance. It robs the show of any suspense, and a horror without suspense can’t really be described as being a horror. At heart it’s more of an action-comedy. The action is thoroughly lackluster, but the latter is much better handled.Momentary Chuckles:Tenkuu Shinpan is at it’s best when any sense of realism is replaced with over the top absurdity. When it lets loose and just has fun with its premise and isn’t squeezing out some drama for drama's sake. It does stay light-hearted through a large portion of the show, but clearly also expects you to take it seriously when it tries to be. It should've been a full blown parody instead of being both zany and serious which just makes it jarring. The comedic parts we do have are not amazing, they didn’t land as gracefully as one might’ve hoped. Often missing and falling flat on impact. When it does land however, it’s quite funny, but not a worthy enough reward to sit through the whole thing in my eyes.Final Verdict:Well, at least the pacing wasn’t sluggish. But if you're not a pacing enthusiast or is actively looking for a time waster then there's isn't much to recommend it by. The show could, like I said, be slightly humorous when it embraces its own silliness. Although not enough to be worth the time spent on everything else.

I\'m really disappointed with all of the panty shots and ""transformations"" of the girls, it just felt gross to watch. Sad to see new shows still do that kind of stuff just to try and make it some kind of ""fan service"" when that\'s not what viewers are here for. Overall though the story is rather interesting at first, but looses its way after about 5 or so episodes. I wish the masked sniper had a better plot, there could have been a lot more to his character which is a big letdown ', 'This is my first review.  I’m going to be direct.I started watching anime thinking about giving it up.  Like other users, with 4 chapters it would have given him between a 2-4 grade.  But unlike them, I endured until the end, and now I give it a 10.Even the artistic theme, which I did not like very much, in the end seems very correct, an 8. I think people should see the entire anime and not  put a review just to see the first 4 chapters as some users say.If you like survival animes, and good plot with...mystery and psychological theme... you will like it.There is some things without sense... but it’s normal, if you want something different. And they help to enjoy the plot. mystery and psychological theme... you will like it.There is some things without sense... but it’s normal, if you want something different. And they help to enjoy the plot.', 'I watched this at the recommendation of a friend, who told me that it was one of the worst anime he had ever seen on Netflix, and boy did he turn out to be right. This show has so many issues, but just to name a few:-The death scenes are overly dramatic. This has been said many times before but it needs to be repeated: anime is a terrible medium for presenting gore and body horror because 2D animation is very limited in the amount of detail that can be realistically included. Increasing the amount of blood and screaming does not fix the problem, but...merely exposes it further.-The characters are boring and never have consistent traits or motivations. Seriously, I started noticing halfway through the series that I could not identify the personality traits of any of the main characters. They change whenever is convenient to advance the plot with no real character development.-There are tons of random panty shots + scenes featuring female characters getting their clothes cut in inappropriate places. The sheer amount of sexual immaturity on display makes me question whether or not this show was actually conceived and directed by adults.-Lots of plot details are poorly explained and when something is explained, it\'s often through dry exposition. (I\'ve heard this is partly a problem because the director cut out a bunch of early chapters from the manga, but I haven\'t read it. To be blunt, though, I strongly doubt I\'m missing out on anything of substance.)-There\'s an utterly pointless sexual assault scene in the first episode. (Why is this show so creepy, and not in a good way?)-The tone rapidly shifts between intense action scenes and much more lighthearted fare. To clarify, when I say ""rapidly"", what I mean is ""in a matter of 4 minutes or less."" This show gave me whiplash.Some of these issues are slightly toned down after the first two episodes, but you get the point. It\'s just not a good anime and you\'d be better off watching nearly any other show in the same genre. The character designs aren\'t memorable. Severe pacing issues are present throughout the series and the plot moves too fast for me to care about anything. The animation is decent, but that\'s the only positive I can think of. Unless you plan on watching High-Rise Invasion to see how bad it is, it\'s not worth your time. merely exposes it further.-The characters are boring and never have consistent traits or motivations.

Usually, I try to emphasize a parallel between my experiences and the qualities and defects of the show. However, I have to do it differently in these following paragraphs. This review is totally the outburst of a user who detested everything in 12 episodes of pure edgy and textual incoherence and today gives ""thanks to God"" for not having gone crazy with every minute that passed.Okay... I tried to like it. I swear that when I was looking at Winter 21\'s first list I visualized Tenkuu Shinpan as one...of the best animes of the year. But no, definitely not. It was an absurd discrepancy between expectation and final result. Such an inconstancy and such an abysmal difference, that Netflix should be ashamed to distribute this anime in its anime catalog. But that doesn\'t mean that the anime is totally horrible, right? WRONG!!! In this show, Yuri is the protagonist of the story, where the world is set up in a battle royale, but with no evident purpose. Seriously, everything that happens is crazy, between humans and masked people, where the purpose of humans is pure survival (of course, no one who has more than three neurons wants to die without even trying to want to live), while the masked ones... well, this is where most problems come in.  It is not as if they were not totally flawed, after all, they are commanded by someone, as an omnipotent God and controller of their own actions as servants. However, we have no knowledge of the context of the world, let alone the purpose of the masked. Some kill only humans, while others rebel with masked others. IT\'S CHAOS! The Sniper who starts the show with the goal of killing humans and becomes the protagonist\'s ally without much resistance, other extras with the goal of just offering a backpack and weapons to Yuri and Nise-chan, her ally, and a hundred more faces  identical and boring, where they have different and often suicidal goals.Oh, and I didn\'t mention Yuri\'s brother, Rika. Rika is living her days in other regions of the city, looking for more strong allies, to be able to conquer the power that can save this whole world from an even greater bloody catastrophe: being a God. What would it be like to be a God in this world? Well, to be a God you must first be an ""ally of God"", who awakens his power in different ways. Again, the shit of inconsistency is not helping. The very rules for being elected a higher class being are broken.  Even the way the power is manifested is a joke.  This happens on the show for the simple reason that there are no explanations. I particularly cannot even interpret the horrific episodes of ""masquerade of the day"" in a profitable way, much less will I care about scenes and dialogues of shitty and unexplored characters, who don\'t even have their name disclosed. Yes, Tenkuu Shinpan is so grotesque in terms of characters, that the name doesn\'t matter. At least, he is easily forgettable as the conversations took place...In addition, the entire cast does not support more than a trio. As I already mentioned the duo of brothers, there remains Nise-chan, another very pathetic character. She is the most cautious among the three and the one who most seeks to protect Yuri during the entire show. But it doesn\'t mean that she doesn\'t have a good character. She is superficial, just like Yuri and Rika, but she has had signs of bullying in her past. A nice flashback, if it weren\'t for the shit of the anime, not exploring any characters at all. What he misses as coherence and rhythm, he also misses the construction and character development itself.And here we are. After half the episodes, Yuri gains powers from ""God\'s allies"" and has superhuman abilities. It is not surprising that the anime would develop it up to that point, in fact, the great luck about it makes the show even more ridiculous. How can a character who has barely touched a gun in her life manage to do great in a fatal battle? Honestly, there are things that are easy for you to accept, but that\'s not the case with Tenkuu Shinpan.And what about ecchi? I know that anime doesn\'t have that tag, but many scenes simply try to promote an intimate relationship between the characters based on ... panties? Seriously, I honestly don\'t have the stomach to see this. Both Kuon, Yuri and Nise-chan participated in scenes where one is fearful and totally ashamed, the other has a cut in one corner of her uniform and Nise has her breastplate exposed, after having her shirt partially torn during  a fight.But one positive thing I can find on the horror show: the production. Tenkuu Shinpan was made by Studio Zero-G, which is not remembered for many incredible projects.  ""Tsugumomo"", ""Rikei Ga Koi"", \'My Roommate is a Cat ""and"" Grand Blue ""are the only most interesting shows and only in"" Tsugumomo ""can I speak well of the production, as a highlight for the show. Now,  Tenkuu Shinpan managed to be something similar. Obviously, in the Zero-G standard, it is evident that it is not of impeccable quality. It is still quite common and it is not different from most anime, but it is the only salvation that I can put to not  give the minimum score for this shit.Finally, this should not be seen by anyone. Don\'t be fooled by positive reviews about the manga. It is all a tremendous lie. ""Tower of God"" failed as world-building, ""Mirai Nikki"" failed as character-building, Tenkuu Shinpan managed to put the two shit out of two popular animes and did one of the worst shows of 2021. Honestly, I think there will be no other  anime that will disappoint me more than this. I remember still having an expectation of finding it good, since the manga is being sold physically in the country in which mode. It is a pity, a cruel and painful pain that will not be erased.

A good comparison might be the movie Dredd - just a killer, energized, increasingly entertaining piece, with a similar set up.This show borrows a bunch of stuff and has an overused idea, but it benefits greatly from its stripped-down aesthetic.  There's something awesome about the setting of empty skyscrapers.  It's almost like a stylistic beacon for the show, course-correcting everything, as if to tone down any cliche, soft dialogue, or panty shot.  The same goes for the masks and the ol' chess game between the detective-type strategic geniuses.  None of these...are groundbreaking ideas, but they work because everything is straight to the point.  It's like a cold shot of vodka.And eventually, the strong vibe gives the show time to coalesce and show off some uniqueness.  There are a few moments of humor that were just nonsensically hilarious.  The panty shots got worse and better at the same time.  And the plotting of the different factions eventually wove together pretty dam smoothly at the end.

Everything is too convenient. Since there is no character development, in order to keep something going for them there are just randomly thrown in convenient twists, as if the creators of the story just didn't want to bother coming up with smart plays for characters to use.2. Female characters have no personality and their sole purpose is to keep male viewer's attention through panty...and bra shots shots, as well as queer-baiting with some mildly lesbian scenes. It seems creators had an attempt to make it look like that's not the case by making them over-powered with convenient twists mentioned above, but well, didn't work.3.

Because the animation is fast pacing the manga version. But it's still great also the opening and closing is good also characters are good especially the ones wearing the mask."", ""Not recommended. The concept of the world in the anime is good, but because of the inconsistent characterization of the MC, it's very annoying to watch. There's no horror feeling at all, and the violent scenes are overly dramatized and uninteresting. The only thing I'm interested in is seeing Rika and Snape Mask meet; apart from that, I'm not interested in anything else. I thought they would meet in the end. The plot armor is very strong, to the point where the main character can suddenly gain new powers. There are too many ecchi scenes, even though the genre doesn't include ecchi; I had to...skip them while watching. The plot also feels very rushed. It might be better to read the manga instead of watching the anime. skip them while watching. The plot also feels very rushed.

It has an interesting storyline with great characters. I loved the concept of the sky rise buildings in a different realm where people killed to survive. The strong female characters were great as well. Before I watched this, I had heard that the overuse of fan service ruined the show. However, upon watching the show, I noticed there was not that much fan service to really clash with the storyline. There was the occasional panty shot here and there but it did not affect the overall story. I loved...the comedic and flirty scenes; it balanced out the suspense and horror well.

Tenkuu Shinpan\'s downfall primarily comes from the uninspired sound design, repetitive/boring music, poor (dubbed) voice cast and disjointed story.The promising aspects do derive from some action sequences, but combining everything with a huge cast of uninspired character tropes - just leaves everything feeling flat.I believe this series would\'ve faired better with a darker approach, but instead it aims more for the cheap fan-service and awkward sexual tension between the 2 leading characters.

The series tells the story of Yuri, a high school student who finds herself in a world of skyscrapers connected by suspended bridges, where she must escape from masked men who want to kill her or make her commit suicide. Her goal is to reach the tallest tower in the city, where she hopes to find her older brother.The anime presents itself as a thriller, horror, and splatter with elements of action and mystery, but it fails to convince for several reasons.First of all, I\'ll start with a small rant: the ending of the...series spoils the identity of the sniper-mask, thus ruining the one and only mysterious character in the series. This is an example of how the anime lacks attention to direction and scriptwriting.Everything is based on excessive and out-of-place fan service, making the female protagonists sexual objects and diminishing their credibility as real characters in a series of this kind.Furthermore, the characters are stereotyped in a very crude manner. The protagonist will meet a girl at the beginning of the series, and from the way she dresses and her hair color and style, you\'ll know exactly how she will behave and what her role will be in the story, failing to evoke empathy or interest from the viewer. The plot is inconsistent, borrowing elements from other more famous works and not explaining the motivations behind the characters\' actions very well.The positives of the work are few and not enough to save the product.

The next thing she knows, she\'s on top of a building in the middle of a city, and people are trying to kill each other.On one side, we have the ordinary people, like Yuri, and on the other, we have the Masks (or the Angels, as they\'re actually named). The Masks were once ordinary people, until they were brainwashed by the code on the inside of the masks they wear, and turned into little more than killing machines. (Except when they...don\'t, because they\'re defective, or enhance you, or just take their own sweet time activating.) Their goal is to kill those without masks--or rather, force them past the point of despair (no, Monokuma, go away. This has nothing to do with you), and cause them to jump off the edges of the buildings and kill themselves. The longer those not wearing masks survive, the closer they come to God.You see, the world they find themselves in is something like an alternate universe, and they\'re all vying to become God, and have a wish granted (Battle Royale meets Mirai Nikki meets panty shots every few minutes? Okay, sure.)Now, the premise sounds simple enough, except that...it\'s not. We never really get any answers to what the hell is going on. Who brought them all there? Who created that world they\'re in? HOW was it created? What happened to escaping by helicopter? What\'s the point of it all? Why are some masks defective? How do they choose who plays the game? Of those players, how do they choose who becomes an Angel, and who is a regular player? Why do the regular players have to commit suicide by jumping off a building? Why does it seem like everyone is filled with tomato juice? (Seriously, the blood effects in this show are riDONKulous. There are fountains of tomato juice breaking out everywhere.) How many Angels are there? Who is the mysterious voice that sometimes talks to the players? Why do some players get powers, and others don\'t? Who determines who gets what powers? How are the powers given to the players? Does the code alter their genetic makeup somehow? How can it do that?And most importantly, WHY DO THEY ALWAYS LOOK AT THE CODE?! Seriously, if the code is embedded on the inside of the mask, just close your eyes when you put the mask on. Once it\'s up against your face, you shouldn\'t be able to see the code anymore. Seriously, this bugged me SO DAMN MUCH.And these are just the questions I came up with off the top of my head. Yes, this is just a one-cour anime, and it\'s clearly left open-ended for a second season, but there shouldn\'t be THIS many questions remaining at the end.Okay, that\'s my little mini-rant finished. Moving on.The art is...okay; it\'s nothing special, but I didn\'t find anything horrible about it, either, excluding the aforementioned tomato juice explosions and the gratuitous panty-shots. Like, seriously, the panty-shots are... Well, for example, one of the characters identifies another character not by her hair, or by the clothes she\'s wearing. How does she identify her? ""Oh, I recognize those panties!"" I\'m not kidding.One thing that did bother me was with the hair of one of the characters. She has blue hair that fades into pink, and where the gradient starts changes from shot to shot. Sometimes it\'s up at her shoulders, other times it\'s towards the bottom of her back. CONSISTENCY, PEOPLE.Most of the NUMEROUS characters in this show are utterly forgettable, and the only ones I really remember are Yuri, the main character, Mayuko Nise, Yuri\'s enemy-turned-friend (and the one who identified Yuri by her panties), Kuon Shinzaki (the girl whose hair is constantly changing), and Sniper Mask another enemy-turned-reluctant ally, who is by far the best character in this show.Not only is Sniper Mask absolutely badass, but he also has a charming personality, even when he has very few memories of who he was before putting on the mask.This anime had some promise, even though it brought to mind several other things that have been done before, some better, some worse, but it\'s not the worst way to kill some time.

So I read the manga to find out what happened in the end, and it was pretty much what i expected.Survival/battle royale genre have some of the most entertaining concepts. This one also has a good shlock concept. People killing each other on rooftops. But like most of the animes/mangas in this genre, Tenkuu Shinpan fell into same fatal mistakes. First one is, giving unncessary complicated and tragic back stories to pretty much every character in the anime/manga. This is essentially Fortnite anime, people dont care about woman in the nurse outfit...was mean to elderly or guy in gimp suit had cancer before they magically transport to rooftop world. They want people kill each other with creative and gorey ways. What you should do is, giving your 2-3 main characters somewhat interesting backstory so your viewer/reader relate/root for them and leave the rest one dimensional so your story would be smooth. In a genre like this, smooth storytelling keeps audience busy and dont spoil the entertainment. Second mistake is, adding an overly complicated philosophical main plot that they reveal slowly as if it was a plot twist. This kind of mistakes just prove that writing is really hard. You can come up with a good concept but if you are a hack and sloopy writer, your story fall apart really easy. This is what happened in here. When you look from above, it looks like a full block of cheese but when it is on your sight, you realise it as a block of swiss cheese, full of holes. I dont like to say `overly ambitious` but it kinda is.In general, quality of animation is decent, soundtrack is OK, VA is good. There are lots of fan service which is a MUST in this genre. So if you like survival game and gore, you will have a good time. If you are not into it, just pass. You wont miss much. was mean to elderly or guy in gimp suit had cancer before they magically transport to rooftop world. They want people kill each other with creative and gorey ways.

The only interesting part was rika and the sniper mask, also yuri was wayyyyy more annoying in the anime like bruh, she was somewhat annoying in the manga, but i was able to get use to her and enjoy her character but in the anime i wanted to fucking bleach my eyes and rip my ears off everytime she did something or started screaming, her character was just not interesting or funny at all, BUT i want everyone to just read the manga, its very good well id give it a ""7"" its not the greatest but its not bad very enjoyable skip the anime unless you want to see rika and sniper mask in action. Dont get mad at my opinion you might like the anime but if you ever read the manga you would understand why the manga is better i wanted to enjoy the anime since im more of an anime only type, but i do read a little bit of manga and high rise just so happened to be the one i read, the anime is BAD, but its okay just blame it on netflix, move on and go read the manga the subbed was better and thoroughly watched the anime, the pacing was somewhat fast too fast, so i honestly just recommend reading the manga.

For this reason I rate High Rise Invasion a 4.', ""After finishing High-Rise Invasion, I have a lot of mixed feelings.The plot itself is actually pretty good and I found myself extremely intrigued by it. The Masks were all stunning, with most of them based on horror tropes that were pretty easily identifiable, and I enjoyed the aspect of it. The idea of the dystopian world was intriguing and, for me, brand new and I really enjoyed it. I found a majority of the characters relatable in a way and found myself binge watching it with ease. The psychological horror was very apt, and although it pulled from some overused tropes, it was still enjoyable....Now, usually, that would be enough for me to turn around and easily give it a 9/10, maybe an 8.But I cannot get past the fan service. I can't. The series is absolutely diluted with it, making your cup of juice taste like water with a single drop of flavoring and making your brain shudder at the mixed signals coming through.The plot was strong enough.

A girl got thrown into an alternate world with masked killers and now she and her new friends had to get out and return to the real world.What I liked about the series was the premise. It’s not the most unique as Netflix just released a series similar to this called “Alice in Borderland.” However, there’s still good enough world building and competition to make me invested. Some of the characters were also good. The sniper character was very cool and I was invested in his story of rediscovering his identity. Also for most action scenes there was one...musical score used, and the score was quite dope and gave some excitement to the fight.However, this series has many problems. Even though the animation was pretty good, the actions were mostly boring and ended too quickly. This took away the rush and excitement at the beginning of each fight. There were too many characters for only 12 episodes, with many were irrelevant and some just popped up out of nowhere. There wasn’t enough time to invest in this many characters. Also, the main protagonist was pretty bland and generic for a shounen. There wasn’t anything unique to her character.Overall, it’s an alright action horror fantasy anime, but I still look forward to season 2. 6/10 musical score used, and the score was quite dope and gave some excitement to the fight.However, this series has many problems.

Well its her fucking brother.Now this boils down into why Netflix anime is so bad and they will never get it. This was a flier, they threw away money on cuties, they honestly dont care about profit, this is just another one in the wheel of garbage they churn out. They will take a beloved IP, and they will completely fuck it up. Hey you liked Death Note? How about Light is an edgy teenager named Sean and L is some dumbass black guy? Hey you liked Kengan Asura? How about we make it in CGI and don't focus on fight scenes?Netflix will never get it, they will never understand.

It had mediocre story and everything was so blah.Fist of the story. It sounded interesting, waking up in the different world were you would be chased by monsters. Kinda reminded me of backrooms but more interesting because there was skyscrapers. Well was it interesting? Did it had story that made me want to watch more? No. It had very mediocre story with very predictable twists. It...had idea but the studio or Netflix didn't go for it.It also was very uncomfortable to watch. There were so many boob or panty shots. I don't like them. To me it feels weird to sexualize characters who maybe aren't 18. Of course I am not sure but still the characters wear school uniforms and just are okay with their boobs hanging around half the show.The art was too colorful, too romance anime type. It didn't feel like a horror or thriller anime, it needed the depth of colors. Maybe different color theory would have looked better, more darker or sickly. I did like the gory parts tho because the screen would go black and white with only the blood showing. And also the backgrounds and places that the characters were, were really hard to make sense.So the sound of this series was weird. The music always switched in weird places or didn't go with the moment. It just didn't match. Some songs were okay, like the action music, but some were weird.The characters were okayish. I liked the sniper mask, he probably was the only character I liked. Kinda liked the two female main characters because they were kinda gayish but they didn't have much character building. And then the other characters that popped up just somewhere felt unnecessary and bland. I liked the mask/angels and their designs because I haven't seen so many interesting design choices.I didn't enjoy the series. It was okay to watch, but I didin't feel anything after I watched it.

I just started watching because my family randomly decided on something to watch together...I must admit that the initial chapter kept me comparing this to other similar works such as Alice in Borderland, Maze Runner, Hunger games and I wasn\'t much into it. However, as the story progresses it manages to keep you interested and engaged. Tenkuu Shinpan does add interesting twist to the story, with people being trapped in skyscrapers connected through bridges, the different types of masks and their meaning and differentiating ""participants"". While watching this I was reminded...of why I HATE watching on going stuff...there are so many questions left: what is this world? who created it? why did the people in there get chosen to be there? why do cellphones work if ""Participants"" are not in their real world? why were masks created? what is the purpose of all this? what makes a person ""God candidate"" (meaning, what criteria is taken into account to give someone a mouthless mask?), what determines the God candidates\' progress and strengths?All in all, not a jaw dropping show but definitely interesting...so much so, that I will be reading the manga with the hopes of finding answers to my questions. Great cliff hanger at the end.I liked the twist given with Sniper Mask and Rika apparently being friends. At first I thought Sniper Mask was Yuri\'s brother.*side note:-no idea as to why the high focus on women\'s underwear?-why high schoolers as protagonists?Art 8/10This anime looks pretty cool to me.Sound 7/10Nothing to highlight in this area, but it was OK.Characters 7/10I think the anime counts with a wide array of characters, which keeps things interesting.I did find Yuri a bit annoying and clumsy at times, but overall, she is a good female lead character as she is very proactive, strong and resourceful. I like that she is quick to take action as opposed to being a damsel in distress. I like Mayuko for the same reasons. Now, can somebody explain to me why was Kuon the one chosen to be able to control the big gun-building? She is very powerful, but she is completely useless in combat. I can\'t say I dislike her though. Talking about Kuon bring to mind one of my favorite characters, Sniper Mask. I am completely intrigued by this character, not only because we have been purposely unable to see his face, but because of his journey. He himself has no clue about his past or who he is. I also liked he seems to be smart and resourceful. An also intriguing character is Kusakabe, with having a child and all. I so want to know how they got separated.Along with Sniper Mask, Rika is also one of my favorites. He seems to also be strong, resourceful and with a strong will.

Trying my best to avoid any spoilers, I can tell you that the character\'s personalities and their morals are all over the place. Yuri Honjou is a typical high school teenager who reacts somewhat as you\'d expect when she is transported...into the Skyscraper World (does it even have a name? I may have missed it), she is scared and confused.However, just like a robot, she changes completely as the situation needs it. She quickly observes the ""rules"" and the masked people\'s behavior, draws a correct conclusion, gets her hand on some weapons and easily kills in cold blood any masked people who stand in her path. Instant convenient adaptation.When she meets Mayuko Nise things get even weirder: Let’s just say this character’s actions would make anyone who has some sort of moral compass instantly hate her. She is cruel, unforgiving and edgy, probably a fan of Tanya von Degurechaff (that hair, uh? Guess morals as well lol). Yuri has a good justification to kill her on the spot, but she not only refuses it, she saves her life. Mayuko completely changes after that into a “good kawaii anime girl” from the power of kindness and friendship. Who would\'ve guessed that murderers just need a panty shot and a hug to become a good person?Maybe it\'s part of the story that the bad people and the masked people we see were good people before this strange world corrupted them, but it just feels weird. Seeing that guy who had no qualms about murdering innocent people just an episode ago suddenly being portrayed in a good light as one of the Good Guys as if he was as kind as Yuri or Kuon is honestly quite insulting. Kuon is perhaps the most adorable of the characters, and ironically, her stereotype of a carefree, gentle and pure person ends up leaving her as one of the most consistent personalities in the whole story.The opening and ending sequences are pretty good and are likely part of the charm that kept me from dropping the show (and I guess the potential for a good story that ended up not existing). Despite the (IMO) bad writing, the character\'s designs are pretty damn cool, although I wished to see Yuri using other firearms instead of just revolvers and pistols, something tells me that rifles would look pretty nice on her, (doesn’t seem that far off considering one of the masked enemies had a M32A1 grenade launcher).Sound design is okay, although the same sound effects are easily recognizable due to how often they are used, a particular “zyooon!” noise was used during rail guns firing, kicks, cannon balls, rifle shots and handgun shots and I’m only mentioning this because it can get distracting, and kinda funny.I can’t recommend this one for anyone who wants to feel immersed in a good story with decently-written characters, Tenkuu Shinpan is a good anime to pass the time when you’re bored or when you have nothing else to watch during a snack, but it is extremely forgettable. I’d even dare say that Highschool of the Dead has better-written characters, and if you are not a fan of that one, you’ll likely not be one of Tenkuu Shinpan.My first review on this website, I\'m too lazy to write reviews for every anime I watched in my life, so starting with the ones I just recently watched seems fair. into the Skyscraper World (does it even have a name?

If you've watched Hunter X Hunter, picture this anime just like that, except with girl MC's. There's a Gon, and there's a Killua. There's also a Leorio, Kurapica, and it's exactly like their cast.2. Picture the setting as the Phantom Troupe in HxH. One group vs the other.3. Actual Elements:- Those who wear the mask are then controlled.- This will inevitably be an anime that revolves around the wearing of a mask, and those...who are able to break said mask can become free. It's a wild ride I will say that much, and there are few psychological elements for some of the MC's, which really help keep the atmosphere of this anime HIGH and MIGHTY.4. There are unfortunately some ecchi moments, but don't be alarmed, they are expected, and sometimes cute.5. There are tidbits here and there of incredible moments with outstanding characters having a direct impact on the flow of the anime. It's really nice, as it were moments that were truly unexpected.Overall, this is an anime to watch if you're interested in...- Dark pasts (that begin to become uncovered throughout the anime)- Psychological aspects (Things that mess with the minds)- Action- Chaotic characters (those that view justice but have a sick mental)- Adorable Characters (Think of Ran Mao from Kuroshitsuji, or just characters that obey)- Killugon aspect (friend level) or past that (Yuri, it's implied but not directly). who are able to break said mask can become free.

If I had found it on an anime site, I would have immediately dropped it.So many panty shots, bad depiction of boobs in clothes, and cliche lines. Why do the characters even have to have some sort of connection between each other? And was the anime made in a way so that the MC and her sidekick kind of has borderline gay vibes going on because it's going to be on Netflix? Or is it just pure coincidence that it turned out this way?The only cool character in the anime is the sniper with the mask...that you will get to see straight up from Episode 1. Throw the rest of them in the trash lolFun fact: The main character's thighs increasingly grow in size the more episodes you're in.Did I have way too high of an expectation going into this???? that you will get to see straight up from Episode 1.

The thing is, the anime takes the sweet and cool style the manga art has and turns it into colorful boring stuff you'll see in any other badly animated Netflix anime, the story feels dull here and the characters are boring.I got tired so I'll just say it, read the manga first, you'll enjoy it way more.

Must have been cheap for them to pick up. like Netflix are dubbing trash like this instead of so many shows that deserve more. Must have been cheap for them to pick up.', 'Coming from highly praised animes to such an Original Net(flix) Animation was a harsh reality check.Indeed while this anime is not really outstanding it fails at conveying the mood and setup it originally intended to , and that right after a few minutes of the first episode.To sum it up really shortly before going into a deeper analysis : this show has an interesting plot and that\'s all it has got. Animation and drawings are neat while being quite average , OSTs and the OP are bland , the characters could have been quite interesting however this anime suffers from the ""add more characters to...a point you don\'t know who is with who"" syndrome.TL;DR : if you\'re looking for some fan service and a decent plot while overlooking every other aspects you could get a decent experience. However don\'t get into this anime if you\'re looking for a thrilling or above average experience.Now for those of you craving for a deeper analysis , there we go:Story : plot is really promising , having a survival game taking place on high buildings appears to be a quite an original setting when compared to your generic survival anime. However right after the beginning and a brief explanation of how the whole world works , it does not get further than this.While some development occur - I am talking about the different masks and type of enemies- the pacing makes the discoveries really bland and lacking surprises.In the end you hardly get you blood rushing or shivers when a new mechanics of the game appears : it all seems generic.The overall plot would be ""onee chan wants to meet onii chan while making as much friend as possible and killing the bad enemies"".Furthermore this anime is trying to set up a horror atmosphere , however it fails at showing the whole pain of death as side characters are easily discarded without any emotion or fear. Part of this is because of fan servicing and the comedy aspect poorly implemented : if the anime wants to be taken as a horror genre while being funny and having a bit of ecchi it should at least make sure to separate those different genres. Having horror mixed up with ecchi is acceptable when the victims are fearing for their lives -and are to be sexually abused- however horror mixed with comedy without being cynical is just a really bad mix.With that said I am pretty sure that having the mood set up in a better way and the pacing slower would have made this anime more enticing.As such I advise people to read the manga as 150 chapters have been adapted in course of only 12 episodes : it indeed feels quite rushed.Finally I decided to give a 6/10 for the story as it is original but fails to get on top of that.Art : nothing particuliar to say about that , it consistent but really lacking a soul. The anime reminds me of a generic pre 2010\'s seinen : meaning dull characters\' drawing and a repetitive environment.On the last point it appears to be quite a shame considering that there exists different places in the world that could have been explored : not all buildings are the same especially in such developed city as Tokyo. Although it is clearly shown that singularities exist within the building themselves.On the animation it is neat but really lacking a soul : it is fluid but really fails at giving weight to the weapons or proper emotions to the characters. This is explained by too few facial expressions and fighting animations : a scared expression appears the same as a neutral one and moves are basics and repetitive.The real weak point of animation are the fights , although it should have been a strong point as this anime aims at being a horror/survival type , having generic fights with only a few frames is really disappointing! For instance BTOOM being in the same type of genre while not being overwhelming , deals better with the animation and drawings during combats. An other point is guns are just inconsistent sometimes their animation is really over the top and other times they appear as pea shooters.Having blank scenery is acceptable however with such a plot having so poor fighting animation and expression is just a lackluster.With that said CGI is implemented in a really convincing way in this anime which appears as the only good point I could find.As a result I gave a 4/10 , don\'t get me wrong it is neat but really underwhelming and disappointing for such a scenario.Sound : here too , nothing much to say : generic OP/ED and a quite absent OST which would have helped into setting the mood and even differentiating when the anime aims to be funny , ecchi or horrific.A missed opportunity translated as a 2/10 and I am being really generous.Character : as promising as the plot appeared to be on the first episode , the characters right of the bat were giving out what kind of anime it would be. While Seiyuus really did a good job at delivering the characters\' emotions the animation not following up really undermined their performance and did not serve them justice.With Seiyuus such as Fukuyama Jun from Code Geass - to mention only one anime feat- really fits the role of the villain controlling people - such as in Code Geass- however the animation made him look like your generic villain : trampling over his reputation as far as I am concerned. Really I cannot praise enough the seiyuus for the job they made and feel very sorry that their talent went to waste.Now for the characters themselves , you have your generic Yuri - Honjo- girl looking for her onii chan and her tsundere sidekick. Here as well the anime really failed a interesting opportunity by pacing it too fast : building their relationship during a longer span a time would have been better than your usual : ""you saved me imma worship you now and I\'ll love you in secret"" type of scenario.The mentioned onii chan appears to be a better a character however the lack of development makes him really only interesting and nothing really engaging.Now for the allied factions such as Rikuya they appear to be quite interesting but they are not explored at all.Kuon\'s side seems more appealing while herself is really uninteresting - your typical Ojou sama- her guardian Mister Sniper is really the main dish of this anime : he is your mister badass of the plot , Umehara Uchiro as his seiyuu is really a fitting choice. However here too the lack of screen exposure really does leave us with craving more explanation about his condition. Nevertheless I should praise the anime by not revealing his face and slip that he is a good looking man -reminds me of Goblin Slayer.The villain as said previously while being interpreted by your nonetheless Fukuyama Jun is really lacking any characteristics which is really unfitting of such a performance.Now something really singular that I noted is how fast the characters switch emotions : doubting that they are crazy I don\'t think that any credible character can change their mind so fast considering the situation they are in. To give an example our main heroine sees a woman die right in front of her at the beginning of the anime , kills a few people and does not seem much affected by it. Although there happens to be some reflection the pacing makes it appear as frivolous. If it were a light hearted anime I would not have minded that in comedy anime however with such a dark plot I would have expected more consequences on the psychological aspect of the characters. In the end characters appear as inconsistent.As for the overall characters drawing , as mentioned in the art part they really lack distinctive signs and really appear as the relics of a previous generation of animes.As such I attributed a 5/10 only to praise the seiyuus otherwise the anime while being neat does not stand out and does not even indicate that it is recent and a Netflix flagship.Enjoyment : while being bad in multiple categories , enjoyment is the category where the anime gets a fair point. To be honest the plot is so engaging that one ends up binge watching the anime : as such the episodes seem very slow on useless parts but very short in action scenes. The plot , voice actors and Sniper san carry the whole anime.For that I give the show a fair mark of 7/10.Overall : right after a few minute the environment , the characters , the absent OST , the mediocre OP and the underwhelming fight scenes gives the tone of the overall anime. Although the seiyuus and the plot try to raise up the level, it clearly appears that the anime is just not fitting the original work. Going into the anime for a mindless enjoyment and listening to your favorite seiyuus is acceptable however getting into it for a thrilling experience will leave you with a bitter aftertaste. Going for the source element would be a nice solution in my opinion : nothing would be lost as the animation and OST are mediocre.In overall by making an average of the marks it gives a 6/10 which appears appropriate. a point you don\'t know who is with who"" syndrome.TL;DR : if you\'re looking for some fan service and a decent plot while overlooking every other aspects you could get a decent experience.

Through all media, Netflix has given us A LOT of variations of that same theme. This anime was no different. Just like ""Alice In Borderland"", which got adapted by Netflix past year, this anime reveals no new story. It\'s again about some characters who suddenly find themselves in a ""kill or be killed"" world. Of course, none of these characters know how or when did they get to that ""world"". The built of characters is extremely poor if not pathetic, and the story is almost none...existing with such loose way of writing. The soundtrack is almost laughable as the music suddenly turns from sad to happy, almost immediately, in a dreadful try to keep up with unbalanced cuts and unprofessional story line. The art of this anime is bad at best since some frames and the body shape of the characters somehow looked super distorted even if they were standing straight. From the first episode, one can notice that the heroine of the story stood like she had some sort of knock-knees Genu valgum which made the art look absolutely dull. This anime cannot and will NOT immerse viewers into it without any good story, art or character building. The only thing I felt watching this anime is the excessive extra push of the same theme, ""kill or be killed"", by the same production company; Netflix.The overall rating for this anime for me is barely 1, and, of course, I\'m not waiting for a season two of this appalling production. existing with such loose way of writing.

The theme of people losing their personality and consciousness after putting on a mask and being forced to follow orders was something surprising. When we later learn about the candidates for god, we slowly begin to understand what this may be about. We meet various characters and their motives, the real world is brutal and people with different pasts come here. When it comes to the characters, the honestly masked sniper is a character I wanted to watch, the rest have their pros and cons. The main character, however, often changes her character, which...makes her somewhat vague; compared to her companion, she was simply bland, and the fact that she gained strength towards the end makes her even more indifferent to the viewer.I rate the anime as good, but the ecchi scenes were exaggerated for a series that is not of this genre.

Although some elements of the classic plot of 'being trapped in another world and having to fight' were a bit generic, as the story progressed, each episode introduced new twists and mysteries that kept me wanting to see more.I found the art style to be very clean and aesthetically pleasing, the anime girls are adorable, and the masked villains each have their own unique flavours and occupations.At only 12 episodes long, it's a short, exciting, and...worthwhile watch! worthwhile watch!"", 'I really tried to finish this anime, but after 8 episodes it wasn\'t getting any better and I started to realize that I was only torturing myself. So no, I didn\'t finish it, but that doesn\'t stop me from disliking it to the point of complaining about it. Just like when you eat some really salty peach pie; you feel disgusted, you throw up, and you complain to the establishment, because... Well... You paid to eat that. So, how horrible is Tenkuu Shinpan? Oh boy, hold on to your seats.I loved the premise of this show, I really did. I went into it expecting something...akin to Battle Royale (maybe that was my downfall) and what I got was one of the worst experiences of my life. So where do I start? I\'ll start with the decent aspects, since there are so few:The art is passable. It\'s bad for the most part, but it gets the job done. Plus, there are some nice character designs (emphasis on ""some"") which got me saying to myself ""hmmm, cool"". And, along with the art, there\'s the voice acting which is okay; nothing to right home about, with the exception of the main character (Yuri), whose\'s voice is all over the place. It\'s like they didn\'t know if they wanted her to talk like a ""dumb hot girl"" who is always overly excited and emotional or a smart and calculating tipe, because the way she speaks is all over the place.Aaaand speaking of Yuri, let\'s talk about the characters (if you can even call them that). There is zero development to any of the characters. Yuri goes from a dumb scaried girl who doesn\'t know how to handle a gun to a dumb brave girl whose weapon handling is on par with John Wick, it\'s ridiculous. The only character semingly interesting is the masked sniper, but any interest surrounding his mystery dies as quickly as the interest in the series as a whole. And then there\'s Mayuko... A cold blood murderer who kills innocent people begging for theirs lives on the very first episode. And guess what? The anime wants us to care about her and sympathize with her, because... She\'s been bullied as a child, guys!! Oh no! Poor girl, what a sad life she\'s led; that totally excuses murdering innocent people... Not! This was one of the most pathetic examples of a character I\'ve ever seen. How do you want me to care about someone like that? That was the main reason I couldn\'t even enjoy the anime as a ""so bad it\'s good"" type of thing, unfortunately, because I only got disgusted.Well, that was long, but now there\'s the story and its many, many, many continuity errors. I\'ve read on forums that they\'ve rushed the production and jampacked a bunch of chapters in a single episode, thus cutting a lot of information and character introductions, which it shows. When the story isn\'t revolving around Yuri, it\'s revolving around her brother, but that\'s where you\'ll start to scratch your head in confusion. Character\'s appear out of nowhere without a single introduction, and the anime acts like it doesn\'t matter, always; you\'ll pause and think ""wait, where did those people come from?"", but there isn\'t an answer, you\'ll just have to bear with it. And, apart from that, people get items seldom out of nowhere, like cellphones (which the fact they didn\'t have one was a big deal) with no explanation whatsoever.Thus, while the story\'s concept is good, it\'s so poorly executed it makes me laugh. What was interesting in the first episode quickly becomes a bore, and they start throwing characters and concepts at you without ever explaining the ones that came before. There are so many subplots it\'s jarring, and then you quickly realize how pointless and meaningless they are, and that the main plot isn\'t far from that.And this leaves us with something I truly despise: fanservice. This anime relies a LOT on fanservice, be it pantyshots, gratuitous ""rape scenes"", jiggling boobs, clothes being slashed and torn... It takes you out of anything remotely serious and interesting. It\'s hard to take the story they\'re trying to tell seriously when they keep throwing ass and panties in your face, which is a reminder of another serious foul this anime commits: the tone is all over the place. The series don\'t know if it\'s a mystery, a comedy, a gruesome gory-fest, or an ecchi, and it\'s infuriating.Well... In short: Horrible anime with horrible characters and poorly executed story. Watch if you\'re a masochist, want to laugh along with your friends at how ridiculous it is or are having a drinking game. akin to Battle Royale (maybe that was my downfall) and what I got was one of the worst experiences of my life. So where do I start? I\'ll start with the decent aspects, since there are so few:The art is passable. It\'s bad for the most part, but it gets the job done. Plus, there are some nice character designs (emphasis on ""some"") which got me saying to myself ""hmmm, cool"". And, along with the art, there\'s the voice acting which is okay; nothing to right home about, with the exception of the main character (Yuri), whose\'s voice is all over the place. It\'s like they didn\'t know if they wanted her to talk like a ""dumb hot girl"" who is always overly excited and emotional or a smart and calculating tipe, because the way she speaks is all over the place.Aaaand speaking of Yuri, let\'s talk about the characters (if you can even call them that). There is zero development to any of the characters. Yuri goes from a dumb scaried girl who doesn\'t know how to handle a gun to a dumb brave girl whose weapon handling is on par with John Wick, it\'s ridiculous. The only character semingly interesting is the masked sniper, but any interest surrounding his mystery dies as quickly as the interest in the series as a whole. And then there\'s Mayuko... A cold blood murderer who kills innocent people begging for theirs lives on the very first episode. And guess what? The anime wants us to care about her and sympathize with her, because... She\'s been bullied as a child, guys!! Oh no! Poor girl, what a sad life she\'s led; that totally excuses murdering innocent people... Not! This was one of the most pathetic examples of a character I\'ve ever seen. How do you want me to care about someone like that? That was the main reason I couldn\'t even enjoy the anime as a ""so bad it\'s good"" type of thing, unfortunately, because I only got disgusted.Well, that was long, but now there\'s the story and its many, many, many continuity errors. I\'ve read on forums that they\'ve rushed the production and jampacked a bunch of chapters in a single episode, thus cutting a lot of information and character introductions, which it shows. When the story isn\'t revolving around Yuri, it\'s revolving around her brother, but that\'s where you\'ll start to scratch your head in confusion. Character\'s appear out of nowhere without a single introduction, and the anime acts like it doesn\'t matter, always; you\'ll pause and think ""wait, where did those people come from?"", but there isn\'t an answer, you\'ll just have to bear with it. And, apart from that, people get items seldom out of nowhere, like cellphones (which the fact they didn\'t have one was a big deal) with no explanation whatsoever.Thus, while the story\'s concept is good, it\'s so poorly executed it makes me laugh. What was interesting in the first episode quickly becomes a bore, and they start throwing characters and concepts at you without ever explaining the ones that came before. There are so many subplots it\'s jarring, and then you quickly realize how pointless and meaningless they are, and that the main plot isn\'t far from that.And this leaves us with something I truly despise: fanservice. This anime relies a LOT on fanservice, be it pantyshots, gratuitous ""rape scenes"", jiggling boobs, clothes being slashed and torn... It takes you out of anything remotely serious and interesting.

It's more of a comedy than anything else, and when you watch it through that lens, it's really enjoyable.I had zero expectations for this anime, and it exceeded all expectations as the show went on.The characters are interesting, the rules of the universe are interesting.

Another death game to become god, dont get me wrong i love anime with this concept but it just wasn't done great imo. The fan service was unnecessary for a death game type of show, i dont think they were trying to set a serious tone for the show but i feel if they had it would have been a bit better.The character design i really liked, i loved how the mask design looked and the girl characters as...well. The thing i had a problem with was how Mayu and Yuri were willing to die for each other even after knowing the other person for a day or two, i mean i get it bc at first that was the only person they had with them but still. There was a theme of characters willing to trust one another fairly quickly too.The art was really pretty no complaints about this part of the showthe sound was pretty good i enjoyed the ending more than the opening for this animeThe story was fair enough, they focused on the plot which was interesting enough to want to keep watching the next episode.Overall i gave this a four which in my case im calling a 4 decent. It left off showing us there will possibly be a second season, now will i watch it im not sure yet. I recommend watching if you enjoy death game anime it is entertaining ill give it that but is it the best death game anime out there i would have to say no. well.

So the story was actually pretty interesting. I’ve always enjoyed the survival horror battle royale feel for animes. You are introduced to a girl called Yuri, and she turns from damsel in distress to a fighter. So having a goal for everyone to reach, to turn into gods. From what I’ve seen, it sounds like once you turn into a God, you’re able to mold the world how do you see fit. Pretty straightforward premise. There’s also a second option to escape the world completely. In this new world, they are mask-controlled fighters with the sole objective to...cause the survivors to be pushed to death. Whoever is wearing one of these masks is granted special abilities or physical abilities. The story does leave a lot to be desired and has you questioning what the purpose of this whole game is. But because the story is so straight to the point, it really helps you stay engaged in the story.ArtThe art isn’t really anything special. Most of the time, it looks like they’re trying to save money by having the characters minimize their movements, so they don’t have to animate as much. There will be times when you actually get to see them put forth a good effort during certain special scenes and certain fan service shots. Which, of course, I’m all for that.SoundThe sound also falls into the same category. It isn’t awe-inspiring most of the time. Some of the sound effects seem more exaggerated and don’t really fit what was sometimes happening. When bodies hit the ground, there’s a weird watermelon explosion sound effect that feels like it’s over the top. I will say I enjoyed the music in the opening cut scene, it was relatively good, and even the closing credits music was fine. And I think the route they did a really good job with the English dub as well.CharactersThe characters are what really keep me coming back to the show. Yuri is kind of your copy-paste main protagonist, but she shares all the good qualities. The supporting cast characters are outstanding, though. I loved Mayuko's Character design with her interactions with the main character. The instant attraction she made with Yuri, made her care design a little bit more charming. Mayuko doesn’t rely on people and normally sees the bad in people 1st. But when Yuri risked her life for Mayuko, She saw the good in people and immediately drop her goals so Yuri could accomplish hers.OverallI really enjoyed the anime, but I did notice a few problems I didn’t like. There are many times where the mask would openly try to kill someone without even given the survivors the chance to be suicidal, which went against the entire premise of the masking job. They also stated that if you try to take off the mask, it would command you to kill yourself or either harm the mask user. But there’s been plenty of times with the mask users would openly take off their mask and put it right back on, and it had no effects. Even Mayuko, what kills people without any hesitation. And then she would turn into a Defenseless character all because she saw a severed head. Even the other supporting character, Kuon Would have no idea how to use her powers and then immediately figure out that she can control the towers laserbeam.  Just a lot of things that didn’t really add up cause the survivors to be pushed to death. Whoever is wearing one of these masks is granted special abilities or physical abilities.

So call me a SM simp :(Personally, I feel as if it\'s a good story, just poorly executed. There are some very intriguing characters and a wonderfully interesting world concept but the writing feels too rushed. If they had taken their time, I\'m sure this anime would have been not just /good/ but /great./The humor and panty shots were a bit much though as they were just 16-year-old girls.Do not try and...hit me up with ""but at this age, they can blahblahblahblah."" I understand that and that this can be considered ""echi"" anime but it is going out of its way to sexualize /16/ year old girls. If they had been 18 it would have been more acceptable.As for the ENG Dub voice acting, I couldn\'t believe that some parts even made it out of editing stages but that\'s to be expected of some if not all ENG dubs. Except Jonah Scott\'s voice acting for Sniper Mask. I could be biased but I think he did great as this character. Very fitting.Of course, that is a personal opinion though.I may go on to read the manga and see how it differentiates. From what I heard the main character Yuri has always been some sort of Mary Sue. We shall see.Overall its not /that/ bad of a watch..

No.  Is it terrible?  Also no.Due to both my TikTok FYP and my YouTube recommendations, along with my Netflix, I discovered this anime.  And am I happy about it?  I don’t know.The story is a mess, the pacing is awful.  Japanese sub is fine, while the English dub is grating (except for a select few, like Sniper Mask).  The characters are...fine?  I enjoy the LGBT+ representation but it just seems forced.  The art is inconsistent, making (specifically the female) characters look either chubby and short or skinny and tall...and...the changes happen every other scene.All in all, it was enjoyable in my opinion.

Sure, I guess.I guess it was fine for a 12 episode anime that adapted 249 chapters of the manga. the changes happen every other scene.All in all, it was enjoyable in my opinion.

The premise and the plot are ludicrous, but for the rest is a very average anime, if you are looking for something just to waste your time with brainless violence and pretty schoolgirls. Otherwise, you are looking in the wrong place.What I\'ve just said would be enough to explain my point of view over this anime, but I\'m talkative, so I\'m gonna say something more.This anime is about people being trapped in a maze of skyscrapers where strange guys with masks try to kill them. However, some of the ""normal"" people may obtain a...special power that makes them able to control the masked. I won\'t go further because spoilers, but in actuality, even if I would tell you about all of the plot, it would still be pointless.

Overall, it feels like the concepts the team came up with were not followed through.Also, too many panty shots! Even in intense fight scenes, you could get a gratuitous panty shot that completely takes you...out of the story.

Plenty of important-seeming characters appear but are never given much weight in the story apart from moving the plot along, and OP characters feel completely unexplained. What little we do learn about our cast feels superficial and it's hard to form a connection with any of them- it really says something when your most emotionally intriguing characters are ones that barely speak or have screen time. if we do learn something, it's usually way too late in the story and we're too deep in the action for it to feel like it matters.Even our titular main character is oxymoronic. She's a high school girl that gets thrown into this world and develops a taste for violence who becomes a Mary Sue halfway through the series.

In those 12 episodes I dont recall her ever losing a fight she somehow managed to get out of more experienced and strong fighters who are more than capable to harm/ kill Yuri.The second main character which is Mayuko Nise had a promising start in her first appearance, her background story was the typical 0 to no parental care and love but overall she had a promising start, until she...got attached to Yuri, her whole character/ personality is based off of Yuri, she lacks uniqueness and depth, the entire anime was her practically being  a slave to Yuri she is such a wasted potential character.The only character who I personally liked and enjoyed his screen time was ""Sniper Mask"" out of every character in the series Sniper Mask was the best written when it comes to High rise invasion\'s level of writing. He\'s the third MC and practically the favored MC in terms of writing out of the five protagonists.Overall found the anime pretty stale and not exactly enticing, in my opinion the show lacked depth in every aspect and felt rushed and the major issue I find is the MC (Yuri) needs a plot armor nerf.Story: 5/10Art: 7/10Sound: 6/10Character: 3/10Enjoyment: 4/10Overall: 3/10 got attached to Yuri, her whole character/ personality is based off of Yuri, she lacks uniqueness and depth, the entire anime was her practically being  a slave to Yuri she is such a wasted potential character.The only character who I personally liked and enjoyed his screen time was ""Sniper Mask"" out of every character in the series Sniper Mask was the best written when it comes to High rise invasion\'s level of writing.

It has a concept which feels like a mix of mazerunner, battle royale and even autodale. The way the world is introduced is good and overall the story isn't too complex to follow but it does have unique features.PositivesUnique character designsGood English dubA top tier outro and solid introSolid supporting cast Not gonna lie I preferred the supporting cast compared to the main character. Especially the sniper he definitely the best character from design to character because he develops.NegativesToo much panty shots like easily 1 per episode and it just kinda ruins the story...as you're trying to watch a fight scene then you've got a girl's ass covering the screen just takes away from the anime unfortunately.Main character is okay but isn't good. She isn't a bad main character at times she was good and I can understand her story but she barely develops compared to others.Parts of the story left unanswered I don't know if this was intentional as it looks like a follow-up would be made imo but when 1 of the 3 main characters is barely explained it's not great.SummaryIs the anime good? Yeah I found a lot of enjoyment out of it the concept is great some of the characters are extremely good but the main character and story having issues as well as the animation team appearing to be horny as fuck while making this makes it almost bad. The fight scenes aren't great but they're not made to be. It's a story of survival and how the characters find a way to survive in this unusual world so I actually prefer more tactical fights compared to battles.Overall it's a good anime from Netflix they've done well recently with Great Pretender, B the Beginning, Early seasons of 7 deadly sins and now High-Rise Invasion. I would put it at a low 8 because I enjoyed it however I think it could be placed as low as a 5 for some. It's a split anime some will love it while others will hate it.

I actually quite like High-rise invasion/ Tenkuu Shinpan, but even though I did enjoy the series, I have a few bones to pick.1. It's rushed plot.When I first heard about this series, I thought that it really did have the potential to be a good series, the idea of the anime was great! But...I feel like they rushed the plot way too much. I felt like this anime should have been spread over more episodes. (I know we'll probably be getting a season 2, I'm just on about what happened in season 1) Especially the last episode, so much happened over the span of 20-25 minutes. There's 12 and each episode is about 20-25 minutes long.2. It's excessive fan service.The anime itself is meant to be very serious with all the action and combat but I feel like the excessive fan service made it seems less real. Don't get me wrong, a bit of fan service is alright but I just feel like they put too much and it was unnecessary.3. It's crappy dialouge.A lot of the dialogue was very unneeded. E.g: Say a random anime charactor was on a plane, when they boarded the plane, they say 'I boarded the plane' and then 'I am walking to my seat' ' I have sat down in my seat' 'The plane has took off' 'we have landed' (this isn't actually in High-rise Invasion, it's just an example)  It's not so bad as the series continues but it's very present at the starI also want to make it clear that I do not mean to offend anybody with this review, it is completely fine to agree, disagree or neither and have your own opinion :)Thank you for reading my review on High-Rise Invasion and I hope you found it helpful! ~Silxntt I feel like they rushed the plot way too much.

There are so many of them and about 80 percent of those are unecessary af. The plot at first kinda got me intrigued but then it started going into gods, chosen ones and other shit. I would recommend the first 4 maybe to 5 episodes of this anime, but anymore than that and you could end up hurting yourself sitting through this piece if garbage.

And it was as I expected, it was progressing well until the first 2 episodes, but I just realized that they exaggerated the ecchi scenes. As I continued to watch, I noticed that the ecchi scenes increased and became more prominent. This was pretty disgusting.As the episodes progressed, encounters emerged, unfortunately they were not a masterpiece. So I finished half of the anime. some characters looked like characters from other anime. Too bad the crappy panty scenes started to increase as we neared the end of...the anime. Sometimes there were surprisingly good scenes, but there were also shoddy ones. For some reason I never liked the main character. The side characters were better than the main character.His drawings weren't bad. Music was good. Although the story was average, the handling was terrible. The characters were, as always, very weak.

If that sounds like your thing, you might like the premise of this series.The story felt rushed and never like it was actually going somewhere. Things just happened and then something else happened. There are always new character popping out of nowhere without any explanation (guess knowing the Manga would have helped) and it takes until the 11th episode for something of consequence to happen, only for the first season to end 20 minutes later. The character designs are competent but really nothing special. The masks, however, are some of the worst designed things I\'ve ever seen. They look either extremely generic and cringe or absolutely stupid. I never felt threatened, I felt annoyed everytime they were on screen. Same goes for basically all of the character. I never watched an anime that made me care as little about a single one of its characters. Also, the fan service is just next level intrusive and makes the tone incredibly incconsistent. I could not go 5 minutes without rolling my eyes about either another panty shot or just dumb shit the character said in the name of ""comedy"".The anime also does a horrible job of exlaining its own rules and it honestly seems to invent rules and mechanics as it goes along.

Also I\'ve noticed at least one continuity error.Believe it or not, I didn\'t hate everything. The artstyle, apart from some incredibly dumb character designs, is generic but competent. The animation does its job well enough and the soundtrack, even though not amazingly good, was actually pretty enjoyable. Also I never felt so bored that I decided to quit. I was atleast interested enough to want to see what would happen next, even though nothing interesting ever happened until the final two episodes.My final score is a solid 4/10.

Each masked being is given a name, based on either their appearance, or ability - ex: Sniper Mask wields a large sniper rifle.

Together, they try and find out how to thwart this cursed world that they\'ve been brought to and find a way to end the game.The story itself is a pretty typical survival series and things like weapons and food are always contested.  Not only that, but because everyone\'s stuck at the top of these high rise complexes, one slip will mean instant death.  Many of the buildings are connected via wire bridges and in that regard, I do like that they try and make the world as menacing as possible, while giving our characters some shred of hope.  All that being said, that\'s about where the complements end.The theme of the entire series is to survive, but this series can\'t seem to help itself with trying to be funny... which it doesn\'t do well.  The jokes come off as extremely bland or have questionable placements and then inserting fan service wherever they can certainly doesn\'t help.  It just doesn\'t do a good job at taking itself seriously in a survival anime.During the course of the series, the super human powers that each masked character gets really don\'t add much to the story.  What I mean by this is you may as well pretend that each masked enemy is a generic zombie, holding some random weapon.  It leaves the action scenes to be quite boring, even if they did create some pretty creative fighters in the process.  At some point in the story, some of the secrets to the masks get uncovered... but they never fully explain it.  How do you maintain control, who has power over these, who has their free will intact and why?  They also introduce a state of being that\'s called ""being closer to God"", and while that\'s fine... again, they don\'t explain it fully.  None of the questions are answered, and by the end of the story, it doesn\'t feel like the story went anywhere, outside of some minor character developments.Speaking of each, our characters have solid motivations (ie: survive) but there was so little that made me care about them.  Yuri is extremely bland and they honestly don\'t do much to develop her, outside of a certain action near the end.  She seems to only want to find her brother, but doesn\'t seem to bright.  Mayuko isn\'t really anything special to me and just feels like a device for Yuri - who always seems to think everyone can be her friend.  Sniper Mask gets some pretty heavily involvement and a lot of the story tries to weave itself through him.  While that\'s okay, it feels like a lot of the explanations they try to use go in circles.  Kuon is introduced a little later as some form of a different being but she\'s possibly the most annoying character in this whole series.  We later see more stable characters that make up our villain squad, but we don\'t get much insight into them, aside from one of them having different powers and another barking orders.  The characters in general are okay, but never amount to a whole lot that makes the story more interesting than it is.  (Story: 4/10, Characters: 6/10)Art: High-Rise Invasion has a lot of moments where the art animation looks pretty flat and sloppy.  This was very obvious for many of the scenes with nothing to really stick out all that much.  The masked characters are all very distinct, as are our main cast, but... is that so hard to do?  As mentioned, the fan service feels misplaced, and really makes it seem like certain action sequences don\'t mean a whole lot.  (Art: 6/10)Sound: I actually didn\'t mind how High-Rise Invasion sounded as a whole.  The whole vibe kept to being pretty spooky and mysterious, and this lined up with the OP and ED.  There wasn\'t a ton of standout tracks, but considering the flat plot, it still fares okay.  The VO cast were very strong, with all of Suzie Yeung (Yuri), Jennie Kwan (Mayuko) and Jonah Scott (Sniper Mask) being smaller names on this cast.  There were all great.  There were plenty of big names in side roles here so to have the smaller names take leading roles, and do well, gives me hope to all three of those.  (8/10)Overall Enjoyment: High-Rise Invasion was a series I slogged through.  It just didn\'t have any excitement that made me want to keep watching and the ending didn\'t solve a thing.  They heavily imply another season is coming, but I won\'t likely be checking it out.  They simply don\'t change up enough to keep the series fresh and the entire feel of the series was horribly lacking.  (5/10) enhanced powers and basically act as mindless killing machines.

(5/10)', ""*spoilers ahead*Well then, let's start from this - do i recommend watching this? No, unless there's a second season at some point, if even then.From that you'd probably realize this isn't too good a show, so then, let's dive into what went wrong, shall we? First of all, Netflix. No, i'm not kidding, while its not a sample of failure/mediocrity per se, the bad outcome is still rather common. There's also the 'Netflix original' stamp that's quite weird frankly - because original would imply THEY made it, not just sponsor an already existing manga/LN. But putting that aside, and the hit and miss nature of...their stuff, let's get back to the case at hand...Let's start with the fanservicy and lighthearted tone of the show. I'm not usually one to go against fanservice, heck, i'm mostly all for it if its done even remotely well, but here, its so common, you might as well forget its there entirely - at least a third of the shots are done from below, with the two main characters being high school girl in skirts. If that wasn't enough, the blonde one gets her shirt ripped pretty much at the start, and spends most of the show with her bra showing every time she's seen from the front. Why even bother with camera angles at this point and not have them run around in her underwear at that point..? Not that i even find lingerie that fanservicy, but it takes a lot from it and disrupts any kind of atmosphere the show might have going when about 50% of the shots are trying to focus on the various 'assets' of various girls from unnatural camera angles.Next up is the lightheartedness. What is a deathmatch supposed to be about, what does the viewer expect from it, and what kind of atmosphere should it have? There's several options, but i'll tell you one thing that does NOT fit - a lighthearted, fanservicy one, which is exactly the case here. The reactions of the heroine to being chased by psychos, seeing murder, and killing is almost always a cheery, comedic one (outside ep1), and its the show's own take too, because they make no attempts to present that the main characters take it all on in their happy go lucky way is because they've lost it or seen too much, no, that's just the way they are... How are you supposed to take a show about a deathmatch seriously if it itself doesn't? You can't. You may say 'then don't take it seriously', but then... What's the point?Simply put, i think either the director really screwed up, or the source material wasn't fit to adapt in a one season anime format (11-13 ep), because my next and final point would be the structure of it all. The first episode makes a decent job presenting the world and the scenario playing out, heck, it even manages to stay somewhat serious (not that its good even then, in fact, that's one of the most boring and generic first episodes i've seen). But then... She finds herself her first ally and... Well, mostly nothing happens. There's a couple of small fights and problems that get resolved far too quickly and easily, and the stakes and tension for which is rather small, either because there is none, or everything is resolved before any pressure is applied, then the blonde is in danger of dying and the heroine is IMMEDEATLEY told how to save her by a passing plot convenience lady, and while she's at it, the blonde gets saved EVEN SOONER by the god candidate watching the two... Them MC gets superpowers as well, but her brother gets kidnapped... Could have gone somewhere with her losing it, but nope, she hears he friend screaming for her and bam, back to normal and all is well.The final boss fight is also rather short, and is riddled with comedy, the stakes are still low and doesn't really seem there's any rush to save MC's brother, and the 'boss' isn't even the bad guy but some stupid side character... The fight itself is nothing special, then they win in a rather anticlimactic way, and... Woo, show's over, they didn't even see the bad guy, and the bad guy puts a mask on her brother, to be continued. Been a while since i saw such an unexciting, anticlimactic and boring cliffhanger of an ending, what where they even going for? Another season? Considering the bad rating, its probably not happening, but who knows, its Netflix...Not at all recommended or special, would not probably recommend if there's a second season, maybe if its REALLY good somehow, which i doubt. their stuff, let's get back to the case at hand...Let's start with the fanservicy and lighthearted tone of the show.

Anyone who’s seen this and genuinely thinks of it as a good show is either 9 or actually a dunce. There are no decent characters, i’m sure the only reason people think the series is good is because of sniper mask, which is the only semi-good character, and i’m being generous. He’s still awful.  The dub voice...acting sounds like nervous kids trying out for the middle school drama club, the fan service is incredibly unnecessary, and the plot holes. Jesus christ, the plot holes. There’s so many. It’s awful.World building is eh, barely explains how everyone got there, how certain things work, etcThis anime is literally what a 12 year old anime roleplayer would create if they had access to an animation studio. Genuinely the worst anime i’ve forced myself to watch. Horrid. acting sounds like nervous kids trying out for the middle school drama club, the fan service is incredibly unnecessary, and the plot holes. Jesus christ, the plot holes. There’s so many.

I was expecting it to be more of a realsitic DIY survivor series, but too many sci fi elements were introduced into the story to make it more suspenseful and special. However these elements just made the story more cheesy and illogical. The tone for the series changes too often as well, it can go from being to light comedy to a wannabe action series to a unsuspenseful thriller within the same episode.ArtThe prduction values especially the animation are surprisingly good.Sound...The opening and ending are somewhat memorable, but nothing that blows my socks off.CharacterNot a memorable cast of characters either. They are mostly one note. Character development can feel extremely rushed as well. For example, Yuri is at first terrified of the new world but becomes very confident and ready to killl by the next episode. You really have to suspend your disbelief to accept that much development in such a short period of time. The blonde girl is rather forgettable as well, I do not recall much of her personality other than she was possibly in love with Yuri. The sniper mask guy is rather bland as well, not much is known about him even by the end. Supporting characters do not last very long to have anything resemblling development.EnjoymentI expected a cheesy no holds barred macguyverish action series where the players have to make due with very limited resources. However this series was also the complete opposite, weapons were seldom in short supply throughout the series. Even when Yuri is hungry, she just happens to stumble upon food very quickly. The scifi mask elements came off as cheesy and uninspired as well. There were moments were I was very amused by the sheer absurdity of how the characters are portrayed and wild manic moments can occur with little warning. The random panty shots and fan service broke the tension (not there was much in the first place). Unfortunately the random fan service was the most memorable part of this otherwise very boring show.Overallif you want fan service, there are better shows to watch. If you want action thrillers, there are more options for that as well. I do not recommend this series, it tries to do so much with so little and just comes off as dull, uninspired, cheesy, and just plain dumb.

I’d seen the poor MAL ratings and I read the bad reviews. I expected a badly written mess. What I got was a surprisingly enjoyable and humorous battle royale.Firstly, High Rise Invasion is not a particularly complex show. Its hardly Promised Neverland. If you’re expecting complex musings on morality or the human condition then this isn’t the show for you. Instead, if you like shows like Mirai Nikki/Future Diary then this may appeal.Character-wise, I found most of the characters to be quite enjoyable to watch. Yayoi Kusakabe and Sniper Mask to...name but a few. However the biggest surprise was the protagonist, Yuri Honjou. At first sight, Yuri appears to be little more than a stereotypical school-girl protagonist. However over the course of the series Yuri develops from nervous school girl into dual-pistol wielding badass. Nor is Yuri the only example. Sniper Mask, Aohara, Mayuko and to a very small extent in the final episode, Kusakabe all get a degree of character development.  In fact the character’s in my opinion are one of the areas the show shines. The show’s premise involves people called “masks” who, as their name suggests are wearing masks. These individuals have enhanced abilities but they also lose their own personalities and the impact of this is fully utilised in High Rise Invasion. Certain characters, over the course of the show will find loved ones becoming masks. As a result there is a little bit more depth to the show that first appears. The show however is not perfect as you may be able to gather from reading other reviews High Rise Invasion has a number of problems, most notably the fanservice, which mostly takes the form of gratuitous panty-shots but also one sexual assault scene in the first episode. So if you don’t want to watch a fanservicey show you will want to skip this series. Furthermore, most of the positive elements I’ve already mention, such as the character development is rather uneven. For example Yuri’s change happens comparatively quickly. Lastly, on the subject of character, Yuri is well named for there is a degree of “Yuri” subtext between her and Mayuko. So if you’re looking for a protagonist with LGBT undertones then this might be a series you’d want to look at.The animation and the music for High Rise Invasion is good. Its not Ufotable level great but not berserk level bad.Finally, a note on the dub. The dub of the series is comparable to the more humorous dubs, such as Highschool DXD or some of the abridged dubs at times.Overall, High Rise Invasion is “Summer Popcorn Material”, that is fun but dumb. High Rise Invasion is entertaining and at times funny, and it has just enough depth to elevate above an average battle royale however it is by no means clever or deep. name but a few.

If you want the full details, feel free to read my review below because oh boy, we\'re in for a wild ride for this animé and why I rated it so low. I gave it a 3 out of 10 for good reason.→ Story:The story kicks off with the main character, Yuri Honjo, who is supposedly trapped in a bizarre world full of skyscrapers where the objective is to kill or be killed. There are these enemies known as...""Masks"" or sometimes also known as ""Angels"" that essentially try to pressure people into dying or kill them themselves so the concept of the story is essentially trying to survive in the world and not be killed to any of these Masks. Yuri Honjo starts off as a scared girl, but then she quickly develops the skills of an avid marksman when it quickly dawns on her that survival is key in this world. She also then meets up with her lover, Mayuko Nise, and the two essentially work together to survive in the world they\'re in. Sniper Mask is also an unlikely ally of theirs, unbeknownst to Yuri until later on in the animé. The story is essentially just that with nothing else, making for a bland experience. Kill or be killed. I wish I\'d gotten more, but that\'s all we got. In addition, it felt like a lot of concepts were introduced then later thrown right out the window. What happened to escaping this world by helicopter? How did Yuri and the others even end up in this world? Who decides who becomes a Mask and who becomes a regular player? There\'s just so many holes and unanswered questions that it really made me dislike this animé as a whole. That and the excessive fanservice this animé had really killed the whole ""horror"" mood that High-Rise Invasion was going for. I don\'t think we need like 5 panty-shots per episode without it killing the somber or serious mood that the plot was in. Overall, High-Rise Invasion was a very below-average animé and I didn\'t enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The story is an easy 3 out of 10 for me, way below average. If you want a survival animé, just watch Danganronpa or something and I promise you it\'s a much better watch than High-Rise Invasion.→ Characters:Oh boy, where do I begin with the characters? Literally all of the characters were either extremely forgettable, poorly written, or just flat out boring or bad. I like the main character, Yuri Honjo, I guess but even then, she\'s pretty generic and had no development to her. She\'s just your generic waifu that\'s super hot and doesn\'t really develop much in the animé, plus she\'s an airhead that has the biggest plot armor ever. Literally in every situation where she was 2 seconds away from dying, plot armor saved her and I\'m not even kidding. Her lover Mayu Nise isn\'t any better, having basically no backstory or proper introduction. She was just as boring as Yuri Honjo, both of them being generic waifus. The only reason I even kept watching this animé was due to Sniper Mask, arguably the best character in the entire 12 episodes this animé was airing. Sniper Mask\'s character design is really cool and he has charm when he\'s on screen. I liked Sniper Mask\'s mysterious vibes and every episode had me on edge wanting to learn more about him and who he is. If not for Sniper Mask, I\'d have dropped this animé at around episode 3 or 4. The characters I\'d rate about a 1 out of 10 because like I said, they were all forgettable and poorly written aside from Sniper Mask.→ Art and Animation:The art and animations were good. Kind of boring, but I guess I can let it slide. I think the skyscrapers were pretty cool and I liked the different Masks that appeared throughout the animé. I can give points here for creativity in creating the various Masks and on top of that, the fight scenes and all the blood was honestly animated quite well. The art could have been better and I wish I could have seen more than skyscrapers for 12 episodes straight. Not bad, but definitely not good. I\'d rate the art and animations about a 5 out of 10 because it just felt average to me.→ Sound and Music:I have no complaints on the sound and music. I think the music that played was appropriate and really helped set the mood and tone for the current scene in the animé. If the excessive fanservice hadn\'t ruined the mood then the music would be top notch but even then, this animé had a really good opening and ending theme so like I said, no complaints here. The sound and music are a solid 10 out of 10 for me.→ Conclusion:Overall, I did not enjoy High-Rise Invasion as much as I thought I would because the story felt like it wasn\'t going anywhere and it was making stuff up as it went with no clear direction. In addition, the whole thing ended on one giant cliffhanger, which is fine if they\'re adding a season two, but due to how bad this animé was, I don\'t think I\'ll be watching the second season if it doesn\'t fix the many issues that the first 12 episodes offered. I found myself just forcing myself to watch through this animé and I didn\'t even enjoy it through and through. I\'m just glad I\'m finally done watching it so I can shelf this on my completed animé pile and never watch it again. Overall, High-Rise Invasion\'s theme of survival sounded cool to me at first but I got bored with its poor execution within the first two or three episodes in. Watch it at your own risk and your own mental sanity. It was that bad. I rate High-Rise Invasion a 3 out of 10 for failing to meet my expectations, its excessive fanservice, and lack of plot.

I don\'t think we need like 5 panty-shots per episode without it killing the somber or serious mood that the plot was in. Overall, High-Rise Invasion was a very below-average animé and I didn\'t enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The story is an easy 3 out of 10 for me, way below average. If you want a survival animé, just watch Danganronpa or something and I promise you it\'s a much better watch than High-Rise Invasion.→ Characters:Oh boy, where do I begin with the characters? Literally all of the characters were either extremely forgettable, poorly written, or just flat out boring or bad. I like the main character, Yuri Honjo, I guess but even then, she\'s pretty generic and had no development to her. She\'s just your generic waifu that\'s super hot and doesn\'t really develop much in the animé, plus she\'s an airhead that has the biggest plot armor ever. Literally in every situation where she was 2 seconds away from dying, plot armor saved her and I\'m not even kidding. Her lover Mayu Nise isn\'t any better, having basically no backstory or proper introduction. She was just as boring as Yuri Honjo, both of them being generic waifus. The only reason I even kept watching this animé was due to Sniper Mask, arguably the best character in the entire 12 episodes this animé was airing. Sniper Mask\'s character design is really cool and he has charm when he\'s on screen. I liked Sniper Mask\'s mysterious vibes and every episode had me on edge wanting to learn more about him and who he is. If not for Sniper Mask, I\'d have dropped this animé at around episode 3 or 4. The characters I\'d rate about a 1 out of 10 because like I said, they were all forgettable and poorly written aside from Sniper Mask.→ Art and Animation:The art and animations were good. Kind of boring, but I guess I can let it slide. I think the skyscrapers were pretty cool and I liked the different Masks that appeared throughout the animé. I can give points here for creativity in creating the various Masks and on top of that, the fight scenes and all the blood was honestly animated quite well. The art could have been better and I wish I could have seen more than skyscrapers for 12 episodes straight. Not bad, but definitely not good. I\'d rate the art and animations about a 5 out of 10 because it just felt average to me.→ Sound and Music:I have no complaints on the sound and music. I think the music that played was appropriate and really helped set the mood and tone for the current scene in the animé. If the excessive fanservice hadn\'t ruined the mood then the music would be top notch but even then, this animé had a really good opening and ending theme so like I said, no complaints here. The sound and music are a solid 10 out of 10 for me.→ Conclusion:Overall, I did not enjoy High-Rise Invasion as much as I thought I would because the story felt like it wasn\'t going anywhere and it was making stuff up as it went with no clear direction. In addition, the whole thing ended on one giant cliffhanger, which is fine if they\'re adding a season two, but due to how bad this animé was, I don\'t think I\'ll be watching the second season if it doesn\'t fix the many issues that the first 12 episodes offered. I found myself just forcing myself to watch through this animé and I didn\'t even enjoy it through and through. I\'m just glad I\'m finally done watching it so I can shelf this on my completed animé pile and never watch it again. Overall, High-Rise Invasion\'s theme of survival sounded cool to me at first but I got bored with its poor execution within the first two or three episodes in. Watch it at your own risk and your own mental sanity. It was that bad. I rate High-Rise Invasion a 3 out of 10 for failing to meet my expectations, its excessive fanservice, and lack of plot.', ""I did read information about this anime awhile ago, but only now did I give it a chance. So, was High-Rise Invasion any good? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryThe idea of a battle royale/death game isn't exactly new to anime landscape, but it can still be interesting if the show puts an interesting spin on this concept and what High-Rise Invasion does is introduce masks that give their wearers superhuman powers but take away their humanity. Protagonist Yuri is constantly forced to adapt, survive and make unusual alliances in order to save in what appears to be a game...intended to create the perfect god, the specifics of which are never developed within the series.Something I found really intriguing about High-Rise Invasion was the characters constantly switching and forming alliances, mostly out of convenience, but sometimes because of genuine friendship. It really increases the emotional stakes and dramatic tension in the show. Sure, there are times when the fanservice and the comedy look misplaced, but for the most part, the show has a very good tone and an interesting story. (7/10)CharactersYuri has to be one of the best female protagonists I've seen in recent years. When she enters the game she doesn't become an all-powerful badass, she is merely a scared teenager who finds herself way out of her depth and the first time she wields a gun or fights someone, she is clumsy and she needs to think fast in order to stay alive. She reminds me of Lara Croft from the new Tomb Raider games. I really love Yuri, not in spite of her flaws, but because of them.I have trouble deciding who is the deuteragonist of the show: Yuri's brother Rika or the mysterious Sniper Mask. Both characters know each other and the show does dedicate a bit of time into their relationship and while Sniper Mask does have a bit more screentime, Rika's influence can be felt throughout the show, either as a motivation for Yuri or his own actions trying to survive the game.I also loved the supporting parts of both Mayuko and Kuon. They both develop beautifully throughout the show. The former learns compassion and friendship through Yuri, while the latter learns how to be strong and to stand by her convictions from Sniper Mask. The connections between characters is one of the show's strongest aspects. (8/10)ArtSex and violence sell, that's a given. There is plenty of action in this series, as expected of a battle to the death. Sure, there is blood, but never to the point where it becomes obscene and grotesque. The fanservice, however, is more distracting than titilating. High-Rise Invasion will find any excuse to tear a girl's clothes to shreds or show their panties, and it's up to the viewer to decide whether it's titilating, hilarious or distracting. Still, the show has good artistic resources and that's something to be praised. (8/10)SoundsI really liked the soundtrack for this show, especially for the fight scenes. The vocal performances are also incredible. Despite their relatively short careers, Suzie Yeung (Yuri),Zeno Robinson (Rika) and Jonah Scott (Sniper Mask) have proven their talent by performing alongside powerhouses like Stephanie Sheh (Kuon), Johnny Young Bosch (Aikawa), Xanthe Huynh (the voice of the masks) and Cristina Valenzuela (Yayoi). I really hope they get more work after this. (8/10)ConclusionLet me be clear about this. High-Rise Invasion isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of imagination. Everything about this show has been done better by other works of fiction. Is it still worth watching? Yes. Why? Because it's fun, it has action, it has an ongoing mystery and likeable characters. This show is a very good way to spend your time on and I highly recommend it.

A fun romp. You be the judge.', 'I forced myself to watch all 12 episodes, which was absolutely painfulI\'ve never written a review on here before, but I couldn\'t let this one slide. This may just be the worst anime I\'ve ever seen. I won\'t go into too much detail, since everyone in the other reviews already voiced my massive gripes with this show. The main points would be an overload of shameless pantyshots, a S.A. used for shock value in the first 10 minutes, non-existent plots, boring, inconsistent characters that weren\'t developed enough to care about, some with barely any introduction at all. The exception to the character issue would...be Sniper Mask, who practically carried the show, and Kuon, by association. The female characters are constantly put in laughably bad situations that are clearly meant for male fanservice. A couple of examples would be convenienly torn clothing to show skin or, one that made me laugh out loud from how stupid it was, a scene where the main villain was talking to his female lieutenant and randomly throws his face into her breasts to ""comfort"" himself. I\'m not even going to begin on how problematic that is considering she\'s being mind-controlled by him.As others mentioned, the plot constantly introduces things, then does next-to-nothing with them. I\'m not even sure if they ever completely explain what\'s going on or why the characters were thrown into this world in the first place. Who created the masks? How exactly do they get out? No one knows, and it seems like the characters are just running around while things just happen to them.All of the above (minus the S.A. stuff, that was just the worst) pales in comparison to the *writing* of this show. My goodness, I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen a better example for talking the plot and telling instead of showing. Literally every thought, every action, every plot point of the show is explained almost immediately after (or sometimes during) the event by interior monologue or dialogue. And it\'s not even written well!I feel like I\'ve rambled on enough, but to conclude, I\'ll repeat a perfect phrase I saw another review use: ""This show is what your non-anime watcher friends think anime is.""

Tenkuu Shinpan doesn\'t get to me as deeply — its characters (especially the main character) are pretty shallow —, but this anime manages to be intriguing and exciting on its own way.I mean, do you know that sense of mystery...that animes such as Attack on Titan build? Like ""What is this world?"", ""I want to know the truth of things!""? Tenkuu delivers that, but, once again, in not as impactful of a way.Still, I really enjoyed the action, and I think this anime is quite a good one, provided how addictive it is.I also liked its soundtrack, even if it seems to be limited in terms of track counts.

High-Rise Invasion is without a doubt a record for one of the worst anime out there. And is therefore yet another proof that there are no quality controls in anime production.Just imagine that this anime is a combination of a hentai, a trash movie, the worst comedy there is, and an Indian action flick. This is how I would describe it and I still can\'t shake the feeling that it was supposed to be a...parody of something. However, after my search, I haven\'t found anything to prove it.Tenkuu Shinpan is an anime that takes the more than hackneyed survival scene and does nothing with it. Absolutely nothing about this series makes remote sense and at the center of it, all is the protagonist. This ""creature"" has the worst and stupidest dialogues and monologues you can find anywhere, they are so poorly done that they should induce states of shock. And to make it worse, she always sets ""new"" goals and ignores the old ones. And her moral code is just incredibly disturbed. First, she doesn\'t want to kill anyone, but then she realizes that the masks are not her enemies and wants to defeat the real enemy. Then she says masks are innocent people. Then she kills masks, then slaughters more masks. Then she says she wants to defy the rules of the game world and not play by those sick rules. What does she do about it? She kills more masks and plays by the rules. Then she mourns the masks and kills more of them. Then she doesn\'t care about the masks anymore, she slaughters them like flies. Then she helps masks (because of the plot) only to slaughter masks again. And then she suddenly says she doesn\'t want to kill masks that have already been defeated! This girl is a witch who bends her morals depending on the situation just to fit the plot. She has ONLY lied and murdered in the whole series, but she accuses others of ""evil"" deeds? She even wanted to kill normal people who are not controlled (controlled too) and says right after that killing is wrong and she doesn\'t want to be like the criminals.My thesis: She is the real main antagonist and has 6 different split personalities. And the rest are so hot for her they don\'t notice. I wasn\'t sure if we\'d ever see an orgy here, the way everyone acts toward her.I would love to say more on this, but then I would probably start spoiling. So do me a favor and just watch it, if you don\'t see any sense in life anymore.[Story 2]What we know of the plot so far is that people are brought to this place with a purpose, which is not just survival. And that\'s all, nothing else has been revealed throughout the season.The course of the season is a sheer disaster, the characters can\'t decide what they want to do. They slaughter each other, then blindly trust each other only to attack another group and blindly trust them again. Even murderers become seatmates in a scene there.Especially remarkable was the protagonist\'s analysis of the helicopter and her helicopter invasion plan, which made me watch the scene twice. I wasn\'t sure if I was just broken or if she said it. The helicopter that constantly stops at one of the places is the ""weak point"" of this world and the opponents showed weakness by being afraid. This is exactly what the protagonist had said during her speech.In that sense, the whole season is really about the helicopter - helicopter, but they somehow forgot that along the way.The fact that most of the masks were also absolute overkills and could wipe out people in seconds made it all the sadder that they always lost. The masks never really tried to kill the protagonists or become dangerous to them. And even attacks that turned everyone into a puddle of blood made them nosebleed. Because the characters are just probably as tough as a heavy truck by birth.[Characters 1]No, just no. There is a limit to how bad characters can be and this was blown up here. Aside from rationality in the negative, the author had no idea what he was having them do and say. It felt like there were multiple options and it was just spinning a bottle to decide what they say and do.The protagonist Honjou Yuri, the source of all evil in this creation. Is supposed to represent a naive, dumb nut who, in contrast, is good-hearted and attracts everyone around her. Unfortunately, it resulted in everyone around her wanting to ""undress"" her. And that she is the biggest mass murderer and hypocrite in her universe. Nothing she ever did or said made the slightest bit of sense. Wouldn\'t a cheat slip have been enough to realize what her goals are?Nise Mayuk, the ultimate Yandere lesbian almost went watery every time Yuri got within 2 meters of her. That\'s her personality.Shinzaki Kaon is practically a second protagonist who is just a Sniper Mask fanatic and represents the typical good girl.Rika, Yuri\'s brother has surprisingly been the smartest character in the anime but is still far from average. Still, I was glad for his presence.Sniper Kamen/Mask is your typical badass and I was hoping he could save the anime. But no, he\'s just a guy in a mask literally ""trying"" to be cool. I don\'t know why, it will be explained later, but he has the urge to be cool. That\'s all that was behind him.Combine all this with such bad dialogue and character interactions and you could almost cry.[Music 4 / Animations 5]The intro had a suitable style, but hardly any musical quality worth mentioning, as did the outro and the osts.Animations were at least average, especially the panty shots took effort, where would we be without them?[Conclusion 1]Usually, when I watch poorly rated anime, I try to find the good in them as best I can. The thing is, no matter how badly an anime is portrayed, most have several strengths or moments where you just think to yourself that this was written quite well. Even a bad anime simply has its strengths. At least that\'s true of most of them, which is why I never mind watching them, and I\'m not always on the lookout for top titles.But with this one, even with me all enthusiasm froze and I didn\'t see any hope. Why? Why? Is something like this even allowed to exist? It\'s almost as if someone deliberately tried to make the worst anime there is to win a bet.If I had to make an anime that was immensely bad and so stupid, my result would be shockingly similar to this anime. And that can\'t be their seriousness.There was only one scene after 12 episodes that I found just okay [When Rika was interrogated] and even that, I wouldn\'t even call average. Other than that, there was not one scene, moment, or approach that made this anime even remotely special. And I\'m not even overdramatizing it, that\'s the bad part.[Enjoyment 0] parody of something.

She kills more masks and plays by the rules. Then she mourns the masks and kills more of them. Then she doesn\'t care about the masks anymore, she slaughters them like flies. Then she helps masks (because of the plot) only to slaughter masks again. And then she suddenly says she doesn\'t want to kill masks that have already been defeated! This girl is a witch who bends her morals depending on the situation just to fit the plot. She has ONLY lied and murdered in the whole series, but she accuses others of ""evil"" deeds? She even wanted to kill normal people who are not controlled (controlled too) and says right after that killing is wrong and she doesn\'t want to be like the criminals.My thesis: She is the real main antagonist and has 6 different split personalities. And the rest are so hot for her they don\'t notice. I wasn\'t sure if we\'d ever see an orgy here, the way everyone acts toward her.I would love to say more on this, but then I would probably start spoiling. So do me a favor and just watch it, if you don\'t see any sense in life anymore.[Story 2]What we know of the plot so far is that people are brought to this place with a purpose, which is not just survival. And that\'s all, nothing else has been revealed throughout the season.The course of the season is a sheer disaster, the characters can\'t decide what they want to do. They slaughter each other, then blindly trust each other only to attack another group and blindly trust them again. Even murderers become seatmates in a scene there.Especially remarkable was the protagonist\'s analysis of the helicopter and her helicopter invasion plan, which made me watch the scene twice. I wasn\'t sure if I was just broken or if she said it. The helicopter that constantly stops at one of the places is the ""weak point"" of this world and the opponents showed weakness by being afraid. This is exactly what the protagonist had said during her speech.In that sense, the whole season is really about the helicopter - helicopter, but they somehow forgot that along the way.The fact that most of the masks were also absolute overkills and could wipe out people in seconds made it all the sadder that they always lost. The masks never really tried to kill the protagonists or become dangerous to them. And even attacks that turned everyone into a puddle of blood made them nosebleed. Because the characters are just probably as tough as a heavy truck by birth.[Characters 1]No, just no. There is a limit to how bad characters can be and this was blown up here. Aside from rationality in the negative, the author had no idea what he was having them do and say. It felt like there were multiple options and it was just spinning a bottle to decide what they say and do.The protagonist Honjou Yuri, the source of all evil in this creation. Is supposed to represent a naive, dumb nut who, in contrast, is good-hearted and attracts everyone around her. Unfortunately, it resulted in everyone around her wanting to ""undress"" her. And that she is the biggest mass murderer and hypocrite in her universe. Nothing she ever did or said made the slightest bit of sense. Wouldn\'t a cheat slip have been enough to realize what her goals are?Nise Mayuk, the ultimate Yandere lesbian almost went watery every time Yuri got within 2 meters of her. That\'s her personality.Shinzaki Kaon is practically a second protagonist who is just a Sniper Mask fanatic and represents the typical good girl.Rika, Yuri\'s brother has surprisingly been the smartest character in the anime but is still far from average. Still, I was glad for his presence.Sniper Kamen/Mask is your typical badass and I was hoping he could save the anime. But no, he\'s just a guy in a mask literally ""trying"" to be cool. I don\'t know why, it will be explained later, but he has the urge to be cool. That\'s all that was behind him.Combine all this with such bad dialogue and character interactions and you could almost cry.[Music 4 / Animations 5]The intro had a suitable style, but hardly any musical quality worth mentioning, as did the outro and the osts.Animations were at least average, especially the panty shots took effort, where would we be without them?[Conclusion 1]Usually, when I watch poorly rated anime, I try to find the good in them as best I can. The thing is, no matter how badly an anime is portrayed, most have several strengths or moments where you just think to yourself that this was written quite well. Even a bad anime simply has its strengths. At least that\'s true of most of them, which is why I never mind watching them, and I\'m not always on the lookout for top titles.But with this one, even with me all enthusiasm froze and I didn\'t see any hope. Why? Why? Is something like this even allowed to exist? It\'s almost as if someone deliberately tried to make the worst anime there is to win a bet.If I had to make an anime that was immensely bad and so stupid, my result would be shockingly similar to this anime. And that can\'t be their seriousness.There was only one scene after 12 episodes that I found just okay [When Rika was interrogated] and even that, I wouldn\'t even call average. Other than that, there was not one scene, moment, or approach that made this anime even remotely special. And I\'m not even overdramatizing it, that\'s the bad part.[Enjoyment 0]', ""It's not that the writing is bad. The characters aren't under-developed. The plot isn't bad. The plot is actually really interesting and I don't understand why it was executed like this. It's the studio that adapted it.Zero-G was not the studio to pick for this adaption. The show should've been a horror but every single event that was supposed to suspenseful was instead made goofy. They make early deaths that are supposed to give the plot weight comedic and easy to shrug off. Add to that all the ecchi that's supposed to lighten the mood and its just a goofy ass show.I was...highly excited when I heard this was coming out and was completely disappointed by what I watched.Read the manga. highly excited when I heard this was coming out and was completely disappointed by what I watched.Read the manga."", 'Ok so, thsi is a meh show, But if there wasen\'t anything special then I would\'nt be writing this. ""So why am I"", you may ask. Well I\'ll tell you, its because of the first episode. High rise invasion has quite possibly one of the best first episode builds I have ever seen. It has everything a good first episode needs. Not only does it introduce all the characters and the main idea, it also shows the themes, enemies, concepts  and is basically a little slice of the full show. Even if that steam doesn\'t go to the end, anyone who is looking for...a good example for how to make a perfect pilot episode should study High rises ep 1. a good example for how to make a perfect pilot episode should study High rises ep 1.', ""I was really excited to hear that this was getting an anime adaptation but I was still a little worried because it was being adapted by Netflix and an animation studio that doesn't really do action anime and instead does more of a slice of life/comedy anime.  And I was right to be with how this show plays out. This show goes from a terrifying scene of a guy going in for the kill to panty shots like 2 minutes later. For an anime so morbid they constantly add stuff like this and sometimes right after action scenes they just start trying to add...comedy. The writing in this shows is incredibly loose with the pacing of the show sometimes and with the fanservice they constantly put in. But I think if you just turn your brain off and let yourself just watch this instead of critiquing it like Darwin Game I think this would be a really enjoyable show to watch.

After reading the other reviews for this show I have to say. There are some interesting people in this world. They complain about fan service when the creators put it in fir people like you and me. You\'ll complain about the action scenes having too much action. On that note I\'m sure someone already did. Now then lets start the review. Also one last thing. While I can\'t judge you for not liking a series why only watch four episodes then stop watching and say ""it\'s bad"" like ?. I would be a lot more inclined to actually listen to...a review if they watched all 12 episodes. Just saying :/ (Not talking about anyone specific just in general)Story: The story is decent the whole finding someone close to you in another world and finding stuff out in the way. It most certainly was not bad. Can\'t wait for a second season just because the way the first one ended with the brother. 8/10Art: While this is my first time hearing of this art studio I am happy they made it. It\'s good, they did a good job conveying emotions on the characters. Also like I said earlier. Just be happy a show gives you fan service -_-. It\'s literally there for you to enjoy. In my mind there is no such thing as unnecessary fan service. Action scenes look really smooth as well. Can appreciate. 9/10Sound: In all my reviews I say ""it\'s hard to mess up sound"" it\'s no different here. They the right V.A. to play sniper mask. 10/10Character: This is most likely the weakest point of this anime. With the only exception being sniper mask who got really good character development. Everyone else was kind of just there. Actually I take that back Yuri had decent character development as well. Kind of. 6/10Enjoyment: My overall enjoyment from the show was good. In my opinion it was a very interesting take on an isekai. It kind of reminded me of ""I\'m standing on 1,000,000 lives"". I\'m happy it\'s getting a season two.

Although, I do think this show as an ""action/horror"" is really really far off the mark, as as comedy, \'High-Rise Invasion\' is hilarious as comedy; paralleling Tommy Wiseau\'s \'The Room\'. I am giving this show a 4/10 but it really is a GEM!Firstly, the story\'s premise is quite enticing but very much lacks in its execution to it and can get messy a lot of the time. I find it quite strange how many of the bad guys in the story can switch sides at nearly a drop of a...hat. The pacing of the show is one of the weirdest I\'ve ever seen but it\'s so funny at the same time. There are scenes in which characters go through an inner monologue for far too long than they should be, about things that are so trivial, all the while they are in a fight to the death. The little romances between the characters are so strange and are with very little subsatnce towards them. But it does, however, add to the comedy in its ""dramatic"" moments. The show also adds layers upon layers of plot points at our heroine\'s connivence displaying its unkempt story crafting.The art of this anime, is not too bad, as it is one of the main reasons i clicked on this show in the first place. But throughout the show it can get inconsistent at times. At different angles the character\'s features can be distorted a tad bit but it\'s not enough to be unwatchable. Though, the hair physics of the character\'s can go a little crazy and can feel unnatural at times.The sound/music of the show is a little jarring. The opening and ending are not very pleasing to listen to and skipped them almost everytime they came on. The sound design throughout the show is pretty standard, but the mixing of vocals in dialogue needs work. There were times when a person\'s voice was louder than the other\'s and slightly overlaps unintentionally.The character\'s in the show are pretty one-dimensional. There is very little depth towards each but it is not something I mind too much. The bad guys however are very hilarious to watch. They are always super over top and have the best reactions when they die or get defeated. The way they fight is so unfeesable yet they do it anyway just beacause. It\'s all stupid fun.Lastly, I enjoyed myself very much watching this anime. It\'s very over the top, really stupid at times, but overall fun. I absoulutly adore the odd pacing, the super bombastic characters and weird storyline. I can\'t wait for the next season hat.

I can\'t wait for the next season', ""When I watched the trailer I was really excited because the premise seemed rather interesting. However when I first watched the first ep I was really disappointed. I could barely watch the second episode due to how Mary su-ish Yuri ( MC ) is. The anime doesn't seem like a horror anime more like an comedy anime but with gore kinda like Zombie land saga.The panty shots were just really unnecessary.And it felt like the only reason I was willing to finish watching the anime was because I was interested in Mayuko and Mr. Snipermask. They were the only two characters where I think...they were developed well but the story is mainly focused on Yuri, It seemed like the anime was trying to budge in multiple characters and their plot in 12 episodes which just generally wasn't really fun. they were developed well but the story is mainly focused on Yuri, It seemed like the anime was trying to budge in multiple characters and their plot in 12 episodes which just generally wasn't really fun."", 'I will keep this brief. Interesting premise is the only positive I can give this show. The show is full of unrealistic depictions of gore for shock value, panty shots, comedy (which completely is out of place and really diminishes to ""horror"" aspect), anime girl moaning and grunting sounds for no reason, and top to bottom full of clichés that really get on your nerves after a while. The top reason not to watch this show is that all the characters say and act very unnaturally. You\'ll constantly be sitting there wondering ""Why would she say that? How did she come to that conclusion? Why...is she doing this?"" because every character interaction is just completely unnatural. This just seems like someone had a decent idea for a show, but that was it. is she doing this?"" because every character interaction is just completely unnatural. This just seems like someone had a decent idea for a show, but that was it.', 'spoilers up to episode 2OH MY GOD PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY STOP EXPLAINING SHIT PLEASE DUDE. I KNOW 1+1=2 I DON\'T NEED YOU TO EXPLAIN TO ME ""it is hard to kill people because people are human and people die when they are killed and that is sad"" btw have you noticed that the sniper man might be the girls brother like its kinda subtle but they look similar and he keeps hanging around her and he has a photo of her... THAT HAS ""to big brother"" WRITTEN ON IT. Even if it\'s a red herring, the story pushes it...way too hard and it would be really hard for the writers to find a way they can make it a red herring without it being either forced or really basic.There was a scene in episode 2 when I thought maybe they wouldn\'t explain something. The masked brother man sniper got attacked by another mask because his mask was broken and I had hope, I had hope they\'d leave it for the audience to think to themselves ""hey maybe this is something that happened because his mask has broke, seeing as he just talked about the break in the last scene."" Then the script writers metaphorically shot my dog of hope behind the shed as they proceed to explain, like they\'re telling a toddler that he can\'t eat his own shit, that maybe it\'s because his mask broke.This show also thinks it\'s way better then it is. It acts like it\'s all smart but just does the same edgy shit as always, killing character I don\'t care about as the only emotional scenes the writers seemed to be able to vomit onto the staff room desk, ""the enemy doesn\'t want you dead, its worse then that"" troupe, really unnecessary rape scene in episode one that the brother just watches most of, which is really fucking weird. All of this is made worse by the anime refusing to come up for air, showing edgy scene after edgy scene without a single joke or anything to lessen the tension (even though very little is made due to the predictability of it). If Akame ga kill released today then it would be more original then this.Also wayyyy, way too many panty shots and generally sexualizing the characters. Even if they are 16 (which is still too young), Yuri looks about 13 and Nise looks about 12.The animation is also subpar, they try blending 2D with CG in some scene which I have nothing against but it just looks so jarring and the CG running is a joke in and of itself. even without the CG the animation looks pretty bad, kinda like a slide show. The art style also isn\'t very appealing, none of the characters really stand out especially the main character, Yuri. She looks super basic and despite what they keep saying about her expressive face she really doesn\'t make any unique expressions or particularly strong ones, especially considering characters like Anya or any Jojo\'s character exist.only giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because the setting is cool, although wasted.In total, this anime is uninspired, poorly written and takes itself far too seriously.

Why this show is rated lower than some of the harem trash out there, I have no idea.The first thing I want to say before I get into actually reviewing is that I see a lot of people criticizing this show literally just for the fact that it shows panties. It\'s absolutely absurd that people can\'t handle this anymore. Would you rather a white light shine where the panties are supposed to be? Or would you rather the camera pan some other way so we men of culture can\'t see them? I say screw that. And screw you if the...panty shots actually bother you to the point where you\'re rating the show a 3.Story 9/10This story really was great! In episode 1, right off the bat, we see a bunch of people on rooftops suddenly fighting for their lives from these creepy ass masks dudes wondering what the hell is going on, and we\'re wondering what the hell is going on. I love how we\'re thrown into this ACTUALLY interesting world, and we\'re given just enough to figure out on our own about this world. However, I can\'t say this is a 10, as there\'s a couple of questionable episodes where I just feel like literally, nothing happened. It\'s unfortunate, this 12 episode series felt more like 10 or 9 episodes because there were just some pointless episodes crammed in there.Art 8/10Comeon guys. The art is amazing in this anime. The people jabbing at the art style probably couldn\'t even draw a stick figure correctly or had their expectations at like Attack On Titan level. The art is really good for what it is. There\'s blood, a lot of gore, and despite the animation studio not even being known for that type of stuff, they pull it off really, really well. It\'s definitely an 8/10.Sound 8/10Great sound effects, great voice actors, great OP, great ending. It pains me that people disliked the opening transition. For a brief comparison, I\'d compare it to mushoku tensei. Not with the OP itself, but with how it transitions in to the OP. Something at the beginning of the episode is revealed and then the OP starts to hit. The rap-type  ending is really good aswell, and features my favorite character,  Sniper Mask. Speaking of Sniper Mask...Character 10/10Sniper Masks and Rika held the show. No doubt about it. I don\'t know about you guys, but I love the mysterious cool characters. Sniper Mask is that character. But it\'s not just Sniper Mask, it\'s everyone. The villain of this story is good and well-developed, and all of the Masks have their own story. Whether it\'s the BaseBall Mask, Sumo Mask, Swimmer Mask, Chef Mask, just with their faces, what they\'re spouting out, you can tell what their backstory is, and what they did with their life. It\'s truly amazing. The main female character however, Yuri, I kind of found dull. Early in the anime, she shoots a gun and reloads it, and I questioned myself like ""How did she know how to use a gun? Isn\'t she just a normal high school girl?"" I felt like I knew a lot more about Rika then I did Yuri, and Rika did not get as much screentime as Yuri did. If Sniper Mask wasn\'t here, I\'d definitely score the characters a lot lower, but like I said, Sniper Mask CARRIED the show.Enjoyment 9/10I enjoyed this show. I think you\'ll enjoy this show. Don\'t let people\'s negative reviews thrashing the panty shots turn you away from this gem.Overall 8/10Despite me scoring high for basically almost every aspect, I\'m looking at the reality that this is probably an 8/10 show. I mean, I glossed over the fact that any time a character was in trouble, someone would always be there to save them. Although that didn\'t bother me at all, I\'ve got to face the fact that it was a pretty lazy move in terms of writing.

I, however, was 100% in it for the two main character's growth, bond, and triumph in the end. That is the journey that was worth it for me personally as it was very wholesome in that sense.The Yuri relationship betweent he two loads is present, it is not only undertones, and it's quite obvious.The story, however extremely intriguing at first, tripped...over a rock and slid to a halt just before it could really take off. The unveiling of the WHY of the story was so underwhelming it left me with a sense of 'wow, okay, I might have wasted my time with this one...'Now, I have watched this anime when it first came out so my memory might be a little fuzzy, I don't remember there being a TON of fanservice, but I do remember two instances where it was pretty agregious. I am not a fan of it myself depending on how it's done, and depending the purpose of it. The only good utilisation of panty humour to memory might actually have been Lycoris Recoil - which is why usually I stick with battle animes. However, I totally understand why in this case it might have turned people off as it was completely unecessary in this show.In short, this show would have benefited from axing the fan service for a more serious tone and a better intrigue.Art - 7Characters - 9Narrative - 3Music and Sound - 8Finale Grade: 7 over a rock and slid to a halt just before it could really take off.

Many have mentioned that the plot is kind of similar to \'Alice in Borderland\', and in my opinion, this anime is just a tryhard version of that. The first few episodes were still bearable because I was constantly telling myself that I would be able to get a clearer picture of what\'s going on as the story unfold. But nope, the storytelling of this anime is just horrible; the pacing too rushed, random characters appearing out of nowhere without any...introduction - at one point I was even doubting myself if I had skipped an episode by accident because suddenly rika was talking to this random ally as if the audience all knew about this guy.The different parts of the story just don\'t connect well. Yuri was still in despair and suddenly she became determined to save the world, the next moment she met random allies, and all of a sudden random masked men started blabbering about being god, seconds later she managed to contact rika (oh boy rika\'s side is another whole mess with whole ass random characters that will make you go???), and next baamm the big boss appeared and there the final boss battle happened. It gets a little ridiculous whereby characters will just have sudden realization and enlightenment about the realm and what\'s happening. The entire time I was just so confused and unimpressed.There is also zero character development, zero interesting character\'s backstory as well. It felt as if the characters are there just so to conveniently rescue yuri lolll. The suspense the anime tried to build during the fighting scenes and stuff are just not suspenseful at all lmao, for sure some random ally will always manage to fly in fancifully and kill the enemy while screaming ""sorry I\'m late but thank god I made it... I will risk my life for you my friend..."" etc.I tried to justify for this confusing plot - maybe it\'s because the show is only still at the introductory part of the story, so many things are supposed to be left unexplained and abrupt? But nahhh, this should not be an excuse for the horrendous storytelling as there are so many other animes with just season 1 released but the storytelling and introduction to the massive plot of the anime are smooth, relatively logical and just so much more enjoyable.I was able to finish the whole show only because it has 12 episodes and I watched the second half of them at 1.5 speed lol. But ok, 3 stars for I am still able to pull through all eps and sniper mask is a relatively more interesting character that made me want to know more about him, and he\'s kinda cool ngl.

I thought her character could've used a lot more screen time and more development, it felt a little rushed seeing her development throughout some of the episodes, but overall, still enjoyable.

After that it was not so good. When the 3 of the 4 main character have over powered powers it makes it less entreating. The main reason why the first 4 episodes were good as it was a normal person dealing with a death game (and I do love a...good death game show.) it is safe to say that High-Rise Invasion has a very strong start. This anime has a very good idea to it but let down by overpower syndrome.It is also disappointing that every villain dies in the same episode that there are introduced in, it does not all a viewer to reason to build up a link with this characters, this seems to be a issue with many 12 episode anime.Also, the constant shots of pants makes it really hard to get behind any character other than sniper.

And unfortunately, the anime suffers the same mistakes as the manga, but worse. The anime doesn’t bring anything revolutionary to the survival horror sub-genre, but instead completely neuters the franchise from its horror. As the audience, we are robbed of having any kind of suspenseful score to enhance the tension and fear between characters battling off the masked antagonists. Instead, the aesthetics of this anime keep it as a happy-go-lucky survival comedy where all the...characters are single goal-oriented and are one-dimensional. Unfortunately, the anime relies heavily on showing off underage titties and panties. On top of that, we don’t get to see the real hard-hitting carnage that was portrayed in the manga, but instead, we are left to see characters burst like red water balloons.

Okay, there was that kind of random situation where the protagonist's panties or other characters were exposed but if we analyze it well, it even...makes sense, when it is exposed by the character's jump it is normal due to gravity and when the characters are on the floor, well, for example, it can depend on the foci, for example if the focus is a character who is lying or lying on the floor and the female character is standing wearing a skirt it would be very strange if the character lying or lying on the floor did not catch it already which are relatively close and the focus is not on the female character but on the character lying or lying on the floor. I like horror horror anime, but mainly if it involves themes like this of killing or being killed. I like it even more if next to this feature there is something supernatural together, and ok that the mask system can be said that it is not supernatural but technological.

Well, let\'s goAt first, I thought it was necessary to develop the characters better, for example, right at the beginning the protagonist is scared and not knowing what to do, but soon after she changes and kills a woman ""without even caring"" (?). In my opinion the only character who got it right was the masked sniper.Secondly, one thing that bothered me a lot was the focus on sexualizing the girls, like anything they do they managed to find...a way to show their curls or breasts, even in action scenes, the focus was on sensualizing them and not in the main part, like the fight itself.Other than that, I will not lie, I liked the anime and I think it can be considered good. a way to show their curls or breasts, even in action scenes, the focus was on sensualizing them and not in the main part, like the fight itself.Other than that, I will not lie, I liked the anime and I think it can be considered good.', ""I created this account to say the only good thing about this anime is the sniper mask's dubbed voice actor—I simp for a deep voice man.Jonah Scoot literally carried the whole series, deadass all the characters are either braindead or just annoying to sit through.

I found that it was often steering away from the original plot. Although I did see some potential in the plot, I felt as if many unnecessary aspects were brought up just for there to be a forced event of surprise and/or suspense. Because of this, some specifics did not align with each other, causing unnecessary confusion. It was almost as if the entire basis got too repetitive to the point where creators had to involve more unexpected aspects. This poorly executed plot was somewhat enjoyable, though because of the overall goal of...the show.ART 9/10- Before getting into that, I wanted to touch upon the art itself. I felt like this was very well animated but the only critique I had was the unnecessary fan service. I feel as if it was not appropriate for high school students to be completely exposed during unrelated fights. However, I enjoyed watching the animation itself since it was so well done. The art style is wonderful, I’d love to see more anime that looks similar.SOUND 9/10- After touching upon sound, I thought that most of the music was pretty appropriate for the overall vibe of the series. The suspenseful music some scenes and encouraging music during the others was ultimately accurate to what was occurring in the show. These made the experience much more enjoyable.CHARACTERS 6/10- Now, regarding characters specifically, I felt as if there was no real sense of distrust between the main character and who she befriends. This made the show incredibly unrealistic considering it’s a survival-of-the-fittest type deal. Anyone in that situation would fend for their lives instead of wanting to revise it. I also felt as if the main character was incredibly annoying since she did not communicate well at all. Many people in this show think so selfishly which interferes with the plot even though it can easily be avoided. If the goal is to befriend, why does the main character make her situations so much more complicated for no reason. This itself makes many characters dislikable, even the major ones.ENJOYMENT 8/10Even if this may be the case, I still found this anime somewhat enjoyable because of the fighting scenes. I liked how each mask kept their personalities close to them but also being changed for the worse. This made each fight scene unique yet full of suspense, keeping me at the edge of my seat. Sadly, that was not enough to fully convince me that this anime was worth anything over a 7/10.OVERALL 7/10This series was an experience to say the least. I wouldn’t classify it as a bad anime but there are many underlying things that drag this series down. The many dislikes outweigh my enjoyment for the concept and execution throughout this anime. If it were executed and not as rushed, it could’ve had so much potential. Regardless, I wouldn’t recommend this anime to anyone if I had the chance but it’s not a terrible pick. the show.ART 9/10- Before getting into that, I wanted to touch upon the art itself.

This tag turned out to be very misleading, due to many reasons.First of all, the many unecessary panty shots throughout the series. It may be a very intense scene where the characters are fighting for their lives and then- oh look! You can see her panties!! Its quite funny and it ruins the suspense aspect for the most part of...the show.This anime really struggles with its tags, like the writers couldn't decide beetween a mystery horror and an ecchi so they decided to merge the two together. The only reason it deserves the horror tag is for the excessive gore, which is not too badly done.For the story and main plot of the anime, it has a quite strong start being very omnious and creepy, which dies down very drastically after the introduction of side characters and the idea of being a god. They throw a bunch of things in your face and it adds a ton of plot holes, buffed up characters and just confusion.You cannot mention High Rise Invasion without talking about the characters, so first I'd like to talk about the MC. Yuri is your standard high school girl, only is she absolutely braindead and dumb as fuck. She does undergrow some changes later on, but its really random and full of shit. Sniper mask is only cool in comparison to the other characters, since they're so shallow.Another thing, is the english voice acting is pretty much the equivalent to the acting in porn.All in all, the anime is a huge letdown from what it first showed itself as, and I sincerely reccommend you do not watch it, unless you're a masochist and you want to torture your braincells. the show.This anime really struggles with its tags, like the writers couldn't decide beetween a mystery horror and an ecchi so they decided to merge the two together.

It\'s another edgy battle royale style show with sloppy writing, poor animation, dialogue, voice acting and an overly convoluted reason for the death game to be held in the first place, but god damn did I enjoy it! From the moment lesbian angel Mayuko over dramatically utter the words ""This is going to be an invasion... A HiGh-RiSe InVaSiOn!"" which led me to spit out my water from laughter and pump by fist in the air shouting ""Yes!"" I knew this was going to be a good time.I\'d like to reiterate that this show is NOT...good. What it does is form a perfect blend of terrible elements to create a legitimate \'so bad it\'s good\' vibe. Wait, good is too strong a word... Okay is more accurate. It\'s so bad, it\'s okay.All the characters (heroes and villains) are charmingly camp like Saturday morning cartoon characters, but surprisingly competent and likeable which goes along way in making the show watchable.Main protagonist Yuri Honjou is a bro-con loving, dizzy airhead most of the time, but she is reliable, clever and daring when it counts. It\'s very enjoyable to watch her overcome obstacles with shonen protagonist energy. She\'s also THICC like, god damn her thighs are so thicc that even in scenes when the poor animation mangles her body composition they\'re the only thing that will be reliably consistent. And also, dem tiddies.Her guardian angel Mayuko Nise has the dramatic, yandere backstory that every battle royale/death game side girl has to give her a reason to kill, but she becomes more likeable as the show goes on and through Yuri\'s influence (and her panties).Unfortunately the first episode is the biggest hurdle to get over. The tasteless use of suicide and sexual assault that is common in these types of anime on top of the list of problems I\'ve made at the top of this review will probably turn you off quickly if you\'re not into trash (it almost did for me). It\'s not until the end of episode 2 until the show really gets going. The main villain is also very... meh. If you\'ve seen this genre of anime you know what kind of villain you\'re going to get and he\'s just as dull as you think he is.High-Rise Invasion is a bad anime, but it\'s MY bad anime and I love it anyway. If you\'re into watching trash I can guarantee you\'ll get a kick out of this. It\'s better than the poe-faced, edgy seriousness of Battle Game in 5 Seconds that came out this summer. Through all it\'s flaws it\'s at least thoroughly entertaining and fun (plus funny) to watch. I can\'t wait for season 2.6/10 It\'s Okay *Thumbs Up* good.

The tasteless use of suicide and sexual assault that is common in these types of anime on top of the list of problems I\'ve made at the top of this review will probably turn you off quickly if you\'re not into trash (it almost did for me). It\'s not until the end of episode 2 until the show really gets going. The main villain is also very... meh. If you\'ve seen this genre of anime you know what kind of villain you\'re going to get and he\'s just as dull as you think he is.High-Rise Invasion is a bad anime, but it\'s MY bad anime and I love it anyway. If you\'re into watching trash I can guarantee you\'ll get a kick out of this. It\'s better than the poe-faced, edgy seriousness of Battle Game in 5 Seconds that came out this summer. Through all it\'s flaws it\'s at least thoroughly entertaining and fun (plus funny) to watch. I can\'t wait for season 2.6/10 It\'s Okay *Thumbs Up*', ""With this anime I was able to feel a complete experience of cs go, COD and Btt.I learned to kill people with masks because they could be people controlled by the government.Too bad I watched the anime too late. If it was at the time of covid, I would be sending 360 on scope hs in the middle of smoke and flash.Can't wait for season 2 if there will be oneThe next anime will be how to survive a war just using a pickaxe and a cheese bread and a broken pot...THIS ENTIRE REVIEW IS NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY THIS ENTIRE REVIEW IS NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY"", 'I can´t understand how this Anime got a decent review.The beginning of the Story is okay until episode 3 or so where it constantly gets worse and worse. The twists are weak. The dramaturgy is artificially created by bad music and sound design (the sound of people falling from the rooftops made me laugh). The introduction of every character is extremely lame and predictable. The Character development of all chars isnt making sense at all except  sniper man, who was actually not that bad written. Every Dialogue is poorly written. The first time you see someone on screen he has to tell what he...thinks, who he is and whats his goal. They dont even try to let the viewer some imagination. Their background Storys are shortly told without any deep meanings behind them. Everyone got a crush after 20 sec of meeting each other. Too many unnecessary Panty shots or weird scenes to create somewhat of fanservice.Well in the end its wasted Time thinks, who he is and whats his goal.

Only having 12 episodes 20 minutes apiece, you can easily get through it within a day or two.The story is... serviceable. The first few episodes are intriguing, following lone schoolgirl Yuri Honjo as she navigates a labyrinth of skyscraper rooftops nobody can descend from, all whilst avoiding ""Masks""; masked figures with the intent of either murdering or ""driving humans to despair"", essentially assisted suicide by throwing them off. It\'s an interesting premise and very Silent Hill-esque at first with how dystopian and lonely the environment feels.The later episodes also do well. The introduction of...Mayuko Nise (who is most definitely tasting the rainbow, from how often they embrace and devote themselves to one another), Rika Honjo (Yuri\'s older brother, equally struggling to survive in this strange realm), Sniper Mask (More or less the mascot of the franchise) and Kuon Shinzaki (Another lone schoolgirl who finds herself with the aforementioned sniper) all make for an interesting group of protagonists, with their own compelling characters, stories and motivations. Yuri and Mayuko develop quite well in opposite directions, with Yuri growing with her environment from a helpless schoolgirl to a strong mask-slayer by the end, and Mayuko growing to be softer and to learn how to live happily with her friends. They\'re written very well.The more minor characters are... sub-par. Some characters barely get any screentime (The majority of enemy masks are introduced, fought and slain within 5 minutes. They make for fine enemies, but some characters felt like they could\'ve used more screentime. [Maid Mask, my beloved.]), others get plenty of screentime but barely do anything of value. The main villain, is introduced with 4 episodes left, and those episodes are used building up to the final fight with him. Unfortunately, they leave episode 12 on a cliffhanger, and it\'s been 3 years since Season 1 has released, so there\'s basically zero chance of a season 2 ever getting animated. All anime-only\'s like me should continue with the manga, as it was finished in 2019.OVERALLThe anime is fine. The premise is interesting and some of the characters are really cool (Sniper, Mayuko, Yayoi), but there\'s a LOT of unnecessary fanservice a la pantie shots and sexual imagery. The anime also doesn\'t hold back on gore, with plenty of dismemberment and murder onscreen, but nothing inherently sickening. The lack of proper closure really holds it back from anything close to a 10, but it\'s short runtime and simplistic plot suffice for anyone looking for a short-term anime to see if they\'re into it. You can always read the manga afterwards, which is my plan. It\'s a great franchise, but the anime in a void doesn\'t offer anything inherently life-changing.

The premise may seem like a typical survival game but the setting is unique (and also sort of like a fever dream for some weird reason). The plot may not make much sense sometimes, but the animation is decent and some of the fight scenes are pretty good too (wish there was more over-the-top action scenes though). Characters are fine, not that great, but not bad either. Also the OST is really good (some nice symphonic metal, metalcore and djent). Overall I'd say it's pretty good, although there's always room for improvement. Hopefully there's a second season, and it has even better background...music. music.""]"

The ""idol event in dragon empire branch"" filler episode was the best filler episode for me. It literally shows us that dudley heal trigger ogre as favourite card....THAT WAS A MEME AND IT STILL STAYS STRONG TILL NOW.Also in this season the episode was plot heavy and the myoujin vs...chrono last fight was the most epic...because chrono just screw myoujin entire set-up with only G-Guardian that can shuffle opponents card, which ruined myoujin stack due to demiurge skill.Well i sort of understand ppl who watch this and had visible confusion.

Maybe by looks, since it\'s the same animation, but almost everything else is better in this one than it was in the first.I\'ll be short and specific with this, as I want to just get the basic info out and not have this be 5000 pages.The story is in such a better spot. Everything is better. Character development, the story telling itself, the card fights, the...movement from emotional to serious and back to more comedic sides. The show got funnier, the characters got more lovable, the story makes more sense, just everything is better.Art is the same, still amazing.Sound is the same, if not better. The music is just amazing in this show, the opening, ending, scenes with music, just about everything. Side note, but the main ""villian"" girl who can\'t see, her song is just absolutely stunning.Character is like definitely a 10 pretty much, all the characters have some kind of feeling or improvement,  its just amazing.Enjoyment I think is up to the viewer, if you\'re not a Cardfight!! Vanguard player, you may find slightly less joy in this anime overall, since it\'s hard to understand the movement of some of the cards and stuff, but you can still understand it a little as the show definitely provides amazing visuals for everything, I think if you are a player of Cardfight!! Vanguard, you might enjoy this more, as everything is more calculated, intense, funny, and just overall more enjoyable and if you know what the cards do then I feel you\'ll have even more fun as the fight scenes in this season are a S O L I D.Overall? I think this is a solid 8(a 9 for me personally, but 8 to the general public). Mainly because I don\'t think a show like this is for *everyone*, but it is close! It\'s been awhile since I\'ve truly enjoyed a cardgame anime, and this is also by CLAMP for the art design, so there is just a lot to enjoy for me as a person, but I can see someone else maybe having a little bit of a falling. HOWEVER, if you watched season 1, and want something more, this is definitely the show for you, if you even enjoyed Season 1 a little bit, Season 2 should blow you away. It\'s been blowing the community away, so I hope whoever out there tries it out even with Season 1 being a bust.That\'s all I got, hope you enjoy an amazingly well animated show about cards, emotions, friendship, battles, hardships, funny parts, and more! <3Regards,A Fellow Card Lover <3 movement from emotional to serious and back to more comedic sides.

You can check out my review for season 1 here: https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ghrln/reviewsTL; DR- overDress S1 is for people who is not familiar with the franchise- overDress S1 is not about Vanguard, it is about people who play Vanguard and their relationships with others- super adorable main character and side...characters who are extremely straightforward with affection for each other- plot is entirely incomprehensible at times but you just have to go along with the flow- protip: if you are not familiar with vanguard the card game, i suggest you skim through the card game scenes just enough to understand the contextNow my review for season 2...Section 1: Story is now comprehensibleI would say the biggest hurdle for S1 was that it was sorta confusing and incomprehensible at times. Character motivations weren\'t really clear and things just.... happened for no reason. Like why did Danji declare his retirement after playing with Yuuyu? No idea but I kind of accepted it and moved on.No more of that problem in S2. With a proper introduction to Danji\'s backstory, his actions start to make sense and almost everything that conspires because of his past makes sense from a logical standpoint!Section 2: MireiMirei is a wonderful character. Seeing a visibly disabled character is always a welcome since we really need more representation in that front. As a disabled person myself (I am not hard of seeing though), I was extremely excited. Honestly I would want blind person\'s opinion on how they portray Mirei but here\'s my take.The ways that Mirei made the card game which mostly relies on visible cues accessible to herself was incredible. She uses little stickers and puts them on cards. She feels the shape of the stickers to understand what cards she has. The game actually acknowledges her needs as a blind players are different and puts effort into animating her feeling the stickers with her fingertips. She does require some aid when playing the game but the most part she is able to play independently! She also uses braille as a way to write and she reads it off with her fingertips when talking to Danji.She also does not like loud noises and hates it when people offer to help when she is fine (or she does not want to receive help from that person).  I really relate to that as a disabled person. Please do not help us before asking and. if we say we are fine, leave us alone.One of the other things that I really like about her is that she\'s a child that acts like a child and is allowed to do so. She\'s immature and selfish but also incredible kind and deserving of respect. She does not understand that what Danji did was for her sake in the long run. She isn\'t able to understand the complexity of the situation and despises Danji for his actions.  If I am being honest, her suffering is caused by people forcing a role onto her, not because of what Danji did.  If that ""incident"" did not happen (trying to avoid spoilers here), then another person would have forced a role onto her regardless. But that\'s okay. She\'s a child. She allowed to be mad at Danji for what he did because it did make her suffer. It is very selfish of anyone to ask her, a literal child, to be understanding. Danji also understands this so that\'s why the conflict for season 2 is so interesting.Section 3: Touya is unironically insaneThis man is insane. He literally dropped out of med school to play card games. What a dedication. Also, I find that he is such a good leader and having him become the next leader for Blackout was a good decision from Danji\'s end. Him slowly making connections with Blackout members, fixing the merry go around that he destroyed , earning everyone\'s trust and getting Megumi back… It was a slow process but I am really proud of him. I especially liked how Yuuyu helped him all the way throughout. Yuuyu is such a sweet child and I think being around such a person really helps. Also he literally is unphased by crossdressing and compliments Yuuyu’s makeup skills. That’s it — he’s the manliest man in the entire cast of overDress.Touya is kind, caring, emotionally secure, extremely secure in his gender, and smart. What can else can you ask for in a leader?Conclusion:If you liked S1, you will like S2 more.

Crayon Shin-chan Gaiden: Alien vs. Shinnosuke,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33661/Crayon_Shin-chan_Gaiden__Alien_vs_Shinnosuke,"[""Lazy and uninspired sci-fi movie riff in 13 episodes featuring a hollow story with no redeeming qualities.This genuinely feels like an attempt to cash-in on the Shin Chan brand and not much else. It should be noted that there are a few lazy sci-fi references to justify the scenario but not much more than that (ex.: Ripley fighting the alien queen in a loader is recreated).  This is a shame since I really like what they were doing with the main series, thus this just feels like a gargantuan waste of potential.The story is absolutely absurd and makes no sense even by...anime standards. The characters are all fairly one-dimensional and Shin-Chan's stupid behaviour nearly gets one of his friends killed and puts everybody's life at risk. I really disliked the plot and without going into any detail it just seems like the writers couldn't come up with anything coherent or interesting about Shin-Chan and co being trapped on an alien ship, which is frankly shocking and unforgivable.All the characters are flat and one-note. There is no real reason to root for any of them and any danger they are put in is eliminated or ignored via lazy writing that relies on deus ex machina to get out of any difficult situation. The Shin-Chan series thrives off of engaging characters and how Shin-Chan interacts with them, but there is never any interesting interaction here.The main issue is that in the 8 minute episodes there is often very little to laugh about. Given the series is based on using a child as a protagonist to poke fun at adult society and make jokes throughout, this is a bad development. The story isn't gripping or interesting, the scenario isn't explored in any new or intriguing ways; but overall it's just not very funny or entertaining which is a cardinal sin.If you take Shin-Chan and strip away the humour, the amusing storylines, the charm of the series and its varied characters; you are left with something akin to this. They removed all the strengths of the main series and just added a lazy and poorly written sci-fi plot by the numbers without any heart.If you're a huge a fan of the series and want any excuse to spend time with Shin-Chan and the gang you might consider it, but for everybody else this is a hard pass.

Dragon Ball Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2520/Dragon_Ball_Specials,"['I think this was a really good way to end the entire Dragon Ball (excluding the sequel series) series for me.These two episodes served as educative episodes for young children, the then watchers of Dragon Ball in Japan, the first episode being about how to cross the road and the dangers of not being alert, the second episode being about how to prevent fires & who to call if there is one.While it did retain the music, animation & great voice acting in both episodes, I feel as if the second episode made Goku seem more mature than he actually was back when he was...still small, which sort of ruined the character.However, this mistake was partially resolved when it turned out that Goku was actually a fire-fighter, though it still didn\'t fully resolve the mistake as we all know that kid Goku would never be mature whatever field of job he may be in.I also loved how the two episodes ended on two different \'remixes\' of the Dragon Ball opening (or was it the same?), which made the episodes almost distinct and more memorable for the future.What was also great was how they reused old characters and displayed them either as some of the \'main\' characters or just showed a glimpse of them in the background, ""Nam"" being one I saw.In general, I think anyone would really enjoy these two episodes, no matter what age they are. still small, which sort of ruined the character.However, this mistake was partially resolved when it turned out that Goku was actually a fire-fighter, though it still didn\'t fully resolve the mistake as we all know that kid Goku would never be mature whatever field of job he may be in.I also loved how the two episodes ended on two different \'remixes\' of the Dragon Ball opening (or was it the same?), which made the episodes almost distinct and more memorable for the future.What was also great was how they reused old characters and displayed them either as some of the \'main\' characters or just showed a glimpse of them in the background, ""Nam"" being one I saw.In general, I think anyone would really enjoy these two episodes, no matter what age they are.', ""Man, I certainly know this is gonna have a long imperishable gevity effect on me. The original Dragon Ball's simple carefree atmosphere is what I think made it so fun and memorable to watch.The episodes are not long {25 min together} and there's not much to say animation-wise, it's definitely not so impressive nowadays and can look wonky at times but it was standard for the show back then this goes along with the music & voice acting, I also wanna point out the inclusion of side characters that got to be on the front row for a bit. All and all I think...anyone will find themself having a sweet time watching these specials that still have relevance in their life lessons!Hoped this helped! anyone will find themself having a sweet time watching these specials that still have relevance in their life lessons!Hoped this helped!"", ""While dragon ball is an anime rather about action, these specials are still something very enjoyable. Well the age group is obviously like 6-12 years and the animation is really bad, but it's still nice since it teaches kids not to play with fire and teaches kids not to just run across a street without looking. If you're a fan of the original OG Dragon Ball from 1986 them im sure you're gonna enjoy these specials.And since i have to write a longer review here's my thoughts on if the specials made sense: No, they didn't really make sense and it's obviously non-canon almost like...a filler but that's not a problem since the specials are still nice and short. So anyone that has at least a bit of free time can watch it since watching both would only take 25 minutes. a filler but that's not a problem since the specials are still nice and short.

As it's the case with most of the movies of this type that I have watched, their short run time (and the more or less 10 minutes spent in stock footage of the transformation/movements...doesn't help) together with wanting to split the screen time so all the girls get protagonism made the plot quite underdeveloped, but the theme of this movie about the feelings of the toys and why of the actions of Toymajin hit me pretty hard emotionally as someone very weak to those elements.The art was pretty nice as expected of Precure. This movie uses some CGI in the later parts of the movie but it looked pretty good IMO, the awesome models for the characters already used for the ED dances helps with that quite a lot. The music was the same of the TV series and while it's not too memorable it does a good enough job with adding to the scene.If you liked Fresh and find the story elements I mentioned interesting enough, this movie is well worth a try, but I recommend to not go with high expectations. doesn't help) together with wanting to split the screen time so all the girls get protagonism made the plot quite underdeveloped, but the theme of this movie about the feelings of the toys and why of the actions of Toymajin hit me pretty hard emotionally as someone very weak to those elements.The art was pretty nice as expected of Precure.

I watched this film not long after I finished Fresh Precure, a season where my liking towards it was already on thin ice. This film tipped it over the edge.This film can generally be summed up as the Precure franchise\'s take on Toy Story- Very very literally. But unlike the Pixar classic, the plot of the Fresh Movie is extremely generic and too predictable for it to be truly compelling. Predictability doesn\'t always make stories uncompelling, but it indicates a lack of effort...to try and structure or express the same message differently with the context in mind, which I think this movie was unable to do. I managed to correctly predict the ending halfway into the movie, and the resolution wasn\'t a convincing enough message for me to take away.The only Cure that had any sort of relevance in this film was Peach, and the other three practically didn\'t need to be here at all. And I get it; Lead Cure ftw, but there have been movies that have done this relevancy issue better even if the story is focused on mostly one Cure (Suite, MahoPre, StarPre, to name a few). So from the get-go, the success of this movie was dependent on Love. And she failed.Years later, Mahoutsukai Precure would feature a similar Cure-Toy story in Mirai and Mofurun, which was put into the spotlight properly in both series and movie, that created one of the best Cure-Mascot relations and Precure movies of all time. Fresh\'s movie brought in Usapyon as a movie-exclusive character, who had no impact on the main series whatsoever. It created too much of a burden towards making a deep story between Love and Usapyon for the ""Forgotten toy"" prompt to be emotionally powerful. Love\'s defence and promise to Usapyon did not convince me and came off as a spoon-fed message.Maybe it\'s to do with how I never really liked Fresh Precure, but this movie was TERRIBLY boring. The board game concept slowed down the pace drastically and only Passion\'s individual fight scene really made me bat an eye. The CGI for the final battle was jarring as heck and the villain has zero personality. All comedic relief did nothing; I recorded my reaction and as I looked back through it I don\'t think there were even 5 moments where I was truly engaged. It was more like ""Yes yes let\'s kick the villain\'s butt and get out of here."" As basically a mega-fan of Precure for 4 years, this attitude of mine was unfathomable. But there\'s a first time for everything.I\'ve lost count of how many of my Precure friends I\'ve ranted to about this film, going as far as saying ""This movie wasted my time."" I do feel my disdain towards this film is partly subjective, and I\'ve tried to keep most of it outside of this review. Generally, this film was a bore-fest and it led to Fresh Precure being the only season of the franchise I left hating it.

Anyway, they find Usopyrin or something, Love\'s toy she left in the closet as a kid. The girls need to find and defeat Toymajin, who is a compilation of abandoned and lost toys. The Cures are tricked by his roulette assistant in an annoying manner; they see Love ""play the game"" to get the king, get tricked, and they all decide to play his bogus games anyway (since as he...says, ""it\'s more fun,"" but no. Not really.) As I said, Toymajin is made of abandoned toys, which means Usopyrin felt abandoned and joins with him or something. Love is able to convince every child on Earth to open their hearts to their lost toys, and she uses the power of their hearts to upgrade into Cure Angel, who uses Lovely True Heart to free all the toys, leaving the real Toymajin to be a simply teddy bear. Later, they do a yard sale and he\'s given to a cute little girl who loves him. This was pretty good, but tbh it was also just a tad boring unfortunately.

I will give it a 6/10!', ""I've talked about the Precure franchise many times. Fresh Precure being the most recent series I reviewed and one of the best. So, this film festival week we're going to look at the film based off of that series. Omocha no Kuni wa Himitsu ga Ippai!? It came out in 2009 while the series was still airing. Is it a good addition? Let's check it out.Story:We open with the girls planning to have three nights worth of pajama parties. Unbeknownst to them, toys are disappearing around the city while they're playing around. Naturally, when they find out they assume it's Labyrinth only to find...out that they have nothing to do with it. That's when Love's old stuffed rabbit, Usapyon, emerges from the closet to tell them that the trouble originates from the kingdom of toys and a being called Toymajin.The big issue with the film is that the twists are all way too obvious. I understand that the Precure franchise is intended for a young audience but there's a point where things are so obvious that you're actively insulting that audience. And this doesn't quite cross that point but it comes very close.On the positive side, the film does have a strong sense of fun to it. The antagonist also has a legitimate grievance which does make things more interesting. I also appreciate the overall message of appreciating what you have. I also like the way each of our main protagonists has her own challenge to overcome. It's kind of reminiscent of the X-men story where they get taken to different challenges in Arcade's Murder World.Characters:Our main cast are as endearing as ever and all four of them get a chance to showcase the personality aspects that make them such. The two major characters who get added in for the sake of the film are Usapyon & Toymajin. Usapyon is quite a likable character. Toymajin is more compelling than the antagonists we usually get in Precure films since he actually has a genuine complaint unlike, say, the antagonist of the Gogo film.Art:The artwork and animation are really good. It looks very much like the series. The only real issue would be the length of time spent on the stock footage scenes. The film doesn't condense or combine the transformation sequences. So, we get to see all four one after the other with their full lengths.Sound:The acting is really good. Oki Kanae, Komatsu Yuka, Nakagawa Akiko & Kitamura Eri are all really strong in their roles. The film adds Sakamoto Chika and Tsuru Hiromi who are both solid in their roles. The film uses the same music as the series proper and it's still fantastic.Ho-yay:The girls in this continue to read as a polyamorous lesbian grouping. There's about as much les-yay in the film as there is in a standard episode after Cure Passion joins the roster.Areas of Improvement:Combining the transformation sequences would have allowed for extra time for more important content.The film would have benefited from being less obvious with its plot line.I would have liked to see more of the girls just interacting with each other.Final Thoughts:This film is pretty enjoyable. If you're a fan of Fresh Precure, you'll most likely enjoy it. It's basically a long, stand alone episode. I'm going to give it an 8/10. out that they have nothing to do with it.

Full Moon wo Sagashite: Kawaii Kawaii Daibouken,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1996/Full_Moon_wo_Sagashite__Kawaii_Kawaii_Daibouken,"[""Cute Cute Adventure? you think. Cute Cute Adventure! I say.Not often have I been able to make a review that is longer than the thing being reviewed. But today I can gladly triumph at my victory. Being at least no longer than 12 minutes, this is probably the shortest OVA I have ever watched.Can this OVA be viewed as a stand-alone? Hardly, you definitely need to have watched Full Moon wo Sagashite to even begin to understand the content and the events in Cute Cute Adventure. If you're reading about this OVA without having seen Full Moon wo Sagashite you're in the wrong place. Begin...with watching Full Moon wo Sagashite (which is highly recommended may I add) before you even consider watching this OVA.Having said all of this, let's get down to the meat. For an OVA, and for Full Moon wo Sagashite in particular - the story is indeed quite below poor. Taking into consideration that the OVA is under 12 minutes however it is easy to conclude that a magnificent story wasn't on the directors' minds when they made it. The OVA is made for more character screen-time alone, and probably not even in the slightest anything else. Actually, which should also be noted, the title makes a good summarization of the contents - kawaii kawaii Adventure. It's cute, and I reckon some of those who have watched Full Moon wo Sagashite will appreciate that.The art is like that of Full Moon wo Sagashite, no complaints at all (I can't give a 10-minute OVA a score over 5 though). It's enjoyable.The sound is, oh, I don't remember if it was the same as the original Full Moon wo Sagashite - but surely it wasn't bad. You won't be able to hear much song variation in a 10-minute clip though, so it never really matters.Overall, it's enjoyable enough. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it (notice that 3 rate) but to those who find Meroko and Takuto and Mitsuki cute in whatever &quot;adventure&quot; they're thrown into I can imagine that watching this OVA will be an enjoyable ride. For those who never really fancied the humour and &quot;kawaiiness&quot; of Full Moon wo Sagashite (no matter if you enjoyed the anime as a whole or not) could still watch this OVA. It's horrible I said? Well, that's true, but it's under 12 minutes so finding an excuse for not watching the OVA will be difficult enough. At least afterwards you can mark all spin-offs derived from Full Moon wo Sagashite off. with watching Full Moon wo Sagashite (which is highly recommended may I add) before you even consider watching this OVA.Having said all of this, let's get down to the meat.

It's worse than Full Moon o Sagashite, which is actually pretty good in my opinion but I'm more of a fan of action and adventure.I feel like this OAV is trying to brainwash me and sometimes to think it's good. This OAV is good for babies and toddlers, I do not think that anyone over the age of about 4 can stand this. The title card is childish!So this OAV is about Mitsuki who oversleeps through her television interview and now she must get to...the interview as Full Moon as fast as she can! I don't think this is a bad idea but this is just completely pointless with some random parts to it. It reminds me of the adventures Mitsuki, Takuto, and Meroko had in the series which isn't anything like them, therefore just cutesy. This isn't even completely like Full Moon o Sagashite.The art and animation are almost completely different even when I read the title, it said Cute Cute Adventure and I thought it was supposed to be interesting because it represents the cuteness of the anime? Plus, it was supposed to be even cuter? Looking at the poster, it makes me even more confident that this was supposed to be even cuter. And when I watched it, this is exactly what I thought, even cuter! Why make it even cuter? The characters were already too cutesy without having to make them even more cutesy!I can hardly remember the music but I remember it being repetitive! I think Mitsuki has a different voice actor because now she sounds like a cutesy anime ten-year-old! What happened to myco? The voice acting was perfect in the series.I think Mitsuki is stupider than she used to be. Why didn't she just go find Takuto and Meroko and ask them to transform her into a teenager instead of trying to sneak in? Even Takuto and Meroko are stupid. Everybody is now different.I must stop writing this review, thinking about this OAV is starting to bore me aside from the series though, while annoying wasn't too bad or much too annoying, it even managed to be quite memorable. This is like even more annoying, how I'm rating it. The series was a beautiful childhood memory now crushed because of this pointless OAV even if the ending was alright. I'm glad it was short.This OAV is so unbelievably unmemorable, everything about it except for the story is, it can even be quickly forgotten. I even forgot the dialogue quickly, part of the reason is because the characters were talking so fast. Just watch the show, it's more fun instead of wasting your time on this OAV. the interview as Full Moon as fast as she can!

I don’t exactly get why they couldn’t transform into their normal Shinigami forms and fly there (subsequently avoiding the dog and bird mishaps), but this little adventure is otherwise alright. Plus, I have to give it props for not being particularly fan-servicey like most OVAs of the same nature.Overall, I’d give this a 6.5 (rounded to 7)/10....Definitely not necessary, but a decent watch if you like the main series.

Getter Robo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3579/Getter_Robo,"['I initially had very little interest or knowledge of super robot animes. About all I knew was that Gundam exists and that was it. Then I got interested in Super Robot Wars (Original Generation, specifically) and when I decided to try some of the non-OG ones, I got interested in some of the various series that appear in said games. One such series that peaked my interest was Getter Robo, thanks to SRW A\'s rather prominent usage of Getter Robo.Story:There isn\'t too much of a story here. To be honest, I do not think it\'s really a strike against the show. It\'s really...just an excuse for Getter Robo to go beat up the monster of the week while the Getter Robo theme blares in the background. In short, it\'s awesome. However, as the show goes on, a certain pattern starts to develop involving characters introduced past the first few episodes which can get somewhat annoying as it falls into predictability.9/10 for story, despite the fact there isn\'t really one. Until the last few episodes, anyway.Art:This is the second oldest anime I\'ve watched as of the time I\'m writing this, so I\'m not too familiar with the ""par"" of 70s anime art. That said, it does what it needs to. Nothing is particularily busy or confusing, most likely because this was made before everything was done in a computer. A lot of frames and sequences get reused but like I said, not surprising considering its age and length.7/10 - Nothing too outstanding, but not bad.Sound:This is one area where Getter Robo excels. It has an epic opening, an epic ending, and lots of great tunes and arrangements of the OP that play during the episode. The audio quality isn\'t the greatest, but well, it\'s going on 54 years old at this point. I usually skip the openings of animes because I don\'t like them all that often, but this was one show where skipping ""Getter Robo!"" would be a silly move.9/10 - It\'s awesome.Characters:They\'re all decent enough, Musashi is often there to provide some comic relief before Monji and his robot are introduced, and well after they are. Ryoma and Hayato are the more serious ones, but even then, they still can joke around.7/10 - They\'re good.Enjoyment:Could be because it\'s the first super robot anime I watched, but I had a great time. I just took it for what it is, a silly, hammy, 70s cartoon about high schoolers beating up dinosaurs. I don\'t think was a time where I was like ""Oh yay. Time for Getter Robo..."" so in very short: I liked it.10/10 - I didn\'t try to take it too seriously. As one shouldn\'t.Overall:If one compares Getter Robo to more modern shows of any type, it\'s terrible. Tons of reused animation, a monster of the week format that becomes quite predictable, and so on. That is somewhat silly though, because Getter Robo didn\'t air in 2020, it aired in 1974. Expectations were different then and it\'s no surprise things have changed since then! It\'s good for it\'s time and personally, I think it\'s still good.

Damn I feel old. Well, sit thee down, young whippersnapper, and let me tell thee a tale while slowly stroking my bumfluff.A long time ago (the 70s) in a land far, far away (Japan).... there were four unrelated super robot anime series and one not-super-robot anime series which got an English adaptation. The adaptation mashed them all together and presented them as an anthology under the umbrella title ""Force Five"". The show would air during weekdays, with a different series being shown each day. The version I watched had ""Force Five:...Starvengers"" on Wednesdays, and that was my favourite. ""Starvengers"" was cobbled together from the anime ""Getter Robo G"", which was the sequel to ""Getter Robo"", and thus we finally get to the subject of this review.[Note: ""Getter Robo G"" is mostly similar to ""Getter Robo"", even sharing the same opening theme, so all the direct comparisons I make between ""Starvengers"" and ""Getter Robo"" in this review are valid even though the former is technically not an adaptation of the latter.]I hunted down the original ""Getter Robo"" in a bout of nostalgia, and like with most shows you remember watching when you were young, it turned out to be (to take a quote from ""Zatch Bell"",) ""very shit"".In fact, it\'s so shit that the first episode is one of the funniest I\'ve ever watched - it had me rolling on the floor as soon as the bombastic vocals ""GAN GAN GAN GAN!"" hit the opening theme. (It seems the English adaptation had wisely removed the vocals.) The entertainment rarely lets up from there on. You know all those anime tropes that gets parodied, like characters\' heads rising from the bottom of the screen when they speak? Well, ""Getter Robo"" seems to contain all of them… it\'s practically a museum of old anime cliches.The premise, comical in its absurdity, is that the dinosaurs have not gone extinct - they\'ve just been hiding underground, biding their time to overthrow humankind as the master race of the planet. They\'ve decided it\'s time to strike, sending a mecha dinosaur or two every week to wreak havoc upon human civilisation. And the only thing capable of stopping them? Getter Robo of course!After being thoroughly entertained for a few episodes, ""Getter Robo"" starts becoming a bit of a drag. Once you get used to its ridiculousness, the show doesn\'t have much else to offer. The formulaic dinosaur-of-the-week gets tiring quickly, and there\'s rarely anything more to the story beyond that. Even the action is boring by today\'s standards: this was, after all, one of the earliest super robot shows that ran for 50+ episodes on a limited budget, so it\'s full of cheap tricks like re-used animation and long, static pans.There are other reasons why ""Getter Robo"" failed to hold up to my memory of ""Starvengers"". For one thing, ""Starvengers"" was based on the sequel ""Getter Robo G"" in which the robots had been upgraded. Even with the upgraded robots, the arsenal was already underwhelming compared to the other ""Force Five"" robots, and here in ""Getter Robo"", the robots\' attacks are so few in number that even when they do something ordinary like a jump, the pilots would pretend it\'s a special move, and be compelled to shout ""GETTER JUMP!""One of the things that made ""Starvengers"" my favourite was the characters. Unfortunately, these don\'t hold up either. The main three pilots are very archetypical characters: the leader, the cool mysterious dude, and the dumb comic-relief fat guy. There\'s also Michiru, who\'s mostly there to add a pretty face and to play the damsel in distress role every so often. Perhaps having these archetypes in combination was rare back then, but when put alongside modern works, these characters really lack depth.But there is one aspect of ""Getter Robo"" which has stood the test of time, and that\'s the robot designs. ""Getter Robo"" is the brain child of the legendary Go Nagai, who pioneered many areas of anime/manga - he pretty much invented the super robot genre. Being one of the very first super robot shows is probably why the robots of ""Getter Robo"" are so lacking in special moves, but it also means the show contains a lot of innovations. Astoundingly, some of them still remain fresh today. ""Getter Robo"" is known as one of the first works to feature combining robots. But while combining robots won\'t raise many eyebrows these days, there are still hardly any anime that combine the way Getter Robo did.The way Getter Robo worked was: the three main characters each pilot their own ship, and the ships combine into a giant robot. The interesting part is that they can combine in three different ways into three distinct giant robots. But wait! There\'s more!! These giant robots - uninspiringly named ""Getter-1"", ""Getter-2"", ""Getter-3"" - each uses a different lead pilot, and have different specialties (amusingly they even look like their respective lead pilots). For example, ""Getter-2"" is really fast and can fight underground; ""Getter-3"" is physically strong, and specialises in underwater combat. This means that, given vastly different situations, the pilots can use different robots to get the job done. How cool is that?! This is probably the main reason why ""Force Five: Starvengers"" was my favourite - having lots of special attacks may be cool, but multi-combines are even cooler!But even though the awesome designs of the robot sustained my enthusiasm as a child, it\'s no longer enough to salvage the show for me now. Getting through the 50+ episodes of ""Getter Robo"" was a painfully boring experience at times, and I suspect most audiences today would feel the same. I can perhaps still recommend ""Getter Robo"" to super robot enthusiasts, and certainly as a historical artefact because it\'s such an important and influential work. But everyone else should just watch a couple of episodes to get a good laugh, then move on.Personal rating: -2.0 (""very shit"") Starvengers"" on Wednesdays, and that was my favourite.

It may contain errors due to the translator.This is literally an anime for those who want to watch robots fight every episode, with the enemy of the week.Getter Robo is a classic from the 70\'s produced by Toei Animation, which made many other classics based on the manga by Go Nagai (exemple: Cutey Honey, which is also the enemy of the week).Since this anime is the formula for the enemy of the week, I don\'t expect anything more than this, because I know it won\'t be.For many, just being the enemy of the week is a defect. Well, I can...understand it, because at some point it gets boring to watch, because it is very repetitive. If those who watch it can adapt to the formula, they can enjoy this kind of anime very well, because it has many good episodes.And you have to take into consideration that it is an anime from 1974. In the 70s it was common anime with this enemy of the week formula.Since it is a mecha anime, we expect good fights. Well, in Getter Robo there are plenty of fights, and most of them are good and even creative, even if they are limited to the same attacks that the main characters do.Taking advantage of the fact that there are fights every episode, I can briefly talk about the animation.The animation is not bad. Yes, it is dated and quite limited because of the budget, which probably wasn\'t much. Well, the fights don\'t have static frames, and there is always animation when you need it. You can enjoy it a lot if you just want to see robot fights, considering the standard of the 70s.The characters in this Getter series are good.Ryouma in this Getter Robo series is not as ""badass"" as in others. For example: he is afraid of heights (there is an episode where he does everything to overcome this), and he also has compassion for others.I want to highlight him in episode 9, where he doesn\'t let the enemy die because he is not armed. And this is used for a message about a little bit of human nature (of course, we all know it\'s not quite like that in all cases in real life).Hayato in this Getter Robo series is still ""badass"", but not that badass.He has his background in one episode, and I confess it was unexpected for me, because of his personality.Musashi in this series is very fearful, but I like the way he is. He is very spiteful (and fearful), but he is a good person.I honestly don\'t have much to say about him.Michiru doesn\'t get much of a spotlight, because the highlight is Ryouma, Hayato and Musashi piloting the robots and fighting the enemy of the week. Even without much emphasis, I like her.The other characters are not even worth mentioning.Well, when I finish watching it, I will edit this review with my final conclusion. So far the anime is ok. understand it, because at some point it gets boring to watch, because it is very repetitive.

Hanyou no Yashahime: Sengoku Otogizoushi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41911/Hanyou_no_Yashahime__Sengoku_Otogizoushi,"['I\'m not gonna mince my words: if you\'re a fan of Inuyasha, please STOP at The Final Act and don\'t pursue Yashahime thereafter, and this is coming from a hardcore fan who has grown up with Inuyasha since its inception. Call me biased, but this was to be expected.It\'s been more than a decade since Sunrise gave us quite the finale to one of the most beloved series of legendary mangaka Rumiko Takahashi\'s works, but the resurgence with Hanyou no Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon, only proves that both the production staff team (the original Inuyasha staff for that matter, minus the original creator herself) behind this...sequel at Sunrise only knows the term ""cash-cow"", and milk this show all they want, because all the charm of the original is (almost) completely gone, and I wouldn\'t blame you if the emotions and feelings are mutual. What a behest of an insult to injury to the word called ""nostalgia"", it sure does feel a time to be alive to fans who only constantly get shot on the foot when old shows like this make a comeback to only make a mockery of themselves. At least Japan was more adamant on the positive side, so a Season 2 (or rather appropriately, a continuation) is coming soon, but let\'s not get ahead of ourselves.If I can give a TL;DR to what Yashahime is all about, let me put it in a non-spoiler context of the entire Inuyasha series: there is this jewel called the Shikon Jewel, and for anyone who possesses it shall be granted maximus power of their wielding, be it good or evil. And if you are experienced with battle Shounen stories back in the day, Inuyasha is no different with trying to gather pieces of the shattered Shikon Jewel from the vast world that is the Warring States Era. Gather them all and save the world from evil and destruction, pretty typical stuff. Yashahime\'s foundation of the story and plot is one and the same of Inuyasha\'s, just with the difference of the shattering of the Shikon Jewel being Rainbow Jewels with the same after-effects and what-have-you. Obviously, since this is classified as a sequel of sorts (that\'s carried forward straight from the post-events of The Final Act), there\'s the usual cameos of Inuyasha characters, albeit those that are worth the time and importance to Yashahime\'s story. Otherwise, everything else about it is all new, albeit (again) that if you\'re watched even an episode of Inuyasha, it definitely feels right back at home with the fascination of the series as a whole.The story plot of Yashahime is clearly an ode to Naruto in the most blatant way of how Boruto came to be, heck I\'ll even go as far to rename this show to Yashahime: Inuyasha Next Generations - ""The Spin-off/Sequel Everyone Asked For But Sucks"", despite being made as an original as compared to Boruto\'s manga source material counterpart...IMO not as appalling as how Boruto was, but it\'s by no means a consolation of condolences. Clearly, the best points of what we got to see from this show is the next generation of the original cast: the trio of half-demon princess girls Moroha (Inuyasha and Kagome\'s child), Towa and Setsuna (Sesshomaru and Rin\'s twin children, though the former\'s nonchalance is prevalent from the get-go), along with returning characters like the protector Grandma Kaede, Sesshomaru and Jaken, plus many others who make the return to nostalgic goodness...at least for the beginning. The new storyline with converging worlds of Feudal and modern Japan (that\'s obviously connected with the Sacred Tree of Ages), not gonna lie, that was a cool concept that fans would\'ve wished to see in the original series, and we definitely got it here.Alas, everything else just seems like the usual with Sunrise\'s decent visuals and animation, but with scriptwriting that\'s cringe levels of terribad. Let\'s break it down:- The Dream Butterfly itself being a connection to both Towa and Setsuna\'s past memories of dissent (that was awoken without any hint of past life), that was the only driven plot that somehow was half-assed (and eventually half-baked) due to the slow pace and progression of the plot. Not like Inuyasha can evade faults on this aspect, because the former also does side events like these, but not to point where it feels condescending, solely due to Rumiko Takahashi\'s incredible storytelling that manages to keep fans engaged for the most part, even when it feels dull. Sadly, with Yashahime without the direction of Rumiko Takahashi, the word ""nostalgia"" is anything but a saving grace.- The characters: Obviously, fans would\'ve wondered that the OG pairings got together and did the deed, that was also a large selling point for Yashahime\'s beginning points as well. But as the show progresses, the subsequent feeling of cold feet of them being one-sided plot-centric focal pointers becomes more obvious. Moroha is easily the biggest mistake: From emitting the same nuisance behaviour (like how Inuyasha was), to being relegated as a side character with no proper potential development, holding daily conversations with regulars like raccoon Takechiyo, bounty hunter master Jyubei and killing demons to earn money. All of that, despite being a MAIN character alongside twins Towa and Setsuna. If my speculations are right, Towa inherited Rin\'s kindness and naiveté while Setsuna inherited Sesshomaru\'s nonchalance, which comes to serve as both a boon and bane in the journey to pickup and pursuit the truth of the Dream Butterfly\'s significance.- As much as I love the original cast return all grown-up, that I find to be the only above-average decency for Yashahime as a whole. Taking demon slayers Kohaku and Hisui (Sango and Miroku\'s love child) as an example: talk about following the job legacy of Sango whilst not having the perverse effect of Miroku is a welcome surprise to see more of characters like Hisui, that once again, is heavily skewed upon nostalgia values.- The villains...are a serious downgrade when compared to Inuyasha. Kirinmaru, Zero and ""The Four Perils"" aren\'t quite the levels of Naraku and his ""offsprings"", and the ""pirate washed ashore"" Riku is just your average typical generic meditator-cum-spy. Sure, there are some moments that seemed just fine even without the lore of Inuyasha (that frankly Yashahime does not need to imitate, and that\'s fine), but dear heavens, I\'ve seen quite the detraction of badly-written characters, and the villany aspirations are just existent, but only when the plot serves to plate it as such. ""Meh, Meh, Black Sheep, have you any (black) wool"" as I\'ll describe it.The OST is also...just decent, given for a new generation that also does not need to try to mimic all the bells and whistles of the original, and that\'s also OK for the most part since I wasn\'t expecting V6\'s ""Change the World"" levels of nostalgic brilliance. For the most part, the OPs handed down from current boybands SixTONES and NEWS, I\'d prefer the latter any day as it fits the series\' more action-heavy tonals, while the EDs are just as decently sounding as to be expected. Overall, just some fine music, but also easily forgettable.Even with another sequel currently in production (as of the time of this review), I will give a preface to the general audience: whether or not you love or hate Yashahime to a degree, that\'s not for me to decide the enjoyment values that you\'ll get out of this show. From an anime-only perspective of people wondering what Yashahime is about, please start with Inuyasha (even if it takes you eons to finish the 10-year journey from the beginning to the Final Act, plus the canon movies), then come back to this and see how you feel about it.You\'ve tried, Yashahime...no, you should\'ve tried harder. Until next time when the continuation sequel drops, I\'m gonna keep my expectations low to exact the same ""wash, rinse, repeat"" action sequence once again, if it helps qualm the stacked amount of worries. Not the best, but it\'s nowhere as pathetic as it looks. sequel at Sunrise only knows the term ""cash-cow"", and milk this show all they want, because all the charm of the original is (almost) completely gone, and I wouldn\'t blame you if the emotions and feelings are mutual.

Not the best, but it\'s nowhere as pathetic as it looks.', ""Hanyou no Yashahime was a mistake. There I said it.I never was a huge fan of Inuyasha but I did like that series, it was a big part of my childhood and I just liked all the variety of characters there! If you miss Inuyasha, don't watch this serier, go and rewatch original one, I promise you, you will have way more fun than watching 24 episodes of Yashahime.Although the main 3 characters aren't exactly terrible, they are not very entertaining either, somehow their interactions aren't enjoyable to watch, they are just plain boring. Something really is lacking. I don't know if it's because it's...only three girls and there is no male or fun sidekick to just balance them out, it just doesn't work for me. As single characters, I see nothing wrong with Towa, Setsuna and Moroha but as a group, they just don't work right. Tanuki character adds nothing, he's just a rip-off Shippo but less funny.Story is very very boring. Nothing exciting happens, nothing suprises you, it's bland. Now I didn't really like plot in original Inuyasha's series either but it still was way better than whatever they threw in the script of Yashahime.Now you may see that I gave it 1/10. Is it 1/10? No, it's really not. It is at least 4/10 probably but I am biased and I will keep this low score. Main reason is that I find the ship Sesshomaru x Rin turning canon as something very inappropriate. I saw how people defend it that it is a different era and this used to be normal etc. Just because something used to be 'normal', doesn't mean it was  supposed to be treated that way. I won't write a whole paragraph of reasons why this ship shouldn't have happened, many people before me has already done that. I don't like it, it ruined this mediocre show for me, I don't regret giving this series 1/10.Go watch better shows, don't waste your time on upcoming sequel. only three girls and there is no male or fun sidekick to just balance them out, it just doesn't work for me. As single characters, I see nothing wrong with Towa, Setsuna and Moroha but as a group, they just don't work right. Tanuki character adds nothing, he's just a rip-off Shippo but less funny.Story is very very boring. Nothing exciting happens, nothing suprises you, it's bland. Now I didn't really like plot in original Inuyasha's series either but it still was way better than whatever they threw in the script of Yashahime.Now you may see that I gave it 1/10. Is it 1/10? No, it's really not. It is at least 4/10 probably but I am biased and I will keep this low score. Main reason is that I find the ship Sesshomaru x Rin turning canon as something very inappropriate. I saw how people defend it that it is a different era and this used to be normal etc. Just because something used to be 'normal', doesn't mean it was  supposed to be treated that way. I won't write a whole paragraph of reasons why this ship shouldn't have happened, many people before me has already done that. I don't like it, it ruined this mediocre show for me, I don't regret giving this series 1/10.Go watch better shows, don't waste your time on upcoming sequel."", ""There's 7 episodes out now of Yashahime, the nostalgia driven sequel to Inuyasha. At first, I thought it was turning out better than a sequel of this type had any right to be. The new protagonists, are quite likable, and Moraha in particular, will surely be a fan favorite. And they really made this show an ode to the original. Same voice actors, same style eye catches, same music, same spoilerific previews. Though twenty years have past since Inuyasha's debut, Yashahime feels just the same, as if no time had passed since the Final Act's last episode. But then... as the show started getting into...its plot, unfortunately I started to realize, the nostalgia and the characters are the only good things about it, since the writing is TERRIBLE.There's constant leaps of logic, where characters either have knowledge of what's happening that they shouldn't have, or characters go along with what's happening because the story requires it, and not because it makes any sense for their point of view or personal motivations.  Other things feel like they aren't really explained because they're tropes or plot points established in the original series that writers felt obligated to follow.  The story simply flits between one thing and the next in a rather disjointed fashion, because the writers very clearly had a starting point and an ultimate destination in mind, but just have no idea how to get from point A to point B. The writers also completely flubbed giving the girls any sort of driving motivation, other than Towa's desire to restore Setsuna's memories, which the other two don't share. A big bad was introduced, but the girls immediately rejected taking up the quest to defeat him. Which could have been an interesting choice, except the show feels completely aimless as a result.On top of all that, their parents, that is, the original show's cast, are very conspicuously absent, and it's getting more and more contrived why they are never mentioned, and why the girls seem unconcerned that their parents are gone. The writers made the decision to hold back on that, most probably to tease the audience, but the longer it goes on, the more it feels forced, and the longer we have to endure this crappy writing about them wandering around aimlessly, when really we all know that mystery is what the audience really cares about.In conclusion, only fans of the original Inuyasha could possibly like this show, but even then, be prepared for some really poor writing. its plot, unfortunately I started to realize, the nostalgia and the characters are the only good things about it, since the writing is TERRIBLE.There's constant leaps of logic, where characters either have knowledge of what's happening that they shouldn't have, or characters go along with what's happening because the story requires it, and not because it makes any sense for their point of view or personal motivations.

And honestly? It delivered.Do I really think this show deserves a 10?No. I would say it is an overall solid 8. But damn I enjoyed this show ways more than I ever thought I would. So I\'ll keep my 10.Now, about Hanyou no Yashahime.It starts giving us a little bit of what happened after Inuyasha with the old cast and then we have our new generation cast to take the show. And I can...say that the entire new cast is pretty enjoyable and we frequently have some nostalgia moments with our old friends showing up once in a while (sometimes personally, sometimes in flashbacks).At the start, the pace is kinda fast on how things are dealed easily but that only adds to our 3 heroines, as they develop upon that. I would say that Moroha is one of the most enjoyable characters of the first half of the anime. From the second half onwards, we get more details of what happened and why a lot of things changed. With that, Sesshoumaru gets more screen time as well.As Moroha is pretty enjoyable, is important to notice that ever since this anime got announced, it was stated that this would be ""Sesshoumaru\'s daughters\' story"". Every single episode starts talking about ""Towa and Setsuna"", so it got me surprised on how people would constantly complain that in some moments, the two of them would get more screen time than Moroha. She is part of the main cast, but this is not her show.About Towa and Setsuna. The other two of our new main heroines.Sesshoumaru\'s twin daughters and the center of this anime\'s plot. I love Setsuna\'s design as she is basically a female version of Sesshoumaru. Her more cool character that actually hides a huge dere inside remember very well her father too. The way she learns to trust Towa and even Moroha only adds to her development and she was my favorite character of this entire show.Said that, is Towa who gets more attention for the most of the time. Even though all three are half demon Yashahime (Moroha is actually a fourth of a demon), she is clearly THE main character here. We don\'t see her change too much like Setsuna, but still she is a lovely character who cares a lot about her friends and specially her sister. Some people complain about she being too naïve or making some stupid decisions, but lets be fair, the old Inuyasha characters had a lot of this derp moments as well. This isn\'t something new to the series.About the villains.Though the side villains are quite annoying (and honestly, this is another thing that is not new to the series), the main ""bad guys"" are pretty much likeable.I don\'t have the same ""shit I want this guy dead so hard"" feeling I used to have when Naraku was the main villain. Instead, I feel the new characters the same way I felt his creations were in the original manga. They were enemies that needed to be fought, but they still have something likeable about them (damn I cried when Kagura died back then).They are interesting characters and every one of them have and objective in mind and I enjoyed a lot seeing our heroines fighting them during this show. Sesshoumaru showing some times added more intensity and nostalgia to the whole setting.Finally, the plot.This is where things get a bit confusing for some people when it comes to the anime\'s pace.We usually have some episodes to add development to the main cast and them some episodes to give us a bit more of background of what\'s going on. These changes made some people feel it was rushed sometimes and super slow other times.In my opinion? Even though it felt a bit fast at the start, it was pretty well balanced overall.For last, I would like to point out that if there is something I didn\'t liked about this anime, it was episode 19. Would recommend everyone who plans to watch this show to just skip that. I am still trying to understand exactly what were they planning with that, can\'t even call it a filler. Though, there certainly are people who loved that, so I\'ll respect everyone\'s opinion.

Spots where you can see a good idea, an interesting possible character exploration, etc and it just doesnt follow through on any of those. This series has only nostalgia going for it, and for someone who really only cared about the original was tbh, because of this ships, this show has none of that. You might think that maybe the original cast popping up here and there could fix things with a burst of nostalgia, but no. The original cast has all but disappeared...after the first episode (Which is a flashback for little/no reason) and what has happened to them is treated as a big mystery box that the actual characters, despite being their family/origins etc, they could honestly give a damn about.Now that is interesting in how they characters view it, but what it ends up leaving the show with is three leads who buy and large go down to this basic formula (As of episode 9):Moroha: Wants to actually do somethingTowa: Will only go along with it b/c what moroha wants to do somehow ties back to her goal of restoring her sister\'s memoriesThird girl (I honestly forgot her name. She has that little bearing on anything): Will go along with whatever Towa wants to do  bc reasons. Despite stating previously that she doesnt remember or care about towa or moroha. But will be there to do her cyclone attack but never the finishing blow.Thats really it. Two of the three characters really have little to no bearing on what happens in a given episode or where they go. Now, they will disagree with what  moroha wants to do initially, but they\'ll eventually do what she wants to do anyway, because reasons.The biggest thing that bothers me about it though is the pacing. This show is quick. Way quicker than the original show at least. The central conflict thus far has the three characters going around killing what are called  ""The Four Perils"". Thing is, these perils are described as basically generals in the army of the guy who (presumably) killed Inuyasha and Kagome. Sound like pretty tough folks right? With one exception, all of them are killed in a single episode. And most of the time its just by happenstance that they run into the Perils. Theres no planning, no searching, nothing. Literally theres a character who fast travels them directly to the Peril\'s base to go kill them. Its ridiculous, and I hate it. Maybe im just too used to the original series, but why would they even bother making a nostalgia based sequel series if they weren\'t going to try to mimic as much of what people enjoyed about the original as possible?Also the OP sucks more ass than Donkey from Shrek\'s Vaccuum.3/10 after the first episode (Which is a flashback for little/no reason) and what has happened to them is treated as a big mystery box that the actual characters, despite being their family/origins etc, they could honestly give a damn about.Now that is interesting in how they characters view it, but what it ends up leaving the show with is three leads who buy and large go down to this basic formula (As of episode 9):Moroha: Wants to actually do somethingTowa: Will only go along with it b/c what moroha wants to do somehow ties back to her goal of restoring her sister\'s memoriesThird girl (I honestly forgot her name.

This review will contain spoilers.Yashahime went back and forth from being decent. I love the girls and their dynamic, which is very different from what I expected it to be. Moroha is charming and feral. Towa is earnest and soft, which is the opposite vibe I got from her design. Setsuna is straight laced and serious like her father, which wasn't the vibe from her design, but I actually liked being surprised.The cameos from other characters were fun and I liked how even not knowing their parents, the girls are intertwined...in Kagome's family one way or another. I loved that they were all connected that way, whether they realized it or not.The story definitely has pacing issues, trying to lengthen its run time with stories of hunting down demons that are less interesting than what everyone is here for: to find out what happened to the girls' parents. While I didn't watch far enough to uncover this true, news has spread down the grapevine that a certain dog demon is confirmed to have groomed and performed pedophilic actions is neither okay nor acceptable, even in fiction, in my opinion.Yashahime had a lot of potential as an enjoyable show where you can just turn your brain off and relax, but I can't even do that now. Total score is a 1: do better Japan, pedophilia is not okay in any context. in Kagome's family one way or another.

It’s disgusting how in episode one they show her at age 11 worshipping the adult man she trusts, only to portray her 4 years later having his children.

You know, I\'m a huge Inuyasha fan since my 11 years old and when the notice of Yashahime came I was super happy, I put a lot of expectations because I like Sunrise works and the previous series. Well, right now I\'m terribly disappointed. Let me explain some points about this (IT CONTAIN SPOILERS):1. Even the art and sound are pretty good, they\'re nothing amazing. You can easily enjoy what you see but when it comes to the story and when you think about it deeper......That was a poorly written. The Rainbow Pearls, the Dream Butterfly, it\'s just too basic, we needed creativity here!2. The main characters are very boring, specially Towa. They don\'t have convincible ambitions, most of the episodes don\'t show us too much about their growth as characters. And the random adventures couldn\'t put much enjoyment to me.3. Kirinmaru, Zero, Riku... All the villains and antagonists are pretty boring too. Nothing you can compare with Naraku, Kagura and the others, it\'s just anything with a ""cool"" design they can use as a villain. Nothing really exciting.4. Yashahime let me thinking, we have some big holes in the script. Like Kaede knows Setsuna and Moroha a long ago, right? Kaede knows Miroku and Sango. And everyone knows Inuyasha and Kagome. So how can Moroha doesn\'t know about them? We have all the daddy issues of Towa and Setsuna with Sesshoumaru, Moroha knows this and NEVER questioned herself about her parents? In 24 episodes it was never mentioned. And, by far, this was so dirty with Inuyasha and his whole family story, when he could be genuinely happy with Kagome and their daughter, he got sealed in a dumb way. Alright, I doubt they can really explain this in another season.5. And about the old characters/organizations too! Miroku looked so pathetic, we had just some seconds of Sango... Miroku, in the end of Inuyasha, was so happy with Sango and their family. We were robbed again. We got more devil slayers, but no time for them too. Does someone remembers Shippou? A shame, really.I won\'t even talk about Sesshoumaru and Rin\'s relationship in this anime, that was so GROSS.I don\'t really believe or care for scores in anime, I\'m just putting 2 in overall because... Yeah, it feels right. Thats was my opinion, probably won\'t go watch the next season. Sorry for any mistakes, English isn\'t my native language! That was a poorly written.

Sorry for any mistakes, English isn\'t my native language!', 'As many fans who watched this show, I grew up watching Inuyasha and loved it so much that my imaginary characters were Inuyasha and the gang. When I heard about it getting a sequel I admit that I was worried that it would be trash...and boy was I right.1) Yashahime relied a bit too heavily on nostalgia and that\'s the only ship that kept it sailing, I\'ll tell you that. We have Moroha who is the daughter of Kagome & Inuyasha, she has a nice balance of their personality and could have been extremely interesting but sadly gets treated as the butt of the joke....We have Seshomaru\'s twins, Setsuna has the same exact personality as her father, she\'s aloof, quiet and prefer workings alone. She had potential but was also cast out. Then we have the older twin, Towa, who was raised by Kagome\'s family in the modern world and for me, she\'s the biggest problem. She\'s naive, whines all the time and only knows how to say ""Setsuna! Setsuna! Setsuna! Waahhhh"" from episode 1-24 her character does not change in the least. The series tries bringing back some of the old cast...and by that I mean Kagome\'s brother who is now married, with his own family and raised Towa [this is episode 1] we have Kagome\'s family for like...2 episodes. Then we have Miroku for like 2 episodes but that was weak. We get hints of the other characters like Sesshy but there just isn\'t enough.There was no character development from the very beginning, unlike Inuyasha where they each had an interesting backstory and they grew. I admit Inuyasha wasn\'t perfect but for me personally the characters were what made me keep coming back, even the villains grew on me. We had Naraku who used to love Kikyo when he was human before turning evil and we had his offsprings. In Yashamime we are meant to have Kirinmaru and the 4 perils who are so weak that its laughable. Riku starts off interesting and then becomes one dimensional.2) Storytelling/ Plot: This was the biggest reason for my low score after the characters. The plot well maybe at the beginning is something about finding the dream butterfly for Setsuna but it seems the writer forgot that they set that as the plot, we are also meant to find out what happened to the old cast, why Rin is sleeping or dead in the holy tree where Inuyasha once slept for 50 years. The monsters are weak and get destroyed within 1 episode, the girls all get crazy power without explanation. One moment we are talking about Rin, the next it seems to be forgotten and Towa is going ""Setsuna! Setsuna! Setsuna! Wahhhh!!!"" After 24 episodes we learn almost nothing at all and go back to the beginning.3)The art was okay, it wasn\'t terrible but it wasn\'t amazing either. Episode 24 was a laugh for me when they decided to go crazy with it. Music is nothing at all like Inuyasha where we had songs like ""My Will"", ""Dear"" and so many amazing ones that even now after more than 20 years, I still listen to. There is only so many times I can hear the screech of ""We are going higher"" before wanting to puke and rip off my ears. The ending song was nothing special, not memorable at all. I wish they had music like Inuyasha which for me personally was one of the places that it had shined.4) Enjoyment...if you\'ve read this far its probably obvious that I did not enjoy this show. From the first day they released the first episode until today (03/20/2021) when we got the last episode of the first season...I was left disappointed. I kept going back due to nostalgia and because I hoped it would get better but time after time I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth and wishing I knew who the writer was and how to reach out to them so that I could curse them out and teach them how to write. This felt like a little kid trying to write a fanfiction, its like comparing it to the trash of Fifty Shades of w/e. Even Boruto with all of its fault was better and that\'s saying something. I feel like the writer should get fired and that we should get someone that at least has a plot. What is the reason for having the 3 girls? What is their purpose for existing? What is the reason for their enemies existing? Why are they important? We don\'t have any of that.Overall my score is 1/10, am I being harsh? Yes, I am. At best I\'d give it a 2/10 since Setsuna, Moroha and some of the other characters had potential and the animation was alright but that\'s all it has.If you are a fan of the original Inuyasha DO NOT WATCH THIS! At best, watch episode 1-2 and stop there, please. But hey, if you are a masochist or want to treat this as a terrible show to watch and learn what NOT to do, give it a go as well. We have Seshomaru\'s twins, Setsuna has the same exact personality as her father, she\'s aloof, quiet and prefer workings alone. She had potential but was also cast out. Then we have the older twin, Towa, who was raised by Kagome\'s family in the modern world and for me, she\'s the biggest problem.

I wish they had music like Inuyasha which for me personally was one of the places that it had shined.4) Enjoyment...if you\'ve read this far its probably obvious that I did not enjoy this show. From the first day they released the first episode until today (03/20/2021) when we got the last episode of the first season...I was left disappointed. I kept going back due to nostalgia and because I hoped it would get better but time after time I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth and wishing I knew who the writer was and how to reach out to them so that I could curse them out and teach them how to write. This felt like a little kid trying to write a fanfiction, its like comparing it to the trash of Fifty Shades of w/e. Even Boruto with all of its fault was better and that\'s saying something. I feel like the writer should get fired and that we should get someone that at least has a plot. What is the reason for having the 3 girls? What is their purpose for existing? What is the reason for their enemies existing? Why are they important? We don\'t have any of that.Overall my score is 1/10, am I being harsh? Yes, I am. At best I\'d give it a 2/10 since Setsuna, Moroha and some of the other characters had potential and the animation was alright but that\'s all it has.If you are a fan of the original Inuyasha DO NOT WATCH THIS! At best, watch episode 1-2 and stop there, please. But hey, if you are a masochist or want to treat this as a terrible show to watch and learn what NOT to do, give it a go as well.', 'What could have been a great show...but wasn\'t. I wasn\'t even expecting it to be better than the original Inuyasha, but god this sequel is terrible.** Note for new viewers: If you haven\'t figured it out, this is a SEQUEL to Inuyasha, so yes, you\'d have to watch Inuyasha to know who the original characters are. **That being said, as I\'ve just finished watching Episode 11, my disappointment in this show has grown tremendously. If anything, this sequel feels more like someone\'s failed fanfiction. I will go over a few things below.The reason fans were excited about this sequel was because of seeing our beloved...original characters living their life. They\'ve brought back some or most of the original VAs, so why use them so little in the sequel? I understand that this show is focused on the new characters, however, what I don\'t understand is why the show is trying so hard to disassociate them from the original characters. Seriously, all this time they\'ve spent with Kaede and they still have no idea what kind of parents they had LMAO The writers make it seem like the daughters have nothing to do with their parents. I also don\'t get the attitude for that... The entire show, the daughters question about their parents, but when it matters or when they have a chance, they suddenly couldn\'t care less. It\'s like the writer\'s own characters are going out-of-character LOLSecondly, the writers used a cheap trick of killing off their parents. (Not a spoiler since this was already talked about when Yashahime was announced and also we still don\'t really know). There\'s better ways to do a sequel, and killing off characters randomly without even a reason isn\'t one of them.Third; there\'s no plot. I would\'ve been satisfied if this was a slice of life or a series of episodes for all their battles, kind of how Inuyasha was when they weren\'t worrying about the Shikon Jewel. But it\'s really confusing. Even as an avid Inuyasha fan, a lot of the things in this show don\'t make sense or aren\'t even explained. The writers have failed to asked themselves, what is the purpose of the 3 daughters? What is their individual purpose? When watching this show, it\'s painfully obvious how there\'s no clear direction.Fourth; as I mentioned earlier, this show seriously feels like someone\'s failed fanfiction. There\'s so many things that don\'t make sense? Rainbow pearls? Okay, so there\'s 3 of them---wait there\'s actually at least 7 of them?? Doesn\'t even explain where tf the rainbow pearls came to be, why each daughter has it plus random monsters/""Perils"". At least we understood how the Shikon Jewel came to be! If you\'re going to introduce something new, you better have a story for it!Unfortunately, the writers couldn\'t take a hint from the original show and do a little story narration at the beginning, like Inuyasha. Would have saved all this pointless confusion and lack of organization.And so we go to the last point; storytelling. This show is doing is really terrible job at telling the story. As someone mentioned, the pace is all over the place, often times too quick. If Towa thought it was hard to leave her modern family, you would think she\'d brood over it for at least 2 episodes, considering how impactful and important her modern family is to her. But no, within 3 minutes she easily makes the decision and that\'s it lolI don\'t know if Rumiko was involved in the making of the story? I thought she only did their character design. But yeah, whoever wrote the story for this show is definitely not an actual fan of Inuyasha... Writing is poor, takes way too many shortcuts, hopes ____ and ____ make sense at this certain time when it never did.Really the only thing this show has going for it is the nostalgia of the original characters and teasing the audience in hopes we\'ll see them (i can assure by ep. 11, we still won\'t). original characters living their life.

Why does everyone feel so human to me?These questions are left hanging in the air after every episode of Yashahime in my eyes. They have powers they do not earn, they don't really do much with them, and there is no plot to comment on. I cannot recommend watching it unless you are very curious as to how much worse it can get, as I am.As other reviews have stated, it feels like poorly written fanfiction that should have just stayed as that. We still don't know why we should care about these dang pearls, why their journey...means anything, and where this pasta stain on the wall is spreading to.I wanted to like this, and now I end up hate watching this series :/Enjoyable to hate watch with a friend though! means anything, and where this pasta stain on the wall is spreading to.I wanted to like this, and now I end up hate watching this series :/Enjoyable to hate watch with a friend though!"", 'PLEASE READ!This anime was the best thing/news from 2020 for me!People need to understand a few things:-This anime is NOT Inuyasha. People need to stop complaining that you don\'t see the original cast in every damn episode.-People that complain about the story leaving you wondering, don\'t actually wait for things to unfold and to see WHY something is the way it is. There are so many good animes that at first make no sense, like Ghost in The Shell, yet at the end everything makes sense and you realise how good the anime is.By no way am I saying that Yashahime rises to the level...of such anime. It\'s not even the same genre. But my point it to wait until everything unfolds. Yes, Yashahime is NOT the best anime out there and is not even close to being one of the best,at least not at this point, but it CLEARLY does not deserve 1 star.-People who bash the Rin x Sesshomaru relationship have HUGE DOUBLE STANDARDS. In the original anime Inuyasha, Sango was a minor. Miroku was like 19 years old at the start of Inuyasha. Sango gave birth at the age of 17-18. Miroku would be a child gr**mer or a p*dophile because Sango was underage when they were in a relationship and because he actually ""grew"" with her possibly influenting her decisions. Sesshomaru on the other hand only interacted with Rin while she was a child for several months, not even a year. He barely comunicated with her, told her to go live with humans. He did not ask her things about herself to try and know her better, he did not manipulate her in any way and he even left her to live with Kaede to ""make her own decisions"" in the future. RIN decided to tag along with him. He never ever asked her to join him. He never ever acted like a father figure to her! Jaken was the father fighure tu her, something you can see in the episode 15.Inuyasha is a 150+ year old demon in a relationship with an underage girl, Kagome, but that was always ok with people. Same Koga promising Ayame to mary her when she gets older.- The actual reason people are offended by the Rin x Sesshomaru couple is because Sesshomaru LOOKS 19. If he looked like Shippo or like Rin\'s age people wouldn\'t complaing. That\'s why they don\'t complain about Inuyasha x Kagome. Because they LOOK THE SAME AGE.BUT THEY ARE NOT! People saying that Inuyasha is physically and MENTALLY 15 is dellusional. How can a being that lives for 150 years be mentally 15??? Yes, he is sometimes immature and headstrong. He is like this because he doesn\'t enjoy showing his emotions. He literally lives for 150 years. He cannot be 15 years old mentally! He is 150 years old mentally! Every experience he had in 150 years matured or changed him. Him being mentally 15 years old means he literally did not mentally evolve for eyery ten years! Like his stagnates mentally for 10 years! That is absolute absurd! In 10 years he can have SO many experiences that change him! It\'s absurd!By the same standards that these people call Sesshomaru x Rin a p*edo relationship, other relationships are the same or EVEN WORSE, because Sesshomaru is the only one that did not influence his wife\'s decisions!- Even if the wife younger than 17-18, IT\'S THE FEUDAL ERA where people were barely getting to their 30\'s. After becoming fertile, women were already marying and making kids since their husbands were working and providing and the women were taking care of kids. There were no ""careers"" back then that women were aspiring for. Stop being mad for an anime being historically accurate!I cannot believe there are people who give this anime 1 star just because they cannot understand a ship in an anime! These people don\'t even wait for the story to unfold! The ACTUAL AGE of some of the characters, including RIN was not announced!!!! The way her relationship with Sesshomaru evolves was not shown yet! Their love story is not shown yet guys!!! of such anime. It\'s not even the same genre.

It all just feels too perfectly fitting with the time travel. And they barely have troubles to go back and forth, even though it...was just once both ways. Now the viewer got a brief explanation of the story from the tree spirit, which also offers a quest the girls don’t want. So, they deny. Now somehow Setsuna & Towa do stuff together, even though Setsuna has no interest in doing so and Moroha does her own thing most of the time.There is nothing for the viewer to really focus on (like some kind of goal) because at some point they just fight random demons, and it doesn\'t contribute to the story. And except Towa we have no one who is interested in catching that butterfly so why should the viewer be?The only thing we get to know is that Moroha wants to collect money, because she must pay herself free (??). (Instead of just running away? idk.) And by earning that money it somehow always ties up with Setsunas and Towas Story, so they walk around as trio, but it doesn\'t feel like one.The pacing is way too fast. Ep 18 just released, and they already faced the main antagonist. They barely needed any time to fight these 4 Demons, but also there was no actual point in fighting them anyways? No one helped with the butterfly and there was also no money earned. You can just watch them wander around, face a demon, beat it, earn nothing and next episode the same cycle starts again.Also to the throwbacks: They want to make you believe that SESSHOMARU, the guy who found Rin as a little kid, dead. Was making babys with her? And then he just took the kids and barely someone complained? He took two newborn babies and put them in a forest on their own and you want to tell me no one even tried to make him stop?? Ok.Character (4):Setsuna and Moroha really got most of their personality traits from their dads. It is kind of cool to be like ""oh that\'s what InuYasha would do as well"" and I think it is normal to have personality traits of your parents. But not when you have literally never seen them?Setsuna is not interested in anything and her ""story"" is literally the whole plot. Towa somehow feels a deep connection to Setsuna, even though they also barely saw each other. They do go on their way to catch the Butterfly together, even though Setsuna taking part in this doesn\'t make great sense as she is not interested in catching it. Moroha just feels thrown in. She doesn\'t help the storyline develop and she also just does her thing, by ""accident"" she ends up going the same way as the other two.Art & Sound (8):I like that they kept it VERY similar to Inuyasha, because any other thing wouldn\'t have made sense as it plays in the same world/era. It may be nostalgia talking here but the Soundtracks of Inuyasha are masterpieces and since the ones here in Yashahime are nearly the same they just sound great. They fit the scenes and sometimes they give you some feeling of nostalgia.The art is also very much kept the same. It\'s really nice looking.Overall (5):I\'m giving it a 5 right now, even though idk if it will go down as the episodes are being released. Except the occasional throwback there isn\'t really something to hold on. was just once both ways.

It’s heavily dependent on the original cast, it has a lot more emphasis on chicks than men, and is overall unneeded and a waste of time. Inuyasha had already outstayed its welcome by over a hundred episodes, but at least it ended. You were free to leave it behind you as a very good action adventure than ran out of juice very quickly and then kept going in circles until you no longer gave a damn. Years later and for no logical financial reason they decided to make a sequel for a show nobody asked for or...was looking forward to. How did they expect to make back their money I have no idea, since everyone had either moved on to other shows, or stopped watching anime altogether. And they didn’t exactly win back a lot of people with the direction the continuation had. I am not referring only to the callbacks, which were the only interesting thing about it. There were nonstop cameos of older characters and locations for attracting the fans of the original for which they would have a heavy dose of nostalgia about a show they had watched decades ago.The problem was with the newer stuff which was a complete mess to figure out or to give a damn about in general. It’s all fine when they are showing you what the older characters are doing in flashbacks, but when the plot switches to the newer ones you are just waiting for another flashback. The three girls we are following for most of the show have very little to do compared to their parents. One of them wants to make money. The other one wants to be able to dream again. The third one wants everyone to be friendly with each other. Holy shit, how is any of that interesting? Remember the monk who would be sucked in a black hole at any moment? Now that’t tension. And sure, the objective is to eventually defeat a super powerful demigod, but most of the show is wasted on silly episodic missions with weak enemies. The older series was also full of silly adventures to the most part, but that show came out at a time when having a loose plot was fine. You could have a hundred filler episode of Naruto in a row and people wouldn’t give up. A mostly episodic structure no longer works nowadays. That aside, the fights were far more exciting back then, because the horror aspect was far more prevalent. In Yashahime you never feel any tension or dread, because it’s like a bunch of silly girls going on a picnic. They are more preoccupied with unimportant first world problems than with dealing with demigods who ruined their childhood, hurt their parents, and who want to kill them. And the reason they can be so carefree is because the bad guys are not killing them despite being easy and despite knowing of the prophesy which foretells of their demise by their hands. It’s obvious plot armor and there is no good justification for it.And even that is peanuts before the incomprehensible plot. They constantly throw these little mysteries in order to make the characters act in mysterious ways. They want to make you believe there is a lot going on behind the scenes and that is why their motivations seem to change from one episode to another. But that is not true. The more they explain what they want to do, the more you realize not even the writers know what is going on. They keep flip flopping for the sake of the plot, or plot armor in general. It’s so jarring.And what the hell is wrong with their magic powers? Many special attacks in Inuyasha could only be used if you had a special weapon or you went through a specific procedure. In Yashahime most of these special attacks can be used freely and right away. It doesn’t matter what weapon they use and they sure as hell didn’t spend any time in training so they can learn any of those abilities. Like a typical modern shonen, the best powers are given to them right away when the plot demands it, usually in the middle of a fight and with no effort. That makes the fights very boring, because they are won too easily. As a follow up to that, it never feels like they deserve their victories, because they use powers they shouldn’t be able to master so easily. In Inuyasha they would always spend a few episodes on getting a power up, and then a few more on using it properly. There is no such thing in Yashahime; everything is easy and the girls are going on a picnic where they discuss their first world problems. It’s so boring to watch.Oh, and one last thing. The only time the show created some buzz during its run, was when it was revealed who was the mother of two of the girls. Hell broke loose because it was Rin, a girl that was like a daughter to Sesshomaru. They never showed any romantic interests, not even in the sequel, so it came off as grooming, a very typical thing in anime that feature a man raising a girl as his daughter, only for eventually making her his wife. It doesn’t matter if that was common in feudal Japan. We didn’t see them falling in love, there was no build up to that relationship, and therefore it comes off as disgusting. And that is Yashahime in a nutshell. A show nobody wanted, almost nobody watched, and even those who gave it a chance ended up hating it for having dull main characters, boring fights, incomprehensible bad guys, and disgusting grooming. was looking forward to.

A show nobody wanted, almost nobody watched, and even those who gave it a chance ended up hating it for having dull main characters, boring fights, incomprehensible bad guys, and disgusting grooming.', ""it's full of pedophilia and bad story writingthe characters are lovable but it just destroy the original story of inuyashaand we barely even see the original castand to top it all off, they made sesshomaru and rin together, i'm sorry sessrin shippers but i think there are lots of wrong things in their relationship and i can list it:-the main trio all have the same age that is 14, kagome have moroha in her 20s but rin have towa and setsuna in her teens which is pedophilia if you think about it-to me their relationship is more to a parental relationship more then lovers so...making them together ruins the story for me-it just weird that sesshomaru would marry rin, it gives me a weird and bad taste, it literally gives me the 'i raised her to be my wife vibe' and trust me it's a big no-no. i'm okay if sesshomaru marries someone else (even though i'm a sesshomaru simp) but does it have to be rin? making them together ruins the story for me-it just weird that sesshomaru would marry rin, it gives me a weird and bad taste, it literally gives me the 'i raised her to be my wife vibe' and trust me it's a big no-no. i'm okay if sesshomaru marries someone else (even though i'm a sesshomaru simp) but does it have to be rin?"", 'I may be in a rare position to criticize Hanyou no Yashahime because I started, and finished, all of InuYasha in 2020 before Hanyou no Yashahime was released. Because I watched InuYasha so recently, I do not have fond memories from years past to cloud my judgment. I am able to compare and contrast these two shows rather easily. Given that, I can safely say that if you are looking for an adequate sequel to InuYasha you may be disappointed. I say you “may be disappointed“ because if you can look past the problems with the story and only look at the good parts such...as the art, then you are in for a good, and perhaps even a great, ride down memory lane. I, however, was not looking for this. I wanted a worthy sequel to InuYasha and I was left rather disappointed. 6/10.*Spoilers beyond this point*Quite a bit of the story of Hanyou no Yashahime is rather similar to InuYasha. A few examples are, a girl from the modern-day has to live in a new era killing demons while learning that she has powers, there are jewels that increase the owner’s power, the first demon that the girl from the modern-day has to fight is a warped Ōmukade, and the group of friends has to travel and kill demons, all be it for a different reason. Like in InuYasha, the pre-episode flashbacks are unnecessary, intrusive, and flow-breaking. The flashing of previously introduced character’s names is also unnecessary, intrusive, and flow-breaking. These similarities could be called references to the original, and I wouldn’t have too many issues with that statement, but where I do have irrefutable issues with the story are the plot holes. A plot hole for example such as Kaede still being alive. Canonically about 15 years have passed between the end of InuYasha and the start of Hanyou no Yashahime, and Kaede was 63 at the end of InuYasha, so she would be about 78 now. That is rather old for someone living in that era. Similar maths could be used to work out how old Rin was when she gave birth to Towa and Setsuna. The last plot hole I will cover is the plot hole of Towa not losing her demon powers on the new moon. My immediate reaction to seeing this was “Surely this happened in the present day, right?” Well as it turns out, she “Is originally from this world, so the new moon did not affect her in her world.” Wich I shouldn’t have to tell you, make very little since. Getting off the topic of plot holes, let me discuss the few other problems I have with the story, such as, the story lacking a main villain. Naraku was iconic. He was smart, intimidating, cunning, and strong. He also posed a constant threat to the main and supporting cast. In Hanyou no Yashahime who is there? Riku? Kirinmaru? Both options are unexceptional.Many unfortunate realities in anime came to light due to the pandemic in 2020. One of those being that some anime don’t look as nice as they arguably should have. Hanyou no Yashahime could be one of those anime. A few times in the series is have noticed small to moderate seized flaws in the animation, but, is this due to the pandemic, or is this the way that it is supposed to look? Are the simplistic sword slashing animations an unfortunate outcome, or are they purposeful? Are the sometimes stale-looking backgrounds a time-saving trick, or are they true to the vision? I will leave those up to the individual to decide. However, something that I shall not leave up to the individual is the character design, and more specifically, Kohaku. His design is rather different from the other demon hunters, and even other characters for that matter. He wears a high collared half cape arrangement that looks very inefficient and unnecessary for such an efficient group as the demon hunters. He also has a cliche scar across his dorsal base. This not only makes him one of two characters with a scar in the whole series but also the only one with a permanently on display scar, which then furthers his visual clash with the other characters. On a similar note, if Rin has brown hair, and Sesshomaru has white hair, then why do Towa and Setsuna have a red streak in their hair? My theory is that the character designers were told that the main cast had to have a similar color scheme, so they added a red streak in Towa‘s and Setsuna’s hair to make them match Moroha’s red robe.While on the subject of the characters, they are fine. But, I am not really connecting with them. None of the new characters feel as fleshed out as the original ones. This comes to light when the new characters interact with the old ones. The old ones are still fleshed out from the original series while the new ones look flat when compared. Similar to this, Setsuna doesn’t care about Towa, but as soon as she has a vague flashback to her childhood she is caring and protective. This would be wonderful character development, but it happens too quickly and comes off as the plot needed Towa to be saved and this was the most efficient way that it would happen. On a similar note, Towa has a very good grasp of her powers for someone who has just found out that they had them.My opinion on both of the OPs and both of the EDs are rather similar to the characters. Just replace “connecting with the characters” with “liking the Ops and EDs” and that would encompass my opinion rather nicely. That covers the OPs and EDs, but what of the rest of the music and sound? Well, a lot of it is reused from the original. The flashback music, the fighting music, and others are all extremely similar, if not the same. This is where I have to question if this is an homage, or is it just blatant laziness? A similar thing could be said for the other sounds in the anime. What isn’t reused for the original is generic sound effects found everywhere else. Really, reusing the music from InuYasha would be a nice callback, easter egg, or reference to the original, but the reused music is implemented too frequently for me to believe that it is either of the previous three options.I enjoyed Hanyou no Yashahime when it was being Hanyou no Yashahime, and not when it was being an InuYasha mimic. Villains that manipulate space-time, mutualistic pond monsters, and magic rouge all create a sense that this is the world we once knew, but with new aspects and challenges that make it feel refreshing. Easter eggs like Moroha being given the same Kappa foot that was given to Kagome is one that I remember off the top of my head. But, the similar story, reusing the music, and the lackluster characters really bring the whole anime down. I will continue watching because maybe the show will become more of its own in the future. That is a 7 for art, a 6 for the characters, enjoyment, and sound, and a 5 for the story. Coming out to a 6 overall. as the art, then you are in for a good, and perhaps even a great, ride down memory lane. I, however, was not looking for this.

The original explored the life of someone who was born between two sides and belonged to neither one. It told a love story that ultimately could have been a metaphor for coping with lost love and moving onto someone else, our tendency as humans to try to see someone we loved and lost in the new person. The list of things that the original Inuyasha tale left behind is long and can be enumerated further, but this review is about its sequel: Yashahime.This show is being done by the same studio as the...original and the character designs have largely not changed in style. They are in fact pretty consistently keeping with the original. Sunrise also has a decent sized budget for animation work, though a few cuts did have mediocre background characters and the animation did seem to run low on budget towards the end. The visuals are a solid 6/10. Being Sunrise, they also have a tendency to use pretty strong audio, especially for OP and ED themes. The sound is truly solid. Had the show\'s substance been done better, I would probably have grown attached to the theme songs. The biases of the story and characters aside, the sound earns a solid 7/10.The issue with Yashahime lies primarily with its storytelling and characterizations.Yes, in its 167 episode run, the original Inuyasha had fillers. However, it had a good deal of characterization of minor characters at the very least and substantial characterization of its main cast. Here, however, the fillers are the majority of the show with little to no overplot to tie one episode to the next. Only about the first 4-5 episodes had any substance and direction to them with about one significant flashback some 10+ episodes later. There is effectively no progression plotwise until about the last 3 or so episodes.The main cast is also notably shallow compared to its predecessor. We have Towa, Setsuna and Moroha, a pair of years-separated twins and a half cousin. There isn\'t any romance between the main characters this time around, which is fine if that were all. However, their bonds are superficial. Little to no screentime is spent showing them bonding or even compatible to bond as friends, let alone as sisters/kin who are willing to risk their lives for each other.Of the supporting cast, the minor episodic villains are largely of the slapstick comedic variety that communicate little to no meaning worth contemplating upon their defeat. Miroku and Sango\'s married lives were shown at one point but amount to effectively a form of non-sexual fanservice of their married lives with kids. New members of the cast like Riku are portrayed with little to no history or motivation and often amount to just acting ""cool"". Sesshoumaru, a much beloved character of the original series is effectively rendered an illogical plot device in the background just to initiate the setup in episode one and provide convenient combat help. Lastly, the villains\' only motivation seems to be a shallow form of narcissism combined with a half-baked excuse of self-preservation according to the prophecy of a rock that never talked let alone predicted futures in the original series.While a sequel has technically been announced and may address some of the blanks and question marks started by this show, it is unlikely that even combined with the coming sequel\'s answers that this show would live up to its original. As a standalone entry, these 24 episodes certainly fail to. In fact, in two whole ways, the series is more akin to a mediocre fanfiction with the worst pairing possible.Story: 4/10Characterization: 2/10 original and the character designs have largely not changed in style.

I just felt the story could've been better because there was just so many plot holes that it kept me questioning non stop with any conclusion to close that part of that particular scene. I don't want to say too much because of giving away spoilers. Anyhow we don't ever find out what happened to the original gang like there's literally no clues whatsoever on where they went. They might as well be forgotten about lol!Now don't get me wrong, the...music, the voice actresses and their characters were pretty good. However it badly needed a unique story as a backup and the art wasn't as serious enough as the original Inuyasha series (yes I am old skool thanks very much). In conclusion, the story was a failure in this anime series for me and it just failed to have the exact charm in looking for from the original Inuyasha series. music, the voice actresses and their characters were pretty good.

So let\'s see: a sequel to Inuyasha, one of the big ""classics"" - how bad can it be, right? In short: if the original is near and dear to your heart, do yourself a favour and stay away, because this is a cringefest that\'s just checking some new-fangled boxes on a to-do list.Sadly, the answer is anything but flattering. From the very start I had a feeling I stumbled upon some third rate Mary Sue self-insert fanfiction, and that feeling did not go away....If anything, it got progressively worse as the series went on. Straight from the start I felt iffy about the protagonists: the very obvious and very cheap pandering to certain more recent mindsets that just had to make this series about three girls, kinda contrasting to the Inuyasha-Miroku-Kouga triangle (where Kouga wasn\'t even a main character). It doesn\'t help that none of them is particularly girly, either, in fact one is straight up dressed like a boy in suit and tie, another\'s just too restrained and more like a strict matron, while the third is sort of a restless, mischievous prankster. The one male character who does appear rather frequently throughout the whole season - looks more feminine than any of the ""princesses"".The story isn\'t exactly anything to write home about, either: instead of a jewel, we\'re now chasing pearls, fighting mostly monster-of-the-week enemies, while the rhyme and reason for everything remains too obscure for too long, only to come to a messy sort-of-conclusion. No character development to speak of, but hey, at least some of the old favourites show up (not that they\'ve changed all that much despite the timeskip). I\'m actually not even sure this entire story adds anything to, or really expands on the original, instead of just existing in its own vacuum. The same goes for the art and sound as well: for a short while it feels nice to settle back into an old atmosphere, but then - that\'s all. Nothing new there, as if time really did stop somewhere along the way and no image/animation quality, nor battle direction evolved at all in the years since Inuyasha. There\'s an overhyped first OP song, though. And if going on about comparisons feel pointless, it\'s unfortunate, but that\'s just it: you can hardly avoid it, all things considered.The entire series is baffling. The quality and effort put into it is almost laughably poor across all departments, and consistently so throughout the season. Which season, by the way, is double length - and not only that, but a second season is already confirmed as well. It\'s baffling to imagine all the money and human resources wasted on a title that\'s running on nothing but empty nostalgia and some dried-up respect for the creator of an older series. There are too many other anime, with much more potential, that don\'t even get the 24episode treatment - the constraint serving as catalyst where they do end up buckling under their own weight of inconsistencies and ending up disappointing. Yet, here we have this thing that belongs on a fanfic site, where I wouldn\'t even touch it with a 10-foot pole, getting all the special treatment, simply because of a name. If it wasn\'t tied to Inuyasha, it probably would\'ve lasted a total of 12 episodes.In my opinion, Hanyou no Yashahime is a good showcase for too many things that are wrong with anime.

Unfortunately, the new series fails to score in any discipline. First impression, don\'t do it!Story: feels like a cheap rehash of the original story (4/10)The daughters of Sesshomaru and Inuyasha embark on a journey through time between modern and feudal Japan. They have very different reasons, but together they face the adventures that await them. The short introduction makes it clear that the plot will not be a firework of innovations. It feels more like a cheap remake. My personal low point is episode 14 with its discourse on a...smartphone, built in for the target group, with no real reference to the series. Unfortunately, the plot largely consists of independent missions that often have little connection to the main objective and are also solved far too easily. The biggest shortcoming of the story, however, is that the end of this story arc is incomplete and requires a second season. This leaves one unsatisfied.Characters: Cast is simply colourless, stereotypes created without care (4/10)I will leave the original characters of the series out of consideration here, they are certainly known.Unfortunately, the new characters simply have little personality or backstory to offer that is worth mentioning.Higurashi, Towa:She seems superficially likeable, but is incomprehensible and inconsistent in her behaviour. Dressed as a boy and acting like a girl, I wondered if it was meant to be an attempt at cross-dressing or gender issues in general? Her moralising is also inappropriate, she of all people makes the most mistakes.Moroha:She has a personality that is easily identified as a cross between Kagome and Inuyasha. She is adorable in her own right, but Kagome\'s face with Inuyasha\'s demeanour is not so easy to bear. Moreover, her backstory is very poorly written and doesn\'t make much sense.Setsuna:She has the looks and the backstory, unfortunately here the potential is lost due to the amnesia issue and demotes her to the most boring of the trio and the cold, condescending demeanour inherited from her father does the rest. Very sad.Jyūbei:He actually has a suitable personality and is even interesting, but cannot add much to the plot as he only plays a supporting role. Again, there is a lack of backstory, but that is less serious with his character than with the MCs.Kirinmaru:It is telling that the antagonist has the most striking and also fascinating personality. He seems to have integrity in his own way, even if one does not share his motives and goals. Well, where there is a lot of shadow, there must also be some light, it\'s just a pity that it\'s the only ray of hope.Visuals: better average, with too much focus on the fight sequences (6/10)The character sketches are generally too soft, too trimmed for beauty. The design, while felt to be true to the original, still fails to convince as simply the level of detail is too low for a 2020 series. Of course, one could counter that the creators did not want to go beyond the scope of the original series with too many details. That would be quite an argument if it weren\'t for the flaw that they have made the use of magical attacks, ubiquitous. On the other hand, Inuyasha had to train quite a bit before he could do it properly. So it means, subverting the framework of the old series is fine, but more detail isn\'t. Really? A fitting example of this is the dust cloud that arises when the three MCs are thrown onto the beach by Kirinmaru. It was probably not in the budget that the three girls have some sand on their clothes after the incident. On the other hand, the backgrounds are partly beautiful and have an acceptable level of detail. But if you contrast this with the fight scene in the cave, when Towa lost her demonic powers, which is again below average artistically, you simply have to realize that the graphics are not of consistent quality.Speaking of the fighting sequences, we can also talk about the quality of the animation at this point. On the surface, one would say there is not much to criticise. However, if we take into account the choreography, we need to recognise that the fighting performances are repetitive. Often you can be dazzled by a flood of impressions, but a really good animation convinces with subtleties. As an example, when Setsuna plays the violin, not only should the bow hand move, but the fingers of the other hand as well. Art and animation are superficially acceptable, anyone who is easily dazzled will fall for it. All in all, the visuals are average and if you pay attention to the subtleties, it\'s even worse. The nadir is reached in episode 19. Here all the weaknesses come at once. It\'s filler with no point, the comedy is painful, much like the scenario in episode 4 with the grandpa and the gift for Moroha, there is also chibi, as well as the animation and art are again sub-par. You just don\'t miss anything by skipping this episode. Last but not least, the faded in ""who\'s who"". The names of the characters. It\'s not really a fault, but at a certain point it just bothered me.Sound: Unfortunately, only a few bright spots and disappointing overall (4/10)The BGM was composed by Wada Kaoru, it has its moments but is not overwhelming. This is surprising at first, as Wada-san was already responsible for the soundtrack of the original series. However, the reason why the music is not really convincing becomes clear when you consider that the new series is deliberately oriented towards the original. So it is not surprising that the music is perceived as a second rehash. This also fits into the overall picture, because the moments when the music is perceived as apt or beautiful are precisely the arrangements that have nothing to do with the old series. So it\'s not that the music couldn\'t have been done better, but there was probably a brief to stay as close as possible to the original for maximum success. Unfortunately, the opposite is the case.The first OP (1 -13) is called ""New era"" and is performed by SixTONES, a typical J-Pop opening song by an idol boy band that has been heard a thousand times and most of the others are better. The animation for the OP is boring, so I listened to it once and then skipped it.The second OP starting with episode 14 is ""Burn"" and is performed by the band NEWS. This J-Pop formation has been around for a while and the plus of experience is especially noticeable in the cool music, but also in the fact that the voices are clearer and stronger, so that the overall sound comes across better. Unfortunately, the animation is again designed with too rigid a reference to the predecessor, which shows that the new series cannot stand on its own.The first ED ""Break"" is sung by Uru. The Japanese singer-songwriter gets a lot of attention and is also a bit of a mystery, as she does not divulge her personal information. She has a really beautiful voice whose true potential is revealed in the higher notes. The first bars of ""Break"" are rather inconspicuous and Mai Uru uses this beginning to start with a soft and somewhat smoky voice. Only gradually does the track develop into a successful J-pop arrangement, creating a beautiful and unusual track and a ray of hope.The second ED from episode 14 is called ""Kesshou"" and is performed by the band Ryokuoushoku Shakai and the voice is Nagaya Haruko. A beautiful song with a great melody, as a mixture of rock and pop. Unfortunately, the composition does not emphasise the singer\'s voice and with the tempo changes, it seems unbalanced overall and does not bring out both the beautiful voice and the great music to its fullest.Among the male seiyū, I really enjoyed Hosoya Yoshimasa\'s performance. He speaks the role of Kirinmaru with a pleasant yet powerful timbre that reflects the character\'s personality very well.Unfortunately, none of the female voices really impressed me this time. I only liked Moroha\'s voice when she goes into her berserk mode. Her Seiyū is Tadokoro Azusa.A follow-up 20 years after the first series started. For fans of the original, simply put: ""don\'t watch it"". The background is that the series not only looks like a half-hearted remake, but the major fault is that some of the characters and plot parts from the old series are literally dismantled.As always, thanks for reading smartphone, built in for the target group, with no real reference to the series. Unfortunately, the plot largely consists of independent missions that often have little connection to the main objective and are also solved far too easily. The biggest shortcoming of the story, however, is that the end of this story arc is incomplete and requires a second season. This leaves one unsatisfied.Characters: Cast is simply colourless, stereotypes created without care (4/10)I will leave the original characters of the series out of consideration here, they are certainly known.Unfortunately, the new characters simply have little personality or backstory to offer that is worth mentioning.Higurashi, Towa:She seems superficially likeable, but is incomprehensible and inconsistent in her behaviour. Dressed as a boy and acting like a girl, I wondered if it was meant to be an attempt at cross-dressing or gender issues in general? Her moralising is also inappropriate, she of all people makes the most mistakes.Moroha:She has a personality that is easily identified as a cross between Kagome and Inuyasha. She is adorable in her own right, but Kagome\'s face with Inuyasha\'s demeanour is not so easy to bear. Moreover, her backstory is very poorly written and doesn\'t make much sense.Setsuna:She has the looks and the backstory, unfortunately here the potential is lost due to the amnesia issue and demotes her to the most boring of the trio and the cold, condescending demeanour inherited from her father does the rest. Very sad.Jyūbei:He actually has a suitable personality and is even interesting, but cannot add much to the plot as he only plays a supporting role. Again, there is a lack of backstory, but that is less serious with his character than with the MCs.Kirinmaru:It is telling that the antagonist has the most striking and also fascinating personality. He seems to have integrity in his own way, even if one does not share his motives and goals. Well, where there is a lot of shadow, there must also be some light, it\'s just a pity that it\'s the only ray of hope.Visuals: better average, with too much focus on the fight sequences (6/10)The character sketches are generally too soft, too trimmed for beauty. The design, while felt to be true to the original, still fails to convince as simply the level of detail is too low for a 2020 series. Of course, one could counter that the creators did not want to go beyond the scope of the original series with too many details. That would be quite an argument if it weren\'t for the flaw that they have made the use of magical attacks, ubiquitous. On the other hand, Inuyasha had to train quite a bit before he could do it properly. So it means, subverting the framework of the old series is fine, but more detail isn\'t. Really? A fitting example of this is the dust cloud that arises when the three MCs are thrown onto the beach by Kirinmaru. It was probably not in the budget that the three girls have some sand on their clothes after the incident. On the other hand, the backgrounds are partly beautiful and have an acceptable level of detail. But if you contrast this with the fight scene in the cave, when Towa lost her demonic powers, which is again below average artistically, you simply have to realize that the graphics are not of consistent quality.Speaking of the fighting sequences, we can also talk about the quality of the animation at this point. On the surface, one would say there is not much to criticise. However, if we take into account the choreography, we need to recognise that the fighting performances are repetitive. Often you can be dazzled by a flood of impressions, but a really good animation convinces with subtleties. As an example, when Setsuna plays the violin, not only should the bow hand move, but the fingers of the other hand as well. Art and animation are superficially acceptable, anyone who is easily dazzled will fall for it. All in all, the visuals are average and if you pay attention to the subtleties, it\'s even worse. The nadir is reached in episode 19. Here all the weaknesses come at once. It\'s filler with no point, the comedy is painful, much like the scenario in episode 4 with the grandpa and the gift for Moroha, there is also chibi, as well as the animation and art are again sub-par. You just don\'t miss anything by skipping this episode. Last but not least, the faded in ""who\'s who"". The names of the characters. It\'s not really a fault, but at a certain point it just bothered me.Sound: Unfortunately, only a few bright spots and disappointing overall (4/10)The BGM was composed by Wada Kaoru, it has its moments but is not overwhelming. This is surprising at first, as Wada-san was already responsible for the soundtrack of the original series. However, the reason why the music is not really convincing becomes clear when you consider that the new series is deliberately oriented towards the original. So it is not surprising that the music is perceived as a second rehash. This also fits into the overall picture, because the moments when the music is perceived as apt or beautiful are precisely the arrangements that have nothing to do with the old series. So it\'s not that the music couldn\'t have been done better, but there was probably a brief to stay as close as possible to the original for maximum success. Unfortunately, the opposite is the case.The first OP (1 -13) is called ""New era"" and is performed by SixTONES, a typical J-Pop opening song by an idol boy band that has been heard a thousand times and most of the others are better.

The way they disregard the old characters is disgusting and sad.The plot is also a bore to watch and lacks any cohesion. The director had no...idea what he was doing when he plotted this story. There are loose ends all around and none of them can be remediated with simple flashbacks as they did with Inuyasha and Kagome's (which was terribly executed).This is one of few anime that I remember having to fast-forward some scenes to be able to get through it. I would have dropped but I was already more than halfway through and wanted to get it done with it. I won't be watching the second season though, no with these characters taking the stage.It doesn't get a lower score because, artsyle-wise, it remains loyal to the original and the soundtrack was nostalgic, but that's about it. Also, I've seen a lot worst than this. It's just that how they destroyed one of my favorite anime just kills me inside.They should just have let this one end as it ended with an original, glorious arc. Now, for certain, for me, Inuyasha is dead. But they have killed it.I won't be writing a full review because I'm afraid more venom will be spilled and honestly, this anime should be forgotten, it was a mistake, and hopefully they don't try to milk it anymore. idea what he was doing when he plotted this story.

I\'m not complaining because I\'m a hater.That being said, this show sucks. We\'ve had a whole season of random episodes, the plot is still not clear. Why is Zero angry? Why is Kirinmaru angry? No one knows and apparently that\'s not important. What about the butterfly? No explanations either.They could have saved it with some fan service, maybe appeal to the nostalgia feeling of Inuyasha fans, but decided to be suuuuper original and that was a huge and pretentious mistake. You see, if you have a good...story, trust it and don\'t appeal to fan service, but if you don\'t... At least put something we can love and relate on it. (Moroha is probably the closest to the original series the show offers, since she is just like her father)Also, they messed up with all the families and don\'t seem to care about the terrible life some of the characters have had the past 14 years.The 3 main characters have a ridiculous and shallow relationship, being friends in one episode and almost completely strangers in the next one, jumping to best friends at some point even though we hardly ever get to see truly bounding moments between them.I honestly think that ruins the show because even if we don\'t have Inuyasha characters, it would\'ve been possible to like their children and follow their story, but this lack of development of their relationship makes it hard to empathize with their fights (what are they fighting for?) and their ""friendship"" (are they really friends?).Moroha and Setsuna are interesting characters though. Towa... well, towa is such a Mary Sue and sunrise is definitely trying to make her happen but she doesn\'t have the same charisma as the other two. In fact, I think one daughter would be fine for each of Inu no Taisho\'s sons. No need to split Sesshoumaru\'s personality in two. The dynamic between a mini Inuyasha and a mini Sesshoumaru would be good enough for this show.In my point of view, Towa is clearly unnecessary. Just as unnecessary as the whole show.

Probably the best 2 episodes out of the 24.Then you have Inuyasha slice of life. The majority of the episodes are these. You follow the 3 partial demon girls as two of them do their actual jobs, and one tags along just because she has nothing better to do. These episodes are decently enjoyable for what they are, and can be watched in...any order and it makes no difference, and you can skip them all and not miss anything from the story. The series would have been fine really if these episodes made up the entire thing. Could use more actual character interactions to flesh out the cast a bit, but they're okay.Then you have like 5 episodes that are actually about the plot of the show. you have some at the start, that sets up the plot and builds some intrigue, then you have the last 2 or 3 episodes where they completely forgot what happened at the beginning and just made up some new stuff just because. The story makes no sense, it's downright terrible. Nothing about the plot makes any sense, and character motivations are just all over the place. it's like a bad soap opera.The only reason why anyone could like this show is because either they're just blind fans that will like anything from this franchise you throw at them, or they really like inuyasha slice of life, which is decent for what it is, and is the majority of the anime.

It's fourteen episodes in, and each new addition is just another poor excuse for a plot that fails to deliver. There used to be a purpose in Inuyasha. The plot was clear, and the subplots were also well-developed and made sense, for the most part. A big part of...me is speaking with the nostalgia that I associate with Inuyasha, but I have to say that Hanyou no Yashahime falls short on everything: storyline, art, characters, and enjoyment.The storyline makes very little sense to me. There's too much of a gap between what we knew from Inuyasha and when it ended to what's happening now, and they aren't filling in those gaps in a way that makes sense for the story. It feels so disjointed and raggedy, as if someone were animating the random brainstorms they scribbled down onto a sheet of paper at some story development meeting without thinking about it as a whole, complete picture. Somehow we're supposed to be satisfied with the absentee parents of the tritagonists, with almost no context to why they essentially abandoned their children with over half the season finished.Moroha is honestly the saving grace of this show, because I honestly find the twins really fell flat for me. Moroha is the perfect mix of Inuyasha and Kagome, with all the aspects of each parent's personality coming through exactly the way I imagined. Towa is frustrating, and quite frankly, I find her absolutely useless to the plot. What purpose does she serve other than to constantly push Setsuna's boundaries? Frankly, Setsuna is a stand-alone character to me. Even without Towa, she has an interesting enough story where I'd be interested in seeing how it develops.This show tries hard to be something that it can't be: a stand-alone series. I feel as if it's doing its best to separate itself from its predecessor, but when there are so many direct references back to the original series (same OST, all the old voice actors have returned, InuYASHA and YASHAhime, the apparent antagonist is their literal dad Sesshomaru, the list goes on), it's impossible to do so when so many of us are watching out of nostalgia.I've honestly never been as disappointed in a show before. Hanyou no Yashahime could've been a great sequel to one of my absolute favourite shows, but it falls short on too many aspects and I really don't expect it to pick up anytime soon.

Kirinmaru, Yawaragi, Konton and Lady Kyuki are my personal favorites.Animation quality is pretty inconsistent and looks pretty rushed, but a lot of anime seems to be this way when currently airing. I also had a high expectation for the series OP/ED since InuYasha gave us a legendary soundtrack, but its been pretty lukewarm (season 1 ED was good).SPOILER REVIEW:One thing that has really annoyed me is how there seems to be no character development, only story progression [example below]. The fillers in this series do not really...build up the main characters\' likeability so much as to cameo older casts.Episode 16 had a lot of potential to spotlight Moroha for her childish combat tactics as she had to go face-to-face in a fatal duel against her former trainer, Yawaragi. She was supposed to understand that she cannot recklessly depend on the rouge to win her battles, but instead hone her skills the old-fashioned way to become a good figher. Yawaragi is killed, and three episodes later Moroha whips out her rouge without one ounce of consideration of what Yawaragi was trying to instill in her with her last moments in life.[Moroha utilizes a ""rouge"" that has been passed down from Lady Izayoi that allows her to transform into Beniyasha. Put simply, this swells her demon energy (since she is only 1/4th demon) and increases her skills in combat. The trade-off is that she has less control over her instincts much like InuYasha in the past.]I am only 18 episodes in, and Im only keeping up with this series out of my love and dedication to Rumiko Takahashi\'s legacy but I find this whole series to be a dull experience. build up the main characters\' likeability so much as to cameo older casts.Episode 16 had a lot of potential to spotlight Moroha for her childish combat tactics as she had to go face-to-face in a fatal duel against her former trainer, Yawaragi.

So it would be only fitting that this anime would receive a well written next generation sequel that did the original justice and reminded us how great Inuyasha truly was.Yeah that didn't happen, instead we got hanyou no yashahime. What started out as a promising announcement (albeit a bit weird since it would focus on Sesshomarus twins instead of Sangos and Mirokus girls) ended up being the most atrocious sequel I have ever seen.When it was first announced and the artworks for the three main characters dropped I was excited. The girls...looked great, Towa even looked gnc in her suit. Setsuna looked like a mini Sesshomaru and Moroha was the perfect blend of her parents. If it only stayed that way.The first episode was the animated extra chapter from the manga which already looked very very wonky. The characters looked younger, their ears bigger and their eyes more asymmetrical than ever. But the story was nice. If only it stayed that way.The next parts will contain heavy spoilers so be warned.Right of the bat the show made it clear there aren't three protagonists, there is Towa and her sidekick Setsuna and then there is comedic relief Moroha. As much as I hate the term Towa is a blatant Mary Sue, she doesn't have to train, she doesn't have to work for anything she just gets it. New power here, cool weapon there, win the fight when the two girls who fought and trained almost their entire lives couldn't do shit. She also got to grow up in a nice home with Sota and his family when Moroha who was separated from her parents as a baby, raised by the wolf tribe and then sold as a child slave at 11, had nothing.That's the other thing. The protagonists of the original are treated absolutely horrible. Right of the bat Sango is referred to only as Mirokus wife, we later learn she also for some reason doesn't want to fight anymore and instead makes masks like a good little wife while Miroku is out training and fighting.Inuyasha and Kagome got sucked into the black pearl by none other than Sesshomaru and didn't come back the entire series, they're still gone by the end of it and no one cares, not their best friends, not Kaede, not even their own daughter, no one.Oh and Shippo is just gone.But don't worry cause Kikyo is back. She is now a tree spirit but aren't we all glad to see her again? :) Don't worry she won't matter later in the show anyways.The plot makes no sense, everyones motivation is different and it's all over the place. Things don't get explained, the protagonists don't ask questions. New plot points get introduced all the time when none are resolved and then they have the audacity to shove shitty fillers into your face at the very end of the show. There are multiple villains and oh nooo is that Sesshomaru as a villain? Well they already took a big fat dump on the character development of the original show so this shouldn't be surprising.Sesshomarus motivations are completely unclear. Does he have a plan? Is the dementia finally setting in? Who knows.Sesshomaru has been a fan favorite for a while so it shouldn't be surprising they wanted to focus a little bit more on him and his family. But what is that? He doesn't care for his family? Yeah you heard right. Not only did he snatch his daughters right after the birth to dump them in a forest, supposedly to be raised by Jaken instead of him but he doesn't even speak more than 10 words to them, leaves them unconscious in the middle of nowhere and BIG SPOILER when one of them dies he just turns around and leaves, A+ parenting!!Then there is of course the big mystery of the twins mother. It's Rin who would've thunk. But wait there is a neat little twist to this since we got a timeline provided to us of 18 years passing since the first episode which took place half a year after the final act in which Rin was 11 years old. In case that wasn't clear Rin is 15 when she gives birth, yeah you can piece the rest together.But she clearly must've been very much in love with Sesshomaru and he with her right? Oh boy. Not only aren't they shown in the same frame until episode 23 but they don't ever talk to each other.Also Rin is shoved in a tree to hibernate for 14 years and didn't get to raise her kids either, fun right? She hasn't aged making her effectively the same age as her daughters.Aside from the blatant pedo/hebephilia I also want to include the racism and transphobia the show gave us in 2021. Shiori, the little half demon girl from the original makes an appearance in yashahime. She has a human night and her dark skin suddenly gets all white and creamy. Because dark skin is demonic.In one of the fillers they introduce a character called the lady, who dresses feminine with make up but looks very masculine with a cleft chin, tall, muscular. It's very obvious if you look at her that this was intentional to make her look weird. She also wears hoop earrings, has kinky hair and a little darker skin, which also could be seen as using some black stereotypes.I know this has been a lengthy review but if you made it to the end you either saw this shit fest or hopefully stay far away from it and the upcoming second season. looked great, Towa even looked gnc in her suit. Setsuna looked like a mini Sesshomaru and Moroha was the perfect blend of her parents. If it only stayed that way.The first episode was the animated extra chapter from the manga which already looked very very wonky. The characters looked younger, their ears bigger and their eyes more asymmetrical than ever. But the story was nice. If only it stayed that way.The next parts will contain heavy spoilers so be warned.Right of the bat the show made it clear there aren't three protagonists, there is Towa and her sidekick Setsuna and then there is comedic relief Moroha. As much as I hate the term Towa is a blatant Mary Sue, she doesn't have to train, she doesn't have to work for anything she just gets it. New power here, cool weapon there, win the fight when the two girls who fought and trained almost their entire lives couldn't do shit. She also got to grow up in a nice home with Sota and his family when Moroha who was separated from her parents as a baby, raised by the wolf tribe and then sold as a child slave at 11, had nothing.That's the other thing. The protagonists of the original are treated absolutely horrible. Right of the bat Sango is referred to only as Mirokus wife, we later learn she also for some reason doesn't want to fight anymore and instead makes masks like a good little wife while Miroku is out training and fighting.Inuyasha and Kagome got sucked into the black pearl by none other than Sesshomaru and didn't come back the entire series, they're still gone by the end of it and no one cares, not their best friends, not Kaede, not even their own daughter, no one.Oh and Shippo is just gone.But don't worry cause Kikyo is back. She is now a tree spirit but aren't we all glad to see her again? :) Don't worry she won't matter later in the show anyways.The plot makes no sense, everyones motivation is different and it's all over the place. Things don't get explained, the protagonists don't ask questions. New plot points get introduced all the time when none are resolved and then they have the audacity to shove shitty fillers into your face at the very end of the show. There are multiple villains and oh nooo is that Sesshomaru as a villain? Well they already took a big fat dump on the character development of the original show so this shouldn't be surprising.Sesshomarus motivations are completely unclear. Does he have a plan? Is the dementia finally setting in? Who knows.Sesshomaru has been a fan favorite for a while so it shouldn't be surprising they wanted to focus a little bit more on him and his family. But what is that? He doesn't care for his family? Yeah you heard right. Not only did he snatch his daughters right after the birth to dump them in a forest, supposedly to be raised by Jaken instead of him but he doesn't even speak more than 10 words to them, leaves them unconscious in the middle of nowhere and BIG SPOILER when one of them dies he just turns around and leaves, A+ parenting!!Then there is of course the big mystery of the twins mother. It's Rin who would've thunk. But wait there is a neat little twist to this since we got a timeline provided to us of 18 years passing since the first episode which took place half a year after the final act in which Rin was 11 years old. In case that wasn't clear Rin is 15 when she gives birth, yeah you can piece the rest together.But she clearly must've been very much in love with Sesshomaru and he with her right? Oh boy. Not only aren't they shown in the same frame until episode 23 but they don't ever talk to each other.Also Rin is shoved in a tree to hibernate for 14 years and didn't get to raise her kids either, fun right? She hasn't aged making her effectively the same age as her daughters.Aside from the blatant pedo/hebephilia I also want to include the racism and transphobia the show gave us in 2021. Shiori, the little half demon girl from the original makes an appearance in yashahime. She has a human night and her dark skin suddenly gets all white and creamy. Because dark skin is demonic.In one of the fillers they introduce a character called the lady, who dresses feminine with make up but looks very masculine with a cleft chin, tall, muscular. It's very obvious if you look at her that this was intentional to make her look weird.

The reason? There's 2 reasons: one is that their ship sunk, and Sesshomaru married a character that is not the one they wanted. And because that they scream pedophilia and grooming, which is not true at all. Rin and Sesshomaru have the same age when they had kids than Sango and Miroku in Inuyasha, and no one complained then. (Yes, 17 and 19. Sesshomaru has 19 years in human years, just like Inuyasha is 15 years old even if he lived more...than 200) But of course, they don't ship Miroku with someone else so they don't care.The second reason is that this is an spin off, not a sequel, and the main characters are the daughters of a secondary character from Inuyasha. The fans of the main characters of Inuyasha seems not to be able to grasp that and and are really mad. They want the daughter of the main character to be the protagonist of Yashahime, even if when you read the summary is pretty clear that the main character is not her. Sp they are not judging the argument or the anime; they just hate that the character they like is not the main character, and even if the anime was Pulizter worthy they will scream that is bad. than 200) But of course, they don't ship Miroku with someone else so they don't care.The second reason is that this is an spin off, not a sequel, and the main characters are the daughters of a secondary character from Inuyasha.

Plot holes abound, and the show barely has even a fraction of the original anime. Enemies are weak, old, beloved characters are practically nonexistent, and why the HELL do we have to have character introduction tags showing up at the...start of every single goddamn episode?! Do the creators think their watchers have the memory of a particularly dense sea cucumber? We don\'t need reminders of who everyone is over and over and over again!Here are a few of the questions that have popped up.1. Why does Towa wear a boy\'s uniform even when she goes to an all-girl\'s school? Why would a school like that even HAVE a boys\' uniform? (The ""explanation"" is that it\'s easier to fight while wearing boys\' clothes, but Kagome wore a tiny skirt all the time, and she never had a problem fighting.)2. If the Mystical Macguffin in this story are supposed to be the RAINBOW Pearls (a very poor, watered-down version of the Shikon Jewel), why is one of them silver? I don\'t recall silver being part of any rainbow that I\'m aware of. There\'s also a gold one, but I\'ll let that one slide as either yellow or orange.3. Inuyasha and Kagome never once gave up fighting to protect those they cared for in the original series. So why, when they had what was probably the MOST precious thing to them (Moroha), did they just foist her off on somebody else to take care of when a new bad guy appeared? The Inuyasha and Kagome I knew never would have done something like that.4. Why do Towa and Setsuna have red in their hair when no one in their ancestry had that color? I know, I know, ""because anime"", but I want an explanation, dammit!5. How can Setsuna play the violin perfectly after what is, at best, a few days of practice? Even half-demons aren\'t THAT talented.6. Towa doesn\'t experience the new moon in the present time? WHAT? Not being in her original era shouldn\'t matter! It\'s still the same world, with the same moon, and I\'m pretty sure Inuyasha experienced his human form a few times while he was in the present!7. Moroha doesn\'t experience the new moon at all, even though she\'s just a quarter demon? Shouldn\'t a period of humanity affect her even more than it would a half-demon?8. WHAT THE HELL IS WITH THIS GODDAMN (plot device) DREAM BUTTERFLY?! Stealing a person\'s memories, I can buy, and making it so they can\'t sleep makes sense. But what the EVER LOVING FUCK does it have to do with whether or not the new moon affects her?! THIS MAKES NO SENSE! It seems like it can do anything and everything the plot needs.9. Sesshomaru takes away the children that Rin carried for nine months just minute after their birth, and she doesn\'t have a single word of protest about this. I know she respects him, and he\'s a powerful demon, but if someone tried to take my newborn children from me without any kind of explanation as for why, I would raise unholy hell.For the first season, at least, there\'s barely any overarching plot, and things are more \'monster of the week\' than anything else. You don\'t even really get introduced to this series\' big bad until towards the end, and he\'s...meh. He seems to be no threat at all, so there\'s no sense of urgency whenever he shows up.On top of that, none of the characters have to really struggle. Not only are the enemies quickly and easily defeated, but they don\'t have to learn any new powers or abilities. They either already have them through inheritance, or they just...suddenly appear out of nowhere, and voila! new ability.I\'ve also noticed that the show it surprisingly bloodless. Not that the original Inuyasha was especially gory, but it\'s a little strange when Moroha\'s Blades of Blood feature absolutely no blood at all.Then there\'s the fact that in a little more than twenty episodes, we get THREE reused enemies from Inuyasha. Mistress Centipede (now sporting three eyes), another one of those moth guys (seriously, how many siblings do those dudes HAVE? And he\'s even defeated the same way as the first one was.) and a demon masquerading as a priest.And who thought it would be a good idea to start the second opening with flashes of Sesshomaru and a CHILD RIN, overlaid by images of Towa and Setsuna? As if that ""relationship"" needed to be any more creepy... At least with Inuyasha and Kagome, Inuyasha didn\'t spend years grooming her...One of the positives, though, is that you occasionally get to see characters from the original series all grown up. Kohaku is one such, and a certain half-demon bat child is another. It\'s good to see them again, and she, especially, has an interesting little twist that comes with her.Now, the characters.Towa: She is the daughter of Sesshomaru, and the older twin of Setsuna. She\'s friendly and brave, unafraid to jump into a fight. At first, her sense of morality gets in the way, as she\'s constantly arguing with Setsuna not to kill their enemies, and it starts to become tedious when it happens over and over again. Finally, she becomes less of a pacifist. She wants nothing more than Setsuna\'s love.Setsuna: The younger twin of Towa, Setsuna was raised by demon slayers, and learned their skills. A tsundere, she has very little sense of emotion, and is often cold towards others. She especially gets annoyed with Towa\'s attempts to get close with her. Thanks to something called a (Plot Device) Dream Butterfly, Setsuna is unable to sleep, and thus unable to dream. It also seems to have affected her memories.Moroha: The daughter of Inuyasha and Kagome. While Moroha takes after Kagome in appearance, she inherited Inuyasha\'s personality. Loud, brash, and always itching for a fight, Moroha is a bounty hunter (though a somewhat poor one, if her constant lack of money is any indication).Inuyasha, Kagome, Miroku, Sango (whose title is relegated to ""Miroku\'s Wife"". That\'s it. Badass demon slayer who?), Shippo, etc: They might as well not even exist in this show. That\'s how little they show up. Kohaku, and Sango\'s son, Hisui, have a bit bigger presence, as Kohaku is now the leader of the demon slayers, and Hisui inherited the hiraikotsu from Sango (why she retired as a demon slayer, I have no idea).Oh, and there\'s also some little tanuki thing that shows up from time to time, but he\'s seriously not important.If you loved the original Inuyasha, you\'ll probably be infuriated by this meandering, nonsensical, at times rage-inducing anime. The character designs are good, and you\'ll hear some familiar music tracks, but that\'s really about all it\'s got going for it. start of every single goddamn episode?!

The character designs are good, and you\'ll hear some familiar music tracks, but that\'s really about all it\'s got going for it.', 'I haven\'t reviewed an anime on this site (I usually do reviews on anime on other sites) before but bro as someone who loved the original series as a child, there are so many issues with this that I have to just leave a review and roast this for all its worth on this site. I don\'t understand how anyone could see this anime in the score of 7-10. Especially the scores for this show that range in 9 or 10. While I don\'t think this anime is a full on 1 or 2, and that even a straight 3 is being a bit too...negative, it definitely is not good. I didn\'t initially look into this show but the controversy the past few weeks made me go check it out and boy do I regret it. This sequel is absolutely so insulting and disrespectful to the point where it\'s arguable to say that even Boruto is a better sequel. And that\'s saying something.Story:People usually like to joke that a lot of sequels feel like they\'re fanfiction-level of writing, but this anime for sure is at the level of fanfiction-level. The story contradicts so much from the original series that you almost question if the writers for the sequel that worked on the original forgot about the plot of Inuyasha when they wrote this sequel. Scenes are poorly handled out or executed poorly in order to just show ""the next generation having fun!!!!!!!!!!"". Attempts of tension fail because of clear loopholes from the original series and (terrible) attempts to repeat or remake a few storylines from the original that fail because the sequel has plotlines and structures that are heavily not as thought out or coherent as they would be in the original series. I believe that Yashahime should\'ve been a one shot novel because multiple storylines and things in the sequel feel too lacking in ideas and dimensions to be a whole season of a show.The pacing struggles immensely which is ironic considering how for how slow the pacing it is, it took many episodes for basic things to be revealed or structured. This sequel honestly would\'ve worked better as an OVA or a single movie because 24 episodes were far too much for this show. Or, at the very least, only 12 episodes. I also think that certain issues should of been solved in the series sooner in order to prevent the pacing issue.The modernization attempts also fall short compare to how the original series introduced the differences between Kagome\'s modern times and the Sengoku period. In the original series, one of the things I always liked was how the Japanese folklore stories and creatures compared to the modern world differed and had a rather grim theme. Yashahime\'s modern times and Sengoku period are however even when it tries its best lack memorable and intriguing differences, especially on the yokai elements.Art:The art for this series has so many off-model moments that it looks like some scenes were just made by middle-schoolers tracing anime in art class. The characters when the creators attempt to actually try can look good, but even in the best moments some of said best moments feel extremely flawed and amateurish in certain stuff, especially with features of faces being too large or exaggerated for certain heads. I believe the brightness and less mature feel in the art style of this show compared to the original Inuyasha scene also ruined the artistic side of Yashahime. This is something in fact a lot of sequels in anime that attempt to be serious do, and imo that causes a lot of scenes to be taken less seriously because of how flowery in visual tone they are.Sound: The sounds/music is the only thing that I was approving a lot of in this anime. The music is good and the sounds during certain climax/battle scenes are nice to hear. The voice actors and voice actresses do a good job, and even though some of the next generation children have personalities akin to rocks, their VAS do the best they can.Characters:This is honestly the worst part of the series and somehow managed to ruin the characters more than Boruto. The female characters of the original series are reduced to homemakers/mothers of the next generation and the twins and Moroha are half carbon-copies of their parents and half failed attempts of being ""two-dimensional"". One is a complete cardboard/brick-wall in terms of personality and characterization, one is a hit and miss, and the one that actually is almost tipping around being a three-dimensional character is reduced to comic relief and thus pointless. I love btw that said comic relief is pushed to the side for no reason despite being the daughter of the protagonist and her lover from the original series. Yeah, that makes sense. The male characters of the original are written to be either OOC romantic-inclined or douchebags whose years of character development were thrown in the gutter, and the male characters of the reboot are either copy and paste rip-offs from the original anime\'s fillers or are just, ESPECIALLY the villains, cliche one-dimensional villains with no purpose or meaningful impact.Speaking of villains, the villains are also like the Boruto villains in which you can\'t take 90% of them seriously due to their designs or one-dimensional personalities and because it is so obvious how little they fit in the world. While Inuyasha\'s villains were always with a good shot out to youkai folklore and their actions and motivations tie in, the villains of Yashahime feel like someone\'s OC villain for their Mary-Sue fanfiction that the fanfiction writers did not put much effort in because they focused more on their terrible Mary-Sue character.In fact, most if not all the characters feel like someone\'s 2005 Mary-Sue Inuyasha fanfiction. I wonder if the creators went on fanfiction.net and got ideas. Some of the new characters for this sequel are lacking crucial parts that makes a character a good character, and they also have parts that seem for Inuyasha either too juvenile or too modernized and not in tune with the era of the original series/future even given the circumstances.Now, there is one character I\'m going to specifically highlight because they were one of the best characters of the 2000s in the original series and the disrespect towards them in this sequel is off the charts.Sesshomaru\'s stoic nature and character development in this sequel is absolutely disrespected and regresses all the development and dimensions he possessed in the original. His actions in the sequel are written as if we are looking at an AU early chapter/arcs Sesshomaru where he just straight up stayed almost exactly as the same character and arguably even worse and with terrible ""moments"" (barely) that show him slightly better. Which is one of the worst character assassinations I\'ve seen in modern times.I\'m not going to go much into the whole you know what main issue with Sesshomaru as that\'s been debated both by people for and against the ship and in fact most of these reviews seem to focus more on the ship than the actual whole series, but I will say it is completely OOC for Sesshomaru to suddenly have a romance in general, and ruins all the character development he had in the original series as it implies that all his progression with his views towards humans were made out of restrained lust and romantic affection. Sesshomaru is not a character that is inclined to romance and it seems out of character for a platonic relationship he closely had with someone to turn romantic in a few years. It is especially OOC and makes Sesshomaru\'s character disturbingly predatory and Woody Allen like for him to end up with someone he once raised.As someone who was a major fan of Sesshomaru, I seriously do not understand how anyone could see it in character for him to be with Rin or suddenly into romance in general. Or see the relationship between Sesshomaru and Rin to be romantic/a step for eventual romance.Rin and Sesshomaru had a relationship in the original series that was a father and daughter dynamic at most and a guardian and a child dynamic at the least. Even if you say their relationship was not familial, it was at the end of the day one with someone having an orphan in their custody, and Sesshomaru is not a character that would initiate a relationship with someone they once spent time raising. The show was already terrible but Sesshomaru being with Rin was just the final straw. It\'s honestly sad how Sesshomaru, one of the most badass characters in anime, was ruined in this sequel.Enjoyment:At the better parts of this show, I was smiling and feeling nostalgic, and I was hoping for certain characters/plot points to get better developed in the future. At the worse parts of this show, I was wishing that Inuyasha never had a sequel and having 1257823 thoughts about how OOC and contradictory most of the moments in the series are. Unfortunately, as episodes went on, my enjoyment slowly and slowly decreased.=========================================================================================================================================================Overall, I give this a 3.5/4. Maybe the next few episodes will be good, but all I know is I ain\'t watching it. It\'s honestly sad to see my childhood burned to the ground. Complete disrespect to the original series. And the fact that so many sequels nowadays makes it even worse.And for all the people on both sides of this whole SessRin debate only talking about SessRin in this review section, at least attempt to talk about other parts of the series instead of your support/disapproval of the ship. Or go on episode 15/Yashahime discussion threads and give your rants either for/against the ship there and stop giving non-direct obvious subs to reviews that don\'t agree with your perspective of SessRin. negative, it definitely is not good. I didn\'t initially look into this show but the controversy the past few weeks made me go check it out and boy do I regret it.

Some of the new characters for this sequel are lacking crucial parts that makes a character a good character, and they also have parts that seem for Inuyasha either too juvenile or too modernized and not in tune with the era of the original series/future even given the circumstances.Now, there is one character I\'m going to specifically highlight because they were one of the best characters of the 2000s in the original series and the disrespect towards them in this sequel is off the charts.Sesshomaru\'s stoic nature and character development in this sequel is absolutely disrespected and regresses all the development and dimensions he possessed in the original. His actions in the sequel are written as if we are looking at an AU early chapter/arcs Sesshomaru where he just straight up stayed almost exactly as the same character and arguably even worse and with terrible ""moments"" (barely) that show him slightly better. Which is one of the worst character assassinations I\'ve seen in modern times.I\'m not going to go much into the whole you know what main issue with Sesshomaru as that\'s been debated both by people for and against the ship and in fact most of these reviews seem to focus more on the ship than the actual whole series, but I will say it is completely OOC for Sesshomaru to suddenly have a romance in general, and ruins all the character development he had in the original series as it implies that all his progression with his views towards humans were made out of restrained lust and romantic affection. Sesshomaru is not a character that is inclined to romance and it seems out of character for a platonic relationship he closely had with someone to turn romantic in a few years. It is especially OOC and makes Sesshomaru\'s character disturbingly predatory and Woody Allen like for him to end up with someone he once raised.As someone who was a major fan of Sesshomaru, I seriously do not understand how anyone could see it in character for him to be with Rin or suddenly into romance in general. Or see the relationship between Sesshomaru and Rin to be romantic/a step for eventual romance.Rin and Sesshomaru had a relationship in the original series that was a father and daughter dynamic at most and a guardian and a child dynamic at the least. Even if you say their relationship was not familial, it was at the end of the day one with someone having an orphan in their custody, and Sesshomaru is not a character that would initiate a relationship with someone they once spent time raising. The show was already terrible but Sesshomaru being with Rin was just the final straw. It\'s honestly sad how Sesshomaru, one of the most badass characters in anime, was ruined in this sequel.Enjoyment:At the better parts of this show, I was smiling and feeling nostalgic, and I was hoping for certain characters/plot points to get better developed in the future. At the worse parts of this show, I was wishing that Inuyasha never had a sequel and having 1257823 thoughts about how OOC and contradictory most of the moments in the series are. Unfortunately, as episodes went on, my enjoyment slowly and slowly decreased.=========================================================================================================================================================Overall, I give this a 3.5/4. Maybe the next few episodes will be good, but all I know is I ain\'t watching it. It\'s honestly sad to see my childhood burned to the ground. Complete disrespect to the original series. And the fact that so many sequels nowadays makes it even worse.And for all the people on both sides of this whole SessRin debate only talking about SessRin in this review section, at least attempt to talk about other parts of the series instead of your support/disapproval of the ship. Or go on episode 15/Yashahime discussion threads and give your rants either for/against the ship there and stop giving non-direct obvious subs to reviews that don\'t agree with your perspective of SessRin.', 'If you watched Inuyasha and were hoping to see a good sequel and how the 3 girls find their way around the feudal era.... Sorry to tell you but that does not happen.I went into this thinking (and secretly hoping) it was going to be good and not just the trend that a lot of anime were going into recently; where they end with the characters all having kids and a ""happily ever after"".Yashahime depends heavily on nostalgia and hoping that it drives you to watch this anime all the way through. It feels like it was not thought out well, considering in...the beginning it was paced decently but after the 6th episode or so, it slowed down and dragged on. To the point that they still had fillers going on well into the end. They gave plot points that eventually didn\'t matter or they quickly forgot about and lost interest in. Like the dream butterfly.I only stuck around to the end to see what exactly it was trying to do with the story. I have to say I am sad and disappointed to see that it did not live up to my expectations. Just as any story, there are good and bad things about it. However, in my opinion it just felt that the bad outweighed the good.The characters were underdeveloped and lackluster most times. I don\'t know if maybe splitting the main character role between the 3 girls would have made a difference in keeping my attention. Or if the main character simply being another girl would have made it more interesting. But just the fact that Towa never learns, Setsuna is apathetic and Moroha is made to be the butt of nearly every jokes makes for a boring story.Overall, I would not recommend the anime to anyone to be quite honest. It is not worth it, sure if you want to know where they were going with this, just as I initially did be my guest. But, the story is confusing and goes nowhere. The characters are just there to replace the old cast and give us the nostalgia factor that we as people sometimes seek. Music...I can\'t say much because it wasn\'t a big factor like in Inuyasha.  Art wise, it may follow the same ideas and style as Inuyasha but I felt that the designs gave more insight into the demons in Inuyasha.

I grew up with it and loved it to death, but Yashahime has absolutely killed my experience. I'm at the point now where I warn friends who want to get into Inuyasha to not even touch this sequel. Its only saving grace is Moroha, but even then it's not enough to keep me watching.Let's start off with the mom of the twins being a little girl that hung around an adult man in the series, and said...adult man married and impregnated her while she was still a minor from what I can see. Now, you can say 'But this is the feudal era! They didn't know what pedophillia was back then!'. Dog, the feudal era didn't have glamourous dog men running about either, nor a flying fox demon. The least the anime could do is not romanticize and normalize that stuff. I speak of this all as a victim of grooming and pedophilia. Not a fan of a very traumatizing event in my life being used as a romance trope :). Even if she was an adult, it'd still be grooming since that adult man was around her and took care of her since she was like, what, 11? 10? 12? Can we stop pairing children and the people who take care of them? Thanks.Next up, the fast pacing kills the series. Granted, Inuyasha itself was fast paced, but not to this degree. There's no tension, everything's fixed near immediately, and the characters the audience loves are just...gone. Where are they? Hell if I know! The kids don't care! Even if we do see them it's either a flashback or just for one episode and never again. It's like an elaborate form of dangling the carrot.Lastly, it's just....terribly boring. I don't get the same excitement I did watching Inuyasha. Perhaps it's because I know there's no payoff or buildup. As much as I hate love triangles, I'm about ready to run back to Kikyo's whole deal over all this. At least that gave some good tension. Even now if I even try to force myself to watch an episode I turn it off halfway through because I'm bored and wanna go watch something else.So, in conclusion, a gigantic disappointment. Inuyasha was better off without a sequel, and I even lost some respect for Rumiko Takahashi out of her involvement with this kiddie diddling snooze fest.

The art looks very good and some of the music is also pretty neat, having a couple remade tracks from the original Inuyasha Soundtrack, which I think is a nice touch.The first three episodes were also pretty good, and I think they\'re the ones I enjoyed the most. It was nice seeing the original cast living their life for a moment, and I actually enjoyed seeing Souta as a grown up!However there\'s something...that doesn\'t quite feel like what Inuyasha was, when I watched it waayyy back in the early 2000\'s. It\'s a lot different ( not that it has to be a bad thing ). The main problem this show has is the writing and pacing I think.In fact, a lot of the episodes seem to have the same formula:-Moroha goes on a bounty with Towa and Setsuna-They run into a demon or one of the Perils ( the bad guys )-Setsuna does a Scourge of Swallows and then Towa finishes the demon off, very quickly-Joke where Moroha doesn\'t get the bounty-EtcWhich can be okay at first but it tends to get a bit repetitive after a while.There are also a lot of moments where Setsuna tells Towa she is ""too soft"" because she always wants to avoid conflict. But that doesn\'t really make sense to me, because when we are introduced to Towa\'s character in the first episodes, she\'s kind of a delinquent and she always gets into fights ( to the point of having to switch schools ). But two episodes later she suddenly starts being in fact way ""too soft"" for what she was supposed to be, and we aren\'t really given any reason or explanation for that. I think it\'s a shame because I really do enjoy Towa\'s character. She has a nice design, and I thought she was so cool, but her character kind of seems to have lost its charm as the series went on. She deserved better in my opinion, and so did the other two main characters.( I\'m basically saying that if Towa wants to avoid conflict so much, why introduce her to the audience as this tough character who gets into fights all the time? To me it feels a bit strange. )The villains are also pretty bland. They unfortunately don\'t have a lot of personality like the ones from the original Inuyasha series. I miss Naraku and each one of his incarnations, especially Kagura, who was so cool and  well-written, but the villains here just don\'t really do it for me. They also get defeated waaaaay too fast...but maybe that\'s a good thing if they\'re not that enjoyable or memorable in the first place. You be the judge.Another biiiiiiig problem I have with the series is the fact that Rin and Sesshomaru became a couple and Rin basically gave birth in her teens. I don\'t think this is ok, at all. I believe the main demographic for this franchise is young girls, but it doesn\'t leave a good message and is actually very, very uncomfortable.Though like I said at first, the anime itself is decent. While it does have its flaws, sometimes it\'s nice to just sit down and watch anime to decompress.

Initially, I rated this show an 8/10, but perhaps my nostalgia for Inuyasha and my overexcitement clouded my judgment.I understand the show is about the offspring of Inuyasha and Sesshomaru but it was frustrating that old characters, the parents more specifically, were cut out from the story. It was like they were discarded. It's one thing to leave a little mystery for viewers to wonder about the parents but to do that entire season is...a bit much. As a watcher, I felt lead on astray. Also, the battles against the antagonists seem to be too easy in comparison to Inuyasha; they weren't as catastrophic. Lastly, a romantic pairing revealed in the show was off-putting, to put it lightly.Aside from that, the art was beautiful. I loved how to it stayed true to the same style as the predecessor Inuyasha. The three protagonists grew on me (with Moroha being my favorite), despite my issues with Yashahime. Moreover, I enjoyed ED 1, OP 2, and ED 2. The OSTs were fine but nothing really stood out to me as spectacular.By the end of S1, the drama finally picked up a bit. The ending, I felt, made up for some of the show's shortcomings.This show has a ton of potential and I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either. But, I'll give the 2nd season a chance since there's still so much story and background to discover.Overall, I made up my mind and rated it a 6/10 because it was alright. But I'll issue a fair warning for Inuyasha lovers, watch this without expectations or else you'll be let down. a bit much. As a watcher, I felt lead on astray.

I feel like Towa should not had been adopted by Sota and should just...have been in feudal era. If they really wanted separate her from Setsuna, it was possible to do it without bringing Towa in the futur and it would have made more sense to me.Next big problem, where are the main protagonist of Inuyasha? I know that it's a serie based on the three daughters of Inuyasha and Sesshomaru but they definitly didn't need to erase the parents, why couldn't Inuyasha and Kagome just be happy and living with their daughter? Nobody wished such a dark story for our first heroes. Kanketsu hen end did not portends such a dark sequel for them and it's unfair.They could just keep the parents and center the story on the new adventures of the daughters.But, with this story line, the other problem is that it's reaaaaaallly SLOW.We, Inuyasha's fans, want to know what happened to Kagome, Inuyasha, Rin and Sesshomaru and you give us useless filler instead of progress in the plot? Meh.Inuyasha itself did had a lot of fillers but the difference was that they we're mostly great and well implanted when Yashahime's filler just looks out of place.The most terrible part to me was the episode 19, it's the worst episode so far and it really disapointed me, what is the point to put such a bad and useless filler when the plot finally start moving? Without spoiling it, something really important happened in the episode 18 and then you have the 19 where no one speak about what happened in the previous one and we just have a stupid contest with an annoying princess without anything to do with the plot, it's crazy.The show is poorly writted, the story make no sense and they could have do much better and simple.A great anime as Inuyasha deserved way better than this.I will continue until the end but I feel like our questions won't be answered...Like, it remain only few episodes and they wasted 1 of them with the terrible 19th...Maybe there will be a season 2 but if it's to see lot of useless filler again, I don't know if I will want to see it.Even with the eventual return of Rin, Inuyasha and Kagome, I will always feel like everything was wasted, they didn't even had the chance to see them grow up... have been in feudal era.

As many of the other fans, I too, was left disappointed. Somehow, I wish it was just bad from start to finish, but it isn\'t, which somehow makes it even worse.It started out pretty okay, the beginning was kind of bland, but also evocative of how Kagome started her adventures out. Character...introductions were fine, Moroha instantly clicked with me, Towa and Setsuna didn\'t seem that bad either. At that point, that is. Cue me, after the first seven episodes, realising I could not remember what had happened the last four episodes, because nothing really mattered between episodes anyway, and mostly I just wanted to know where characters from Inuyasha was now. A plotpoint that is continually baited at the preview for next episode to then pan out to literally just be what was shown in the preview. For God\'s sake, Kagome and Inuyasha\'s absence is first explained in episode 15! That\'s approximately ten episodes TOO LATE. Before that episode, the only good one since the first three had been episode 13 because Miroku showed up.Funnily enough, the first episode after 15 that I liked, most people seem to find bad. Episode 19 at least had the tone of Inuyasha and gave some development to Setsuna, who is the biggest block of bleh I have seen, maybe ever. The dream butterfly stole her dreams, and apparently it took her personality along with them. Episode 19 broke away from that a bit, which was nice. This was then followed by four episodes that were actually pretty good. Suddenly, I was looking forward to watching episodes again, instead of dreading each episode. But then the final episode had to ruin everything.This is now a rant about everything I hated in episode 24, the finale of season 1: First of all, Kirinmaru is a bad villain, and no one cares about him. Zero at least seems interesting, especially because of dynamic between her, Sesshoumaru, and Sesshoumaru\'s mother, but Kirinmaru is bland. The only reason he hates half-demons is because of a prophecy, so that\'s also boring and played out. The only consequence of Setsuna dying is a risk that maybe Towa will stop being reduced to a siscon. Which she wasn\'t for the first three episodes, by the way. Not like anything will actually come from it, because Sesshoumaru gave Towa the Tensaiga, so I bet Setsuna will only stay dead for three episodes at most, but probably will come back in the first episode of season 2. The whole battle against Kirinmaru was so ridiculous too, it seemed so out of nowhere – now we\'re in SPACE, we can manifest our demonic energy as DOGS, and we have PERFECT CONTROL over our powers, because that seems like the natural next step for characters who previously barely could summon a minimum of that power, and when they did, they had no way of controlling it. It just seems like such a powerjump, even considering the circumstances. The demon energy dogs and space-thing I still can\'t actually proces. Urgh, this episode was just terrible.I\'ve alluded a bit to it already, but the main characters Towa and Setsuna are bland. Towa is mostly a siscon, making her entire life and arc (pfft, as if she has one) about her younger sister as well as most of her lines. Said sister, Setsuna, is a knockoff Sesshoumaru crossed with Sasuke, except both of those characters worked because they were not main characters, but antagonists who sometimes showed up. Moroha is a good girl, but was forgotten or only used for laughs for a lot of episodes, because Towa and Setsuna had no humour in them. The plot is filled with McGuffins to be found, gathered, lost, and looked for.All in all, watching this series is like an abusive relationship. It starts off okay, and then gets bad, but you keep thinking to yourself, ""no, it was just a bad episode, everything will get okay soon,"" but then it doesn\'t. When there finally is a good episode, it\'s only a bigger letdown when it eventually goes back to being bad. While I was watching it, I had to make up excuses for why I was STILL watching it to my brother. I can\'t even watch it as a hate watch, because I want to like it. I can\'t recommend it as anything to anyone. If you\'re still interested in watching it after this, be my guest, but it is disappointing. I will probably watch season 2 when it gets released, just to see if I was right about my prediction from episode 24, and because I will never be free. introductions were fine, Moroha instantly clicked with me, Towa and Setsuna didn\'t seem that bad either.

While I was watching it, I had to make up excuses for why I was STILL watching it to my brother. I can\'t even watch it as a hate watch, because I want to like it. I can\'t recommend it as anything to anyone. If you\'re still interested in watching it after this, be my guest, but it is disappointing. I will probably watch season 2 when it gets released, just to see if I was right about my prediction from episode 24, and because I will never be free.', 'POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS!!Yashahime was a HUGE disappointment for me. I don\'t understand why the characters behave the way they do, many Inuyasha characters have been replaced with other hollow ones (like Takechiyo replaced Shippo -I mean, come on! They even use the same powers-) and the ""bad"" guys are just a joke, you can\'t even take them seriously. I just can\'t accept the storyline (which, in my opinion, makes no sense AT ALL) and the fact that the characters we\'ve grown so fond of feel so foreign, especially Sesshomaru acting so coldly towards Rin and his daughters without explaining the reason (don\'t get me...started with what happened to Inuyasha and Kagome -they simply took them out of the way-). Many things that happened throughout the season remain unanswered and there are characters, such as Riku or Kirinmaru, whose intentions and goals are hard to understand.All in all, there are many copies and borrowings from Inuyasha (story, characters) and many things going on that let me down. I was too disappointed in the 1st season and the way the characters acted. Honestly, I was sad to discover that Inuyasha received such a sequel. :\'( I\'m just gonna pretend that Yashahime never happened and stick to the old, glorious characters and story! started with what happened to Inuyasha and Kagome -they simply took them out of the way-).

The reason I say this is because both shows focus on 1-2 main ""Goals"". (For Naruto that would be finding Sasuke. And for Yashahime it would be getting Setsuna\'s memories and dreams back, as well as the three meeting there parents.) Not only that, but the way they achieve the goals is very similar. They both focus on the goals yet complete smaller things along the way. Second, the art of Yashahime is beyond beautiful, with the environment being very bright, detailed, and stunning...to look at. And the character designs of the characters are very realistic yet there all somehow unique. Third, the personallites of each of the main characters are all a mix of there parents, but, they are also are different in there own way! (Setsuna\'s is similar to Sesshomaru\'s, Towa\'s is similar to Rin, and Moroha is a mix of Inuyasha and Kagome!)

I\'m a little nostalgic for Inuyasha, but not much, so this review is coming mostly from the perspective of a new watcher.So what does this show offer? Nothing but nostalgia bait and ship bait. Everything else about the show is trash. The writing is poor, the characters are one-dimensional and inconsistent, the animation seems to have been done on a shoestring budget, and the ""plot"" doesn\'t seem to exist. The one good thing about it that I\'ll admit...is that the music for the OP and ED are decent.I tolerated this garbage for 17 episodes because I hoped it would get better. Now I realize this was very much a waste of my time. If you\'re a nostalgia Inuyasha fan, I\'d advise you to just reread the manga rather than watch this anime. Also, if you\'re someone looking for an anime for your kid to watch please look for something else. Not only is this show incredibly bad, it also supports some uncomfortable messages that I, personally, wouldn\'t want my kid to learn. is that the music for the OP and ED are decent.I tolerated this garbage for 17 episodes because I hoped it would get better.

It's not perfect by any means, but It's not as bad as others say. You really need to be a fan of Inuyasha to get into this show otherwise you're not going to get much enjoyment out of it.  The new characters are all right, but Moroha steals the show no question. The art is amazing but some of the characters can look a bit goofy in certain shots. The music is phenomenal as always from the Inuyasha series. I will say the story is a bit rushed, and maybe that's because they can...only fit so much into 24 episodes, and sometimes some episodes feel like filler and don't progress the story, but we have been getting more details as of late with the story and it seems to be only story focused from here on out which is much needed. The comedy is great, and this is the main reason Moroha steals the show because shes a funny and loveable character...Setsuna and Towa? Not so much but they're not terribly written, just no as interesting. What I loved the most is seeing Inukag again, they are the 2 most lovable characters on the show and it's obvious we are being teased with them being absent throughout, and that actually goes for everyone in the original, they are absent through the show but do come up in an episode here and there.

It is plagued with filler and a lack of compelling characters.Defenders of Yashahime are quick to point out a few things. One, that we continue to view Yashahime through a nostalgic lens, that Inuyasha had pacing issues and had too many filler episodes. That’s as may be, but the difference is that I was hooked by the end of Inuyasha Season 1. What I feel at the end of Yashahime Season 1 is indifference. If I’m already at episode 18 of 24, and (1) feel...extremely “meh” about the protagonists, (2) am so much more interested in the original cast that I am grateful for info-dump episodes like episode 15, then something has gone seriously wrong.Some might also say that we should learn to appreciate Yashahime as a standalone series. I don’t disagree, but let’s also think about why Yashahime has its name. A yasha (or yaksha in Hindu mythology) has nothing to do with hanyos. The name Yashahime itself relies heavily on its connection to Inuyasha, because producers know full well that Yashahime will need Inuyasha fans to support it.Let’s look at the protagonists.Towa is sliding into Mary Sue territory. Her worst flaw is “caring too much” and being too compassionate. Even the ""villain"" feels he must somehow praise her during the final battle. If that\'s not what a Mary Sue does, I don\'t know what is. She is the simple syrup in this awful cocktail, yet somehow awarded a central place in the series despite having no compelling traits.Setsuna is the typical tsundere, but with the crime of being flat and lifeless. Despite being a twin to Towa, she plays a secondary role in battles even as she has more experience in combat and hunting demons.Moroha is the comedic foil, and I enjoy her character the most of the bunch for one reason: her Japanese voice actress is absolutely brilliant. There\'s always a cheeky air to Moroha\'s voice, a little laughter beneath the surface, waiting to bubble up. Yet she continues to be sidelined by the writers, conveniently disappearing from the plot at crucial moments. Why make it this way? Just say that Kagome and Inuyasha didn’t have any children.I will also add that I\'m unimpressed that the writers decided to make Sesshoumaru\'s bond with Rin a romantic one. Many others have already picked up their pitchforks arguing that he was a groomer and a pedophile, but that isn\'t something I agree with. Rather, I am concerned with the power dynamics between the couple and the lack of romantic development. Sesshoumaru is probably the most powerful daiyokai in the Inuyasha universe. He has been Rin’s provider since she was a child. Even after they have children together, Rin capitulates to his wishes and addresses him by the same honorific she did when she was a child, filled with childish admiration, completely dependent on him. Why did it have to be about romantic love? Many other types of bonds exist, and the bond between Sesshoumaru and Rin deserves to be more complex and nuanced. Sesshoumaru is also as reserved as he was in the original series, held back from expressing affection and emotion. Is that what Rin and the children deserve?Together, all three leads barrel through the series without much in the way of character development. Their bond is flimsy. Powers are discovered because they are hereditary, rather than learned through hardship and growth. When they do gain powers, it happens very quickly. And, if their powers all stem from the original cast, which many viewers are more fascinated by, then what is the point? Sesshoumaru was my favourite character after his redemption arc in Final Act. His is a coming of age story, about learning to live as a man outside of his great father’s shadow. Yet right now, his children are completely dependent on their inheritance.You know, I almost wish this had been a dark, twisted  fairytale in which Sesshoumaru loses everyone he loves and has to grapple with loss, grief, loneliness, and immortality. Because that’s a compelling story in my book. Everything that Yashahime isn’t. Now excuse me as I pretend Yashahime isn’t canon and go read more fanfiction.

It had me going for 4 episodes and after that it started feeling like filling episodes all over. If you are from the ones that watched Inuyasha as a child. It’s only natural that you will want to know what’s happened to the main protagonists. However, I’ve seen up to episode 11 and there are no news yet. It’s said We will get some on episode 13 but gosh, I feel like the creators are using the love we have for the original series to keep their protagonists...hostage. Still I am not quitting and keep watching each episode. However, there’s also a terrible manage of the characters screen time. In inuyasha it felt like the screen time of the main characters was even. However, in Yashahime they tend to completely push away characters like it’s nothing. The music is great and the art is good. There’s a lot of work to be done on one of the main characters though. Hopefully we will get to see an improvement. As for now it looks like there’s a Mary Sue, a sesshomaru and a Inukag personality character used as comedy relief. Nothing compared to the original.

I watched it so young that I didn’t even know what anime was, I just thought it was a weird cartoon with flashy powers and cool fights. Even now, as a 20-year-old, I still enjoy the hell out of Inuyasha whenever I decide to rewatch it, despite its flaws in the middle of the series. So, when Yashahime was announced, I was ecstatic to see a beloved anime of mine brought to modern animation. I knew I shouldn’t have been too hopeful, but I couldn’t help it. Lesson learned, don’t always let your hopes get the better...of you.Yashahime is nothing more than a poor man’s Inuyasha. The real issue I have with the show is that the minute it gets interesting, everything goes downhill all over again. Throughout its runtime, I’ve rated this show everything from a 4-8, and since it kept shifting from interesting plot and character interaction to shit pacing devoid of continuity I just decided to leave my rating at a 5, though it may have to be lower once this season is finished.Art: 6The art is good, but not great. The OP’s shows a glimpse of how good Sunrise can be when it comes to animation, with great lighting and action and a bright color palette. But the show just doesn’t hold up to the OP’s. There’s almost always a dip in animation quality when things get serious, as showcased in the fight between Sesshoumaru and new-bad-guy-who-hasn’t-gotten-a-glimpse-of-development. The art style is reminiscent of Inuyasha, which is refreshing, but calling back to the greatness of the original series seems to be the only thing Yashahime is capable of.Sound: 9This is where the show shines the brightest. Yashahime both borrows from Inuyasha’s immaculate soundtrack and has a number of original tracks that are fantastic, both in terms of music quality and composition. Both of the OP’s are some of my favorites, especially when compared to Inuyasha’s shit tier OP’s (besides 1 and the final act OP), and I sometimes listen to them just for the hell of it because they’re so catchy. The ED’s are high quality too, bringing a slow tone after the faster-paced OP’s. The BGM just seems to fit every scene perfectly, exactly like Inuyasha. If there’s one thing this show has done brilliantly, it’s the OST. Also, VA’s are superb. Well done.Story: 4Yashahime’s story is incredibly dull and repetitive, making use of “filler” episodes to have oftentimes boring material in between the somewhat decent plot-based episodes. At first, the story was gearing up to be interesting. The main cast is MIA, the girls have no idea what the hell is going on, the demon slayers are grown up, and now the Tree is talking to them? Okay, cool, I’m down with this. Then, they forgot to tell the story. Many episodes consist of half-assed, terribly paced fights where the girls go to a village, find an issue with a demon, slay the demon immediately while Towa gets sixty new power ups out of nowhere and Moroha gets knocked out in one hit and never returns. I understand that the story can’t be explained immediately or in every episode, and that’s okay. But when a month consists of nothing but demon-of-the-week episodes that don’t even contribute to the development of the characters in a meaningful way, people are going to complain. Moroha’s absence of presence in the show is one of its worst qualities. Even the episode where we meet her master is rushed, and then she forgets all about it by the next episode, which brings me to my biggest critique of this show. THERE IS NO CONTINUITY BETWEEN EPISODES. Whatever happened last episode doesn’t matter, and you can hardly ever tell how much time has passed in between episodes unless they run directly into each other. It feels offbeat and horribly paced as a result, both in between episodes and during the episodes themselves. The terrible pacing leads to nothing having an impact. Every time they slay a demon, it just poofs out of existence immediately and then the girls dust off their pants and walk home. There’s no rhyme or reason as to why things are happening and nothing is allowed to sink for the viewers to appreciate before they cut to the obligatory “Moroha didn’t get her bounty” joke and then the episode is over. The show just doesn’t spend the proper amount of time developing anything, from relationships to enemies to fights, regardless of outcome. There is a lot of potential within the series, but none of it was capitalized on at all.Characters: 6Don’t let the score fool you, the three girls are actually decently interesting characters, especially Moroha. But, just like the plot, the show never capitalized on any of its potential. Moroha is often thrown out of fights only to be the butt of the no-bounty-for-me joke, Towa just sits there and doesn’t do anything until Setsuna is in danger, in which she pulls the anime classic of randomly learning how to do a new, powerful demonic ability in less than ten seconds. On top of that, she doesn’t even struggle with it afterwards. When Inuyasha was dealing with his demon blood overtaking his senses, it took several episodes to explain what was happening and why this power needed to be controlled in order for him to grow stronger. In Yashahime, Towa learns a new power and then just tucks it in her back pocket for future use. It’s a sad attempt at writing that I may have done if I were 13 years old writing a shit fan fiction. Side characters, aside from maybe Riku, and terribly bland and just serve the same purpose that non-unique NPCs serve in a video game; stand there and look lively (smile and wave, boys). The original cast is wholly absent even when they finally make their first appearances. Remember Kohaku, Hisui, and Kaede? Yeah, me neither. Remember when they accidentally met Miroku and then the show completely forgot about both him and Sango? I fucking do. I get that this show is supposed to be about the girls, not the OG cast, and I’m perfectly fine with that. It’s just easier to like the show when the OG characters are around because the staff can’t write for shit when the new, semi-interesting characters come around.Enjoyment: 5I mean, yeah, I enjoy it. It’s an Inuyasha sequel. I’m going to finish regardless of it’s quality simply because I loved the original. Now I know how Naruto fans feel. I’m so sorry for you guys, but we suffer together now by both dealing with a shitty sequel. I’m honestly not even sure what I’d do if this show got a second season, but I’d be surprised if it did. I know it’s reception is not very good. Should’ve had Rumiko on the storyboard instead of whoever is writing this boring work.Conclusion:Don’t bother watching this show unless you’re a big Inuyasha fan or by some miracle you rate it higher than a 6. If you do, good for you, enjoy as much as you can. I’m going to suffer through it until the 24th episode, and maybe I’ll update this review at that time, if the show gets any better or, god help us, worse. I want to clarify that 5 stars isn’t necessarily a bad score, in fact it’s completely average, and with all my bashing, it might seem like I dislike this show more than I’m letting off. Truth is, it has good moments that qualify it in the 8-star range for me, and then it has several more terrible moments that are a solid 3 or 4. I’m just trying to enjoy it as much as I can given the fact that it’s a sequel of one of my favorites, so I’m sticking it with a 5 because of its good qualities (soundtrack, OP’s, Moroha, interesting storyline that is hardly expanded upon). I just hope that it can be better. I want to like this show way more than I actually do. of you.Yashahime is nothing more than a poor man’s Inuyasha.

Inuyasha was the very first anime i ever watched growing up and it left a pretty significant mark on me. This one the other hand was nice to see but i could never bring myself to watch it, out of fear it would ruin how i felt about the original. I found myself the most interested when the major characters from Inuyasha appeared. I watch every episode but it felt I was dredging through the whole series solely so I could see the scenes with the original character in it and know the context....I was very confused by the whole rainbow pearls and how they apparently were never heard of during the original adventure despite many demons knowing of them in these 2 shows. I was happy to see the original characters having grown up (even it they all looked pretty much the same) and had children. But I personally would've preferred a story with them just travelling around and doing stuff training the next generation over this twisted net of objectives the all had.Hell what I think pissed me off the most was the whole wolf tribe and Moroka. Koga and Ayame would have never allowed Inuyasha's and Kagome's daughter to be sent off with some random tribe member and then be cool with her pretty much being sold into pseudo-slavery. They probably would have raised her as their own even if that caused conflict within the tribe. I was very confused by the whole rainbow pearls and how they apparently were never heard of during the original adventure despite many demons knowing of them in these 2 shows.

My husband and I have been watching it and loving the hell out of it.  The girls are all so much fun and I love the direction that the story is going.  The music for each of the characters is so nostalgic and whenever I hear the battle music, it gives me goosebumps.  I love being able to see what happened to all my favorite characters and I can't wait to see how the kids deal with what happened to them.If you...enjoy the original, you will definitely love this.  I can't wait to see what happens next <3 enjoy the original, you will definitely love this.  I can't wait to see what happens next <3"", 'If you are an Inuyasha fan like myself then you will be highly displeased by what was put together to be called a ""sequel"".Frankly, Inuyasha ended at a fine point and didn\'t need this if it was gonna be so bad.The best part about this show are the character designs for the main 3 and their personalities. That\'s it.Sango is non-existent, Shippou reincarnated as a weird raccoon, Miroku is just a bum now, and InuKagome…. sighIts annoying to me that the whole franchise was built upon InuKagome\'s dynamic relationship only to be obscured in the events to follow it. Moroha gets sidelined way too much...when shes the DAUGHTER of the two MCs who are the entire reason for this franchise to begin with.Theres so much attention on Towa and Setsuna that great side characters like Kohaku and Hisui don\'t get seen on screen and thats lame because they would be cool.Typical anime have 24 episodes per season. We have come to the end of season 1 and the villains intentions are still unknown or just completely shallow. Krinmaru hates hanyos. Zero loved Inu no Taisho? & Riku apparently seems to be wingin it.I really wish this series had manga, like something writen beforehand so the animated story could flow well, have some depth and not feel so rushed. I mean Rumiko has 4 series and 3 of them garnered outstanding popularity so its safe to say shes just chillin now. She had no means to do anymore with what she has done because it was fantastic.To end the first season with Setsuna dead and a broken Tenseiga really annoys me (and many others I\'m sure)Oh yeah and the dream butterfly? Well Setsunas dead so lets see how long it takes to revive her and if that seemingly pointless plot is ever addressed.You\'re entitled to your own opinion but anyone saying this is good is smoking meth tbh3/10, and Im just being nice& anyone justifying Sessh x Rin needs serious, SERIOUS help when shes the DAUGHTER of the two MCs who are the entire reason for this franchise to begin with.Theres so much attention on Towa and Setsuna that great side characters like Kohaku and Hisui don\'t get seen on screen and thats lame because they would be cool.Typical anime have 24 episodes per season.

Unfortunately it didn\'t deliver on those expectations and I\'ll explain why. There will be a few spoilers but I\'ll warn in advance.Visuals:1) I love the character design of the main cast2) Some scenes break continuity and in doing so it breaks my immersion as well. The best example I can give on this is how Moroha\'s quiver has different number of arrows depending on the angle we see her in, which I don\'t see how it could be such a...difficult thing to fixSound:1) I love the 1st OP and the 1st ED and I was sad when they changed them;2) There\'s a mix of rookie seiyuus with veteran seiyuus but you wouldn\'t be able to tell without looking up because everyone\'s performance was solid3) Moroha\'s seiyuu was not a good choice in my opinion because the voice doesn\'t match the character at all. I like Tadoroko Azusa\'s voice work but this role just wasn\'t a good fit in my opinion. This hurt my overall enjoyment because since Moroha is a main character, I got to hear her a lot4) Sometimes the dialog and animations aren\'t in sync5) Miroku\'s original seiyuu was the legendary Tsujitani Kouji and unfortunately he passed away in 2018. Takagi Motoki did give his voice to a younger Miroku but instead of hiring him, the staff decided to hire Yasumura Makoto. I don\'t fully agree with the decision because I like continuity when it comes to voice acting. Also, here\'s a “fun” fact for you: Miroku (Tsujitani Kouji) was married to Shippou (Watanabe Kumiko).6) Kagome\'s seiyuu is still Satsuki Yukino, InuYasha is still Yamaguchi Kappei, Jaken is still Cho, Kaede is still Hisako Kyouda, Sango is still Kuwashima Houko and Sesshoumaru is still Narita Ken. These were major pluses for me.Story (no spoilers until I say it otherwise):1) Sexist bs like “women have to be girly” or “men need to be masculine” need to die asap. Ain\'t nobody with a brain has patience for that kind of bs in 20212) Miroku and Sango\'s first appearance it felt so underwhelming3) Only by the 15th episode do we learn about Sesshoumaru, InuYasha and Kagome events and to be honest, I was no longer invested in the near non-existent plot because up to that point, it seemed that every episode is the same episode with a different creature they\'re trying to hunt for bounty money.4) I felt no chemistry between the main cast.5) I only felt that the show was going somewhere by the 18th episode but the episode that followed was one of the most ridiculously placed fillers I\'ve ever seen in an anime.6) Setsuna\'s backstory was only shown by the 20th episode which is a huge mistake in terms of pacing7) The plot is messy and hard to follow on which characters are true villains and why false villains are acting as villains. It may be one of those cases where ""wait for season 2 kind of thing"" but I don\'t enjoy shows without a few clear plot points, if that makes sense.8) SPOILERS UNTIL NEXT CATEGORY!!!! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!! Sesshoumaru and Rin are the parents of Setsuna and Towa. Rin was a little kid when she and Sesshoumaru met. This is called grooming and it\'s problematic. Not only that but she gave birth to her daugthers at 16 years old. I don\'t care if it\'s a different culture or fiction, this should not be accepted. It\'s pedophilia and it\'s disgusting.Etc.:1) On the 2nd episode: Chibi, Megane, Perm and Kakugari and even Moroboshi Ataru who are characters from my favourite anime of all time and also one of iconic works of Rumiko Takahashi make an appearance and I cried tears of joy! However, Ataru should\'ve acted a bit more like his usual self and gotten Toshio Furukawa to voice him.All things considered, this show was a major disappointment and it gets a 5/10 from me.

I had high expectations and I must say I wasn't disappointed.The sequel has all the good points of the previous anime...and the bad too hahaThe animation varies from okay to very good. The characters are all likable though I had a harder time to connect to Setsuna due to her withdrawn character but I'm waiting to see her in later episodes.We get all the fan service we can get from the previous characters and some new plots from their children, the new heroes. The only thing that I think could be missing is a love story...or a ship, we had plenty with Inuyasha and Kagome, alas so far nothing for any of the girls. It may not be a bad point for some people, I'm just a fan of romance hahaAlso it got the same repetitive pattern that the previous anime had, they encounter people to save and yokai to defeat but the main plot takes a lot of time to progress.Both opening and ending are bangers. or a ship, we had plenty with Inuyasha and Kagome, alas so far nothing for any of the girls.

So I have prior knowledge of background & character information.- The story starts off pretty decent but then stagnates significantly up until a few important episodes. There are more questions than answers even by the end of the season.- Moroha does very little throughout the season as the show mainly focuses on Towa and Setsuna. Even Moroha\'s solo-focused episode comes off as poorly forced-in.- Very little blood is shown; all the monsters...just disintegrates when killed, only a few stab wounds and bleeding from the mouth is shown- They play the flashback with Towa and Setsuna separating when they were kids A LOT. I\'m serious. It\'s always the same flashback and Towa getting all serious about not separating from Setsuna ever again.- Pacing is slow, it\'ll sprinkle in a few hints & scenes about past characters but don\'t expect any answers or much screentime involving them this season.- Character motivations (Both main & side characters) are confusing & often jump from one objective to another. Often ignoring their original intent up until it comes up and even then not do anything.It\'s an okay anime but it\'s very clearly just a large set-up season for all the (potentially) good stuff that\'s going to happen next season as Season 2 was announced immediately after the last episode aired. just disintegrates when killed, only a few stab wounds and bleeding from the mouth is shown- They play the flashback with Towa and Setsuna separating when they were kids A LOT.

It's really amazing art and the plot is super interesting. The three female characters are some of the most badass female characters that I have seen.I really appreciate that they are not hypersexualized women that are following a male main character (which is probably why the male fandom didn't like it).The plot has similarities to Inuyasha (of course it is the continuation) but it doesn't diminish the particularities of this show.I strongly recommend it if you wanna see strong women characters, beautiful art, and...some traditional youkai art and tradition.Looking forward to watching the next season!! some traditional youkai art and tradition.Looking forward to watching the next season!!"", ""I've never written a review before, but this was such a travesty of wasted potential that I felt compelled to do so. I'm gonna keep it short, this show is not good. With re-boots, there's always some element of nostalgia bait, which is fine, but with Yashahime, that's all there is. The story is actually good if you don't consider the writing. And of course, the world and characters of InuYasha are pretty decent and already well-established, so you'd think there's no way they could fuck this up, right? But the studio is very clearly still stuck in bloated-200-episode-shounen-from-the-early-aughts mode, and it shows. Let's be...honest--we're all used to less-than-stellar writing; I mean this is anime we're talking about. But the writing and pacing is so laughably egregious in this show, it makes it difficult to develop any emotional connection to the characters and the plot. If you're a die-hard fan, you'll probably want to watch this. But I'd advise everyone else to save your time, there's so many better winter 2021 anime happening right now. honest--we're all used to less-than-stellar writing; I mean this is anime we're talking about.

As some viewers have already expressed, this is a story from renowned Rumiko Takahashi, having won the Shogakukan award twice—and recently, The Purple Ribbon Medal of Honor from the Japanese government. To say that her works are underrated or a complete failure simply because one does not agree with the way the story is being portrayed is a disgrace upon some within the Inuyasha...community, and may not be inherently respectable to call themselves true ""Inuyasha fans"".Now, on the flip-side, I\'m not going to sugar coat anything here by any stretch. Yashahime is not without its flaws. As any one series is subject to criticisms—even being regarded as some of the best classics in anime history (i.e. ""Cowboy Bebop"" anyone? Yes, I have heard people criticize it all the same)—Yashahime deserves no special treatment, either.From the very beginning, we get a sense of nostalgia. And I\'d like to say, rightly so! Long-time fans are reunited with some underlying story endings—or hints—from both ""Inuyasha"" and ""Inuyasha: The Final Act"", as well as their favorite characters. It\'s no surprise that nostalgia was going to play a part in making a new series that is inherently -meant- to bring in that factor.However, what we soon begin to disregard as viewers is that, just as we have aged from the original series (yes, pre-The Final Act/Kanketsu-hen), so too have the characters aged. Throughout all my reading, it seems that we as the viewer, have often forgotten that fact. Characters who have been described as ""young"" back in the original ""Inuyasha"" series are now 10+ years older than where they were. It takes some simple Google searching to understand—as well as a general focus on what the story is telling us—that the character(s) in question are no longer pre-teens. They may -appear- young, as they should—because they are just that: young. But they are in no stretch of the imagination a child. Let\'s look up the facts and debunk this myth already. Don\'t give into all the buzz of what\'s -falsely- circulating on the Web. Give yourself, and this show, a fighting chance before you crucify it.This leads me to the things that the show could have improved upon. I\'ll be the first to admit, the show has a very slow-paced pickup. The beginning feels very episodic and very run-of-the-mill ""demon-extinguishing"" day after day. But I honestly don\'t judge this at face value. Why? Not only are they building character development and relationships with one another, but we get a feel for how the world of the Sengoku-era is at present-day (back in time, of course). Out of all the episodes, I can safely count on one hand how many ""filler episodes"" might exist without anyone official giving their consent on the matter. While about 3 or 4 episodes seemed ""filler"" in my mind before episode 13, there was only one (1) episode I may have considered as such from episode 12 to 24. That\'s roughly a 1/6 ratio. I don\'t consider that awful. There are plenty of other anime out there that purposely filler with no regard to canon material—(""Naruto"" or ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"", anyone?)All in all, this was a lovely series. If you\'ve only given it half (or less than half) of its span to crucify it, you aren\'t doing the show, or yourself any justice. It really picks up after or during episode 13, and the final several episodes had me both jaw-dropped and crying—both tears of joy, and sadness.Don\'t give in to the naysayers of folks who have given their heavily biased reviews based on feelings of things their perfect fanfiction didn\'t portray. This is canon. This is Rumiko\'s work. Be happy with it, and be someone who can voice their own thoughts on it. It\'s not perfect, but I\'ve come to learn that most anime are not perfect anyway. Watch the whole thing through. Season 2 has already been announced, and I personally can\'t wait to see what it brings! There is so much -mystery- in this anime, and I think that\'s where all the good writing has stemmed from. People are confusing a compelling, good mystery, with disinteresting or nonsensical.

Is it a sequel to Inuyasha that doesn’t change the killing the new monster each episode format? Yes. However I don’t see why that has to be a problem?I enjoyed Inuyasha years also like many others, I watched it all the way through including the movies and that was that, I never rewatched it due to length but thought it was good when it came out. When I...watch this show obviously there is nostalgia, the sound design specifically seems to be exactly the same but I LOVE hearing it, it brings a smile to my face and makes me feel good. We are still in the same world with many of the same characters/ideas/themes being the same but what is different makes the show worth watching in my opinion.Inuyasha was a long form anime and we don’t yet know if this plans to go in the same direction or not but I’m interested to see where it goes. The seeds of an interesting story are here, character interactions are fun to watch, and I am genuinely invested to see the backstories to how we got here from Inuyasha’s finale. Episode 15 specifically was a very good episode for the lore and at at the end it promises that more is coming. I appreciate that we weren’t kept in the dark for a long time as to the big questions many have after watching the first few episodes. While not everything is answered I trust in time they will and I will be happy to keep watching until then.If you liked Inuyasha I see no reason why you shouldn’t give Yashahime a chance as you’ll probably like it too 👍 watch this show obviously there is nostalgia, the sound design specifically seems to be exactly the same but I LOVE hearing it, it brings a smile to my face and makes me feel good.

I feel like they were sloppy in fitting the background story to the show. There\'s a lot of loose ends-or in this case beginnings- it\'s like it doesn\'t want to feature the OG Inuyasha too much but Inuyasha and its characters are highly relevant to the plot! How are we talking about half-demon princesses and neglecting their parents?? As the series continues some questions are answered but some ""answers"" lead to more questions/plot holesI also dont understand how they curse so its more adult but the fighting is lower stakes. I...think the show needs to decide which direction it wants to go in.Character: The girls dont seem to mature that much but they\'re also 15 so thats fine. We do learn more about why most main characters are the way they are. I wish Sango was more fleshed out she just seems like shes there and we dont see her and Miroku interact. Sesshomaru is i think true to form but I would think after having two kids with a human he\'d be a little softer? i dont like the Shippo-wannabe character. The evil characters in the first half, i think, are too easy to beat. Inuyasha had a bit more drama.Enjoyment: i thought the first few episodes were bad but i kept watching and ended up enjoying it and looking forward to watching. the last few episodes were especially good and well done think the show needs to decide which direction it wants to go in.Character: The girls dont seem to mature that much but they\'re also 15 so thats fine.

Inuyasha had a bit more drama.Enjoyment: i thought the first few episodes were bad but i kept watching and ended up enjoying it and looking forward to watching. the last few episodes were especially good and well done', 'To this day Inuyasha remains my favourite anime series of all time. The late night Adult Swim viewings as a kid and those nostalgic EDs have stayed with me some 15 years later.After Final Act, the fandom wanted more Inuyasha, but we all knew in our hearts that the series had run its course and there was nothing else to add to the story. When news broke of Yashahime being made, I was estatic. Finally, after 11 years we were getting more of our childhood faves. Predictably, Yashahime’s first season(season 2 coming in summer) did not live up to its predecessor, but that doesn’t...mean it’s not an enjoyable watch for fans of Inuyasha.I’ll be brief. My main issue with Yashahime is that there’s way too much dead space in the series. The show blue balls you week after week with glimpses of the truth behind Kagome, Inuyasha and co’s disappearance and other plot points, but takes ages to actually get into them. This season is a show-runner to a longer series and it really shows. The pacing is awful far too often throughout. There’s large portions of episodes that could be condensed down into something much shorter, yet we get 10-15 minutes of fluff. Now, don’t get me wrong. Fluff is ok, I don’t mind the girls doing silly stuff with each other, but when there’s important plot points being neglected for episodes at a time, it becomes an issue.Other than the awful pacing at times, I really enjoyed Yashahime. I think the girls are very fun, each have their own unique personality and are all capable of holding their own in a fight. I loved their chemistry throughout and they really did feel like a family once Setsuna’s tsun tsun walls were broken down. The art is basically an updated version of Final Act, which is very nostalgic to me and brought back so many memories. In traditional Inuyasha fashion, the OP and ED are bangers throughout and classic Inuyasha OSTs are reused as well.Yashahime leaves a lot to be desired, but considering it’s a set up for a longer series and a sequel to my favourite anime, I’m willing to overlook some things until I get the full picture. Yashahime gets 7 pearls out of 10.EDIT: There will probably be a A LOT of people rating the anime low due to the reveal about Towa and Setsuna’s mother. Which is absolute BS. The story takes place 500 years ago. Society was completely different and views towards marriage were nothing like today. mean it’s not an enjoyable watch for fans of Inuyasha.I’ll be brief.

Yes, we get to see our beloved characters again but the story becomes a bit boring pretty quickly. I know it is probably because they are building up the story but I felt lost and not interested because the plot doesn\'t seem to follow a solid story line, there is...no sense of purpose or unity between the characters. There are episodes that feel completely like fillers (mind you, this does not have a manga so I don\'t know how you manage to have filler-like episodes).So many things happen that are so hard to believe or find a logical explanation: why did Sesshomaru ally with Kirinmaru to fight Inuyasha? it doesn\'t make sense because at the end of ""The Final Act"" Inuyasha and Sesshomaru are certainly not best buddies but are definitely on better terms than at the beginning of the whole show, for them to be enemies now. Another confusing thing is...how old is Rin now and how old was she when she and Sesshomaru got involved? when the twins were born she looked like 14? and on that same line, how come we don\'t even get a scene of Sesshomaru being loving towards Rin if he actually got her pregnant? but the worst of all, why would a parent willingly separate his newborn daughters from their mother, give them to his servant to nurse them for a bit and then just abandon them? he could have allowed Rin to do the same as Jaken at least. And by the way, Rin was just completely OK with that? unbelievable.Other things that are not clear at all is, why leave Moroha with Kouga and not with Sango and Miroku? why did Kouga then leave Moroha with the sensei? this poor girl has been completely neglected and even speaks like a wild child.  And by the way, are Kagome and Inuyasha getting older at his dad\'s grave or not? Its hard to believe they have been there for 14 years and not found a way back. What happened with one of Miroku\'s and Sango\'s daughter? she seems to have passed away. Anyway, so many confusing things throughout the whole season and no resolution in sight. I know that it was not like they were going to answer all of our questions because they are probably going to continue the anime, but at least some more clarity on things to give us motivation to continue watching.Art 8/10This is the anime\'s strongest point. You can see ""Inuyasha"" all over these drawings (that is probably why I\'m appreciative of the art).Sound 7/10Other than the opening, nothing really stands out from the sound.Characters 6/10I\'m not even going to spend time on the old characters because I already spoke about them in my Inuyasha review. I do wonder why Miroku abandoned his family to train. Seems unlike him.To be honest, I don\'t even feel inspired to talk about the new characters. Setsuna did nothing but be hostile most of the time, Moroha was annoying due to her lack of manners and acting like acting like a wild child and Towa I guess was just OK. I found Takechiyo very annoying and really not adding anything to the story. I think the most interesting character is Riku, only because I am still unable to tell whether he is a good or a bad guy.Enjoyment 5/10I would be lying if I said all episodes were bad. There were some solid episodes, specially towards the end of the season. However, I did have to force myself to watch through the whole thing because I am no quitter.Overall 6/10 no sense of purpose or unity between the characters.

The characters get limited development and the whole season seems to be episodic with the main story taking a back seat and just being a B story in each episode untill near the end of the season. in Season 2 things get back...on track in a big way so please read up on that here https://myanimelist.net/anime/48505/Hanyou_no_Yashahime__Sengoku_Otogizoushi_-_Ni_no_Shou?q=yashahime&cat=animeb on track in a big way so please read up on that here https://myanimelist.net/anime/48505/Hanyou_no_Yashahime__Sengoku_Otogizoushi_-_Ni_no_Shou?q=yashahime&cat=animeb', ""this is the sequel to the masterpiece, that is Inuyasha I would recommend it.it's better than Boruto, and the plot about Inuyasha and Kagome's daughter and Sesshōmaru twin daughters, teaming up and fighting Kirinmaru the lord of the eastern lands.plot 10 out of 10characters 10 out of 10 and, are 100% interesting....art great loved it,  the out is amazing.i enjoyed all of, it.this not a horrible anime by any means  its great sequel and I love Inuyasha and  Sesshōmaru kids they great main characters,   oh sango and Miroku in it so is there 3 children . art great loved it,  the out is amazing.i enjoyed all of, it.this not a horrible anime by any means  its great sequel and I love Inuyasha and  Sesshōmaru kids they great main characters,   oh sango and Miroku in it so is there 3 children ."", ""I have enjoyed watching Yashahime from the beginning thus far. Although, the show can be a bit predictable. I wish the plot didn't follow along as much as the Shikon no Tama. This can be seen in the opening of the first episode. I do wish that they would focus more on Towa and Setsuna. Setsuna is personally my favorite character. She has the best development.  I don't like Moroha as a character overall. I find her to try and be the new Shippou that is annoying and for comic relief. Overall though the show is pretty good. It brings back good memories of...InuYasha. Sometimes it keeps me on edge.

Most of them like S2 more as all they care about is the original characters not the story or the main characters of Yashahime.Moroha is weak character with no personality and just a comic relief character. Her popularity seems to be due to be daughter of Inuyahsa rather than herself .This season seems to build up to a good story . Episode 24 looked to be promising but by the end of second season. It became all about the parents. Especially for Setsuna...and Moroha . Instead of developing them as characters on their own. They became plot devices for their parentsThe fights in S1 are by far better than S2The ones in S1 had choreography and different scenarios .The best fight was Towa vs Setsuna as it had a lot of different sequencesThere was a combined attack between Towa using her demon energy and Moroha using her arrow .Towa and Setsuna had to work together because of their different poison immunityThe girls were trapped and Towa had to use her mind to be freeThere was also a sword sequences between Towa and kirinmaru in the last episode. It wasn’t a one swing like what they are doing now in season 2 .S2 fights has repeated scenarios and Setsuna keeps using red threads where her enemies suddenly have a change of heart and talk about their feelings 🙄If you think you will see a good shounen fight you will be disappointed by the end of season 2 .

The ending is already best in InuYasha: Kanketsu-hen... but why the hell there\'s ""Next generation""?!My total rating is... 5/10.(Sorry for bad english... I use fricking google translate) hopes too high when this anime was released at that time (when it was still going on...)Note: I should have written this when the anime finished in 2021.The main point is, that this anime only carries the addition of a continuation of Inuyasha... which actually doesn\'t need any extras!

I use fricking google translate)', 'Man, this was such an average series.  Painfully average.  And this coming from someone whose childhood anime viewing experienced started out with Inu-Yasha, being one of the anime that really hooked me in.  This was a weak, weak follow up.  As with all sequels, I\'ll assume you know the events of both Inu-Yasha and The Final Act for the purposes of this review.Story: Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon takes place many, many years after the events of The Final Act.  Sesshoumaru now has twin daughters - Towa and Setsuna.  When they were young, the forest they were in was burned down...and subsequently split them apart from each other.  While Setsuna was simply cast off to a different part of the woods, Towa was thrown back through the old Bone Eater\'s well back to Kagome\'s old timeline.  There, she was raised by Souta, now an adult with a wife and daughter.  Ten years later, Towa goes to school in the modern day.  One day, she discovers Setsuna, as well as Inu-Yasha\'s daughter, teleported through time right to where she is.  However, we soon discover that Setsuna doesn\'t remember her long lost twin sister.  Together, the three of them travel back to Feudal Japan era to find out how to recovery Setsuna\'s memories.The story is such a mess throughout the series, though it has some okay spots.  A few episodes in, we discover why Setsuna doesn\'t remember Towa, but even when our characters have this new goal in mind, they take such a long time to get to where they want.  This was a problem with the initial Inu-Yasha series, in that the pacing was such a slog.  Multiple episodes play out in a monster-of-the-day fashion, which I didn\'t see working, and unsurprisingly, it doesn\'t... at all.  One of the reasons is because Moroha\'s storyline has her incurring a debt from her old master.  The entire thing was horribly uninteresting and her inclusion in this series almost makes you forget that she\'s Inu-Yasha\'s daughter to begin with.  And while we\'re talking uninteresting, can we talk about how boring the three girls\' weapons are?  They don\'t have interesting backstories and outside of the powers the girls\' themselves have, they don\'t even look cool.I\'d be remiss to not mention the effect that nostalgia plays in this series because it does, at least, pull off some of it quite well.  All three daughters do inherit powers that are similar to their fathers\', and they go as so far as to give Moroha some of Kagome\'s priestess powers too, which I thought added a nice touch to her character.  They also reference the events from the third Inu-Yasha movie multiple times, which I thought was really cool too.  That movie was easily my favourite, and to refer to it on multiple occasions was a bright spot in a story structure that was really lacking in just about every other corner.  Aside Sesshoumaru, other characters like Miroku, Sango and Kohaku have minor roles in the series, but I don\'t love that they left whatever\'s going on with Rin out of the picture.  My guess is that that\'s a topic for the sequel - or it better be.  Another surprise side character from the Inu-Yasha makes an appearance in one of the middle episodes, but I\'ll leave that for you to watch for.  I was excited to see her, in any case.By the time we reach the finale, we aren\'t even sure if we\'ve answered some questions, backed onto the fact that these fourteen year old half demons, or quarter demon in Moroha\'s case, somehow manage to have flashes where their power equals that of Kirinmaru, the supposed villain for this series.  I really don\'t understand how they thought this made sense, plot-wise.  Towa somehow also adjusts extremely quickly to fighting with a sword she never once wielded, which also bugged me.  There are so many flaws with the story and you can really tell what happens with this type of story when there isn\'t a source for this type of thing.  (4/10)Characters: Towa\'s a fine lead, and to be honest, I\'m glad they focused on Sesshoumaru\'s daughters rather than Inu-Yasha\'s.  It changes the series up a little bit and we know pretty much everything about Inu-Yasha already, so giving story to Sesshoumaru\'s ""line"" was a nice decision - ignoring the fact that it was poorly executed.  Towa\'s obviously aware of her unusually heightened reflexes and strengths before Setsuna and Moroha pop up in the present day, but it feels like she doesn\'t think things through very well.  Setsuna grades out a little better, in that she makes more sound decisions, all while having a gentle side.  I couldn\'t get a proper read on Moroha because her storyline was such a disaster.  At the very least, you can see her exciting side coming from Inu-Yasha.The series basically has seven villains.  Kirinmaru is the main one, a lord demon that once fought Inu-Yasha\'s father.  He was okay, but we don\'t learn enough about him.  His sister, Zero, has wildly confusing objectives, and his right hand man - Riku - is also confusing in how he acts.  Kirinmaru\'s four ""Prime Evils"" are incredibly bland and are basically just stronger demons that you could easily see being done away with from the likes of Inu-Yasha if he wanted.  None of them rise to the level of Naraku, or even the army of seven.  It\'s not close.  Other side characters are also pretty meh, and mostly aren\'t worthy of mention anyway.  Characters as a whole are fairly mediocre and have weak backstories, for the most part.  (5/10)Art: Maybe I\'m forgetting something, but I don\'t recall The Final Act looking so ugly at some many points during the series.  It feels like they really rushed out the middle portion of the series in particular, because body proportions look messy at certain times, as well as finer details.  These are mostly solved by the time we reached the end though.  Many of the action scenes don\'t inspire much confidence and aside from the last battle of the season, aren\'t exactly exciting to watch.  (6/10)Sound: Where this series didn\'t completely bomb is with it\'s sound.  Kaoru Wada returns to be in charge of the music, and it mostly keeps to the same style as the Inu-Yasha series.  I wouldn\'t say there were many super exciting tracks, but keeping the same feel was a plus for me.  I actually really liked the first OP, New Era by SixTones, as it has the same feel that Change the World did.  The other OP and both EDs were also just as solid.  The VO cast was unsurprisingly strong.  Crispin Freeman (Kirinmaru) and Morgan Berry (Moroha) were easily my favourites here.  I\'ve been a fan of Freeman since his work with Blood+ and Witch Hunter Robin, and to see him get a huge role that he completely knocks out excited me!  Morgan Berry was amazing with Moroha and starting to be a bigger and bigger fan of hers too.  I did not think they\'d be able to get Richard Ian Cox (Inu-Yasha) and David Kaye (Sesshoumaru) back, as both don\'t really do much dubbing work anymore, but I\'m glad they both returned.  Kira Tozer (Kagome) sounds really awkward though, even in the limited role she has here.  Moneca Stori has since retired from voice acting, so it\'s unsurprising that they had to recast her.  Ian James Korlett (Miroku) was fine, but he\'s certainly no Kirby Morrow, who tragically passed away after only voicing for the first episode in which Miroku appeared in.  Erica Mendez (Towa) and Kira Buckland (Setsuna) as the leads do a solid job here as newcomers to the series and also grade out quite well.  (9/10)Overall Enjoyment: To say I was disappointed with Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon would be an understatement.  There\'s just so many uninteresting story lines, no real story structure, sluggish pacing and uninteresting characters present here.  Nostalgia only takes you so far and this series had a ton of hype when it was first announced, which was not met at all.  It\'s possible I watch the sequel series, but it\'s definitely not my priority.  If you were a fan of the main series, movies and / or The Final Act, I think you\'ll be left sorely disappointed with Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon.

There\'s just so many uninteresting story lines, no real story structure, sluggish pacing and uninteresting characters present here.  Nostalgia only takes you so far and this series had a ton of hype when it was first announced, which was not met at all.  It\'s possible I watch the sequel series, but it\'s definitely not my priority.  If you were a fan of the main series, movies and / or The Final Act, I think you\'ll be left sorely disappointed with Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon.  (5/10)', 'First and foremost. THIS SHOW ISN’T FINISHED YET.THIS MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS!!! IT MAY ALSO BE A TRIGGER TO SOME, SO AVOID THIS IF THAT’S THE CASE PLEASE!!!Most of the reviews anyone will read below this are most likely not going to be helpful. That’s due to people either being for or against a ship that is portrayed in this sequel. If anyone wants to know keep reading the next paragraph, if not skip to the other paragraph.This is a  [i]anime-only [/i] sequel to Inuyasha. Inuyasha itself takes place between late 1990s to early 2000s, but a majority of the story is set...in Feudal Japan. It’s fantasy based so demons are part of the focus and plot to this story. Inuyasha takes place over a year to collect the jewel shards and defeat Naraku, the big bad evil. By itself alone, Inuyasha was great and ended on a high note. It had varying dynamics and gave main, as well as side characters (minus a handful) depth along with character development. Now here’s the drama that is ensuing within the fandom. A certain ship was portrayed in the sequel based off characters from Inuyasha, which would be Sesshomaru and Rin. Sesshomaru is a dai-youkai (in other words a high level [dog] demon). He has been alive for 1000+ years but physically he is placed as 19 [in human years]. Sesshomaru starts off as an antagonist by fighting his younger half-demon brother Inuyasha for a sword that was left by their father. The main reason why Sesshomaru was able to change and become a better person is by meeting and traveling with a child named Rin as well as Jaken. Rin, even though it wasn’t stated except for this character profile book no one provides the page of, has no age but is thought to be at least 8 years old. Here’s where people get the division; some view their relationship as father-daughter, some just view them as traveling companions. The some that view this as familial are disgusted by the hint of the portrayal of the Sessrin ship coming true. Going past that, those some have even started to claim that this ship displays signs of grooming and pedophilia. Although people are allowed their opinions and beliefs, everyone views this differently. The examples to back this up are that (and to keep this short/simple) is• (Grooming) since Sesshomaru and Rin met at 19/8, even though Rin was left at a human village and Sesshomaru left for long periods of time, he came back with gifts for Rin.• (Pedophilia) That Sesshomaru did the deed with Rin at the age of 12-15.It’s been said a million times over the internet about the timeline/ages of the Inuyasha cast. If anyone wants to look that up, please feel free to do so. I will state it in terms of Rin’s age but all the way at the end, that way I can space it out to be clean.Now to get on to a review of Yashahime. This series has a lot of....everything surrounding it. Please remember, THIS SERIES WAS DONE DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC! In terms of plot and story writing, so far, the story needs a lot for it to make most people interested in it. Keep in mind, the story is suppose to revolve around the NEW GENERATION, not the original. In that regards, this is light and fluffy. It definitely is funny to watch, but will leave anyone feeling that they have more questions than answers. Animation-wise, it can get a bit wonky and a majority of the characters will look so much younger than their ages. It does however fit the theme of this being a show aimed to an audience younger than adults. Lastly then, music-wise, anyone will get nostalgia as some of the OST is used from Inuyasha. The opening and endings, on the other hand, are well done in animation and are very catchy, plus up-beat.Since this show, as of 1/18/2021, is still ongoing with 8 episodes left within this season, I’m still hoping it will end on a high note. I do also wish for all the characters to get happy endings, and for all my questions to be answered.I hope if anyone took the time to read this has a good day, and thank you very much for taking the time to read this. <3Timeline/Rin’s Age:The anime states that Kagome first travels back to the Feudal Era when she turns 15 in 1997. As said before, Rin is assumed to be 8 years old when she is first introduced in the show.The storyline of Inuyasha takes place in the span of a year. Leaving Kagome at 15/16, and Rin at 8/9. Due to some reasons, Kagome isn’t allowed to travel back in time for 3 years.A time skip occurs leaving these two characters at 18/19 and 11/12. In the first episode of Yashahime, it’s said to be 6 months after the end of Inuyasha. However 1 more month has to be added from information given in episode 15. That then leaves Kagome at 19/20, while Rin would be 12/13.Going back to episode 1, the main characters (Towa, Setsuna, Moroha) are said to be 14 years old [in the present]. Episode 15 states that the beginning of those events take place 18 years ago. From there, 18 years minus the girls age would give us a 4 year time skip (that is poorly addressed).Adding that to the last ages given, Kagome would be 23/24 and Rin would be 16/17 when the last events of episode 15 take place. in Feudal Japan.

It made such a massive impression on me that I totally forgot the name. Or it could be after watching only 6.5 episodes of it, I contracted dementia and alzheimer's because it was totally stupid, mind-numbing and utterly boring.  The plot walked out the door the minute the 1st season went into production. Same with the animation, character development, musical score and script. The only thing that didn't walk out the door was someone's pay check....Reruns of Futurama are better. Geez! Anyway, can someone explain why the centipede lady came back for an encore when she was supposedly killed in the 1st episode of InuYasha? Its absolutely annoying and just plain lazy when the author or whomever rehashes the same character and plot lines over and over again. Yeah, like I wanna see the same thing I saw 20 years ago. NOT!  Blah! Do you have any imagination or creativity left or are you just trying to pad your bank accounts with more money? There is a complete lack or originality here and it leaves you feeling empty that there could have been more done with this sequel than just mediocrity and caving to popular culture. This is why most sequels stink and fans leave bad reviews like this. The only sequel that was really worth watching was the remake of Battlestar Galactica. Fans want originality and substance in a story, which made InuYasha stand out among all the other anime at the time.I'll stick to Svengoolie on MeTV for entertainment, thank you.

I enjoyed it and it was fun to reminisce about the old show and see where those characters are now.I enjoyed it but it didn't give me anything outstanding.

The story drags and there's a lot of what feels formulaic filler. There are a lot of generic villain of the week plots that makes the series feel like indeed, an anime from the early 2000s like inuyasha, but with villains nowhere near as interesting. Moving on to the characters,  Moroha is fun but Setsuna is a killjoy most of the time, and Towa is sometimes a bit TOO dumb/naive. Now, moving on to the animation, it feels very cheap compared to any other current shonen anime airing these days but I feel like the...series in general really could have been improved if they cut it down to a single cour 12 episode season and focused the budget/cut down on the filler-y episodes. All in all though, the show does have it's moments but the pacing will understandably kill your enthusiasm to keep going. The ending was fairly decent and I was actually surprised at how it kept my interest when I was expecting more boredom/mediocrity. All this being said, it's OKAY.

Seeing a sequel series announced honestly came as surprise at first, but I guess not even anime is exempt from the trends of modern media. Soon we will be doomed to receive only sequels and remakes until the end of time.I think the story here relies too much on nostalgia baiting the audience. They know we want to see old characters and they'll dangle little bits here and there on a string to try and keep you...engaged, only to pull the rug out from under you. The story is sort of like poetry, they rhyme. That's a nice way of saying they've essentially gone The Force Awakens route and rehashed pretty much the exact same plot with different characters. It's lazy and unoriginal, but I hate to admit I got suckered into it anyway. I do have nostalgia for these characters and settings much as I hate to admit it, so I found myself enjoying the show despite its flaws.They had a part 2 planned from the start I think because the season ends on an episode that you really don't end a series like this on. I don't think it's spoilers to tell you that you don't kill off the tritagonist of your story before their arc is complete. That's a bad end route that you get an auto reload from, there's going to be some dragon balls or rinne rebirth shenanigans and everything will be fine.Still, even though I knew there was another season on the way I couldn't help but feel a bit blue balled by that ending. They were literally still wrapping things up into and after the end credits of the final episode and still they didn't resolve anything. The parts of the show that were the most fun was when it wasn't trying to do any major story thing and was just episodic adventures with the hanyou trio, it reminded me most of the original show.

In my heart, I knew it would never surpass Inuyasha so when I started watching Yashahime I didn't even try to hold it to the same standard as its predecessor. This series both surprised me and let me down and I will get to things more in-depth shortly.The story of Yashahime is great. When everything sidetracking or embellishing is removed I truly find the main story compelling and deep. It's touching and something I really cared about while watching the series each week....However, the story does stall a lot at first. While most episodes were captivating and interesting they also felt very repetitive at times. I kind of expected that from this sequel, given how Inuyasha as a series was, but it felt rather daunting at first. I wished the series would've opened with a little bit faster story pacing that wasn't so rinse and repeat. However, the ending of the series is what saved those episodes that seemed the same. The ramp-up to a finale was great and I was actually clutching my seat during some of these last episodes.Was this sequel a little cash grabby and hoping that our nostalgia would push it far? Yes, of course, but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment, for me at least. At times I wished the series would've kept the old series away more but at the same time, I liked seeing old characters too. This brings me to my biggest downside of Yashahime.The character arcs and developments felt a little off at places. Especially at the start Moroha was greatly done injustice. While I am 100% fine with the focus landing on Sesshomaru's daughters, I was expecting to have more to Moroha than just some easy laughs. I get it, they wanted another comedic character thrown in to get closer to Inuyasha's cast, but I found it kind of inappropriate. Even though she was later given more depth to her, I wish it would've been there from the start so we would've had more time to get attached to her.Some other characters had some weird pacing in their arcs and development too, but nothing as major as with Moroha. There were even some great characters who I found very interesting, such as Kirinmaru and Riku.Is Yashahime a masterpiece and something revolutionary? No, it certainly isn't, but it's still very enjoyable. The story, like I said, is great and the animation and sound design is amazing.

The weakest elements are the plot, in some places is quite bland and predictable. As far as Anime characterization goes I think is fair, shounen typically lacks strong characterization, and this series is no exception.If one is looking for a simple series, with admirable themes connected to family, loyalty, and the need for creativity and grit to overcome obstacles in life, and why both are important for survival it's available here.The action isn't particularly impressive sense of weight is particularly...lacking and there are tonnes of plot holes. I'd expect those particular about good plotting, and characterization not to enjoy this.If you have come from a weekend of watching Zankyou no Terror, Samurai Seven and Wolf's Rain back to back, then this is the kind of anime to bring back a little levity.Now as a series it's not as good as the original. If there was a 6.5 I think it would be a more accurate reflection of the series overall. 6 seems to low a rating, 7 seems too high. The original had better comedy and perhaps maybe due to length better characterization and plot.I think most value in this series lies with those who've watched Inuyasha. It's a good anime, and lends itself well to skimming with those short of time. In every episode there are skippable bits, and one still can follow the narrative.Note (spoiler warning):In some of the reviews; some expressed unhappiness on moral grounds that Sesshoumaru and Rin got married and had children. This indignation comes on the basis of age and her relationship with Sesshoumaru . However it's one of the better narrative choices in the series. Firstly in the context of Sesshomaru's characterization and interactions with humans if there was any chance a human would be his spouse and mother of his children it would be Rin. Human females also have a strong tendency towards hypergamy and few characters in the series match Sesshoumaru in status and power. Rin, a human girl who grew up raised by Janken and Sesshoumaru, facing danger from yokai and humans; and encouraged by Sesshoumaru to do as she pleases: what is the logical outcome of such sequences of events? Rin as well being characterized as being courageous, kind, and considering humans as more scary than demons...I'm pretty certain there is no moral injunction for sex and childbearing in the context of marriage and those who feel Rin was too young for marriage are just conflating their sensibilities with moral imperatives. So this as a basis of marking down the series is a terrible way of doing a review. lacking and there are tonnes of plot holes. I'd expect those particular about good plotting, and characterization not to enjoy this.If you have come from a weekend of watching Zankyou no Terror, Samurai Seven and Wolf's Rain back to back, then this is the kind of anime to bring back a little levity.Now as a series it's not as good as the original. If there was a 6.5 I think it would be a more accurate reflection of the series overall. 6 seems to low a rating, 7 seems too high. The original had better comedy and perhaps maybe due to length better characterization and plot.I think most value in this series lies with those who've watched Inuyasha. It's a good anime, and lends itself well to skimming with those short of time. In every episode there are skippable bits, and one still can follow the narrative.Note (spoiler warning):In some of the reviews; some expressed unhappiness on moral grounds that Sesshoumaru and Rin got married and had children. This indignation comes on the basis of age and her relationship with Sesshoumaru . However it's one of the better narrative choices in the series. Firstly in the context of Sesshomaru's characterization and interactions with humans if there was any chance a human would be his spouse and mother of his children it would be Rin. Human females also have a strong tendency towards hypergamy and few characters in the series match Sesshoumaru in status and power. Rin, a human girl who grew up raised by Janken and Sesshoumaru, facing danger from yokai and humans; and encouraged by Sesshoumaru to do as she pleases: what is the logical outcome of such sequences of events? Rin as well being characterized as being courageous, kind, and considering humans as more scary than demons...I'm pretty certain there is no moral injunction for sex and childbearing in the context of marriage and those who feel Rin was too young for marriage are just conflating their sensibilities with moral imperatives. So this as a basis of marking down the series is a terrible way of doing a review."", 'When I first heard about this anime, I was really ecstatic. Inuyasha is one of my favorite manga/anime so imagine how happy I was when I heard of Inuyasha and Sesshomaru having their own kids in a new anime series!Opening & Ending Themes + SongsEdited by: Blushing Geek, scenes from Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon c/o SunriseThe opening theme and the song fueled my already excited blood. The opening theme style reminds me so much of Inuyasha. The “bright” animation is just what I like considering this series is all about demons lol. This series is made by the same studio as Inuyasha, so I shouldn’t be...surprise by that, *wink.The first opening is giving me that “chill” vibe about this anime, which is really understandable since we are starting a new series. But the second opening is giving me an “action packed” vibe, which it definitely delivered, *wink.I also like how simple the ending themes are, and the songs fit perfectly. And speaking of songs, I absolutely love all 4 of them (2 each for opening & ending), they’re just perfect for this series!PlotEdited by: Blushing Geek, scenes from Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon c/o SunriseIt was really a great treat that this series started the first episode with Inuyasha and the gang. That part almost left me in tears, waaaah, I just miss them so much <3Sorry, I had to start it with that because I was just so happy seeing the gang in a new series. Don’t get me wrong, Yashahime is definitely not about them but with the next generation. There were some flashbacks about our old gangs once in a while which are really nostalgic to watch.After showing a bit of the old gangs, at the start, the pace starts a bit fast on how things are dealt with easily, then introduces the 3 heroines and the story develops on that. No complaints for me, since that’s pretty much what I like, *wink.I’ve read some reviews saying that the twins have more screen time than Moroha and they think it was unfair. But then again, before this series was aired, it was mentioned that it is about Sesshoumaru’s daughters’ story. Moroha is one of the main characters, but this is not her show. It’s just like with the Inuyasha series, there were 5 main characters, but it was Inuyasha (and Kagome’s) story.There’s some room for improvement, but I really like this start of the series so far. And before I forgot, I actually like the main bad guy in this show. It’s pretty much hard to hate him honestly. Let’s just see what will happen in the next season. I’ve got a feeling that it’s going to be really intense.And lastly, I don’t think you are required to watch the Inuyasha series before watching this one, because the story is pretty much understandable. (Although, as a fan, I wouldn’t recommend not to watch Inuyasha. It’s pretty long, but it’s worth it, *wink)CharactersEdited by: Blushing Geek, scenes from Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon c/o SunriseI absolutely love the design of the main characters. But I would be lying if I wasn’t expecting Sesshomaru and Rin’s twins to have adorable dog ears like Inuyasha since they are half-demons. But then again, with or without dog ears, they are still cute anyway, *wink.Moroha is a badass as Kagome but with a troublemaker streak like his father, hahaha. The three of them together are very enjoyable to watch since they all have their own sets of characteristics that I’m sure you will enjoy following.It was also nice seeing some of the characters from the Inuyasha series. I was right when I said that Kaede will live another more years with the way she’s going, wahahaha.ArtEdited by: Blushing Geek, scenes from Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon c/o SunriseThe art as well as the sound effects is pretty much the same with the Inuyasha series, and I definitely love that! However, the very first thing that really bothered me a little when I first saw the Inuyasha gang were their ears. It just looks different, quite bigger than before lol. But other than that, everything looks so good.Voice ActorsEdited by: Blushing Geek, scenes from Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon c/o SunriseI watched this one in an English dub, and it took me quite a while to really get used to it lol. The voice actors for the Inuyasha gang were different so it was a bit hard for me to feel the character at first. It’s a good thing that the voice actor for Inuyasha (which is one of my favorite english VA) is still the same, weew. But the VA for the main leads (half-demon princesses) were really good, I actually liked Towa’s. Of all the three, I think hers has the most fitting VA for her character.I also rewatched a few episodes (the one with most action scenes) in the original Japanese dub and it was great to know that the VA is still the same for the Inuyasha gang except for Miroku’s character.***As a big Inuyasha fan, I have to say that Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon is a fun watch.You may read a lot of hate about this series, but I suppose that’s pretty much normal with a new generation series. If you enjoy Inuyasha so much, then you should give this series a chance.On my end, I pretty much enjoy watching the 3 heroines on their adventure together. It makes me imagine Sesshoumaru and Inuyasha hanging out together, without killing each other, wahahaha. surprise by that, *wink.The first opening is giving me that “chill” vibe about this anime, which is really understandable since we are starting a new series.

A story between family and friends. I love how Towa is always there to protect her younger twin Setsuna. Moroha accompanying them to their quests or just having the same quest lol. cexciting cliffhangers to tease the audience for the upcoming episodes!  A bit confusing at first cause we dont have any idea where the og characters are but along the way we get to see what happenned during the time skip. i just wished they made Rin look a bit mature cause she still has the baby face...hehe but i guess her face doesnt age xD. Over all its a nnice stroy, cant wait to watch more! hehe but i guess her face doesnt age xD. Over all its a nnice stroy, cant wait to watch more!', ""Is this as good as or better than Inuyasha? God no.Is this sequel needed? Not really. noIs this sequel still fun to watch? Yes. It is. Especially all three girls are very likable.They will quickly grow on you though you may find Towa a little OP or Moroha just a comic relief character because there were many times I felt very frustrated with what they are doing to Moroha. Remember Towa is the MC and the other two are like 2nd MCs. Towa is givin most of the focus and many a times we don't feel like she earned her powers or any upgrades she...gets but if you bear through it and just enjoy her kicking ass then it'll be fun enough. Just don't question from where she is learning so much in so little time even though her more experienced twin sister and cousin are not as strong as her.The first half the season is a little slow but still fun. The supporting cast are fine but don't expect too much of the OG cast. Sesshomaru is the most seen character of the OG cast followed by Miroku, Kohaku and Kaede.Don't expect the OG cast to swoop in and save the day and don't get disappointed by seeing what happens to them after all the hurdles they faced and crossed.Overall it's a fun time. The 2nd half of the anime is the best part. Once the story starts to kick in and all the girls get proper attention you will really start to enjoy the show and see the girls as a team instead of just 3 awkward strangers traveling together because they need to slay a demon.The problem with the story is most of the time we feel like there is no proper goal that binds these 3 together like our Inutachi and that is true. These 3 are literally stumbling into the main plot. As long as you don't compare too much and just have fun for what the episode is you will like Yashahime. There is little romance towards the end but nothing like what is shown in Inuyasha, it's more like start of something new which we don't know what it properly is type.Don't expect the story to be as good as Inuyasha due to the lack of a common cause from the start and lack ofnumber of episodes to make all the characters grow the way Inuyasha anime did but in the end the Girls are worth watching and you can see they start to really care for one another and are finally opening up to one another as you grow nearer to the end.There is a story but you just gotta be a little patient. It did keep the suspense up on what happened to the OG cast and what in the world is happening.I am also really excited for Season 2. gets but if you bear through it and just enjoy her kicking ass then it'll be fun enough.

It’s one of those feel-good shows that never fails to make me smile or laugh. The use of comedy, the plot, fantastical elements, dynamic characters, and the soundtrack, allow it to be a timeless anime. I could’ve continued watching it forever but after the Final Act, I knew it had reached its end.Now, 11 years after the conclusion, we are blessed with Yashahime. The nostalgia, seeing the children of the original characters, hearing the new songs, I was here for all of it. There’s a lot of people hating on it and to be fair, their...arguments aren’t without merit but here’s the truth: Yashahime may not have delivered on all aspects, but it is an extremely enjoyable series.So, let’s get into it. There are some plot gaps and pacing issues that I can’t overlook. Some plot points could have benefitted from being condensed and others needed to be fleshed out more, especially regarding the characters’ backstories. I personally don’t have a problem with fillers or scenes dedicated to just comedic relief, but it would have been nice if we’d gotten a little more focus on the progression of the story. For that reason, I gave the story a 6.In terms of art and sound, I couldn’t be happier. The art style was very similar to Inuyasha: The Final Act and I loved the character designs. Some people took issue with the aging of characters but for the most part, I have no complaints. The OPs and EDs were amazing! I appreciated the use of music from the original series and was grateful for the extra dose of nostalgia.As for the characters, I was pleased with them. Sure, there are some traits that I could do without, but I think it’s their flaws that make them so lovable and ultimately will contribute to their growth. I loved seeing little habits or similarities they shared with their parents as well as their quirks. Now for my InuKag stans, I do wish Moroha’s character and story were given a little more thought but I’m happy with Towa and loved Setsuna’s personality and development. You won’t get to see all the OCs, but for the ones you do, it’ll be nice. The scenes featuring them build a lot of intrigue and do give insight into the past and what led to the present.I want to emphasize that this anime has the potential to be something great. Does it surpass its predecessor? Honestly, no. Is it satisfying and does it leave you wanting more? Absolutely! Thus, for now, I give Yashahime a 7.5. I immensely enjoyed the series and the characters so if you loved Inuyasha, you will as well! If nothing else, you won’t regret watching it, because I surely didn’t! With the confirmation of season 2, I am confident the best is yet to come and my love for this series will only grow. arguments aren’t without merit but here’s the truth: Yashahime may not have delivered on all aspects, but it is an extremely enjoyable series.So, let’s get into it.

I actually don\'t like Inuyasha that much and this one was more ""edible"" to watch and more fun. That\'s why it\'s not really a Inuyasha story, it\'s a different anime, a spin-off/sequel of sorts.(+) What was good: Empowered and strong women, every chapter had a different story but never deviated from its main plot. There are certain mysteries that have yet to be revealed and it gets a little better when you reach episode 13...or 14 aproximately.(-) What was bad: It had some logical incongruencies, anachronical dialogues sometimes, nothing serious but they should be a little more historically accurate. Sometimes confusing, because there are many secrets to be revealed later on. The first opening music was not the best, so they added a second opening in the middle that got a little better but the music it\'s not its forte.Addtional comment: People seem to hate Rin, poor woman. In the Feudal Era, women got pregnant around 16-18 so it was quite normal? I don\'t know, people should be aware of those things and be understanding and respectful before judging too soon. or 14 aproximately.(-) What was bad: It had some logical incongruencies, anachronical dialogues sometimes, nothing serious but they should be a little more historically accurate.

I do agree that the show does not have the most solid story but now 23 episodes in, i can say that it is picking up a lot. A lot of the fans questions are being answered. Another thing, for the people who are disgusted by Sesshomaru and Rins relationship, understand that although the story is fiction they are trying to make it as historically accurate as possible. Back then older men were marrying younger women, that was the norm. There was a lot of famine during that time and...becuz of that their life expectancy was very short.  Kagome and Inuyashas relationship is the same. Same goes for Koga and Ayame. becuz of that their life expectancy was very short.  Kagome and Inuyashas relationship is the same. Same goes for Koga and Ayame.', ""I liked the idea of this anime and I really want to like it but the execution of it just isn't all that great, I like the characters Towa, Moroha and Setsuna but the plot just didn't really do it for me, it didn't really seem to have much of any focus on where it was going and had me confused and a bunch of the episodes just seemed like filler and this isn't based any other source material, it started off well enough in the beginning but got kinda messy halfway through and the villains were kinda lame, this show was pretty highly anticipated...and to me it was really mediocre but I'm interested to see how it goes from here and to me it was really mediocre but I'm interested to see how it goes from here"", ""First things first, I'm a huge fan of Inuyasha and Inuyasha: The Final Act, and I've been eagerly awaiting a sequel. However, I have mixed feelings about it. I really enjoyed seeing how everyone from the original series has evolved over the past 10 years. It brought back a sense of nostalgia from my younger days when I watched the show on TV.Regarding the main characters, I appreciate the way they were developed, particularly Setsuna, who seemed like the central character. My only criticism is that they could have given Moroha more screen time. As far as I recall, she only had three episodes that...focused on her. It would have been more enjoyable to learn more about her character, as the way the show handled it felt somewhat superficial. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it in the end.The main issue with the series lies with Towa. I'm not sure what the author had in mind when creating her character, but it didn't seem well-executed. Her motivations and development felt shallow, and what's worse is how she becomes overpowered when necessary without any real character growth. Even in the original series, characters had hidden powers, but they had to discover and master them over time, leading to character development. Towa, on the other hand, seems to effortlessly master her powers as soon as she discovers them and defeats her enemies. For instance, when Towa received her new sword/flute in the second season, there was no prior indication that she knew how to play the flute. It felt too convenient for her to suddenly possess this skill.Towa's character remains stagnant throughout the series, from episode 1 to episode 48 (considering both seasons as one). She shows no significant character growth, unlike Setsuna and Moroha, who do develop over the course of the series. In summary, Towa comes across as an underdeveloped character, and if she were absent from the show, she wouldn't be missed. Of course, this would require some adjustments to ensure the storyline makes sense, but in the end, the show could have been just as enjoyable or even better with only Setsuna and Moroha. focused on her.

But i was waiting for more since is from Inuyasha's universe.They tried to do something different this time, with 3 protagonists. It's a cool idea, but.... Towa is so annoying. Moroha is cute and funny, Setsuna reminds us Sesshomaru, but Towa is just... nah. Her personality is cliche, you don't really feel connected with her.The anime isn't very nostalgic, except for some episodes with a flashback, and... I really don't understand how Sango still looks the same. Dunno, maybe some grey hairs wouldn't be so bad, you know?The anime miss with a lot of things, but some episodes...have great stories and monsters.Anyway, it's nice if you want to spend some time. have great stories and monsters.Anyway, it's nice if you want to spend some time.""]"
