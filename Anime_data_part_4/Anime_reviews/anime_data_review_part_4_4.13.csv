Reikenzan: Eichi e no Shikaku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33019/Reikenzan__Eichi_e_no_Shikaku,"[""This is much weaker than the first season and has a different feel.  I debated giving it less than 3 stars, but my enjoyment of the characters from the first season carried over and persuaded me to keep it at 3 stars.  However, there were several enjoyable characters from the first season that don't appear or have very minimal roles.  There are character relationship changes that are unexplained and a departure from Oriku's typical behavior.  Maybe the creators tried to rush things, but too much is unxplained.  The whole season feels more like a side story, rather than a continuation...of the first season.If you enjoyed the first season then this is worth a watch, but if you thought the first season was blah, then you'll hate this. of the first season.If you enjoyed the first season then this is worth a watch, but if you thought the first season was blah, then you'll hate this."", ""In short, the second season of Reikenzan seems to be vastly different than the first one. The first season was more like the protagonist's journey to become a powerful disciple, and on his journey we get to know more about the friends he make, see his training arc etc. It was more happy-go-lucky in tone. The second season however feels a lot more darker. We get to see the protagonist coming back to his village and facing some issues there, and while trying to solve them we see how our hero has to play a lot of mind games, and even some big real battles!...Heck, at one point we see a damn bloody battle that turns it into a horror show! Of course, the comedic tone is still present there, but it's much darker this time.Story:If we consider the story, it might fail to charm a big part of the viewers who enjoyed the first season, and that's understandable. The tone of the story shifted heavily, and that will cost dearly for some of the audience. I however enjoyed it. It is not anything spectacular, or might not be on par with the first season, still it felt enjoyable.Art:This might be another deal breaker for some, since the character designs changed a lot, sometimes to the point when some of the previously established characters felt unknown. The first season had the character designs in a, let's just say, pointy style. A lot of sharp angles were present as a facial feature, and it felt kind of unique. The second season's character designs are smooth, and instead of those pointy angles we see round edged broader faces. The same studio is behind both seasons, and the difference between the airing date of these two seasons is not even that much, just a year. Yet they feel so different. Still, they didn't look anything near being bad. The background environmental arts are beautiful!Sound:The BGMs are good, nothing special but doable. The opening and ending tracks are okay. The sound effects are, again, nothing special.Character:A very small part of the characters from the previous season returns this time, and the saddest thing is that the most fan favorite character Oubu has more like a cameo in this season. Ouriku, Rei and Bunhou were the main focus, along with two new and (almost) main characters (and I beg your pardon since I totally forgot their names, but you'll know the ones I'm talking about, nothing spoilery here). Ouriku-Rei-Bunhou's characters were already developed the previous season, so all we get to see is how they act this time. The only growth we see is that of Ouriku's. The two new characters that I mentioned were more to the comedic aspects of the story, and I enjoyed their onscreen presence. As for the others, they were merely there for the plot.Enjoyment:I will say it, I enjoyed it. The mind games that Ouriku play were interesting, and some of the actions he takes were pretty amazing if if they were brutal.Overall, even if I won't say it is as good as the first season, it still gets close to it. Different, but enjoyable. Looking forward to a third season if it ever comes out. Heck, at one point we see a damn bloody battle that turns it into a horror show!

I've never found a show where the protagonist wants to be a...May sound hypocritic coming from me (I watch 'ecchi' shows), this show is very special to me. It motivates (one of several emotions) me to move towards spirituality, which I've always been inclined to. The protagonist [Ouriku] reminds me of myself (although he isn't a degenerate). This show shows the realistic approach towards spirituality, especially the one we see in most eastern countries.It seem to me as another anime...with your typical protagonist who wants to achieve something & he is the great in whatever he does. This may be true, but...Why you should watch REIKENZAN (1+2 seasons) :- Ideal Protagonist (~closer to my ideal) (gave 10 because of MC).- Playful protagonist (plays tricks ; his conversations with other characters) :D- Adventure and Comedy- Concepts on getting strong/powerful- No sloppy dialogues- A bit of fan serviceCHARACTERS :- As a character, ORIKU's development was superior throughout the episodes. ORIKU is definitely a man one should aspire to be.  BUNHOU & REI who are supposedly the other (main/side) characters who are fun to watch & most comedy takes place among these characters. Other characters are good too. watch it, it won't disappoint. Even without OUBU, this is as same enjoyable as the first season.I'd rather not mention this, but someone uninterested in spirituality (less/no knowledge of spirituality ; can't tolerate topics like isolation and death) may not like this show, but I hope everyone give this show a try, cuz every show brings some emotion out of the audience.This show shouldn't be underestimated for its rating. I dare say this show deserves more than 8 rating on MAL. This show for me is a hidden gem. Well, that's my opinion. :D(10/10) for the protagonist.Thank You! with your typical protagonist who wants to achieve something & he is the great in whatever he does.

I mean, WTF? His ingenuity became idiocy? I'm gonna puke, he became something more of...a politician than a fighter. The story really became unnecessary confusing unlike the 1st Season.Still an interesting anime to watch but as I said before, this anime gives many terms that I need to watch a good subtitles. So many jargons from budism or whatever religion they took it from that they didn't even bother to give meaning to it. I simply just watched and did not understand a single thing.The girl or 200 year old woman and our Male Main Character on the thumbnail or even in the theme songs were portrayed in S1-S2 was that of a lover but aren't even developed to be like that or even close. I am quite astounded to so many turn of events even yaoi relationship was there (ending of S1) that I just laughed at, sigh, I thought that prince (whoever he is) just wants to break their relationship as a man and servant.Anyways, the plot of S1 was going smoothly like Naruto's Anime (best waifu was Rei-chan) because of some fanservice they did with her. The S2 really became a huge mess a made and made a huge jump and I can clearly say that the storyline was messed up and they don't even focused on what they really want to portray. I really liked the plot, story and its characters (the half-assed confession was too much for me, I dislike our MC kissing a babe just for fun and the prince RAN like he was FKIN REJECTED, LOL!?, YAOI REFERENCE AGAIN) but the animation really ruins it for me even though its interesting and confusing to watch. Not recommended for those who are gungho to the plot. S2 already finished the story (rushedly) and I hope S3 never comes... XDEven if I scored this Animation, I was really entertained and dejected.I remembered our MC talked to Rei-chan that he will do his best to be in her company in many years to come was quite awesome, I love that part. I was actually looking forward to some romance but hmmm, that didn't end well. My review is pretty much not aligned and I just rushed this.P.S. So many adulterated jokes and then adding more Yaoi that was so unnecessary. a politician than a fighter.

Paradox Live the Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51956/Paradox_Live_the_Animation,"['Paradox Live - let\'s set our hearts on fire with music, just don\'t take it literally!If you\'re even a little bit interested in Japanese hip-hop, you\'ve probably heard about such a great project as Paradox Live, aka Paralive, created jointly by Avex Pictures and GCREST recently, in 2019. The project is essentially a rap battle between members of different teams, voiced by 29 (so far) voice actors including Gakuto Kajiwara, Ayumu Murase, Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro Komado and Kousei Arima), Yusuke Kobayashi, and many others. The teams themselves, as well as their members, have their own characteristics, song styles, history, but the most important thing that...unites them is hip-hop.If you believe the mainstream version, hip-hop started in Japan in the early 1980s and was, like in other countries, ""freedom music"". If you look for a correlation between the anime industry and hip-hop, the first thing that comes to my mind is the series Afro-samurai Fuminori Kizaki by Takashi Okazaki, where at the expense of hip-hop style to the viewer more clearly shows the concept of anime.  Hip-hop in Paradox Live is the basis, it is around him all the musical teams and it is this musical genre is very fond of all the participants of this project.The announcement of the anime adaptation was at the end of the second live concert Dope Show Paradox Live, and later the whole cast of creators became known. The series was created by a small studio called PINE JAM and directed by Naoya Andou, who had previously worked on episodes of some anime and on the music video Hi-DRIVERS! 2022. Paradox Live at the time of writing this review was divided into two story phases, this show is just about the first phase, with the main characters being the members of the four teams.About the plot. Humans discover the metal ""phantom metal"", which in the not-too-distant future hip-hop artists start using to create charming illusions related to their emotions, for this they use accessories containing the very same ""phantom metal"", which has its own DNA. What is the toll of using illusions? Side effects, up to and including the death of the one using them - that\'s the price, quite impressive, but there\'s no way to stop the servants of their creativity. As I mentioned earlier, the anime depicts the first stage of Paradox Life. Several teams battle each other in battles after the mysterious return of CLUB PARADOX for a huge amount of money and the right to get a duet with the legendary vanished group. There are four hip-hop teams, and they are:— BAE, a trio who perform songs in three languages: Japanese, Korean, and English. In general, the anime seems to have no protagonists, as all the teams and members are equally important to the project, but the BAE members do get more screen time, especially Allen and Hajun. Ann stays on the sidelines as a good mate.— The Cat\'s Whiskers are a foursome whose line-up is more reminiscent of the title of a Russian TV series called Two Fathers and Two Sons. They differ from the other teams in that their hip-hop is combined with jazz, and their overall style is darker and nocturnal. In addition, all members work in the bar 4/7, where they mostly get together.— cozmez is a duo of marginalised brothers, Yatonokami Kanata and Nayuta, who, like BAE, get a lot of attention. Their songwriting style is cheeky, talking about the harshness of their life in the slums and their difficult childhood.— Akanyatsura is a five-piece team who call each other family, and are members of the Suiseki Clan, a yakuza group. Their music is more fun and lively, similar to street rap. These guys probably get the least amount of screen time than the others.Seeing in the genres ""music"" don\'t rush to please your musical soul, this anime touches on deeper themes, as it still has drama in its genres. Even though the anime is part of a music project, this show is still not about the music, but about the stories of the characters. Yes, you will see and hear performances, but prepare yourself - there are few of them, less than in other musical anime like Love Live or K-On! The anime does a great job of showing drama, but the creators devote an entire episode to revealing some characters, and a measly minute to revealing some other characters, so it doesn\'t feel like they\'re all equally important to the story. The characters have drama in their story, and hip-hop, as a free genre of music, helps them cope with it, and the ""phantom metal"" effect, thanks to its peculiarity, becomes a powerful weapon for viewers and listeners.Another advantage of Paradox Live: The Animation is 2D graphics, which turned out to be colourful, despite the fact that the show was created by a small studio. However, 3D during the performances leaves much to be desired, it would be better if it was not there at all. If it was not so noticeable during the performance of The Cat\'s Whiskers, it was obvious during the performance of Bad Boyz by Akanyatsura, which Pine Jam did not handle very well.Although there isn\'t as much music in this show as I would have liked, it was cool and varied. Paradox Live is strong with tracks, it\'s hard to argue with that. The opening intro ""Rise Up"", performed by all four bands, sounds great despite the different styles of the bands, all the members sound unified. The closing sequence, ""Every Day Every Night"" by Buraikan, shows the greatness of the legendary band from the first episode.Despite some shortcomings, the show is a great addition to Paradox Live that will delight fans and not only them, Taku Iwasaki has done his job well. Personally, being not the most ardent fan of the ""music"" genre in anime, after watching this project I liked it, even now, w hile typing this review, I have headphones in my ears with the BAE track playing. unites them is hip-hop.If you believe the mainstream version, hip-hop started in Japan in the early 1980s and was, like in other countries, ""freedom music"".

The rappers create illusions linked to their emotions using chemically reactive accessories that contain a metal called ""phantometal"" with their own DNA to inspire young people on a brilliant stage. However, behind the scenes, they suffer from ""traumatic illusions"" as a side effect, also known as TRAP.""But...If you don\'t have traumas, you cannot use this Phantom Metal, so only people who have them can use it.That\'s...why those side effects triggered by The Trap are precisely the traumas that the characters have.Phantom Metal is an accessory or tattoo that you must have with you every time you\'re on stage in order to create illusions on stage (according to your trauma and personality). However, using this metal can be like a kind of drug, because it charges you with enough energy on stage to put on a much better performance than usual.""Additionally, if you use Phantom Metal too much, you risk experiencing a side effect called erosion. The overuse of phantometal can lead to a condition known as metal erosion. Some symptoms include weakness and discoloration of the skin. One should stop using the phantometal at the first sign of symptoms or else risk the progression of the condition into acute metal erosion, which puts the person at a higher risk of dying.""Do you want to know a large part that covers the entire first season of the anime and almost all of the second season, which is impossible not to happen? Listen to their official drama tracks and read the Hidden Track.All I can say is that I cried when I listened to them.The story seamlessly complements the characters.  The backstories strengthen both the bonds between the members and the reasons they have to fight in this competition.Hip-Hop is taken seriously, as are the reasons why the characters have chosen to perform in this music genre. Hip-Hop is a way of life, in addition to being music.An important point to mention is that each group has its own Hip-Hop sound. One group might lay it all on the line with heart-wrenching lyrics about their past, while another will most likely infuse a beautiful jazz sound into the instrumental for exquisite verses. But what would you say if you were to listen to a track that resonates everywhere, announcing the resurgence of a group from the ashes? Musical evolution is indeed present among these groups.The soundtracks are on par with the music, meaning they are perfect to be a part of every scene in the locations where everything takes place.Search for the bands songs in the full version and you will see how brilliant the lyrics are and how well they fit the themes of the rap battles.The music created by the groups: Cozmez, TWC (formerly Quadra-X), Akyr, TWC, Buraikan, and in the future season, Goku Luck, 1NM8, Visty, and Amprule, along with the story, creates exactly the magic that the Phantom Metals perform on stage.I cried for Cozmez\'s lyrics.

However, Paradox Live the Animation completely blew my expectations out of the water with its first episode.Set in a cyberpunk future, rappers use accessories that can create almost magical illusionary phantoms linked to their emotions to enhance their performances. Unfortunately these “Phantom Metals” have the nasty side effect of subjecting the user to intense versions of their past traumas possibly destroying them psychologically.The show follows hip-hop unit BAE made up of music lover Allen, rich...boy Hajun and Anne in all of their non-binary finery on their journey to win 10 billion yen in prize money after accepting an invitation to participate in Paradox Live Battle along with three other groups. The three of them have a great dynamic and they’re really fun to follow. I wish the show just followed these three (that’s foreshadowing). Of course, there is a bigger conspiracy happening in the background concerning the Phantom Metals and the mysterious circumstances around club PARADOX which gives the show a darker tone than your usual male idol anime.Studio PINE JAM has been on a roll with its anime output over the past couple of years and Paradox Live the Animation is no exception. With its colourful neon cyberpunk colour pallet that blends well with the CGI and its incredibly good art, animation and scene direction, Paradox Live is gorgeous to look at. Its first episode also has some genuinely good music numbers that go as hard as the animation.  Overall, the first episode is phenomenal.Unfortunately, where its first episode was akin to firing a rocket, episode two feels like the rocket starts to lose momentum, episode three has the rocket fall back to earth and crash and episode four is damage control. The show throws away almost everything unique it’s established for mundane nonsense you see in your average male/female idol anime.Get ready for an episode centred around the philosophical debate over whether or not you need to be poor to rap well or episode three’s story about the hyperactive member of one of the other rap units looking after a cat complete with “Oh no! The cat is sick, but it’s night time and it’s raining outside!” and then the kid runs outside in the rain to the vet but he trips over his feet, gets wet from laying in the street and feels sad… and at the end of the episode, they do a shoehorned in music number because the issue has been solved thanks to the power of friendship.This is disappointing because there is presumably a lot of set-up happening whilst these events are being pushed to the forefront, but I honestly couldn’t concentrate because I was left so bored. It doesn’t help that the rest of the groups who are also tagged as “main characters” are nowhere near as likeable or as interesting as the members of BAE.Still, that first episode was genuinely a blast and if the show hadn’t failed the 3-4 episode test I give every new anime I watch I’d probably still be watching. If you’re someone who can sit through mediocre storytelling to get to the good bits then Paradox Live the Animation might deliver later on. You can even slam open my door, crawl up next to my bed whilst I’m sleeping, shake me awake and shout “Wake up and turn the TV on i-like-this, Paradox Live got good after episode four!” and I’d probably believe you.

The three of them have a great dynamic and they’re really fun to follow. I wish the show just followed these three (that’s foreshadowing). Of course, there is a bigger conspiracy happening in the background concerning the Phantom Metals and the mysterious circumstances around club PARADOX which gives the show a darker tone than your usual male idol anime.Studio PINE JAM has been on a roll with its anime output over the past couple of years and Paradox Live the Animation is no exception. With its colourful neon cyberpunk colour pallet that blends well with the CGI and its incredibly good art, animation and scene direction, Paradox Live is gorgeous to look at.

Just some context: Paradox Live is a mixed media franchise by avex where teams battle it out for #1 spot. The anime obscurs/ignores? the fact that people paid money to buy merch, discs, etc. to earn PTS necessary...to vote for their favorite unit. So, cozmez heads paid for the twins to win and the story in the voice drama reflects that (no doubt of their skill and talent).Paradox Live The Animation. Even as a standalone product it has severe issues with the structure, setting, storytelling, pacing and consistentcy. Ep. 1 isn\'t represantative of what\'s to come, I don\'t know what was the intent of hyping up the audience for ""hip-hop battles"" when the same battles are held off-screen, the voting process/winning conditions are unclear and what you\'re given, at best, are 3DMV solo group performances. Where\'s thrill in that? Is it that fun to rap into the void as you proceed to the next fixed match? I mean, they did make the audience at Razzle Dazzle during bae\'s ""Fly High"" portrayed as faceless NPCs. A weird own goal if they wanted to promote bae, but whatever.The setting is definetely not hard sci-fi, it\'s like that in the source material, too. We\'re introduced to phantometal, a dangerous technology developed by Alter Trigger that creates holograms via a reaction with DNA that reflects the user\'s mental state, projecting the inverted trauma(cope?) to the audience with the price for that being a mental breakdown called the trap reaction forcing you to relive the traumatic event in a vivid bad trip. But when you think, couldn\'t the same visual effect be replicated via an existing industry solution? We have companies like BASE Hologram, Musion 3D whose tech allow for VFX in real time with live actors on stage. Improved ""pepper\'s ghost"" technique used in Magical Mirai Vocaloid stage concerts comes to mind, too. There are also VR/ AR alternatives, so, yeah, phantometal isn\'t as futuristic or innovative as the writers think. Actually, it was quite corny how the anime portrayed phantometal illusion, sh*t looked painfully unimpressive, to sum it up. I\'ve seen Japanese netizens compare Pararai 3DMV\'s to the fan creations in MMD that go overboard with flashy effects and wild camera angles. So, it stays as a half-baked half-magical plot device to explore personal trauma.Pararai anime failed as a character driven anime, too. Avex/PINE JAM might think that bae\'s collective mommy and daddy issues are the hottest piece of writing in the franchise, but having that shoved down one\'s throat with the entire episodes of extra anime filler while other characters were robbed of their screentime was insufferable. If I were an anime only I wouldn\'t be able to find any appeal in cozmez who are too butchered to be even a parody of the real cozmez. AKYR and TCW predictably play second fiddle to bae. The anime\'s bae bias evolves from favoritism to borderline psychotic devotion. How else could you explain stealing parts of Kanata\'s character development from the drama track and giving it to Allen with minor alterations? The whole selling point of cozmez duo is the co-dependance between the twin brothers Nayuta and Kanata Yatonokami, that they are each other\'s raison d\'être Kanata had to create an illusion of Nayuta to continue living, that no one but Nayuta would be able to save him and stop him from quitting the music world altogether.OOC portrayals. Real Kanata beats up thugs with a steel pipe and tells Allen to go .... himself on a better day(anime prod. team: not family friendly, gotta censor that). Anime ""Kanata"" is a loser who gets beat up by random thugs and pushed down by Allen in some soft BL ship fodder sequence as a tsundere heroine who will later be saved by his amazing being-able-to-summon-a-phoenix shonen MC powers(anime prod. team: simply perfect!). The whole trainwreck that were Ep.9-Ep.12 where they maliciously gave cozmez an \'undeserved autowin\' (they only won because the darling bae didn\'t show up, okay?). And bae didn\'t show up because... they care about their nakama more than some dumb competition!!! See, they are clearly better people! Why aren\'t you stanning them yet? Quick reality check: canon Hajun would practically enslave Allen for so much as letting him borrow his notebook, he\'s sadistic and black hearted to the core. What\'s with the shonefication? Anime bae are plain disgusting gary stus who don\'t act like real bae either.The ending... Apparently, PL was a ploy by a bargain bin Hojo to use phantometal to launch his own Human Instrumentality Project with Kanata being the core for the new Holy Grail dripping with Fate/Stay Night trademarked mud plus sentient tentacles. Then they rapped (their sins away) at a T-posing #goneberserk Kanata who was mindbroken by fake Buraikan. Oh and Nayuta was fake, btw. But who cares?

If you are interested in the music itself (some of them were actually great), you might as well watch the past music videos from Paradox Live official YouTube channel - no need to waste time on this anime.With high-quality character design and music already in place, the anime should have injected soul into the characters by telling great backstories - which arguably is the hardest part, of course. This show clearly fell short, trying to juggle the large number of characters (>10!) only led to flat storytelling that are difficult to empathize with. Despite a stunning ep.1, production...quality fell quickly. Even the live performance weren't satisfactory - sometimes the visuals and music didn't match at all.Setting aside the promotional value, the anime itself is quite disappointing. quality fell quickly.

These groups aim to be the number one group to win 10 billion yen worth of money and challenge the legendary rap unit Buraikan. Each contestant has a metallic accessory called “phantometal”, which can create illusions when it reacts to the user’s DNA.

The rest of the cast only have a single trait that differentiate themselves from another, such as Ryu being the “quirky maniac”. They have to rely on their character design to appeal audiences due to their lack of depth. This limitation affects the story as well, as some aspects of the plot is left unexplained, such as the villain’s backstory and motive. He ultimately becomes the villain of the week in the anime and served no purpose other than a plot device. Despite the limited time, the anime underutilizes their episodes. Instead of expanding their main story, the writers decided to create sub-plots or filler stories that doesn’t progress the story such as episode 9. Thus, the story becomes less engaging and confusing.The animation is the least concerning aspect of the anime.

Paradox Live is one of the good looking CGI in anime that I’ve watched so far. The use of lighting and colors enhances the stage performances.

Even then, the performances are enjoyable.Unfortunately, I have to say that for a music anime, the music is the worst aspect of Paradox Live. Although people have different preferences, music isn’t fully subjective. Like art, music can either be poorly or well-crafted through passion or technical skill. All the tracks in the anime lack diversity in lyricism, as the casts rap about their shallow “swag” or them being number one on repeat. Furthermore, the choice for cozmez to have anything but an old school sound is hypocritical, as they believe hip-hop is a source to tell personal stories and social issues. BAE and even the legendary Buraikan are the worst offenders of the series. BAE has nothing to offer. The series have showcased dark, tropical, and even jazz-influenced rap. However, BAE’s musical instrumentality has the same quality as a copyright-free music that you can find on Youtube. Buraikan on the other hand… SINGS on a RAP track.In conclusion, for an anime about hip-hop, Paradox Live is a parodification of hip-hop with some pop music sneaking in from time to time. With the addition of the subpar characterization and story, the anime becomes unberable to watch, that even the animation is unable to redeem its flaws. If only Anne rapped the “I’m fresh, I’m tight” part for episode 1, I would’ve gaslight myself and give this anime extra +6 points.

I'm Shellious and I'm out."", 'This anime focuses on hip-hop and is based on the drama cd series from ep1-9. People who are voting lower than a 5 and haven\'t even finished the anime are people who were never into the music genre or seiyuus so I don\'t know why these people even bother reviewing. It\'s like going into a fast food restaurant ordering something and then give a low review because they gained weight. I\'ve watched the anime from ep1-12 so I will give a fair review based on what\'s to be expected in music genre anime even though I am a fan of the drama cd series. Expect...this review to mention the drama cd series a lot of the time.Story/Direction/Baity synopsis: Story-wise, ep1-8 follow quite faithfully to the drama cd though there are missing dialogues and development. Anything beyond 9 are completely new and diverted completely away from the drama cd. If you\'re anime only, you wouldn\'t spot anything wrong but for drama cd fans, you will notice the change of direction. The synopsis pretty much baited you all in thinking there will be epic street style rap battles between the groups- you won\'t see that in the anime. A complete miss in direction if you ask me; it\'s bad enough we don\'t see the rap battles in the drama cds (The drama cd always start off with what\'s going on before the supposed rap battle begin or after) the anime could have let us see both teams perform one after another but nope. It didn\'t do that. You are just told who won and who lost and take it as it is. You want to know what songs are used to battle one another? Go listen to the songs used in the drama cds because this anime expect most of the audience to be drama cd fans. Gotta thank them for confusing the anime only fans. Way to go.Music: If you\'re watching Paradox Live: The Animation completely blind to the drama cd series, all songs will sound new to you because like I said you don\'t know what\'s there in the very first place. However, for fans of the drama cd going into the anime, you will be disappointed because only two units have new songs. As a music anime, it\'s often expected to have one song or two per episode but this anime fail to deliver that. You expect more freestyle rap? You only get that in 3 eps out of 12 (one of them was re-used twice). If you\'re anime only and you like the songs from the first four units, good for you. If you\'re a drama cds fan, lower your expectations because if you\'re a TCW or AKYR fan you are shafted out of anything because apparently this anime is about the poster child of Paradox Live. IAnimation: If you have seen the trailer, you will notice the use of CGI for the singing performance. The CGI used for BAE and TCW\'s performance is a 10/10 in my opinion. The CGI in cozmez and AKYR\'s performance however dropped slightly in quality in my most honest opinion. The CGI is pleasing to look at for the most part.Enjoyment: If you\'re going into this anime without checking out the drama cds first, you will vote this a 7 or higher because the characters are all designed handsomely and pleasing at best. Who wouldn\'t want to see their idols from a drama cd animated? But if you\'re like me and you went into the anime starting from the drama cd series, you will will not vote this higher than a 7 because ""Paradox Live: The Animation"" shouldn\'t even bother having that name- they might as well call the anime ""BAE"" because of the blatant favortism of screen time for the poster child of the franchise; don\'t expect to see much of the other units because they\'re just stepping stones for BAE.Is this anime overall for BAE fans enjoyment only? - To the drama cd fans: if you can overlook character assassination, sure the enjoyment is there because it is something new and assassination of the character you knew from the drama cd is something new. To anime only BAE fans, sure you will enjoy itPersonal overall: I looked forward to the anime but the anime is a disappointment to me personally. I\'m aware it can\'t be 1:1 to the drama cd but the least they could do is give us something worth mentioning the anime instead of ""Here\'s a poster child, let me shove them to your face so you can\'t see the other units"". If you\'re anime only, do you even know Satsuki has a crush for Anne and thinks Anne is a girl? Did you know Iori and Yohei are close friends? Did you know Saimon and Yohei both love the same woman? You won\'t know that because you\'re anime only. I\'m especially disappointed in the lack of new songs. Visual Prison gave us lots of songs, Marginal#4 gave us existing song AND new songs specifically for the anime. If I have to describe this, I feel that after ep9, I feel like watching the 3rd season of Starmyu; it feels unnecessary and hard to feel hyped up for.What did I like about the anime: I know I complained a lot but there are things I liked in the anime too. The vibes between the characters are still there; you actually get to see the parents of some of the characters; being able to see what the phantoms look like when they perform; the freestyle rap (Non battle of course) is enjoyable, the new songs are good songs.The drama cd series gave us 2nd sets of units already, will you come back to watch S2 if it happens? - Even though I am voting an overall 6 and I have a lot of complaint, I still want want to hope for S2 as long as they stop shoving the poster child to our face. this review to mention the drama cd series a lot of the time.Story/Direction/Baity synopsis: Story-wise, ep1-8 follow quite faithfully to the drama cd though there are missing dialogues and development.

Before the anime, Paradox Live\'s story was told through drama CDs, music videos, and people\'s votes. I got to check out the drama CDs thanks to the anime and from what I could tell the anime tries to adapt the story told in the drama CDs while adding its own spin.And for the most part, it\'s done well.First off, I loved the concept. I loved the idea of performers using a special metal to help them sing...their hearts out to prove something in exchange for being afflicted by the demons of their pasts before dying a painful death by becoming one with that same metal. It had the potential for character drama and storylines. While it might seem ridiculous that these people are risking their lives for what seemed like a glorified special effect, I\'m game with the absurdity of it and it still made some sense thematically. This could be a more direct or literal representation on how these characters are putting their entire being on the line for what they believed in. After all, they used the metal to literally project their emotions into their songs.Next was the execution which was mostly okay. Each episode was engaging and able to build off each other. I enjoyed the performances that were presented as well as the characters who sang them. These characters were likeable, memorable, and very good singers. My favorite groups were cozmez and BAE, and I enjoyed their stories in the anime and the drama CDs.Sometimes, the anime gave me Idolish7 vibes where the characters and their drama were the focal point over the music. For the most part, it worked. I loved watching these characters bantered, and the slice-of-life moments can be so funny. The anime was at times clever with the way it rearranged or rewrote some of the key moments in the project. The drama was also well-executed as conversations between characters ended up becoming highlights for me. I also liked how certain episodes foreshadow or went full circle with certain mysteries and plot twists. Some examples I had in mind were how Episode 10 intentionally paralleled Episode 1 or how Nayuta was consistently portrayed as an enigma throughout the series which led to the reveal being pretty well done. Also, in context with Nayuta, I loved how his plot twist recontextualized a conversation he had with Kanata on Episode 5. During that scene, Nayuta told Kanata to expand his world. When Kanata asked why Nayuta\'s not including himself in the picture, Nayuta simply said, ""You know why"" which could be referring to how Kanata already knew the truth (that Nayuta\'s long gone*) but was repressing it. It\'s really cool.That said, there were some nitpicks that I had with the show.First of, it\'s the pacing. Like I said before, Paradox Live the Animation sometimes gave me Idolish7 vibes where the character drama is the focal point over the music. While the show was able to do well for the most part, its pacing at times suffered as a result. The reason why Idolish7 was able to get away with prioritizing its characters over the music was because it had enough story content to justify it and it does provide music when it\'s extremely necessary. Paradox Live only had 12 episodes where the primary backdrop was a competition between four groups. While the anime still covers the same results as the project, its lack of time didn\'t allow it to reveal all of the performances on screen. As a result, we\'ll be told who\'s the winner in one round but not know exactly why or what songs were used unless we backtracked with the mixed media project\'s music collection. Another thing some people might be mixed about is how the show seemed a bit more BAE-centric. For context, the project technically didn’t have a central protagonist as every group was given ample screentime. However, in the show, BAE—from their vibes, to the number of songs they got to perform, to their role (specifically Allen’s) in the overall plot seems to be given a bigger protagonist role. Personally, I didn’t mind this change but this will affect the season finale.That\'s said, it\'s not terribly paced and the show\'s still enjoyable. But, it did lead to my biggest nitpick: the last three episodes.To be clear, those episodes were good. I was very entertained and I understood why the show chose this particular direction.So, those last three episodes (Episodes 10-12) were the show\'s original spin to a plotline that\'s vaguely addressed in the drama CDs--Alter Trigger, Buraikan, and their involvement with Paradox Live. This plotline was also connected to Kanata\'s character arc where he finally remembered Nayuta\'s death* and how he created an illusion of Nayuta to cope all this time. For context, the drama CDs never revealed how Kanata remembered so having the anime adapt that ""blank period"" was interesting. And in-between all that, the show initially introduced the possibility of BAE and cozmez having one more showdown before the final battle.That\'s a neat concept that’s mostly well-executed…but then here were some problems I had with it.The first was the extra battle that never happened! In episode 10, BAE and cozmez were getting ready for this match. However, after a bad conversation with his dad, Allen had an emotional crisis where he lost sight of his music. The result? He ran away on the night he’s supposed to perform. Since Anne and Hajun were running after him, cozmez won by default. This rubbed me off the wrong way. In the mixed media project, cozmez originally won because they received the most votes which meant that for the most part—they won through merit. Having them win by default not only undermines cozmez’s abilities but also Allen’s character. Outside the fact that this moment contradicts Allen’s actions later on in the drama CD, Allen’s the type of person who would perform no matter what. He wouldn’t leave someone hanging, and he would definitely try to keep his promise to Kanata that he’ll face him head on. In the anime’s defense, maybe they chose this route because it’s easier to explain. Cozmez only performed one song throughout the entire series while BAE had more opportunities so it’s probably a lot easier to justify at the time. So yeah, that episode was a mixed bag.Then there’s episode 11, which was a lot better than episode 10 but slightly suffered from some pacing issues. The episode changes perspectives between BAE and everyone else in the Paradox Live arena so the transitions felt jarring at times. But like I said, there’s a lot to like from this episode. Buraikan’s presence was strange and eerie, the moment Kanata’s memories were revealed painful and traumatizing, and BAE’s bonding was pretty solid. Then, there’s that cliff hanger with Kanata’s screaming—awesome.Now, there’s episode 12 and it may or may not be for everyone. So basically, Kanata (who’s mind was broken at this point) was forced to become this phantom metal vessel that will make everyone “one with the metal.” The goal of the scientist (who’s been a reoccurring antagonistic figure in the show) was to have that happen so that everyone will no longer suffer under the collective subconscious. This aspect was not fully addressed or explained. There were no debates on why it’s good or bad to be one with the metal, and the scientist wasn’t written well enough to be a character study for that matter. Then again, I would cut the show some slack for not fully delving into this. The drama CDs never really explored Alter Trigger either, and technically the story’s slightly low-stakes by design as no one really died by the phantom metal.Overall, I liked the concept of the episode. It turned on my inner angst, and it’s a good reason to bring everyone together. Also, Kanata’s dilemma reminded me of what happened in the finale of Magic Kyun Renaissance where Kohana was reduced to a sleep-like state due to the magic arts right down to the magic vines that consume the area. What’s even cooler for me was how similar to the finale of Magic Kyun, the characters were able to rescue Kanata by singing and reaching his psyche. That said, this is where some parts may cause some mixed feelings.To start, the scenes when the characters try to save Kanata might make some viewers cringe. It didn’t make me cringe completely, but I did chuckle when everyone suddenly started circling around Kanata like we’re in a ritual. Also, there were times when I felt like the antagonist was a waste of space. All he did was laugh evilly. He didn’t even have an interesting backstory to explain his 10-year experiment. Buraikan’s fate was also a bit confusing if you also watched the drama CDs. In the anime, it’s revealed that one of the Buraikan members passed away, but the drama CDs set after it (the Road to Legend Arc) showed that both members were alive (unless I missed something). So, if a season two were to exist I wondered how they’ll address that.Some might find BAE—specially Allen’s role of the hero to be a bit annoying but I think it’s not a bad choice as Allen and Kanata established their chemistry early on. It’s when Allen started talking to Kanata that made me a bit mixed. For context, in the drama CD, Allen and Kanata had an important discussion where the former’s trying to convince the latter to not give up on his music. Kanata wanted to quit after finding out Nayuta’s death since he felt everything he’s been doing until this point lost its meaning and that he can’t accept a win that’s not truly made by cozmez—but his own “delusion”. It was a very engaging conversation in the drama CD and while bits of it was implemented in the finale, I think it would’ve been better if Kanata’s fully conscious to hear it and actually engage with, but that’s more of a personal preference. One final nitpick I had with the episode was how the ending rushed the reveal that Nayuta’s alive all along. The drama CD was able to build up that plot twist, but the show seemed to just slot it in right in the end to make way for Allen playing hero—which is important to note that in the drama CD he’s not the only reason why Kanata got better emotionally.So yeah, Paradox Live the Animation is awesome for the most part. It may have some pacing issues, it’s still very entertaining. I would highly suggest to also listen to the drama CDs and let’s have our fingers crossed for a season two. their hearts out to prove something in exchange for being afflicted by the demons of their pasts before dying a painful death by becoming one with that same metal. It had the potential for character drama and storylines. While it might seem ridiculous that these people are risking their lives for what seemed like a glorified special effect, I\'m game with the absurdity of it and it still made some sense thematically. This could be a more direct or literal representation on how these characters are putting their entire being on the line for what they believed in. After all, they used the metal to literally project their emotions into their songs.Next was the execution which was mostly okay. Each episode was engaging and able to build off each other. I enjoyed the performances that were presented as well as the characters who sang them. These characters were likeable, memorable, and very good singers. My favorite groups were cozmez and BAE, and I enjoyed their stories in the anime and the drama CDs.Sometimes, the anime gave me Idolish7 vibes where the characters and their drama were the focal point over the music. For the most part, it worked. I loved watching these characters bantered, and the slice-of-life moments can be so funny. The anime was at times clever with the way it rearranged or rewrote some of the key moments in the project. The drama was also well-executed as conversations between characters ended up becoming highlights for me. I also liked how certain episodes foreshadow or went full circle with certain mysteries and plot twists. Some examples I had in mind were how Episode 10 intentionally paralleled Episode 1 or how Nayuta was consistently portrayed as an enigma throughout the series which led to the reveal being pretty well done.

We will see that in these episodes.Adapting Voice Drama series from Opening Show to LIVE even if only to references, Paradox Live is a Hip Hop...franchise that started at the end of 2019 and that, although it does not reach levels of status like Idolish 7 or HypMic, at least the fandom of ParaLive has managed to keep it afloat not only in Japan but also to international fans. As someone from the ParaLive fandom, the dream of an anime and adapting the 8 Voice Drama albums was a dream come true...in the end, the feeling that the anime could have been better is something I feel within me.Starting with the animation by the PineJam studio, of which many were afraid of how they would adapt the presentations and it was felt that it would be the use of CGI like the rest of animes with music and ParaLive was no exception. It cannot be said that the animation is horrible both in general and for the presentations, but it\'s not to be praised either because it is not perfect, at least it is stable for a good part.It would take too long to comment on how faithful the adaptation of the original material is because it was not, on the scale of 1 to 10 in fidelity, I give it a 7 because the writer of the anime is the same writer of the Voice Drama (Original material ) only he will know why he decided to make those changes, but I don\'t forgive him for omitting the most important voice drama: LIVE, why? because it is the closing of the events of the tournament and at the same time it is the preamble to a new phase, closing some cycles such as What happened to Kanata now that he knows that Nayuta was an illusion? or questions that the anime did not answer with Nayuta because yes, that Nayuta that we saw in the finale is the real one but they didn\'t adapt how he survived which in Voice Drama LIVE answers that; It also shows the importance that Buriakan will have in the new phase, which would have been the best to prepare for a possible 2nd season.BUT not everything is a failure in the adaptation, since despite the omissions, I can applaud the writer\'s ideas in introducing new things: Seeing the 4 groups outside of their vs and living together in situations that one has wanted to imagine being the young people of TCW and AKYR are seen the most despite the little screen that those 2 groups have had in the anime (By the way, it\'s nice to see the BAE at the university and it\'s a shame I didn\'t see more of Club Candy); Another detail that I loved in the anime news was the development of Allen in episodes 10 and 11, something that Voice past dramas we never saw at least something to develop him with his parents being the only one from BAE due to that and they nailed his agony that his damn father did to him causing Allen to close down and decide to run away from what he defended so much and I understand the fans who complained about that but look at it this way, just as we saw a different side in Hajun because of his drama, something would happen to Allen similar since even the brightest sun tends to burn.Although the Vs of the groups were not fully seen, which hurt me, ParaLive is not just music but something else that is its lore, a lore that could have been treated better in the anime but at least it is made clear that at sometimes, the path to victory comes with setbacks and sacrifices, something we saw with Hajun who did not care about his health due to erosion as long as he worked hard for his team to win. Also the importance of ties that are not only of blood like AKYR who came together through a tragedy or TCW which is a family that is also called ""Like a home for lost cats"" or even BAE who are united by the same denominator What is it like to have horrible parents? Cozmez teaches us that no matter how shit life treats you, as long as you have someone you love by your side, it is the best thing to live for.In the end, regardless of whether they are rich or poor, handsome or ugly... all the characters carry a trauma that they must relive when the Trap Reation arrives, but it is a price that only the Phantom Rappers are willing to pay for being part of that world of illusions and Hip Hop. The only thing they must do is face their trauma, to avoid a mental breakdown and avoid erosion if they do not want to die like Hajun almost did.This adaptation ended up being something average, it is neither mediocre nor horrible, but it is not a marvel either, so from my point of view it is in the middle (Neither so good nor so bad). In the end it wasn\'t perfect, but it could have been better.It\'s worth it? It depends on how you feel, if you want some Japanese hip hop with different genres (Because each group has Hip Hop but they specialize in different genres for greater added value: BAE with Electro Pop, TCW with Jazz-Blues, Cozmez with Trap and AKYR with afrobeat) but that also has a lore that attracts, it may be for you. Just don\'t judge him at first, because it\'s the worst thing you can do.I would recommend that once the anime is finished, continue with the Voices Dramas to complement what they omitted in the adaptation and you can find them on Spotify or YouTube, the songs can also be found on Spotify.I just hope that for a possible 2nd season, the writer corrects the flaws... and the PineJam studio improves the animation. franchise that started at the end of 2019 and that, although it does not reach levels of status like Idolish 7 or HypMic, at least the fandom of ParaLive has managed to keep it afloat not only in Japan but also to international fans.

No Guns Life,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39539/No_Guns_Life,"[""No Guns Life shines brighter than most of its surrounding competition thanks to its central themes of corruption and dehumanization, strengthened by it’s gritty noir style. But the execution casts a strong shadow on the whole show, loaded with mediocrity.It has a good foundation to improve from though. Most of the first season is dedicated to world-building and does so with modestly good results. But it often felt like it went all over the place and never really resolved many of the plot threads that it had built up. The characters especially took a bullet due to this. Most of them were blander than stale...bread because of how severely lacking their development is as of now.Our main protagonist Inui Juuzou is an Over-Extended and former gun slave unit that was used during a war. His backstory from that time is only mentioned briefly, teasing you to keep watching and find out more later. Other characters fall into this as well, which is quite frustrating since besides their backstories they have almost nothing going for them. They are at least not painfully generic like many of the villains turn out to be, who basically scream in your face about how evil they are. Though they only become a hurdle when the story needs them to be.What ended up making me stay throughout its entire runtime was the same reason I picked this show up in the first place, it’s aesthetic. The bleak and gritty dystopian future the show throws you into is very refreshing. It’s heavily noir inspired which is something one rarely sees these days but I would gladly see more of. Aesthetics aside, the visuals are alright for the most part. There's a heavy use of CGI but it blends in with it's 2D counterpart enough to not become too distracting. Character movement was solid most of the time and they were very consistently on model throughout. The action scenes were the visual highlight and were pretty fast-paced and enjoyable. The CGI is also implemented well here and at times used to the show's advantage.The noir style was amplified thanks to the smooth jazz soundtrack that really helped give the show it’s own identity. I can't say it did a lot for me emotionally, but was overall pretty decent for what it was. I feel pretty much the same way about the voice acting which was also decent and fitting to the characters personality. Not any outstanding performances but they did their job well and made the characters feel more real, aside from some of the villains that just sounded ridiculous.But overall I can't say I'm satisfied at all when the characters and story haven't been properly fleshed out. I think the most harmful problem was the lack of story and character progression which makes it hard to recommend. If it’s style is not enough to make up for it then I can see many finding this quite dull.

Then, after winning the case, he could slap Ted Cruz in the face, and claim he has really bad aim with his high-fives.NGL is a dynamic anime where the main character, Juzo Inui, kills various villains on his quest toward determining who turned him into an ‘extended’ (cyborg designed for war).  The dark, murky atmosphere is a nice lure to pull in...the viewer; however, when Juzo begins to act silly (i.e. the embarrassed faces he makes when he sees a half-naked girl), it becomes irksome.  Juzo’s characterization, thus far, is rather superficial, and if it weren’t for his gun prosthetic, it would be difficult to distinguish him from other action-centric heroes.  He’s the classic ‘badass hero’ who is designed to look cool, and defeat numerous baddies.NGL also draws a clear line of demarcation between the good-guys and the members of the evil corporation (Berühren Corporation).  Making the story a black-and-white affair, that will, most likely follow a predictable build up to the final ‘boss fight.’  The visuals are respectable — given that it’s Madhouse — nevertheless, there is nothing stunning or memorable.  The OST, along with the anime itself, is uninspired, and easily forgettable.All in all: NGL features humdrum action, insipid characters, and weird tonal shifts that are anything but funny.  If you were looking for a show that captured the same excitement as ‘Black Lagoon,’ then keep searching, because it ain’t NGL. the viewer; however, when Juzo begins to act silly (i.e. the embarrassed faces he makes when he sees a half-naked girl), it becomes irksome.

A man with unrivaled pride in his work. From the cyberpunk world where cyborgs exists, this man is a private detective and resolves to rid of it of corruption. He is Juzo Inui, a gun head who is here to help the helpless.Mangaka Tasku Karasuma is not fairly well known to most audiences although some of his work incorporates the usage of futuristic worlds and science fiction. No Guns Life is no exception as we are introduced to a cyberpunk setting. Humans are now...cyborgs and are called “Extended”. Crime is rampant and on the loose in the city. With such technology, you can just imagine how chaotic society has become. Juzo is an Extended problem solver who relies on his mental and physical skills to deal with other Extended. From the very beginning, the audience should pay full attention to Juzo’s character behavior. Despite being an Extended, he has the personality of a private detective and always seeks to complete his tasks for the right price. With the motto of “wipe your own ass”, Juzo prefers to work alone and isn’t afraid to take big risks. From a personal perspective, Juzo is not just the poster boy of No Guns Life but also a symbol. He is a symbol for people to take their own responsibility for their actions.Now I won’t deny No Guns Life is somewhat of a niche anime. Even as a paranormal detective show, the anime leans more into sci-fi and action. The story flows with each episode introducing ongoing problems in a city and corruption. We also meet characters who Juzo associates with including Mary Steinberg and Tetsuro Arahbaki. These two collaborates together with Juzo although they also have their own personal goals. (for instance, Mary hopes to reunite with her brother) Nonetheless, Juzo acts as more of an anti-hero throughout the series. Even though he performs heroic deeds, he’s also a mercenary who takes cases for money. For the right price, Juzo does his job regardless how difficult it may be. But on some occasions, he also helps the Extended in need with his own conviction. In essence, he helps the helpless and comes across as a fairly reasonable man. Some associates occasionally assists him in his tasks although the main course of his job is undertaken by the gunhead himself. Speaking of which, how likeable are the other characters? The bottom line is that Juzo overshadows them but they do possesses unique roles in the show. Mary works as a mechanic and is important to his well-being. Tetsuro has an ability to control other Extended’s bodies making an invaluable asset. Even Olivier Vandeberme, a law enforcer, provides freedom for Juzo so he can work without disturbance. The fact is, these characters are important to the core of the show and without them, Juzo would have a harder time to achieve his goals.But an important question remains. What is your goal for watching No Guns Life? What are you hoping to get out of this science fiction story taking place in this deluded cyberpunk world? It’s ambiguous question because No Guns Life is an unconventional show with its own identity. Sometimes, you have to wonder what the author wanted you to experience. Juzo, the gun head reminds us how the potentials of Extended and their limitations. I mean, isn’t it funny how he can’t actually fire the augmented gun on his head without assistance? In fact, many Extended in the series carries some sort of burden in the aftermath of the great war. A major social issue relating to poverty also exists as some Extended resorts of violence to survive. On the other hand, we have mega corporations such as Behruen, standing as a symbol of power and bureaucracy. It reminds of the old classic 1987 Robocop where futuristic technological inventions are treated differently than others. Crime remains a major issue in the story as Juzo deals with corruption. He finds out the hard way after facing off against rogue cyborg Gondry, the very first Extended. Standing out as a powerful individual but also victimized by the result of the war, Gondry is a poster boy of experimentation. An arc dealing with him is one of the climatic clashes exploring the ethnics of technology. And to be honest, I think it’s one of the highlights in this season. Meanwhile, No Guns Life also gains support for eliciting emotional appeal to the audience. Characters such as Olivier has their own motivations and in one of the later episodes, we find out her purpose in the story. If you made it this far, then I can say it’s safe that you’ll be staying the rest of the way.Serving as a celebration of Madhouse’s creative works, No Guns Life has distinctive elements in its artwork. The dark and noir-style backgrounds inspire a cyberpunk look for the main setting.  Most noticeably, the backgrounds are animated with the Unreal Engine to make them as polished as they can be. By rendering the visuals and fuse them with the character models, it makes both parts stand out sharply. It’s not too often we get to see a game engine being used for an animated series so perhaps this opens doors more to future projects of similar nature. The Extended are also decorative with unique augmentations and modifications to the body, so much that you’ll see them more than regular humans. Characters that stand out the most includes Juzo, Gondry, and perhaps Olivier. Their character expressions sell a variety of human behavior ranging from comical, emotional, and diabolical. And if you’re in for some light comedy, there’s that too. Character interactions sometimes goofs around with their cartoony expressions. Then, there are also light jokes thrown around that pokes fun at technological themes with dry humor. We can’t also ignore how often Juzo needs help to fire his own gun, can we?No Guns Life is a unique piece of work with its own identity.

It says here: “SF hard boiled the gun smoke drifts muzzle talks” (just like that, without commas). To quote someone who knows the source well, it’s surprisingly accurate: Protagonist ""Resolver"" Inui Juzou, is a rogue private detective part of the ""Gun Slave Unit"" assigned to eradicate Extendeds, who\'s always smoking cigarettes, is smoking hot, smokes with gun smoke, because he is an (Over-Extended) cyborg made of revolvers, his head for a gun (revolver), and being the the spirit of the noire revolver embodied: bitter, badass, with a dark history, seeking to break away from the hands that try to subdue him, actually a weapon. And due in part of Juzou being half-human and half-weapon/tool, he always tries not to force a bad hand in situations that call for it in the best possible way he could, and his motto is to ""wipe your own ass"" i.e. clear your own shit the way you know how.And in this post-apocalyptic world, the seemingly formed relationships are barely legal depending on which side of the case it leans on: the ""righteous"" side of Juzou and his workhorse people, or the retro-futuristic cyberpunk setting, which in turn is also a proper one – with an evil cybernetic corporation, a brutal police force tasked with keeping the modified Extendeds in check, with questions of transhumanism and alienation, along with the punk part – bodies being spliced and spruced up in backdoor-alleyway undercity clinics, body horror and brain hacking. So the world in No Guns Life literally has not both start and end lines, but rather, everything is a process in and of its end onto itself. To sweeten the deal, the anime\'s background of a war does best to interlink both sides, where due to the war happened before the world ever came into a consensus, humans and mech Extendeds are like owners and tools before all rules and regulation broke down.In essence, it\'s the interesting characters that both make or break the series in accordance with the many issues at hand, and here\'s where Juzou\'s life gets more exacerbated from Tetsuro Arahabaki, the son of the CEO of the evil Berühren Corporation, who is heavily wanted for experimentation for a device that is heavily implanted within him that could control and take over Extendeds in range to amass their reach beyond areas of influence. Add in Tetsuro\'s annoying and bratty behaviour, along with company associate-cum-mechanic Mary Steinburg and the EMS agency which regulates Extended and Over-Extended beings like Juzou and keeping them under check that they don\'t flout the law, all this becomes one massive problem that Juzou just couldn\'t afford to shrug under the rug.To commend this show on the storytelling and the over-arching plot, it is pretty much a perfect 100% 1-to-1 adaptation of the manga into the anime, which says a lot about fans not wanting to lose out on anything even remotely minor, and No Guns Life definitely benefitted from series composer Yukie Sugawara taking no liberties and adapting the manga\'s entirety to good use. And sure, the story will not win any awards with some of its cheeziness, but for pretty much creating hidden crannies and hooks that\'ll intrigue us to dive even deeper, I\'d say that it has done its job well. Not great mind you, but not bad for a valiant effort.And who to bring that classic 90\'s stylized feels and visuals other than Madhouse, I truly love it when such works like this call back the old aesthetics that give seasoned studios to stretch on their legs for visuals that have been long gone in time past. The modern world, made old with the entire cyberpunk. scrapyard setting really gives it a feel for some of the older classics that we\'ve come to know and love (i.e. Trigun, made by the same studio). Coupled with the great animation, I\'d say that Madhouse has done a good job in replicating the entire world to its core. Factor in the great music with the background music and especially the OST, which was a complete surprise that the entire ED is done in Unreal Engine 4 by Cyclone Graphics to aid that gamer-futuristic look. That\'s superb and unheard of by any standards, with the cool jazzy OP and ED that made up the experience overall.This show\'s truly boring you say, and I\'d agree to an extent, but take a deep dive under the rabbit hole and you\'ll see that No Guns Life truly is a fascinating show with as many of its layers waiting to be delved into a story that is initially hard to pick up but even harder to drop.  Can\'t wait for the 2nd half to drop in Spring 2020, and if you need a binge, do pick this up before the 2nd half commences if your interest hasn\'t waned yet. a 2nd cour (or more appropriately the 2nd half) to go!Always been wondering about the editorial remarks on No Guns Life\'s cover?

Yes, no guns should ever be brought to life.Spoiler warning but I'll just give you one small one, it's not good. Don't bother watching this series because it is downright awful. I know for a fact that at face value this show seems 'cool' and 'radical' with the main character having a head of a revolver and the world taking place in the future. I know this because that was my initial thoughts when going into this show, honestly, the show was fine until everything changed when that Tetsurou annoyance entered the scene. Right away that kid alone just place this show...in the negative zone, he is literally the embodiment of kid Naruto and that's not a nice thing to see. This is literally his format for his character for scenarios, Juno is busy with an issue, the boy's a busybody and has to 'help', in turn of 'helping' Juno he fucks up and gets beaten up, Juno saves him and the boy just apologies, then the cycle continues. This is utter trash writing from the people behind this series, even if is a copy from the books, they do not even try to make scenes or plot interesting.I am going to be straight, the reasons why I didn't give this series a 1 because I love the concept and I like Mary and Juno, that's all. The music sucks, the art sucks (especially coming from you Madhouse), plot uninteresting and unfocused, just the show is a complete mess. Like if they just focus the whole plot on Mary and Juno alone, I bet it would come for a much enjoyable series, 'Mary and Juno's Bizarre Adventures'. That I would dig. It is so obvious the studio is placing this series out for the sake of filling the anime seasons slots, I know for a fact that Madhouse is not using the full production team due to them also working on Chihayafuru 3. Either this shows the saturation of anime titles the NHK demands to studios or that Madhouse just got lazy and they decided to just shit out series without any dazzle on them. This doesn't come off super disappointing as I can clearly see the show's flaws at the near beginning, so it really shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that this series is bad. I do want to call out the ambitious aim the show was trying to go for, like the issue with robots living aside humans and the struggle to maintain peace after a long war. However I just think the studio didn't actually understand the sheer size of what they were aiming, there were tons of technological gaps in the show, not very innovative ideas despite the place being in the future, social system is like messy and politics are just obsolete. I am going to stop here, but if you watch it through yourself you would be able to intake this pile of under-produced crap.-SCORES-Characters- 4/10: Fuck the kid and almost everyone else, Juno and Mary are the only acceptable ones.Art- 3/10: Boobies are big but the physics is so bad that every oppai seems dead to me. In majority of the scenes, especially when the characters turn or look somewhere else, it looks as if the turning animation was made on Windows XP. Face are fucked, environment's boring and the whole show is just trying to mimic shit. Only thing to praise them for is the use of Unreal Engine 4. It's true though, some of the visuals are pretty 'unreal' to believe in.Writing- 2/10: Ooooweee did this part had a blast, since there is so much bad shit to ramble about I'll just say one good thing. Which is errrrrrrrr... Nevermind I can't think of anything. The show is bad at choosing whether this scene should be serious or that scene should be funny and whatnot.Sound- 5/10: For the most part is fine, everything does it's job but not super well nor super bad. Everything is alright except the god awful outro, like seriously what is with that outro. It feels as if the singers just muttering a script with the beat off some Eurovision song.Overall, trash. Plus there is a second season coming up, what a joke. I guess the only way Madhouse and the writers can prove themselves is by delivering their utmost best in the next one. But to comeback from a ditch as deep as this would take a miracle.Strong 2 to a light 3 in the negative zone, he is literally the embodiment of kid Naruto and that's not a nice thing to see.

This is utter trash writing from the people behind this series, even if is a copy from the books, they do not even try to make scenes or plot interesting.I am going to be straight, the reasons why I didn't give this series a 1 because I love the concept and I like Mary and Juno, that's all. The music sucks, the art sucks (especially coming from you Madhouse), plot uninteresting and unfocused, just the show is a complete mess. Like if they just focus the whole plot on Mary and Juno alone, I bet it would come for a much enjoyable series, 'Mary and Juno's Bizarre Adventures'. That I would dig. It is so obvious the studio is placing this series out for the sake of filling the anime seasons slots, I know for a fact that Madhouse is not using the full production team due to them also working on Chihayafuru 3. Either this shows the saturation of anime titles the NHK demands to studios or that Madhouse just got lazy and they decided to just shit out series without any dazzle on them. This doesn't come off super disappointing as I can clearly see the show's flaws at the near beginning, so it really shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that this series is bad. I do want to call out the ambitious aim the show was trying to go for, like the issue with robots living aside humans and the struggle to maintain peace after a long war. However I just think the studio didn't actually understand the sheer size of what they were aiming, there were tons of technological gaps in the show, not very innovative ideas despite the place being in the future, social system is like messy and politics are just obsolete. I am going to stop here, but if you watch it through yourself you would be able to intake this pile of under-produced crap.-SCORES-Characters- 4/10: Fuck the kid and almost everyone else, Juno and Mary are the only acceptable ones.Art- 3/10: Boobies are big but the physics is so bad that every oppai seems dead to me. In majority of the scenes, especially when the characters turn or look somewhere else, it looks as if the turning animation was made on Windows XP. Face are fucked, environment's boring and the whole show is just trying to mimic shit. Only thing to praise them for is the use of Unreal Engine 4. It's true though, some of the visuals are pretty 'unreal' to believe in.Writing- 2/10: Ooooweee did this part had a blast, since there is so much bad shit to ramble about I'll just say one good thing. Which is errrrrrrrr... Nevermind I can't think of anything. The show is bad at choosing whether this scene should be serious or that scene should be funny and whatnot.Sound- 5/10: For the most part is fine, everything does it's job but not super well nor super bad. Everything is alright except the god awful outro, like seriously what is with that outro. It feels as if the singers just muttering a script with the beat off some Eurovision song.Overall, trash. Plus there is a second season coming up, what a joke. I guess the only way Madhouse and the writers can prove themselves is by delivering their utmost best in the next one. But to comeback from a ditch as deep as this would take a miracle.Strong 2 to a light 3"", 'No Guns Life is the anime adaptation for the original Manga by Karasuma Tasuku and brings us a mix of Cyberpunk, Mystery, Crime and a protagonist with a gun for a head. I\'ve heard from a few people they felt the anime was ridiculous because of the superficial look of the main character, but I decided to let this show have an impact on me as I watch it.The most stellar feature of the show is that the world-building creates a setting that draws you into the story. You wonder what kind of wacky combinations of humanoid robots they can come up with and how...the narrative and the story elements weave into one another. I can already tell you that the first 5 episodes were definitely not enough to understand what the hell is going on in this world. You encounter a lot of terms which only make sense in the realm of this fictional world like Extenders. Also, you want to learn about the significance of the boy and why everyone is trying to abduct him for themselves.We have our main protagonist Jûzo that\'s a capable ""Extender"", a race of people that looks like they fused with machines. Jûzo has a gun for a head, but so far in the show, it is only cosmetics and he doesn\'t use it as a weapon. That doesn\'t make him less of a badass though. He speaks in such a cool demeanour and is also a rather cynical dude. He also does have a rather infantile side where he blushes for seeing something raunchy and behaves overall unfitting to the mood the scenery is trying to build up.There is a scene later where he gets a ""hair cut"" and has his eyes covered as enemy forces rush in to interrogate and threaten him. He doesn\'t lose his cool.The enemy designs are quite special, for example we have a mechanical spider robot or other kinds of machinations which give our characters a hard time. I really hope for some kind of Orwellian Dystopia to take place in this world mixed with a bit of critique of future technology.The Visuals are really nice and create an image of a modern city with some kind of scrapyard feel to it. The colours are vibrant but don\'t penetrate your eyes, generally, there is a lot of silver, grey, brown and metallic in the scenery. This creates a salvageable image of this machine city.I have to this point seen the first 5 episodes that released and I\'m eager to follow this show. A Season 2 is already on the Horizon and I picked up the manga so I can learn more about this intriguing show and its lore. the narrative and the story elements weave into one another.

It\'s not a show that I normally would watch and had I not been introduced to it by a friend one night, probably never would have seen it.I\'m not normally a person who watches hard broiled detective series or movies, however I am a sucker for a good story and when I go into evaluating any anime/manga/LN I prioritise the story and world building. No Guns Life excels in that department and even if you aren\'t a person who normally likes this genre, you\'ll most likely enjoy the show because of the...world, characters and mystery.The gist of the story is that humans were genetically modified in order to fight as soldiers in a war, now that the war is over, those ""extended"" or modified humans are struggling to readjust to society amidst discrimination, mental and physical health issues, etc. The protagonist Juuzo, who is quite literally a smoking gun, is basically a PI who takes on cases from the biggest players in town, until he bites off more than he can chew by taking on a case involving the city\'s biggest corporation who will stop at nothing to keep their secrets in-house. Juuzo\'s latest case sets off a chain of events that could lead to the very unravelling of society.The mystery, character development, action scenes, etc are all well done and given it\'s madhouse, this really shouldn\'t come as a surprise. It\'s a seinen story and it feels seinen. The topics explored, the reoccurring motifs and character interactions feel mature and I appreciate that. The first season left a few things to be desired with pacing towards the end, but overall I was more than satisfied with this series and it will certainly be one of the hidden gems of 2019.Overall, No Guns Life is certainly worth a watch if you enjoy Cyberpunk, Sci-Fi thrillers, Mysteries, detective dramas, etc. world, characters and mystery.The gist of the story is that humans were genetically modified in order to fight as soldiers in a war, now that the war is over, those ""extended"" or modified humans are struggling to readjust to society amidst discrimination, mental and physical health issues, etc. The protagonist Juuzo, who is quite literally a smoking gun, is basically a PI who takes on cases from the biggest players in town, until he bites off more than he can chew by taking on a case involving the city\'s biggest corporation who will stop at nothing to keep their secrets in-house.

The manga started in 2014 and is still ongoing. The anime version came from Madhouse. Let\'s just hope it came from their division that works on quality projects instead of their one that makes complete tripe.Story:Inui Juuzou is an Extended. Which is basically the term this series uses for cyborgs. He has a gun for a head and is able to function in normal society solely through cooperating with the authorities and he makes a living by taking on jobs involving other cyborgs. The anime basically covers a series of these jobs and Juuzou\'s struggles with...the large, world ruling corporation Berühren.There are some pretty significant flaws. First off, we find out that Juuzou can\'t fire the gun on his own head because the trigger is in the back of his head... in a spot you could reach with a normal range of motion.... with no indication that he\'s hampered in that regard. And you can\'t say that someone needs special authorization, because we see it fired once in this series and it\'s by a kid. The ending is also pretty shit. Usually when you have a series like this, they\'ll try to make the ending satisfying even though they\'re going for a sequel by answering some big question, showing a major antagonist brought down or otherwise wrapping up some ongoing plot thread. In this one, they decided to give you a really boring case and leaving everything important to be wrapped up later.This also suffers from the same problem as a lot of 90s comics where they feel the need to constantly and quickly introduce the next thing so you can get into the action and the few moments where they take a break and could, potentially, work on character development end up being kind of rushed set ups for the next bit of action.About the best I can say for the series is that there are a few moments that are kind of interesting and none of its faults are so egregious that they absolutely ruin it or get obnoxious.Characters:Hard bitten detective, naive kid with a mysterious power, girl in a supporting role who jokes around with the hero. It sounds clichéd because it is. The series also has one of those trans women characters who looks really masculine and acts flirtatious with men in a way that makes them uncomfortable. Because that\'s such a great trope.I also have to talk about the evil corporation. In something with strong writing that has an evil corporation, you\'ll see humanity from the people who work there and the company\'s evil actions will have some kind of profit-based motive behind them. In this one, there\'s an effort to do that but they just go too far with the evil deeds. We see them use children for cyborg experiments. We also see them decide to sacrifice a bunch of innocent civilians for very flimsy reasons. Which basically makes them Republic Serial villains without the sense of fun.Art:This is another aspect I\'m going to compare to bad 90s comics. A lot of the cyborg character designs, including gun head, look to be going for the ""extreme"" aesthetic rather than looking good. The non-cyborgs tend to have some bizarre characteristic that just makes them look weird like Olivier\'s lips or Cronen\'s eyebrows. The action sequences are pretty good. They flow fairly well. The backgrounds are detailed. Maybe a bit too drab but detailed.Sound:The acting is well done. Suwabe Junichi, Numakura Manami & Ymashita Daiki all deliver their lines well. About the worst performances you get are from Ebara Masashi & Ueda Youji. Ebara because the series has that typical, exaggerated, overly masculine trans character and that character always sounds awful. Ueda\'s performance is meant to sound like a slimy corporate man but he just comes across as hammy.Kawai Kenji\'s music is fine. It\'s not the best I\'ve heard from him by any means but it\'s basically functional.Ho-yay:There\'s really none to be found.Areas of Improvement:If Juuzou has limited range of motion and actually can\'t reach the back of his own head, illustrate that instead of just having the characters act like it\'s impossible to reach back there. It\'s awkward, but it\'s well within a normal person\'s range of motion.Don\'t make your corporation so cartoonishly evil.Better pacing with more time to develop your characters and their relationship dynamics would do wonders.Final Thoughts:This anime is a lot like a mediocre 90s comic, maybe a bit worse. With an extreme aesthetic, under-developed characters & pacing that wants to rush anything character-based because they\'re worried that any atmosphere or character building will bore the audience.

The writing and execution is alright, but there's that sense that it has potential for a lot more, and it's a bit of a shame.

It's hard to describe, but I managed to stay engaged and interested the whole way through.

The story becomes deeper, darker and more multifaceted and despite what others have said, the show isn't based on some pro or against gun philosophy, it has nothing to do with guns really.The real moral battle of the show is between humans, war, technology, and what it truly means to be human.We get a wide cast of interesting characters each with their own backstory, though most are not yet explored in depth, i can tell...you from the passing this is on track for a second season.Art and sound are great. The world is a fantastic, if common, future dystonia brought about by a global war and struggling with the deeper integration between man and technology.

I tried this show dubbed first, looking for an easy background watch, and that was a mistake. The voice actors perform well, but the English translations were all 80's Hollywood action movie clichés and no substance. If that were my sole metric, I'd give the show a 3/10.Switching to the subs and re-watching the initial episodes made things much more palatable, hence the bump in my score, but even so the characters are boring stereotypes and flat. I couldn't get invested in them whatsoever.As for other redeeming qualities, the animation isn't stellar but it is good, and the...atmosphere feels perfect. The setting is appropriately grim and pops of color in the right places.The best thing I can say about this show is that it feels really average. That isn't always a bad thing (and I like some generic contrived shows) but in this case it just didn't do enough to rope me in.If you give this a shot, do yourself a favor and skip the dubs entirely.

You are promised a hard boiled detective series, but then fails to have the detective do any sloothing. No villains are uncovered, they are all happy to explicitly state that they are evil. The mysteries, if you could even call them that, basically solve themselves with the answer just falling into the lap of the b-plot character for that episode so they can show...up to the main plot and actually do something for exactly one scene before taking the background to sauceless action sequences.The aesthetic is interesting on a surface level with next to nothing lying behind it. Dudes just have fucked up bodies that look evil if they are evil or cool if they are good. There's no consistency or themes.If I vaguely state stuff that happens in the story it almost sounds interesting.

And he has a revolver for a head. Not a bad setting, if I got anything to say about it at all.However, it went off with too many themes after that. And spoiler alert, those are basically: victims of some overshadowing corporates, a ghost of old war, people trying hard to live but place the...wrong bet and such. Well, they are not bad if it tries to be episodic. Yet, the plot keeps getting pushed forward with all kind of introduction.But even with all that introduction, there\'s nothing to see in character development. Soiler alert again: the kid stays the same thoughout 12 episodes, and he didn\'t even get to do shits to develop anything with though. The gun head got something dark going on, but it only knocks on the series a little bit, before going away again.Talking about ""a little bit before going away"", that\'s pretty much how it goes with whatever happened in this series. Corporate\'s hunting escapee ends right in first act, after a fight and a busted pair of ""tool""s, war crime related soldiers start talking about what the sacrifice for a war they paid but then got shot a little and both went silent, of course, no one say shits about it anymore, some old accquaintance got introduced as though it\'s going to continue (which I think it will) but never shows shit for the rest of the season. The only thing doesn\'t seem to go away was a little something from episode 12, which is the last one so yeah, it\'s not like just indication means much at this point.Talking about episode 12. What the hell? Why did it revert to episodic after a grim reminder of the past? Another request, another little girl needed to be saved. And really, it\'s kind of cheap plot to say a partner of the father deceive the daughter to gain something her father left behind but then shows his true color right after being revealed. And it\'s the plot for the freaking last episode. Well, if the series was all episodic, that kind of episode is acceptable. But it wasn\'t. We were like, walking on some grand cruiser half way, but had to sit on a 2-men boat to get to the shore for the last 100 miles/km/which ever unit of length goes. It breaks the chain of event, and doesn\'t even mean much.I understand that the series is continuing, so these might just be like a long series got cut off into different season. But come on, while so many series work as though they are going to end after 12 episodes, when they get 24 back to back, this one doesn\'t solve a thing left in the season. Everything got cut off as some dark force is manipulating it.In conclusion, the series tries hard to look cool, hard boiled and smart, but it doesn\'t sold a thing and leaves lots and lots of stuff related to main plot unsolved. While nothing you can\'t enjoy if you shut your brain down, it\'s definitely not something to be called good, let alone score high at all. wrong bet and such.

Potential on its own can't justify  show short coming , its is important to keep  big picture in mind.On surface it can be seen and watched as action packed,  noir show about Dude with gun on his head, beating up bad guys  and being overall awesome and cool. If someone sees this show like that, its fine cause thats what show is about.However it can also be seen as gruesome depiction of late-state capitalism where everything and everyone is a product. Extension...don't exist to help people, but are used as schemes  to get people dependent on medicine, maintenance  and constant improvements. People are tools meant to be exploited for wealth.It also can be seen as show about Post war soldier.  Juzo being born to be nothing more than killing tool for military which created him and see how he struggles to find purpose in civilian life as well as battle against this idea that he just a tool meant to be used.What makes these themes even more appealing is that , show combines them well with its light hearted moments and action scenes that it doesn't come out as surface level preaching and virtue signaling.At what layer  you decide to watch the show  is upto to the viewer, although understanding that there is more to the show when just some action scenes, would let one enjoy the show to another level.Although there are things which nag me.1. Characters over all well designed , their appearance is distinctive  and  fit well into over all art style of the show. However, it might be age thing, turning 22 that surface level fan service  rubs me the wrong way.  Fact that out of 5 female characters, 2 are ninja nuns who were undersized triangle bra and stocking as their uniform, Olivier having massive and over exposed rack and even Scarlet being given standard large anime breasts.  Was bit off putting. If show has to flash half naked women in first 10 minutes of show, it gives you certain expectation about then show.2.Story in S1 isn't really that good. S1 seemed a lot more of an introduction to the world of No Guns Life, so there where a lot of few episode long arcs which didn't really go another, mainly served as character introduction and  world building. However there is second season coming out in 2020, so depending on how good it is , viewing experience of overall show might be a lot different from just first season.Those 2 nit picks aside show is pretty flawless. Art design and great, action scenes are directed well. Whenever juzo fights , you can feel the raw power and metalic hardness behind his blows.all of this is support what I'd day pretty amazing  osts,  Opening has become one of my favorites.When you get depressed anime fan to watch Opening for majority of episodes, thats job well done in my book.TL;DR  great looking show, with potential of exploring some interesting themes.

Sound is alright, but some of the OST is downright cheesy. Characters are fine, just kind of uninventive and done a million times.This show does not bring a lot to the table. It takes old, proven, and tested plot points, aesthetic, and storyline and jams them into one story. Old detective with a deep past. Random companion that follows main character. Mysterious boy with powers that is escaping a facility. Corruption of conglomerates vs the main character. Steampunk.And well, what do you expect?...It becomes basic. Nothing stands out. The gimmick with the gun becomes old when you realize that the MC is as bland as it gets. I swear to god, the dialogue of the MC is just...so predictable. I mean, Mary is the only character that\'s got more than five dialogue options for each conversation. The boy has an extremely idealistic goal and tries to achieve it throughout the show. Never heard of that before.Nothing seems to make a lot of sense behind any of the characters\' actions either. They just establish extremely normal personalities and have them do actions according to what\'s really convenient for the plot.And to top it off? Apparently, no killing is allowed or something. What is this, PG? The gore is literally nonexistant. Fights just are ""fights."" No one fights to kills, like not even the enemy, apparently. I get that overly gory shows are terrible, but can a show basically all about fighting be relevant when no one is trying to kill each other. It\'s not a shounen. Why are people fighting like it is?Let\'s talk about the execution of the story now. It\'s also bad. The show clearly wants the motif about ""failed experimented children struggle,"" to be prevalent throughout the show. Or how about, ""corrupted people are evil."" But it really doesn\'t feel that way. It doesn\'t draw empathy. The show kind of just puts it there, and leaves it. It shows, doesn\'t tell. There\'s no backstory. It\'s painfully linear and not explored. I\'m getting flashbacks to the ""tragic backstory of every demon ever"" in Kimetsu no Yaiba.Oh yeah, the plot doesn\'t make any sense, either. The ""evil corrupt corporation"" that is chasing down the protagonists just employ the most ineffective strategies to beat the main character. They even know where he is. They just, send in men one by one I guess. Alright?Look, the show isn\'t terrible. It\'s just not original. You can watch it. It\'s not bad. But if you actually want to see something different and well thought out, definitely don\'t watch. It becomes basic. Nothing stands out.

He finds himself having to protect a boy named Tetsuro Arahabaki who was forced into illegal experimentation where he has a device called ""Harmony"" stored in his throat that allows him to take over the bodies of other Extended.As No Guns Life is confirmed to be a split-cour with its second half confirmed to be airing in the Spring 2020 season, I\'ll just be focusing on what has been...explored thus far. This first season is mostly used to explore the near-future world of the series and dabble into mysteries concerning Juzo\'s past and the shady criminal underworld that dominates the city the series is set in, as many of the episodes have their relevance for further fleshing out the world of No Guns Life and dabbling into said mysteries. For the world building piece, No Guns Life does a solid job depicting the underworld that Juzo dabbles into as the city he lives in is rife with criminal syndicates fighting over territory and exploiting Extended technology for personal gain, while a powerful corporation has influence over the city\'s affairs as such to interfere in any investigations of the city\'s criminal elements. In addition, a major war that affected the world of the series has many Extended who fought in said world resorting to criminal activity in order to survive and much of the public has a negative perception of Extendeds as a result of said war.As for the mysteries within the series, No Guns Life features a complicated web of questions concerning the seedy elements of the city and Juzo\'s origins. The former has several ongoing story elements connected to the corporation that influences the city\'s affairs within No Guns Life, including the experiments performed on Tetsuro and a pair of mercenaries trying to track down Juzo in the show\'s second half. The latter half involves Juzo seemingly being connected to events from the war in spite of having no memory of his past during that point. These mysteries remain largely unresolved by season\'s end (especially as the show\'s final episode focuses on a case Juzo takes on instead of dabbling more into its mysteries) and mostly serve as a hook to interest fans into seeing the second season of No Guns Life.Whatever the series has to offer up with its mysteries in its second season will likely determine if I think it\'s worthwhile as a whole or not, but it has done well with its world building, mysteries, and gritty mood thus far to keep me engaged to it. So more than likely, I\'ll be revisiting the world of No Guns Life when it resumes its run in April of next year. explored thus far.

The concept of the world has promise, but it never delivers on that promise and potential.Yeah, in an anime landscape dominated by cute anime girls, ecchi, and isekai trash this may seem like a breath of fresh air. However, that’s all it is. A brief flash of interest before you watch a few episodes and are somehow bored of an anime where a man with a gun for a head fights other cyborgs.Literally everything about this anime is either run-of-the-mill or below average. The art and direction...were surprisingly subpar quite often and there were many instances of poor CGI.Remember how I said this anime seemed like a breath of fresh air from the abundence of ecchi in contemporary anime? Well it turns out that thought was misguided because every woman needs to wear some revealing article of clothing and there needs to be dedicated camera angles to highlight it. Why is this even something that must be shown for an anime set in a dark, distopian world? Am I supposed to get hard from this? Is this supposed to keep me interested because the creators know the story is ridiculously boring?Oh yeah, about that story, this was pretty much just 12 episodes of exposition. This is most evident when the final episode is pretty much separate from everything that happened earlier in the season. The entire season, characters and plotlines are introduced only to disappear until later in the series (most likely). But this means that the season has nothing it is building to, so it just says “fuck it” and uses the final episode to set up more characters and plotlines instead of giving a satisfying conclusion.The characters are pretty much all characters you have seen before and the bad guys are just portrayed as irredeemable evil with no real psychology behind their actions.The music was forgettable, but the OP was good if that matters for anything (it really doesn’t).Also there was some awful editing at points. Like, people didn’t even watch it before approving it bad. Maybe somebody at Madhouse did screen it but were put in a trance by how boring it is so they didn’t even notice it.Anyways, I know this review is long and makes it look like I hated it, but like I said before, it was just disappointing and subpar the majority of the time. I will not watch the sequal unless it is supposed to be REALLY good. Like above 8.20 good.It is closer to a 4 than a 2. were surprisingly subpar quite often and there were many instances of poor CGI.Remember how I said this anime seemed like a breath of fresh air from the abundence of ecchi in contemporary anime?

However, I think that other release of exceptional anime has impacted my view on No Guns Life. For example, I enjoyed Demon Slayer or Fire Force a lot better than No Guns Life. The main problem I see in this anime is that there\'s not a lot of variety. Some of the episodes are kind of similar and there are really no ""haha, gotcha"" moments. I do have to say, the opening is a banger and the character design is pretty cool....Unfortunately, this anime starts off on an amazing first 3 episodes and just doesn\'t live up to its expectations.-Spacecraft555 Unfortunately, this anime starts off on an amazing first 3 episodes and just doesn\'t live up to its expectations.-Spacecraft555', ""Use a gun. And if that don't work, use more gun. I've really enjoyed this show. Art style is great, helping truly capture the feel of the environment created within the is world. The story/plot uses this dystopia like world to help create a battleground for many unique clashes between the light and the dark. A somewhat darker story helps drag you deeper into this ruined world. Characters seemly molded by their surroundings, boost this atmosphere. Sounds of No Guns Life do leave something to be desired, but don't be mistaken. This show does achieve the criteria its trying to fill and quite well at...that.While watching, I've taken quite a liking to it. It has this eerie charm to it that I haven't really found anywhere else. Plot wise, the show is quite original with world building.

It's only in anime you're able to make a guy with a gun head work.Unfortunately, the other characters were lacking. Not necessarily bad just, not as interesting. I didn't mind the mechanic, she and the gunhead had a nice dynamic. While the runaway kid was just, not very likable. I'm sure he would come around later in the series. But his ideals were kinda bland. His whole character was just kinda basic. They also tried waaay to hard to make the guy in the suit seem as dislikable as humanly possible.

(It is probably the same reason why many others started watching this.) Super cool design! I also adore Juzo's voice actor, so I had to watch this when I found out that Suwabe Junichi would be voicing him.I love the art style of the serie and all the character designs, so a pretty high score on that part. However, for me the rest was kind of dissapointing. Because a lot of the characters dont move their lips while talking, like Juzo and Tetsuro, the animation is rather...stiff in my opinion. Of course there are action scenes that make up for it, but it wasnt anything spectacular. Story wise, I had to watch this anime twice (i dropped it the first time). I felt there was a storyline missing. It was there in the beginning when Tetsuro first appeared, but then that storyline kind of faded. Because this anime was only 12 episodes I ended up picking it up again and started getting into it. It's just cool to watch a walking revolver doing a bunch of action stuff! A new storyline kind of picked up the last couple of episodes and I figure it is where they will pick up in season two. So even though I didnt think this season was that amazing, I still want to watch season 2 and hope it will be better. I'm curious where it will go next. stiff in my opinion.

Which is why I am saying what I am about this rushed, not thoughtful, and embarrassing excuse for an anime. As well as a total disappointment.

Not only do they confuse you with all the things that happen, but they also provide you with eye-pleasing scenes along the way.In the first episodes, the anime quickly throws you two ""mysterious"" characters with no explanation of who they are, what they are up to, and why the male MC talks to a...fucking rope.

The opening is great but beside that.There are basically four big flaws ruining it.The first is the story.It\'s just a kaii thingy, you don\'t even need a basic story to begin with but this one tried to go with it and is completely failing because the MC just doesn\'t care about what happens beside her.So no matter how big of a mystery is laying around with an MC ignoring all of it without even a thought, it falls short.The worst being that she goes with all the story because she is...supposedly a writer and want material and doesn\'t go to the actual material.Not that the actual story is deep neither, you can guess it just at the first few episodes then it just unravels when none of the characters are here.The second is the actual kaii.You would think youkai and legends of the kind but here it\'s actually more like some ghost stories.That would have been good in itself but the author had to put it in a youkai fashion explaining it using a bit of one youkai, another from a legend, the last bit from a theory and you basically have a weird mix of a bit of all just popping out at the end to explain it all as if there was actually some logic behind it.The third one being the victims.There is actually some background story on them on how they become how they are and a prey to the kaii, it\'s supposedly dark with bullying and bullying and some others (no, it\'s not only bullying, just mainly bullying), but it was just so shallow.

Kakutou Bijin Wulong: Rebirth,https://myanimelist.net/anime/968/Kakutou_Bijin_Wulong__Rebirth,"['I\'m truly shocked regarding ""Fighting Beauty Wulong Rebirth"". I\'m shocked for two reasons. The first one is with regards to its existence - I can\'t believe that someone gave the go ahead for this sequel when the the original series was so terrible. I can\'t imagine there could have been many more than 5 people who demanded this. But nevertheless here it is, a full 20+ episode season no less.The second reason, arguably even more shocking than the first, is that ""Rebirth"" is actually good. And by this I don\'t just mean good in a relative way, like ""this is pretty good for a crappy...harem series"" kind of way (not that I\'m saying this series is a harem - it\'s not), this is good in an absolute kind of way. Continuing down the same route as its predecessor, ""Rebirth"" is also pretty plot driven for a fighting anime. Unlike the first season, however, they actually came up with a pretty coherent and interesting plot this time round, even if it does have a couple of bumps in it.Credit has to be given to the story line of ""Rebirth"" for trying to go for some pretty unconventional twists. To kick it off, Mao Lan, the main character from the first season, has given up fighting and tries to just settle down and be a normal school girl instead. It\'s certainly a neat idea and it\'s one that\'s convincingly executed, as is her return to the arena (you didn\'t really think she\'d stay away for good did you? :P) But what\'s more interesting about the storyline of ""Rebirth"" is that it brings to the table fresh twists on the much used wise old mentor template as well as some contrasting ideas regarding martial arts philosophies (while most shows of this nature will just explore one idea, ""Rebirth"" explores two different paths). Despite there being some plot twists that feels a little forced as the story strives along its planned out path, and despite the occasional subplots that doesn\'t go anywhere and just peters out (most notably the brief attempt at romance mid series), most of the story is pretty competently done, and almost always kept me interested.I\'d never thought I\'d say this for a fighting anime, but there aren\'t actually enough fights in this series. Like many similar series, there\'s a tournament taking place and in the creators\' infinite wisdom they decided to take a long break midway through and no fights happen for what feels like half a year and you just get to see the characters training up. I\'m all for concentrating on story, tension building and character development, but I have to say they got the pacing wrong here and left way too big a gap. The training part isn\'t exactly dull, but there\'s only so long you can anticipate the next fight in a tournament for before impatience sets in. Part of the problem appear to be the that the tournament is smaller than it was in the first series. With less rounds there doesn\'t seem to be enough fights to distribute across the twenty odd episodes, so it\'s a good job that the fights they do have are pretty exciting on average - much more so than in the original series.Interestingly, the fights in ""Rebirth"" aren\'t good because of how good the fighting sequences are. In fact the opposite is true - the fighting sequences in ""Rebirth"" look very cheap (as it did in the original series) and the choreography isn\'t exactly spectacular. However, the fights are quite exciting nevertheless because of the situations the fighters gets set up into. This is a good example of where the story and narration is the driving force behind making the fights good. Like the first season, Megumi is annoying as hell, and her matches always seem to drag on and on because of her meaningless chit chat. However even in her matches, there does exist a shocking twist that really surprised me when I encountered it.Like its predecessor, the sound production in ""Rebirth"" is great. Once again, it managed to come up with some maddeningly catchy themes (albeit some are a little too cheesey). There doesn\'t seem to be that many different background music tracks, but what it does have is used to great effect. The voice acting is also surprisingly competent as all the voices fitted their roles pretty well.""Fighting Beauty Wulong Rebirth"" is a sequel that takes all things that the first season attempted and failed, and made them successes... or at least better than they were before. Big improvements are made to the storyline and there is a surprising amount of convincing character development. As much as I dissed the original series, I\'m glad they made the (admittedly bewildering) decision to have a second season.

Saihate no Paladin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48761/Saihate_no_Paladin,"['If there are 2 things that I can learn from this show, it\'s the quote of “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery”, and that the author Kanata Yanagino is a nice and cool dude that not a lot of authors like him actually interacts with everyone on social media, good or bad, for or against, with his utmost eloquence and politeness.The reason why I quote one of Oscar Wilde\'s famous quotations is that Kanata Yanagino\'s work is definitely influenced/inspired from Rifujin no Maganote\'s Mushoku Tensei on its premise/theme. And because plagarism is never a wise move, everything else from then on was his own...pure work, that with the help of his interests in tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons (he REALLY loves RPGs) and what was originally written as practice, Saihate no Paladin a.k.a The Faraway Paladin was birthed and quickly rose in the same web novel site that most LNs got their start from: Syosetu. And everything from that point on was all based on what Kanata Yanagino had penned out, took the advice and feedback from Syosetu readers and fine-tuned to become a set piece that a lot of people really loved until the eventual publication deal came around. I mean, what kinda of debauchery and fate is this that Kanata Yanagino himself didn\'t even think of posing as kinda a knock-off version of Mushoku Tensei, that slowly transpired into its own material that people like us, now watching the anime, can finally enjoy? Honestly though, call that the red thread of fate that winds with success, and that his nature is strung with understanding and vigor of the international audience that had just begun to pick up on his work and commented on it, and just like the Syosetu readership feedback, he did the same for social media which surprised the hell out of everyone to appreciate him a lot more. I know I certainly did, and huge respect to author Kanata Yanagino.But backing up the case a lil\' bit, the strongest suit of the show has to be the story itself. Despite the whole Isekai reincarnation theme being the prevalent core start (which is where the Mushoku Tensei inspiration was carried from), I would have thought if this had started out better as a purely fantasy story, then it\'d make sense, but it is what it is, and I\'m fine with it since the similarities pretty much ended right then and there. The family aspect continues with William retaining his memories and reincarnated into the fantasy world, where he is taken care of by 3 undead Gods: the hearty skeletal warrior Blood, graceful the mummified priestess Mary, and the crotchety spectral sorcerer Augustus (shortened to just Gus). From there, William\'s story takes shape with the sequence of events that lead him to this road of self-discovery, what the world entails, and the reason why William\'s role as The Faraway Paladin takes precedence with all that\'s happening around him. For a practice piece that turned out to be quite a novelty in and of itself, Kanata Yanagino wrote well with the fascinating world-building aspects that while don\'t have quite the same valor as Mushoku Tensei, but it\'s good enough to stand on its own. The problem lies with hit-and-miss director Yuu Nobuta, and just like the reputation he holds in the aforementioned season where he\'s supposed to direct both this and the delayed Shuumatsu no Harem, this is a decent job of adapting the LN at the correct pacing (I\'m following the manga adaptation of the LN, and that is also another good alternative source check).For one, in a rare but common case of bad faith, William is NOT the tongue-in-cheek ""sex fiend/criminal or pervert"" that is Rudeus Greyrat, although both share a very similar theme of family as its focus (so yeah, screw you ANN for that TWiA segment on this show, it was quite the distaste to get called out by Kanata Yanagino himself). But otherwise, while some people had issues with how William was portrayed over time in the series, I\'d feel that giving a childlike feature to the MC shows that he\'s not perfect for a child that has retained his old memories and just starting out to learn the intricacies of the fantasy world, especially for a medieval time such as this. William\'s also imbued with religious themes, as evidenced of his utmost devout contract with the Goddess of Light, Gracefeel. That in and of itself, creates the same derivative of most stories with the whole ""church is bad"" feeling, but I\'m really glad that Kanata Yanagino chose to go against this trend, because we\'ve seen far too much of it to become an oh-so-predictable trope. If you need a devout believer spreading a faith long gone in the similar vein of Jesus\'s Twelve Disciples, William\'s your guy.The 3 undead gods of Blood, Mary and Gus, really do serve as teachers in Will\'s growing phase of his life, teaching him the ways of the world and like our dear Lord Jesus, is slow to anger, and rich in love. In many ways, all 3 of them are like ""what if\'s"" of a perfect parental figure whom knows how to raise children well, and you don\'t have to look far to trace their nurturing behaviours: their origins as former heroes whom gave their lives away by making a contract with the God of the Undead (Stagnate) in order for their souls to live on this world, with their lessons now passing onto Will like a newborn child. NGL, Mary, Blood and Gus are a delight to watch them raise Will up by being a man, both figuratively and literally. Even in the face of danger, they exhibit parental traits that understand where to draw the line between going too easy and going too far or harsh on Will, as dangerous as the external world beyond the boundaries can be.As for the other characters, since Season 2 has just been announced, their inclusion into this phase of William\'s story as the established Faraway Paladin is not undermined here as it sets up the basis for what\'s to come further in Kanata Yanagino\'s ever-growing story. William\'s story (like Rudeus) of stepping out into the outside world has him getting to know lots of people, and for now, his road warrior team comprises of half-elf archer Meneldor (or Menel for short), halfling bard Robina ""Bee"" Goodfellow, travelling salesman Tonio and renowned warrior Reystov. All are able-bodied at what they do best, and for now, serve as their primary roles until further in the story (which is Season 2 content). If you\'d realize that something was missing in what has already been a staple of Isekai and/or fantasy traditions for awhile, the harem aspect is gone, and just like the reverse, the author chose to go against the trend, which IMO worked out pretty good. Overall, I\'d say that at the very least, it\'s so far, so good.The one sole problem is with the overall quality of the show, and knowing the subpar quality of Children\'s Playground Entertainment as a low-budget studio, it\'s safe to say that production isn\'t the strongest suit of the show, and you can tell that it wasn\'t up to the task of delivering a decent action-heavy show. It\'s always a given that action and sakuga go hand-in-hand, and this felt like it was trying to hit the bare minimum without going too overboard in shadowing the low quality feel that the entire show just reeks of. Such a shame that a show like this has to be marred by the poor production values, but while thankfully the story elements do keep the show alive, you just can\'t help but wish that the anime could\'ve gotten a better treatment in the visuals department.At least the music itself is pretty faithful for the times that this show was developed in its historical time, and it adds into the enjoyable experience of the anime. H-el-ical// and Nagi Yanagi knocked it out of the park with their respective theme songs, especially for the former since she started going solo since Kalafina\'s disbanding in 2019, and has produced hit after hit, of which this is her 3rd single ""The Scared Torch"" (and soon-to-be 4th with Shuumatsu no Harem). I don\'t really need to tell much about Nagi Yanagi if you know her from the days of OreGairu, her vocal presence has grown from strength to strength over the past 10 years, and I\'m a long-time stan of her music. So while the bias is there, it feels great to hear a Nagi Yanagi song once again after quite sometime, and ""Shirushibi"" is no different. The experience delivered when it comes to the feels.All in all, everything is said and done about Saihate no Paladin a.k.a The Faraway Paladin, all I wished that could be better improved is two-fold. First, the visuals/animation itself as the studio is less than capable of handling action sequences (see Hatena☆Illusion). Secondly, is director Yuu Nobuta himself in making this adaptation work, which he genuinely tried his best to do so. But despite that, when animation fails, the story holds up on its own, and I\'m still excited for what author Kanata Yanagino has in store for us for the future in Season 2. Looking forward, and don\'t ever look back. pure work, that with the help of his interests in tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons (he REALLY loves RPGs) and what was originally written as practice, Saihate no Paladin a.k.a The Faraway Paladin was birthed and quickly rose in the same web novel site that most LNs got their start from: Syosetu. And everything from that point on was all based on what Kanata Yanagino had penned out, took the advice and feedback from Syosetu readers and fine-tuned to become a set piece that a lot of people really loved until the eventual publication deal came around. I mean, what kinda of debauchery and fate is this that Kanata Yanagino himself didn\'t even think of posing as kinda a knock-off version of Mushoku Tensei, that slowly transpired into its own material that people like us, now watching the anime, can finally enjoy? Honestly though, call that the red thread of fate that winds with success, and that his nature is strung with understanding and vigor of the international audience that had just begun to pick up on his work and commented on it, and just like the Syosetu readership feedback, he did the same for social media which surprised the hell out of everyone to appreciate him a lot more. I know I certainly did, and huge respect to author Kanata Yanagino.But backing up the case a lil\' bit, the strongest suit of the show has to be the story itself. Despite the whole Isekai reincarnation theme being the prevalent core start (which is where the Mushoku Tensei inspiration was carried from), I would have thought if this had started out better as a purely fantasy story, then it\'d make sense, but it is what it is, and I\'m fine with it since the similarities pretty much ended right then and there. The family aspect continues with William retaining his memories and reincarnated into the fantasy world, where he is taken care of by 3 undead Gods: the hearty skeletal warrior Blood, graceful the mummified priestess Mary, and the crotchety spectral sorcerer Augustus (shortened to just Gus). From there, William\'s story takes shape with the sequence of events that lead him to this road of self-discovery, what the world entails, and the reason why William\'s role as The Faraway Paladin takes precedence with all that\'s happening around him. For a practice piece that turned out to be quite a novelty in and of itself, Kanata Yanagino wrote well with the fascinating world-building aspects that while don\'t have quite the same valor as Mushoku Tensei, but it\'s good enough to stand on its own. The problem lies with hit-and-miss director Yuu Nobuta, and just like the reputation he holds in the aforementioned season where he\'s supposed to direct both this and the delayed Shuumatsu no Harem, this is a decent job of adapting the LN at the correct pacing (I\'m following the manga adaptation of the LN, and that is also another good alternative source check).For one, in a rare but common case of bad faith, William is NOT the tongue-in-cheek ""sex fiend/criminal or pervert"" that is Rudeus Greyrat, although both share a very similar theme of family as its focus (so yeah, screw you ANN for that TWiA segment on this show, it was quite the distaste to get called out by Kanata Yanagino himself). But otherwise, while some people had issues with how William was portrayed over time in the series, I\'d feel that giving a childlike feature to the MC shows that he\'s not perfect for a child that has retained his old memories and just starting out to learn the intricacies of the fantasy world, especially for a medieval time such as this. William\'s also imbued with religious themes, as evidenced of his utmost devout contract with the Goddess of Light, Gracefeel. That in and of itself, creates the same derivative of most stories with the whole ""church is bad"" feeling, but I\'m really glad that Kanata Yanagino chose to go against this trend, because we\'ve seen far too much of it to become an oh-so-predictable trope. If you need a devout believer spreading a faith long gone in the similar vein of Jesus\'s Twelve Disciples, William\'s your guy.The 3 undead gods of Blood, Mary and Gus, really do serve as teachers in Will\'s growing phase of his life, teaching him the ways of the world and like our dear Lord Jesus, is slow to anger, and rich in love. In many ways, all 3 of them are like ""what if\'s"" of a perfect parental figure whom knows how to raise children well, and you don\'t have to look far to trace their nurturing behaviours: their origins as former heroes whom gave their lives away by making a contract with the God of the Undead (Stagnate) in order for their souls to live on this world, with their lessons now passing onto Will like a newborn child. NGL, Mary, Blood and Gus are a delight to watch them raise Will up by being a man, both figuratively and literally. Even in the face of danger, they exhibit parental traits that understand where to draw the line between going too easy and going too far or harsh on Will, as dangerous as the external world beyond the boundaries can be.As for the other characters, since Season 2 has just been announced, their inclusion into this phase of William\'s story as the established Faraway Paladin is not undermined here as it sets up the basis for what\'s to come further in Kanata Yanagino\'s ever-growing story. William\'s story (like Rudeus) of stepping out into the outside world has him getting to know lots of people, and for now, his road warrior team comprises of half-elf archer Meneldor (or Menel for short), halfling bard Robina ""Bee"" Goodfellow, travelling salesman Tonio and renowned warrior Reystov. All are able-bodied at what they do best, and for now, serve as their primary roles until further in the story (which is Season 2 content). If you\'d realize that something was missing in what has already been a staple of Isekai and/or fantasy traditions for awhile, the harem aspect is gone, and just like the reverse, the author chose to go against the trend, which IMO worked out pretty good. Overall, I\'d say that at the very least, it\'s so far, so good.The one sole problem is with the overall quality of the show, and knowing the subpar quality of Children\'s Playground Entertainment as a low-budget studio, it\'s safe to say that production isn\'t the strongest suit of the show, and you can tell that it wasn\'t up to the task of delivering a decent action-heavy show. It\'s always a given that action and sakuga go hand-in-hand, and this felt like it was trying to hit the bare minimum without going too overboard in shadowing the low quality feel that the entire show just reeks of. Such a shame that a show like this has to be marred by the poor production values, but while thankfully the story elements do keep the show alive, you just can\'t help but wish that the anime could\'ve gotten a better treatment in the visuals department.At least the music itself is pretty faithful for the times that this show was developed in its historical time, and it adds into the enjoyable experience of the anime. H-el-ical// and Nagi Yanagi knocked it out of the park with their respective theme songs, especially for the former since she started going solo since Kalafina\'s disbanding in 2019, and has produced hit after hit, of which this is her 3rd single ""The Scared Torch"" (and soon-to-be 4th with Shuumatsu no Harem). I don\'t really need to tell much about Nagi Yanagi if you know her from the days of OreGairu, her vocal presence has grown from strength to strength over the past 10 years, and I\'m a long-time stan of her music. So while the bias is there, it feels great to hear a Nagi Yanagi song once again after quite sometime, and ""Shirushibi"" is no different. The experience delivered when it comes to the feels.All in all, everything is said and done about Saihate no Paladin a.k.a The Faraway Paladin, all I wished that could be better improved is two-fold. First, the visuals/animation itself as the studio is less than capable of handling action sequences (see Hatena☆Illusion). Secondly, is director Yuu Nobuta himself in making this adaptation work, which he genuinely tried his best to do so. But despite that, when animation fails, the story holds up on its own, and I\'m still excited for what author Kanata Yanagino has in store for us for the future in Season 2. Looking forward, and don\'t ever look back.', ""First of all, I'm going to talk about the author of the work, who is a great Mushoku Tensei phenomenon, that is, in this anime we see the origin of the work with a very good animation and a fantastic soundtrack. Besides, you can appreciate the creator's love for Mushoku Tensei since he focuses more on giving the protagonist a very unique personality, trying not to repeat the mistakes he made in his previous life. With this we see a world of magic and fantasy type but only the first chapters already show you that it is not any generic isekai. I really like how...the protagonist is raised and how the parents influence his thinking. With this, he not only greatly expands the depth that they give to the protagonist but also to those who accompany him. Anime is very nice to watch and if you like isekai you are going to love it. I highly recommend it, it shows that it is well thought out and I am looking forward to the second season.En español:Primero que nada primero voy a habalr del autor de la obra que es un gran fenatico de Mushoku Tensei, o sea en este anime vemos el origen de la obra con una animacion muy buena y una banda sonora fantastica. A parte podes apreciar el amor del creador hacia Mushoku Tensei ya que se centra mas en darle una personalidad muy unica al protagonista, tratando de no repetir los errores que hizo en su anterior vida. Con esto vemos un mundo de magia y fantasia tipo pero solo los primeros capitulos ya te muestra que no es ningun isekai generico. ME gusto mucho como crian al protagonista y como los padres influyen en su pensar. Con esto no solo amplia mucho la profundida que le dan al protagonista sino tambien a los que lo acompañan. El anime es muy lindo de ver y si te gusta el isekai te va a encantar. Lo recomiedno mucho se nota que esta bien pensado y espero con ansias la segunda temporada. the protagonist is raised and how the parents influence his thinking.

There’s a pang of desperation to it.Its deficient attempt to reinvigorate the ossified corpse of isekai is meager and sad. Its cheap, shoddy animation and even cheaper, even shoddier CG is worsened by its dull, flat color palette.Every line of dialogue grovels, begging you to care about its characters or its mechanics, but neither are engaging. Its exposition dumps are endless, sometimes occurring simultaneously with characters talking over one another. However, its verbosity is vacuous, and it features not a single moment of directorial inspiration.A monumentally generous person would struggle to call this show mediocre.Thank you for reading. ', 'The Faraway PaladinI didn\'t think my enjoyment of this series would be controversial until I read through some of the other reviews. I was honestly surprised because, for me, this series not only broke the mold for isekai but did a great job just as a series in itself. I can, and will probably, boast about all the aspects that had me watch to the end, but there were a few key factors that led to my ultimate appreciation of what I\'ll refer to as ""Paladin"". This is a series unlike many others I\'ve seen, and if similar, it\'s to series I hold dear.It\'s...safe to say that what I personally appreciated about Paladin is similar to what i appreciated about Star Wars episode 9. In Episode 9, JJ Abrams made a point to axe everything that occurred in Episode 8, effectively making like 8 never happened. I love that he did this, because I hated 8 so much. Just the cancelling of 8 was a point in 9\'s favor, and is ultimately why it\'s one of my favorites of the entire Saga. Paladin meets this criteria almost identically. I\'ve been burned by one too many Isekai\'s that I was tempted to give up on them altogether (Isekai Cheat Magician, I\'m looking at you specifically). However, what Paladin does differently is it takes the aspects that many of this genre follow and completely cuts them out: Born in a new world as an overpowered and chiseled chad? Not here. Women fawning over the main protagonist only, as if other men don\'t exist...eventually leading to the most unlikely of harems? Again, not here. Protagonist has a following of adventurers that the show pretends are important but do nothing to assist in battle? You get the picture! Things I\'ve grown tired of seeing, like strength without any effort or love without reason, don\'t exist in this world. It\'s truly a breath of fresh air.What surprised me most was how looooong it took to see any significant progress in the main character\'s, William G Maryblood\'s, abilities. Avoiding breaking out into a synopsis, basically he has three teachers, all masters of their craft, that advise him from his time as an infant to adult. From there his adventure starts and there you have it! It\'s not until he is an adult that we see his true potential though, and even then he loses against his teacher, clearly indicating he\'s not the most powerful in the series. Actually a fellow by the name of Meystov, that shows up later, seems to be stronger, or at least equally competent. But what makes it all better is Will clearly worked for his abilities rather than showing up already powerful (again, looking at you Isekai Cheat Magician). There\'s plenty of screentime dedicated to getting this point across.Another factor that really stood out to me was how often the protagonist needed help, whether it be from his guardian goddess, best friend, or adventure buddies. So much so, I got kind of irritated they aren\'t given more credit, but the show is about Will after all. I literally can\'t think of one fight that Will wins all on his own aside from small time beasts/demons. Any fight of significance felt more like an actual rpg: a fairy user to debuff the opponent and do long range damage, a swordsman to make critical blows, fodder to block opposing attacks, and of course Will to use both spiritual and physical abilities to cover the all-around class. My point, if not clear enough already, is each fight is entertaining. Aside from it not being a complete blowout because of an overpowered protagonist, I enjoyed seeing actual tactics and use of all party members. The fact that every member plays a role makes there presence all the more important and meaningful.If there\'s one thing the Faraway Paladin does better than anything else I\'ve mentioned, it\'s the story and lore. I\'ve never seen an anime come so close to literal Greek mythology while keeping that blueprint completely original. I know this may sound dull, but a lot of screen time is dedicated to just building the lore, allowing us to understand the gods and their history along with their impact on the living beings of the series. On top of this, the map is described in great detail: where cities are located, what role they play, what customs they follow, who rules over them, how the power has shifted between good and evil, and even the topography is explained! Again, sounds dull, but it\'s part of the reason I enjoy shows like Reincarnated as a Slime or Realist Hero. The politics play a huge role in these series\'. How certain situations get resolved outside of combat are almost more entertaining than any of the actual fight scenes.The characters are extremely unique and likeable in Paladin. A lot of time is spent with Will\'s mentors. Though he sees them as family, and vice versa, it seems a lot of their focus is spent on training and educating Will for the outside world. In this we see each of their individual personalities and abilities shine through. We learn what motivates them and what they reminisce about. One character has an obsession with money and gambling, while another yearns for her goddeses forgiveness, and the last is intent on maintaining his strength and fighting capabilities. Most shows would gloss over this aspect of character personalities. It\'s not just these characters we have a good understanding of though, but basically all the characters of importance, including the goddess who barely talks and the merchant who has maybe an episode of screen time.Everything I\'ve mentioned in this review all lend to what I personally liked about the series, and yet there\'s much more I\'ve not mentioned, with examples like: how beautiful the art is for each location, the noticeable effort put into one character\'s bards, the variety of races and creatures, and even the explanations of where their food comes from. I could continue on but hopefully it\'s not as necessary at this point. If there\'s something preventing you from watching this series that stems from an assumption or hearsay, I would suggest giving it a chance for yourself first, at least the first episode or two. I can easily say that I appreciated the time put into the little details and big alike. I hope others will be able to appreciate what this series does differently, because I definitely did. This was both a fun and intriguing watch for me, and I hope to see a season 2. safe to say that what I personally appreciated about Paladin is similar to what i appreciated about Star Wars episode 9.

A great isekai anime Must have both....And yes sahite no paladin is leaning towards the latter through a very clever writing gimmick, though there is not much to say about the MC (who I think is probably another loner/hikikomori) and uninteresting for the most part. The story still remains engaging.Why?simply because the goal of the MC is interesting because of the CIRCUMSTANCES that lead to it, this time the MC has the responsibility and burden to carry out his duty for the sake of his parents. which adds a certain depth to the story, and also makes us want to see it through till success.the story is great, it starts off with MC being reborn as an abanded child who is raised by his saviors , however, the saviors actually turn out to be fearsome Undeads, and as the story unfolds you fall in love with them and it is a very bittersweet feeling since you know MC will have to leave eventually since he is not the same and the differences are not easy to overlook.VA job is pretty well done as far as the undead parents go, The MC however does not sound equally as convincing and good as id want him to be but that will probably change once he is all grown up, music is nice OP and Ed are standard but not anything special but one might find themself humming to it occasionally.The art is great the undead look really good, no carbon copy D&D bs, character design is nice and original. Animation is well done yes it may not be very fluid but that is only because there is monologues and Info dumps happening across them and that is not entirely bad as it does not drive the fight out of context.characters are awesome, the undead parents might look fearsome but they do a very good job of reminding us that despite their outward appearance they are former humans, and hence we are able to connect with them very easily. Not much to say about the MC, not much has been revealed about him and he is yet to showcase much of his personality.A great anime that has had a very strong start, If it follows through and is able to adapt the rest of the story(I heard the source material is pretty good) in a good manner as well, We may have another strong isekai contender here as well! I recommend all isekai fans to give it a shot .If isekai is not our thing but you still like fantasy and artistic world-building you may still find a lot to like here so please give at least the first 3 episodes a shot.

It shows that despite the difficulties we have encountered, we can always go forward and change. This anime also shows that even if we are ashamed to complain to our family, friend or someone close to us, it is worth doing it, not worrying about what he/she may think, you just need to let the sadness out of you, and the person close to you in it will help. After all, no one who cares about someone, doesn't want their loved one to feel suffering, consider themselves as no one,...etc., right? We can also see that the distinction between race, gender or whatever is not important, it is not appearance but character that counts.

Instead of wasting time lampshading tropes, it decides to just tell a good story.Isekai stories almost always have impossibly strong protagonists who are strong for no real reason other than to be a power fantasy for viewers/readers. Will, the protagonist of this show, is strong, but not invincible, and the audience can see the progress he makes in his training as he grows up. The arc where Will is raised by his undead adopted family is one of the most genuine and heartwarming things I've seen in a show like this.Many detractors...compare this show negatively to Mushoku Tensei because the shows have the same basic concept (a person being reborn and having a second chance to grow up in a fantasy world), but that's a pretty broad type of story. The key is in the execution. The most refreshing part of this show is that Will is actually a believable character. Many other stories try to pretend their protagonists have depth by giving them flaws like being cowards or perverts. Will's flaws are much more thought-out and suited to the story; those being that he can sometimes be reckless and put too much or not enough faith in those around him.The biggest flaw of this show is that it didn't really need to be an isekai in the first place. With some minor reworking, it could have been a normal fantasy story. Regardless, Saihate no Paladin is some of the best the isekai genre has to offer. compare this show negatively to Mushoku Tensei because the shows have the same basic concept (a person being reborn and having a second chance to grow up in a fantasy world), but that's a pretty broad type of story.

The genre has been very popular but also has ideas and concepts associated with it. The person living the life in the new world brings their knowledge. That knowledge is useful and gives them an edge in the new world. And that person is powerful because they were reincarnated/teleported (or specifically because they were given an advantage).Faraway Paladin is not that.We don't learn about William's past. The anime isn't about it. It is too busy trying to understand, talk...philosophically about ideals and the world, and have you understand and enjoy all of it.

I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the entry in the Fall 2021 anime release schedule on this site.Until recently, I only watched anime and didn\'t really pay attention to manga or light novels, so I...hadn\'t realized how gratifying it would be to watch a well done anime adaptation of a series I had previously read.

I have no idea what the story, went into it blindly and was genuinely curious to know more about it. If only I knew to avoid this.Story: 3/10Watch this anime until episode 5 and then stop. Do not watch anymore after that. It turns into a dull fantasy adventure where the main character becomes too powerful to fight against and talks like a doofus when he comes across new people. First, impression-wise,...what once felt like a gritty and dark fantasy story, turned into a light-hearted, inconsistent, and boring story where the main character always wins no matter what.Art: 4/10Again, only the prologue deserves the spotlight. This show should've been a special episode about the prologue and that alone. There is a constant decline in quality where it becomes more noticeable even around episode 5.

I'm done with The Faraway Paladin and I'm not looking forward to its sequels.

Next to no attention is given to Will\'s previous life. Instead, what it feels like is a coming-of-age action-adventure story in a fantasy-setting. After the first few episodes, I found myself forgetting more often than not that Will was even reborn and not simply a native of the world he is inhabiting. There is an obvious parallel to be drawn here of course...with Mushoku Tensei, since both protagonists are reborn into their respective worlds as babies, as opposed to being brought over as they were when they died a la Re:Zero or Konosuba. In many ways this sets up to pull attention away from the protagonists past life, and Saihate no Paladin does this as Mushoku Tensei does the opposite. For me, somewhere tired to death by now of the isekai genre, having the focus pulled away from the protagonists cliche backstory about what a terrible life they had is a breath of fresh air, and makes Will\'s experiences feel much more genuine.Having contrasted this show against the likes of Mushoku Tensei, Re:Zero, and Konosuba, I would like to point out one show that kept coming to mind while watching, the oft-forgotten Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. The plot is your run-of-the-mill D&D-esque high-fantasy adventure slog, and it does its job well.  Nothing feels too out of place, all the expected fantasy monsters and tropes seem to be present, and it is just an enjoyable ride. The world feels alive enough with those familiar tropes in combination with details added explicitly within the show for Will\'s simple objective of spreading the glory of his goddess to feel like sufficient reason to cheer for him and his party through all the varied situations in which they find themselves.Art + Sound:Saihate no Paladin is no Kimetsu no Yaiba or Jujutsu Kaisen with its visuals; instead, to me it evokes the core of ~2005-2010 anime aesthetic, with muted colors and simplistic sound design. Since a lot of my favorite shows come from that time period, this sounds nostalgic notes and adds to my enjoyment. On the other hand, I can see how this could be seen negatively or as poor art and design by those accustomed to striking visuals and high-fidelity sound.Cast:First let me address the protagonist. The only reason I started watching the show was because the premise of a human adventurer protagonist raised by an unconventional, undead family struck me as unique and enticing. I believe that the family dynamics in the first few episodes payed off with just the right amount of wholesomeness while establishing some of the core principles of the world. Where I see a lot of negativity in other reviews is in regard to William\'s character. First, I agree that he often feels inconsistent -- switching rapidly between arrogant, pious, and clueless -- but I also believe that his character fits with his background. In most isekai plots, the protagonist has full recollection of all the memories from their past, and so is able to make decisions at a far higher level than someone of their age would normally (see Mushoku Tensei). This is not the case for Will. He seems to have only some vague feeling related to his past life (and some Japanese slang, apparently), and his backstory has been very intentionally ignored thus far. This effectively means that Will really is a teenager: immature, selfish, and unlearned about the ways of the world. To me this is sufficient justification for his behavior throughout the show, and makes him a sufficient vessel through which to watch the plot unfold.The supporting characters for this show feel solid. They are mostly built on established archetypes, as is generally the case with anime and especially the isekai genre, but that\'s not necessarily a bad thing. Furthermore, the core supporting cast so far has remained fairly small, which lends itself to the party-based adventuring vibe nicely. Furthermore, I would like to say how refreshing it is to not have an obvious ""main love interest"" character shoved in the viewer\'s face right from the start. As anime-generic as many elements of their friendship may be, I have enjoyed watching Will and Meneldor bond and overcome challenges together.Overall:While a bit slow at times, this show successfully conjures the feeling of adventure that I always long for in fictional works and has been a joy to watch. Most of all I appreciate the moments in which the show subverts my expectations... Also just who wouldn\'t want to be raised by Mary, Blood, and Gus? with Mushoku Tensei, since both protagonists are reborn into their respective worlds as babies, as opposed to being brought over as they were when they died a la Re:Zero or Konosuba.

But what makes the story stand out is the world building. I love how they explain the magic system and the echoes that gods can send. It doesn't do it all in a long exposition but spaces it out that it feels natural.I also enjoy the build-up for Will's strength and skill. He's not automatically talented in things-though he is considered somewhat of a genius. I like it when they use training to stimulate character interaction.Art:The fact that I don't see oversexualized woman is already a huge plus to me. Where I am right now, I enjoy the character design...for Will's undead family. Generic but it tweaks just enough for me that they stand out.The fighting animation is excellent and I feel the impact. I love the writing art for the magic.Sound:There are some good tracks here. The VA's also do an excellent job.Character:Will stands out because the anime really focuses a lot on his inner dialogue. I feel attached to him and I empathize with him. He is likeable and I can't wait to see how his travels will make him grow. I enjoy how the emotional trauma that he experienced in his past life translates to his current motives and it is really what I want from an isekai. Not just an op protagonist cause he just happens to have the right skills for the world or knows about the plot.The undead family is also interesting. I see them as one unit. I enjoy how the anime showed some slice-of-life with them and how they impacted the protagonist while he was growing up.Overall:I like what I see so far and I hope this is not one of those that fall off short near the end. It's been awhile since I have felt so attached to an isekai protagonist. for Will's undead family. Generic but it tweaks just enough for me that they stand out.The fighting animation is excellent and I feel the impact. I love the writing art for the magic.Sound:There are some good tracks here. The VA's also do an excellent job.Character:Will stands out because the anime really focuses a lot on his inner dialogue. I feel attached to him and I empathize with him. He is likeable and I can't wait to see how his travels will make him grow. I enjoy how the emotional trauma that he experienced in his past life translates to his current motives and it is really what I want from an isekai. Not just an op protagonist cause he just happens to have the right skills for the world or knows about the plot.The undead family is also interesting. I see them as one unit.

Carried by out-of-the-ordinary character designs.Some issues with CG that were par for the course the year it released, but nothing like Berserk remake or Golden Kamuy....I would say if you watch anime for the visuals you will probably only see this as a 6, but if you watch for the emotions and character dialogue you will probably put it a 7 or 8.Worth your time.

Also I like anime swordsmen. Didn\'t really live up to my expected hype though, as you can probably tell from my rating. I\'ll keep it brief since I don\'t wanna write an essay:The opening is an absolute banger, not gonna beat around the bush about that. The characters are pretty decent, and they actually feel like a real family. Not the best cast of characters...I\'ve ever seen, but they\'re good enough. So why did I drop this? Honestly, I just find the actual content itself... meh. It definitely has its moments, like for example in ep 4, there\'s a funny scene of Mary scaling the MC, and also the MC\'s fight for the episode (which... didn\'t exactly take up a LOT of the ep) was decent, but... at least 80% of the time, and not just during ep 4 (so basically every ep), I just find myself feeling really bored watching this, so yeah. There you go. Personally can\'t see it really getting much better either, but that\'s just me.Cool idea of an anime, but not really much goes on in it tbh. Eh. And this is coming from someone who\'s a sucker for slice of life animes (though tbf, they\'re more ""chill out"").Anyways, it\'s overall a 5.5/10 for me. Pretty average show imo.

I guess the people that think he cries to much which I saw not here but on a reddit post somewhere I promise are used to unrealistic portrayals of iron willed and heartless 14 year olds.Animation is nothing special. I\'ve heard a lot of people say it\'s bad...but I honostly didn\'t see anything that was very jarring.Story is fun, so far haven\'t seen much after the prologue but I am hoping it picks up a but more and forces the main character to experience more loss.

This anime is rated pretty badly with many negative reviews, so I needed to add a positive one. I LOVED THIS ANIME (at least for the first half Lmaoo).I don’t watch shows because of the technical elements or any of that. Sure, the production quality and having believable characters and all that type of stuff is important. However, overall enjoyment, excitement, being left on the edge of your seat, laughing, crying, and just feeling happy from watching a show is what really makes it great....The technical elements make a show better but there’s not much point to it if the show doesn’t make you FEEL things or want to continue watching the characters. I understand what some people say about fantasy or isekai anime plots feeling ‘overdone,’ ‘boring,’ and ‘predictable’ but they just make me happy. I found this anime super interesting and the relationships and story, at least in the beginning, were really amazing and well done.Now, of course, the show wasn’t all perfect. In the middle, it slowed down a bit and in the end, it went by super fast. The pacing was pretty good in the beginning but got a bit messed up after that. The ending was good I guess, but not the most satisfying. It definitely would’ve been better if there were more episodes so the story could’ve played out smoother. I still loved the show and it was fun to watch the main character grow.I rate shows based on enjoyability: how fun/easy it is to watch and on how much I like the story and characters. I gave this show a 10 for myself (9.5 if I could) as I absolutely loved the beginning, but the second half and ending took away from that so it’s really more of an 8ish. I often rate shows a 10 if I think it’s worth rewatching and I’ll definitely be rewatching this one in the future.If isekai/fantasy anime aren’t for you, or you want something super original and all, then obviously you’re not gonna love this one. But, if you just want a good show that’s interesting and fun and emotional, this is worth a try. It has action, family, suspense, emotional moments, friendship, and lots more.

I saw so many other reviews for this show hating on it because they couldn\'t see past the genre and comparisons to other shows. I\'ve been guilty of the same thing, but right now for some reason I feel like being real generous to this show and defending it\'s good points.First off I love the way this show handles its religious aspects. I think in our modern world full of cynical atheists, religious figures are often used in...media as a sort of strawman punching bag. Look, I get it, the Catholic church was historically a political super power with less than altruistic motives. It\'s an easy target for hate and makes your worldbuilding process simpler.Is it so wrong to be pious, though? To have characters that actually believe in something and follow through with their beliefs to the benefit of others? Is it so wrong to portray religious beliefs in media as being anything other than a way for an evil corrupt ruling class to control and manipulate its believers into giving up their possessions?I think exploring the story of a Paladin is the perfect opportunity to have such a portrayal of religion in a fantasy show. By grounding the story in his physical clashes with evil, they make the spiritual aspects of his journey more understandable. It\'d be a tougher sell if the show was him just wandering around blessing/healing people or praying for them. Being a holy knight, he can actually fight directly for their protection. Also feels a little more like the Christian ideology, that God isn\'t always going to do everything for you but he is going to be there to help you do it yourself.There were some strange things about the religious aspects like that scene where the bishop guy is just kneeling and our protagonist says something to the effect of ""wow he\'s so good at praying."" Like, what? I don\'t know if it\'s just me but it was a bizarre moment. There\'s also the BL elephant in the room. I\'m not into it, call me a bigot racist transphobe or whatever else your liberal arts degree has trained you to call people, but I can\'t stand BL shipping. Maybe I just know to many girls in real life who only watch anime to ship platonic male characters who are just friends with each other, and the dynamic in this show seems like it was specifically crafted to engender that kind of behavior. It was off-putting for me.I\'ll give it a nice 7/10 no they\'re not gay their just friends. media as a sort of strawman punching bag.

They are always ""dame-ningen"", worthless dregs of society, who have escaped into the fantasy realm, and it\'s an indictment of...Japanese society as a whole that they condemn so many to suffer and feel this way, that one is naturally born a burden to their family and community and can never be good enough (repeated many times in this anime already just four episodes in), and that the most acceptable way for those who don\'t meet the strict and narrow definition of what is socially allowed is to engage in suicide and hope for a better life in their next reincarnation. It is 90% of the dialogue, where they dwell on their mental anguish, heaping despair upon despair, without any true solution. This is not being alarmist or lambasting fictional narratives. This conspicuous theme is especially prevalent in many isekai anime where suicide is normalized and avoidance or escapism is used as a means of coping. It is emblematic of the harmful real world view Japanese people have of mental health and how they deal with it, this anime being just another dangerous reinforcement of that adverse thinking, and it is one of dozens released in the last few years within the isekai genre. Even non-isekai fantasy like the concurrently airing Platinum End, involves teenagers committing suicide because they aren\'t good enough in the eyes of a harsh and callous conservative Japanese society, only to be ""saved"" when they are conferred divine powers as god candidates. Instead of promoting healthy self-affirmation, positivity, and understanding and frankness within one\'s social circle, they remain intolerant, non-progressive, and close-minded, and this is coming from anime, which is considered one of the most liberal Japanese mediums and frequently aimed with international viewers in mind. It all boils down to how absolutely, insufferably, annoyingly whiny and dejected the main character is, apologizing every minute for his mere existence, and whatever ""dame-ningen"" he was in the past, disappointing his own imaginary critics and never even appreciating what he does have or his own worth, especially his newfound exceptional abilities, which is the whole point of isekai. The godawful voice filter they use for his inner dialogue doesn\'t help either. This type of anime goes well beyond entertainment. It really should have it\'s own label to warn of it\'s negative influence on mental health and it\'s unhealthy coping strategies that borderline insinuate self-harm.

The light novel and manga are utterly amazing. Full of character and life. This show feels like a soulless version of them. The story is interesting, but it does nothing to take advantage of being an anime. Will monologues as much as he does in the manga and novel, instead of using visuals to communicate the same information. The soundtrack is generic and ruins the tone of a few scenes. The LN is one of my favorite series of all time and this adaptation does not live up to it's standard. Buy the LN on Kindle its pretty cheap. "", 'They butchered it. Scenes in the Manga which hit like a truck, hit like a light breeze in this Anime adaptation. Everything is made ""cleaner"", the dark and gritty aspects and mental battles that Will faces are dumbed down, glossed over and overall unimpactful. The fights are just slideshows, the CGI sucks, the character designs were changed for the worse. As a major fan of the Manga, I honestly wish this anime was never made.They butchered my boy Will\'s entire character design, both visually and personality wise. Will straight up looks and feels like an entirely different character to the point that I had (and...still have) a hard time believing it\'s even him. It\'s not just Will either, they butchered most of the other characters as well, especially Gracefeel.Spoiler paragraph:The Manga had one of my most favorite manga scenes of all time, and the anime completely butchered it. When Menel is injured by the Chimera, Will wakes up and is depressed because he realizes he is simply too strong compared to his companions and has been putting too much on them. After that he walks outside to go see Menel and runs into Anna. This is where the Manga and Anime and completely different. In the Anime, Anna is all smiles and congratulates Will for defeating so many monsters and saving Menel\'s life, then Will walks away looking slightly depressed. In the Manga, Anna is in tears and completely distraught, she yells and hits Will for not saving Menel and letting him get so close to death. She outright blames him for what happened, and says it was his fault, despite him being so strong. This completely mind breaks Will. The art in these few pages is phenomenal and really shows how destroyed Will is mentally. Will becomes crazed and suddenly he has a look on his face that makes him seem like a villain. This scares Anna who starts to apologize profusely but Will just says its ok and walks off with that crazed look. After that he walks into Menels room to see his injuries. This is also where the Anime changes. In the Anime, Menel hardly has a scratch on him, just a few bandages around his torso and head. No cuts, no burns. Nothing. In the Manga, Menel truly looks like he is on the brink of death, all his hair in singed off, his skin is completely burnt and covered in scars. At that point you understand why Anna was so distraught and even angry at Will after seeing Menel in that condition. This scene was so impactful and emotional in the manga, I\'ve read that chapter at least a dozen times and I love it to death. In the Anime it simply feels like nothing, Will doesn\'t experience or go through that mind breaking experience with Anna and so his motivation and reasoning for wanting to leave on his own just comes across as childish and unthoughtful.:Spoilers overPlease just read the manga, I promise Will is an extremely well written and likeable character. He is an absolute badass while still being the most humble and realistic ""overpowered"" isekai character I\'ve ever seen. I even hesitate to call him part of the ""overpowered"" isekai character trope because in later arcs, his limitations and struggles are very apparent. Will was trained by hero\'s so he\'s about as strong as a hero himself, but not all powerful. The hero\'s in Saihate no Paladin have limits, as seen by Blood/Mary/Gus\'s backstories and Will can only do what he does because of their training.As others have pointed out, the opening arc is still the absolute peak of the series but the rest is FAR from being bad.

First few episodes were actually really fun and would get higher rating from me. It has ok magic system that depends on how well spoken you are, lets call it charisma based magic i guess, something known to DnD fans. MC\'s magic is used rarely and most often for very boring stuff in actual fights: ""make me faster aka accelerate""meanwhile he is estabilished as spellcaster god that actually fought god and won, kills dragon few days later and few days after that struggles vs lowest...level monsters while being stronger than in the god fight because he has god\'s protection at that point. So power levels are not the reason to watch this. MC is basically weak pleb that could be killed by baby even in full group of support whenerever they want and strong solo god killer whenever they want.But that is nitpick that could be said about almost if not all isekai stories... It does not affect my rating. What affects my rating is the shallow, horrible character writing after the ""family"" episodes where MC leaves them for great adventure, that is all about ""tell do not show"" If this was audibook it would work i guess but it is not. And every discussion is so NPC like. ""Well hello there traveler"" ""Hello there mister vendor"" ""I was attacked by beast"" ""I see mister vendor, how many and where to kill"" ""Forest of newbies bring me 10 wolf pelts"" this is how every talk feels like. Especially last episode was like reading something from someone that never had talked to real human before but only played the cheapest indie mmorpgames.If this was made in superhero cartoon style by american studio i\'d be honestly rating it 3/10 at best. But I\'m target audience for cute girly anime characters so I\'ll leave it with 7/10 i rate anime based on the season it was in mostly and that helps this one a lot because  there were only few better shows in this season to name few: Assassin aristocrat, Ousama Ranking, Kaizoku Oujo(mostly because of art), World Trigger, Mushoku Tensei.

Watch it, you might like it you might not or you might feel the same way as I do.', ""MINOR SPOILERSStory 8: The story is interesting, it develops points that I haven't seen in other isekais and the protagonist is developed from the beginning, which was a great thing for his independence and the rest of the story.Art 6: The animation is bad or at least very limited, the anime would be better with better animation, however, nothing was so bad that it prevented me from watching or took away the quality of the story....Sound 7: The dubbing was well done, I liked the characters' voices and the acting of the voice actors, the songs in the anime were good, but sound effects could be better.Character 8: With few characters presented, the anime developed well, the protagonist was able to demonstrate an attractive personality with pleasant development, as well as very interesting supporting characters.Enjoyment 9: I usually rate an anime by how much I enjoyed it, so with this one I felt very comfortable watching it, the whole theme of the anime was good and it made me enjoy it, precisely because it was simple and well directed.Overrall 9: The anime doesn't do anything surprising or anything very new, but it has a simple and well-executed formula, with interesting characters and a comfortable story to watch, so I was able to enjoy this anime well.

That second part of the season definitely suffers from low-prodction values and the intriguing prologue transitions into a much more traditional isekai adventure.HOWEVER... There's a lot that I deeply enjoyed here. The protagonist is overpowered, but throughout the story he learns to also rely on others and that strength alone is not enough. There's also absolutely no trace of harem here, which is such a massive bonus from my point of view it deserves an extra point by itself.Also, while a bit clunky, there's a lot...of cool nuance to many of the major characters. The protagonist becoming something of a religious zealot and being actively guided by his patron goddess is not the direction these stories usually take. The bishop, head of the church of the virtuous gods in the southern continent is also a really interesting one, giving an off-putting vibe at first but with his actions immediately suggesting there's much more to him that his boorish exterior would suggest. The dialogue he has later about holy blessings and his role withing the clergy is honestly brilliant (don't want to spoil the details).Maybe I just have terrible taste, but I found nothing to truly hate in this show and the way it moved away from isekai tropes, while not massive, was very enjoyable. Not amazing by any measure, but I'll surely remember it more than many higher-rated shows I've seen – I'm glad I've decided to check it out despite the negative reviews. of cool nuance to many of the major characters.

A rushed prologue""Tbh, there\'s not much I can say about this cause, I can\'t even remember the plot anymore. The last episode kinda reminded me of it, but it also made me realize that I\'ve been watching this without knowing what the protagonist\'s goal was.It was more interesting during the first episodes when there were only 4 characters to work with, and one area to play on. Mostly because of the intrigue and curiosity about the mystery surrounding the 3 ""undead"" characters. But as soon as that story got told, it became an open-world adventure for the protagonist.STORY (6/10): Felt like an...audiobook with all the long inner-monologues. I quite appreciate that actually but, gets pretty tiring. Specially when you don\'t get much action, and when you do, the action scenes are so minimal that it feels like a bathroom break for even more inner-dialogues to come.CHARACTERS (6/10): The 3 ""undead"" characters was really interesting. And there\'s still a lot they can do with those characters in future episodes as their backstory hasn\'t been touched-on that much. Will, the protagonist, while mostly a First Person Narrator, is a pretty fine MC. Not to mention, he still have that ""Mysterious identity"" thing (trying not to spoil :P). Menel works as a ""Voice of Reason"" character for Will. Sometimes they even switch roles. But there\'s not really much mystery on him anymore as they didn\'t really struggled to get along. They just immediately became BFFs and tell each other everything. The rest of the characters just happened to come by and tagged along. Not much to write about them... atleast not yet.ART (6/10): It\'s pretty fine for me, but definitely has some inconsistencies. Fight scenes are pretty lackluster though, mostly only consists poking and paper-cut looking sword slashes. There\'s also some enemies that was CGI, similar to that of ""Zoids"" Animation but, I\'m personally not bothered by it.SOUND: (6/10): OP/ED didn\'t make an impact on me, neither did the BGMs. But it wasn\'t bad, atleast. VA of protagist fitted the First-Person Narrator character in my opinion. Everyone else was good, but nothing stands-out.OVERALL (6/10): A pretty fine story, but definitely wasn\'t exciting. Whether it\'s the battles or the twists, it didn\'t really feel like you\'re waiting for something for every episode. You\'re just tagging along in Will\'s journey. But it was made easier by the ""Radio Drama"" approach, coupled with a fitting VA for that.

Overall the show is An Unexpected Beautiful Masterpiece."", 'Good god was I so bored watching this one. The show was only 12 episodes but it felt like it dragged on forever. For those wondering, it\'s not really your generic isekai with a harem and drastically overpowered character. The main character is strong, strangely so in his world, but so far it\'s quite limited to what he can do in terms of his blessing.To start off the title of Paladin in this show confuses me, typically I see Paladins as devout believers in a deity, who are more of a support tank, though this of course changes depending on the anime. But in...this anime, our mc starts off as a tank, wielding a shield and using blocks, parries, and magic as his main arsenal, then halfway through the show he completely just drops his shield and changes fighting style. Consistency is definitely not this anime\'s strong point.My biggest complaints about this anime are its pacing and its characters. The first five episodes could have been completed just fine in one or two, in fact, you could easily have condensed this season into 5 episodes and accomplished the same thing to the same effect. What ended up happening are episodes and arcs that drag on for way too long and really accomplish nothing but to fill up those 12 episodes. Something dragging on forever is not something I should be complaining about in a 12 episode long anime season, you should develop your world, your characters, and set a basic plot in motion. This season spent 5 episodes simply explaining our main character and the background of the world, then after that, the next 3 are spent developing the world. If this season was a movie or a long OVA, then it would have done a much better job at developing the anime and keeping me from getting bored.My second complaint is the characters. The main character is a whiny bitch, this is not usually something that bothers me too much, I like Deku from MHA, Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul, etc. but the difference between Will and the others is that Will does absolutely nothing but whine and bitch about everything. Furthermore, the show desperately wants us to get attached to its characters but it does nothing to really show us why we should care about them.""Oh care about her and him because they raised him"", they threw her in our faces and that\'s about it. Take FMAB for example, the plot revolves around the brothers trying to bring their mom back to life and to care about her, it shows us just how much she meant to the duo. In this anime, they simply seem like acquaintances, yes the mc cries over them, but he cries of everything else too.""Care about the elf because he\'s the mc\'s friend"" No he\'s not, the mc literally says they aren\'t friends, and they never give him a personality trait besides standoffish. That\'s not a personality, that\'s a singular trait, it cants define a character. Sasuke from Naruto was dark, edgy, and standoffish but he had a reason to be. The elf is just because he is.The art is okay. It was nothing special and neither was the score, to be honest. The characters are bland-looking and so are the colors, and the whole anime simply seems to be ""muffled"". There\'s nothing wrong with having typical looking main characters, though usually, anime does do something to set them apart from the others, the only ways this anime separates is through the mc having ginger (not bright red) hair and slightly bigger eyes, the other mains are seen as mains cause ones an elf, ones a halfling, ones an old man, that\'s it. The art, music, and sound, are bland. When you get to the enemies as well, they\'re all bland as well. They use CGI a lot for the enemies, which isn\'t inherently bad if they weren\'t just so choppy and boring.There is a second season coming out, so hopefully, this will give them the chance to expand on their world and story, and redeem themselves from this season, but I honestly don\'t have high hopes for it.3/10, boring. this anime, our mc starts off as a tank, wielding a shield and using blocks, parries, and magic as his main arsenal, then halfway through the show he completely just drops his shield and changes fighting style.

The main character is a whiny bitch, this is not usually something that bothers me too much, I like Deku from MHA, Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul, etc. but the difference between Will and the others is that Will does absolutely nothing but whine and bitch about everything. Furthermore, the show desperately wants us to get attached to its characters but it does nothing to really show us why we should care about them.""Oh care about her and him because they raised him"", they threw her in our faces and that\'s about it. Take FMAB for example, the plot revolves around the brothers trying to bring their mom back to life and to care about her, it shows us just how much she meant to the duo. In this anime, they simply seem like acquaintances, yes the mc cries over them, but he cries of everything else too.""Care about the elf because he\'s the mc\'s friend"" No he\'s not, the mc literally says they aren\'t friends, and they never give him a personality trait besides standoffish. That\'s not a personality, that\'s a singular trait, it cants define a character. Sasuke from Naruto was dark, edgy, and standoffish but he had a reason to be. The elf is just because he is.The art is okay. It was nothing special and neither was the score, to be honest. The characters are bland-looking and so are the colors, and the whole anime simply seems to be ""muffled"". There\'s nothing wrong with having typical looking main characters, though usually, anime does do something to set them apart from the others, the only ways this anime separates is through the mc having ginger (not bright red) hair and slightly bigger eyes, the other mains are seen as mains cause ones an elf, ones a halfling, ones an old man, that\'s it. The art, music, and sound, are bland. When you get to the enemies as well, they\'re all bland as well. They use CGI a lot for the enemies, which isn\'t inherently bad if they weren\'t just so choppy and boring.There is a second season coming out, so hopefully, this will give them the chance to expand on their world and story, and redeem themselves from this season, but I honestly don\'t have high hopes for it.3/10, boring.', 'Interesting start with the unusual upbringing of the hero, but it is eventually revealed to be just a minor background element and not the focus. Turns out it is just your cookie-cutter isekai after all, except... much worse.The slow pacing is terrible. It took half the season for the hero to even get introduced and to finally get going on his adventure, and it still keeps dragging its feet. Most of the show so far has been completely cringe-inducing attempts at power-of-love drama or similar nonsense, with all (i.e. both :p) so far introduced characters taking turns acting like clueless choir boys and crybabies. It...is so stupid and painful to watch that I\'m pausing and writing this to distract myself a bit in the middle of episode 7, wondering if I will be able to finish it. Oh and look, what is this? Since so much has happened in the season already (not), we get a recap episode! I\'m pretty sure the authors are just mocking their viewers at this point.I\'ve had enough.Edit: Ok I finally finished it two seasons later, and my opinion didn\'t change much. The pace does pick up in the last 4 episodes with some fights and new characters, in places even too much with one alluded to last-boss-fight entirely skipped. Other supposedly epic fights felt lame and anticlimactic with the hero\'s OPness. They were also random and without much purpose, making the whole season have no point to it except as a character intro for a supposedly bigger story. If they make more seasons they may still be able to salvage this, but as it is it\'s a waste of time. It\'s not even a good ""read-the-manga anime"" as it only hints of a potential of a story, but is not enough to make you like it or want to see it all yet. is so stupid and painful to watch that I\'m pausing and writing this to distract myself a bit in the middle of episode 7, wondering if I will be able to finish it.

The very concept of someone being sent to different world with current world ideas and knowledge is wrapped with ton of potential- even if lot of them are average power fantasies with harem (meaning not as good, but still entertaining if you know what you are getting into). There are so many great isekais, even in recent years, such as Mushoku tensei or shield hero.And then theres this. Saihate no Paladin or ""the faraway paladin"".

His friends are 3 undead entities that grow to become his family until an overbearing Devil strikes them; Wanting to help, Will tries to manifest powers in order to attack the overbearing Devil but to little avail. In the end, Will parts ways with the remaining entity and decides to explore the land of this new world while also spreading the gospel of his fallen goddess.Story & Characters:...5/10To me, after the conflict with the devil/god and the undead, I considered the story over. The reason being is that this series feels like a directionless sandbox where Will accumulates experiences that don't add much value to the story. The characters feel superficially developed because their personalities bend at will (pun) from bad to good without much developed conflicts. The scenery and world building is probably one of the series strong points because there is little that we know about this world but it doesn't help when we don't have an overall narrative direction to give this series a purpose. It does feel more like an adventure slice of life than anything considering it is a viewpoint on the main character's 'realistic' day today living experience. Any enemies encountered toward the end don't add much friction in the way of story because we know Will can more than likely handle them but chooses not to 'abuse' his goddess' powers in most scenarios which leads to dragged out scenarios.Art & Sound: 6/10The art and animation is above average; Although the art is very detailed, the thin outlining gives off the impression of lower budget visuals and it doesn't help with the choppy inconsistent animation. Furthermore, a lot of the visuals are slideshow panning shots especially during explanation sequences which definitely gives my experience a lower expectation on animation. However, my experience would have been lower if the series wasn't highly detailed and had a nice vibrant pastel color palette.A few of the character voices don't feel suitable which gets distracting during the dialogue dense scenes. Will's voice actor could be more suitable for Meneldor's voice actor and vice versa since Meneldor could utilize the feminine-male voice more to suit his elegant portrayal. I think Will could use VA Murase, Ayumu's vocals better since it can be used to portray a weathered persona and definitely reflect his past life. I expected Robina's voice actor to have a higher pitched voice actor so every time she has dialogue the audio distracts uncomfortably. For the most part, the voice actors are suitable to their character designs.Overall & Enjoyment: 4/10It could have been better if there was an end goal, a more competent main character (since he still maintained memories and somewhat of his past he could have been more prepared) The side characters just don't feel like real characters, they feel more NPC like since they adhere to Will's undying purity. 5/10To me, after the conflict with the devil/god and the undead, I considered the story over.

It started out pretty fantastic, it showed potential to be one of the best shows this season, but really started to fall flat on its face as it went along; going from a more unique isekai to an incredibly vanilla and boring one.Our story follows our isekai protagonist Will as he is trained by 3 undead humans in a faraway ruined city. He trains and learns before setting out on his own adventure to stop evil and spread the word of the goddess of light, Gracefeel. It was the first part...that made it feel like a discount Mushoku Tensei, the story starts with him being born, and then follows him through his childhood as he becomes stronger and grows older.It\'s just that unlike Mushoku Tensei, Saihate no Paladin has incredibly bland and boring worldbuilding, a way more basic plot structure, worse characters, and devolves into a cookie-cutter isekai plotline of ""kill the bad demons"" halfway through. Nothing about the plot is really that inspired or interesting, and it gets really boring because of it. There is an attempt at some character driven drama at the end of the season, but the scene is so generic and something I\'ve literally seen done 10 times already by different works that I just don\'t find it even remotely interesting, especially because I don\'t think I really like any of the characters.Speaking of the characters, they are basically all pretty cookie cutter like the rest of the show. Will is a pretty basic nice-guy isekai protagonist who is motivated and wants to do the right thing, the same thing I have seen and am tired of seeing in every shounen imaginable. He is like ""religious"" if you think that counts as a quirk, but honestly his religiosity ends up feeling like he\'s an amateur D&D player, and not an actual warrior-priest. The rest of the cast is similarly simple and archetypical, and really just all around boring. Also a special mention to Bee, who was my least favorite character for not shutting up about her stupid songs.The art was honestly the best part of the show. It by no means was good enough to redeem this boring show, but it would have been worse if I had too watch everything played out with horribly animated 3d models; instead I only had to watch mediocrely animated cartoons. The quality was just very meh. Limited animation, a slightly drab color palate, that atrocious demon CGI. Despite its very underwhelming quality, this part of the show managed to piss me off the least, so kudos to the art team I guess.Overall this show was a slog that started fine and then just started slogging harder and harder as time went on. I would never recommend this to basically anyone, because whatever\'s in this show has already been done better in at least 4 other anime. that made it feel like a discount Mushoku Tensei, the story starts with him being born, and then follows him through his childhood as he becomes stronger and grows older.It\'s just that unlike Mushoku Tensei, Saihate no Paladin has incredibly bland and boring worldbuilding, a way more basic plot structure, worse characters, and devolves into a cookie-cutter isekai plotline of ""kill the bad demons"" halfway through.

Isekai and their unique story are what make each one appealing. However, this one is nothing special after seeing the first few episodes unless anything major changes in the rest of the season (which I doubt).The show has unique character designs but all the characters themselves are very simple and static. This results in having a very predictable and bland story. The MC makes no sense either. He's strong and very unfun to watch. A weird thing was his design to look...very feminine and to have a female voice actor. I personally don't mind if they just had the character be a girl instead if they were gonna do that. He's also annoying and emotional at the wrong time, which makes me dislike the character in a bad way. Also this guy has so many inner dialogue. Half the time, it stating super obvious or unnecessary thing.Overall, this show's story is similar to Mushoku Tensei without being sexual at some points. However, unlike this show, Mushoku Tensei has dynamic and developing characters. In addition, the MC isn't unrealistic or annoying to watch live in their world as OP people. More emotions and story is built into each character and the story moves at a good pace, unlike this show. I recommend watching Mushoku Tensei instead.

It’s supposed to be an isekai, although that doesn’t play any part in the plot besides making a few vague references to our world. In essence the author threw it in there because isekai sell more than clear-cut fantasy stories. Oh, and also because it’s a cheap explanation for why the protagonist is overpowered. It’s not because he trained hard all his life, it’s because he’s an otaku loser from our world.PACING? WHAT IS THAT?The pacing is also messed up, since there is close to nothing going on...in terms of action in the early episodes. Instead of that you get prolonged infodumps in an area that is empty of life and with nothing to look at in general. Then, out of nowhere, the protagonist can defeat gods with not much training. Supposed this was done for giving the viewer the time to get to like the main characters before the action adventure portion of the story begins, but it was done in a very dull way. There is nothing special about the protagonist you haven’t seen in a myriad other shows, the support cast of monsters won’t follow him when he leaves so you getting to like them amounts to nothing, and when the action part begins you are eye-rolling with how out of left-field it is.OLYMPIC GAMES TONE JUMPEven the tone of the plot is wrong, as it starts like a grim slice of life and then abruptly becomes a light-hearted action adventure. It’s not the first show that has sudden tone jumps, but the amount of things happening in each episode is too small and unimportant to excuse their duration, and the jump to a different genre altogether is way too sudden. He just pledges to a deity and gets a power up that lets him beat the demon lord. Most viewers gave up on the show because of it, and were instead watching Mushoku Tensei, a different isekai that did the exact same things ten times better.BEING PATIENT FOR GETTING A GENERIC FANTASY SHOWBut even if, for whatever reason, some people didn’t jump ship to Mushoku Tensei and kept on with the show after the boring slice of life part was over, all they got was a generic fantasy show where, as I said, the isekai part doesn’t matter and it’s just a bland overpowered guy going around, easily defeating all the enemies, and getting constantly rewarded from the local population. I mean, why wouldn’t he? The very first enemy he defeated was the strongest monster in the world, and he did it with no battle experience. What can possibly pose a challenge after that, or be a worthy enough reward?THIS AIN’T DEMON SLAYERBut even if someone is pleased with all that nonsense, the anime just doesn’t look so good. The production values are subpar, the CGI is awful, the colors are flat, and the character designs are bland. In the post-Demon Slayer era that means nobody will remember it after a couple of weeks.

But there are a few pros and cons.Story:The story is generally set up into a couple small arcs:Will\'s training amongst his 3 undead guardians.His start into being an adventurer and helping people.His reconciliation with the world versus how he wants to go about his own goals and becoming the Faraway Paladin.The first arc is very good....All the characters have interesting quirks and personalities and there\'s a lot of worldbuilding. And it ends with a fairly climactic battle and emotional ending.The second arc, he meets a friend and starts helping people. For the most part, this is fine because it adds to the world building and begins to shows off Will\'s training and outlook on life. The biggest issue is that the people he meets and the general conflicts are somewhat less developed and feels somewhat run of the mill. At times it feels like Will\'s journey is getting truncated and skipped in some places. It seems like the story wants to get everyone moving along quickly.The third arc is Will arriving in the big capital city and essentially learning more about he world and it\'s politics while trying to get help for the surrounding villages being attacked by demons. This brings in a lot of more exposition and world-building and starts to feel a little boring.After the first arc, it seems like the story is mostly about Will\'s introspective thoughts and feelings about himself, his new friends and the world around him. While not inherently bad, it is a tonal shift somewhat to the beginning arc. The story really what you know Will, but unfortunately Will is a little boring. His is the apotheosis of the ""Good Guy"" hero character, and that\'s about it. He wants nothing but to help people in need. The biggest character development he gets is learning that he doesn\'t need to do it all on his own, but the show only spends like 5 minutes on it near the end.Characters:Will is really the only character who gets much development and he doesn\'t really develop into an interesting character. Some reviews keep calling him an idiot for some reason, but this feels pretty off the mark. I\'d sooner call him naïve and inexperienced to some degree. Due to his upbringing, he doesn\'t know much about the world as it is today and never had a chance to make friends, so he struggles with those aspects in his new life and is somewhat unsure of himself. This is also coupled with his previous life, since it is an isekai, where he was a shut-in. He certainly isn\'t stupid, just learning to be open and trying to figure out the new world. Some people have also said he\'s OP and while he sort of it is, he actually does struggle with doing the correct thing and it\'s not like every fight is a cake walk or anything, so I think that point is a little overblown.Other characters aren\'t as developed overall. Mostly just the undead guardians and his new friend, an Elf named Menel. There are a few other side characters who are interesting at first glance but don\'t get much screen time.Conclusion:Overall, if the show got a second season I\'d be interested in seeing it play out. This first season feels like a lot of build up and setting up the world and pieces within for a bigger story in the future. So it does feel a bit like an anime preview to sell the manga or LN series. But I think it\'s interesting enough for a watch if a little slow. Couple extra things: no harem or fan service, which is nice. Art is fine with some ups and downs. All the characters have interesting quirks and personalities and there\'s a lot of worldbuilding. And it ends with a fairly climactic battle and emotional ending.The second arc, he meets a friend and starts helping people. For the most part, this is fine because it adds to the world building and begins to shows off Will\'s training and outlook on life. The biggest issue is that the people he meets and the general conflicts are somewhat less developed and feels somewhat run of the mill. At times it feels like Will\'s journey is getting truncated and skipped in some places. It seems like the story wants to get everyone moving along quickly.The third arc is Will arriving in the big capital city and essentially learning more about he world and it\'s politics while trying to get help for the surrounding villages being attacked by demons. This brings in a lot of more exposition and world-building and starts to feel a little boring.After the first arc, it seems like the story is mostly about Will\'s introspective thoughts and feelings about himself, his new friends and the world around him. While not inherently bad, it is a tonal shift somewhat to the beginning arc. The story really what you know Will, but unfortunately Will is a little boring. His is the apotheosis of the ""Good Guy"" hero character, and that\'s about it. He wants nothing but to help people in need. The biggest character development he gets is learning that he doesn\'t need to do it all on his own, but the show only spends like 5 minutes on it near the end.Characters:Will is really the only character who gets much development and he doesn\'t really develop into an interesting character. Some reviews keep calling him an idiot for some reason, but this feels pretty off the mark. I\'d sooner call him naïve and inexperienced to some degree. Due to his upbringing, he doesn\'t know much about the world as it is today and never had a chance to make friends, so he struggles with those aspects in his new life and is somewhat unsure of himself. This is also coupled with his previous life, since it is an isekai, where he was a shut-in. He certainly isn\'t stupid, just learning to be open and trying to figure out the new world. Some people have also said he\'s OP and while he sort of it is, he actually does struggle with doing the correct thing and it\'s not like every fight is a cake walk or anything, so I think that point is a little overblown.Other characters aren\'t as developed overall. Mostly just the undead guardians and his new friend, an Elf named Menel. There are a few other side characters who are interesting at first glance but don\'t get much screen time.Conclusion:Overall, if the show got a second season I\'d be interested in seeing it play out.

But I was wrong, I cant even remember what happens after he leaves after making his pact with the goddess.

But it's certainly enjoyable and here's why....Faraway Paladin follows the day to day life of Will. From training, to daily struggles, to adventures and how his world is shaped. It's more of an adventurer's slice-of-life than a questing anime. Kind of like reading his diary instead of reading or hearing about all of his feats. It's focused on the characters and their daily struggles in life rather than the fights for their lives (though they are obviously included). It gives a simpler vibe...while actually being more in depth than many others.Graphics-wise Faraway Paladin utilizes this simplicity splendidly. It brings us closer to the characters and making it flashy would have been rather tone-deaf. While there is magic and heroism, it's a fallen and impoverished world. The main character has been raised to live a simpler life and be greatful for what he has. Moral values are to be put above wealth and he lives his life in servitude to others. Flashy things wouldn't support his worldview half as well.As for character growth there is plenty, Will has his faith shaken, he has self-doubt, he wants to better himself and despair is lurking from time to time. He's not a perfect little hero, he's human. Thrown into a role he embraces but isn't always ready for. His side-kicks actually have to fulfill their role of support despite the main guy being slightly OP and through this, they grow as well.Overall it's not the best anime you'll ever watch but it's one you can count on to make you smile in contentment. while actually being more in depth than many others.Graphics-wise Faraway Paladin utilizes this simplicity splendidly.

They should have used twice as many eps to make this part. This would have allowed them to develop the characters a bit more and generally provide a little bit more flesh to the story.The art is generally good, but the ground in eps 11 for example was weak.The characters are likelable, but here and there somewhat underdevelopped. As much as a I like this anime, which I very much do, the enjoyment...gets killed by the pacing and way of 'filming'. E.g. adding a bunch of stills to do a 5min story in 15 seconds.Furiously hoping we get a better paced and more high quality second season and hopefully a third and fourth thereafter. gets killed by the pacing and way of 'filming'.

The story isn't really immediately obvious and you are kind of figuring it out along with the main character. Once you get an idea of the story it is telling and we learn more you can look back and appreciate how events influenced each other and the MC. The main character starts out childish but getting to see how they grow is a central component of the story and I think it is done well. I also enjoy that...the MC has real concrete reasons that cause him to become a goody good and that is incorporated with the story and who the character is. So many generic isekai characters seem to have no real motivation where here we really get to see why the character becomes who they are.I have to say this show has a definite Hallmark edge to it, being overly sappy and pure at times, and actually I'm all here for it.  I've been wondering about an isekai that would work in this kind of way with the character's motivations being divinely oriented too. I always thought that a very devout MC would be cool and I think it works if you can get into it. I don't think this schtick will be for everyone but for me the spiritual/divine aspect dealing with souls, gods, and other topics in a reverent manner was an enjoyable angle for me.I think this show takes some understanding and acceptance to kind of go along with what it is trying to preach.

I enjoyed it due to it's focus on characters, relationship, development, fighting and psychology. Also the powers and the world/enemies/characters/history were nice.

They probably had a pressed schedule and i don't know about funding.

It does stand out from the crowd. Only in the worst way possible.Everything that makes for a fun or interesting isekai is entirely missing from this show.

The show refuses to get going and for half the season we\'re stuck in one place, in essentially a ""training arc"" that any other isekai would have resolved in its first episode. The characters just have no appeal. None. No charisma,...no humor, no draw. Even the oh so dramatic elements they try to introduce with secrets, and pacts with gods and so forth are just so unnecessarily overcomplicated, and ruin the pacing or any real sense of tension the story might have built up.

The 3 characters on the art are the only interesting thing in this anime and they're gone a couple episodes in.The only good and interesting thing about this anime are the 3 that raise the main character. Outside of that, it's extremely bland and boring.When the main character has to leave his home and venture out I got pretty annoyed because it's basically just a couple episodes of crying.

It's to the point where there are repeating frames.. at least I think they're accidental repeating frames? There's a part where the main character unsheathes a sword then sheathes it again.. but then those frames are copy and pasted 2 more times?The worst of the lazy animation is where one of the supporting characters is singing and playing an instrument but they just don't even bother animating their arm moving at all to play the instrument.There's also times where someone will nod or move their head and it kinda just folds in on their neck. It's all very awkward.Nearly forgot to mention.. This is an isekai somehow. The only thing that makes it an isekai is that the main character said he has memories of his past life which was like an office worker or something. Nothing really beyond that.

Isekai can still be good if done correctly. This show is anything but.The pacing is abysmal. I barely got to know the characters and the show expects me to care about them as much as I do my first newborn. It doesn’t try to be subtle or ease you into anything. It’s just one event after another done so rapidly making them all shallow and lack punch. Then there’s whatever lackluster explanation they try to throw at you which is instantly contradicted by what...you see.The art direction is boring, the animation mediocre and the sound design average at best. Only thing I kind of enjoyed was the opening.The show’s story and characters had potential, but it got absolutely massacred by everything else the show tried to do. If it had focused more on building the family’s dynamic before trying to get your attention with cheap action, I might’ve actually been more invested.This could’ve been a good show, or even a great one, but this goes to show that an anime is more than just a story and a premise. You need execution as well.Overall, I am not impressed by the show.

It only feels yet liek a small step from the adventure that has yet to come to make the maincharacter's goal come true.What I think is good is in the Anime that we first learn a lot about the character of how he grows up, and about the people that care about them. It makes them very sympathic and gives a really good start off.The character's...are not that special but they are interesting enough, the maincharacter is well, the maincharacter,being as oblivious to the world from how he has grown up in ,it makes it the perfect character to explore the new world just as the viewer does ,experiencing some new stuff Not only of course in the world but simply also just learning one or two more things from everything a small bit.Coming to the Art & Animation I must say... the Art is very mediocre and the animation is average ,if not almost bad because it feels very choppy. Which makes me wish that they would put more money into it for an anime that actually kept me on interest. I am hoping that might improve it a little in the sequel if they have enough success.

What gets added to the story from the main character being reincarnated from another world? Nothing, that\'s what. The premise of ""orphan raised by badass undead"" is good by itself, so it makes no difference if the mc is from another world.Story is other wise pretty good if you ignore the whole isekai thing just like the writer did after a few episodes. the first few episodes where the mc was still growing up...were my favorite because mc isn\'t that strong of a personality, so the other guys carry the story and give the mc time to develop into the guy that he is for the rest of the show.If you were looking for another generic isekai, or another Mushoku tensei, you would be disappointed. BUT if you want to watch an overall feel good fantasy show with a unique premise, i recommend this show. Just try not to think this is an isekai show jumping in. were my favorite because mc isn\'t that strong of a personality, so the other guys carry the story and give the mc time to develop into the guy that he is for the rest of the show.If you were looking for another generic isekai, or another Mushoku tensei, you would be disappointed.

The story is interesting, a bit mature for a shonen, and is very friendly toward a more ""feminine"" perspective (even though there are one or two cringe moments).The parts I am not sure sure about are the bubbly animation style, the pacing of the storyline, and the direction of the plot.

The initial premise is fantastic. The origin story of the main character is the highlight of this show.As soon as you reach episode 5 things take a massive dive. The animations becomes worse. The character dialogue loses all mystery and that any sense of forward momentum. In fact characterization falls completely flat at some point.This story lacks any sense of pacing and plot points lose their importance. There is no foreshadowing or character depth. Overall one of the worst anime series...I have ever seen.

A considerable amount of time is taken fleshing out not only William but also his undead “parents” trying to give them distinct personalities and motives.The slow pacing whilst effective may not be to everyone’s taste and if you are one who like fast paced action from the get-go then it is recommended you give this series a miss. If you can stick with it then there are...positives to be had as quite a lot of care is applied in character and world building. What is also noteworthy are the cryptic comments dropped by various characters which generates a sense of mystery and tension that will leave you pondering on what happens next.Eagle eyed viewers will be rewarded for the lines and exposition provided will prove critical in understanding the conclusion to this strong opening arc. This arc also has long lasting effects in the latter part of the series as all the comments made here have future relevance so it really pays to keep those comments in mind even beyond the conclusion of this opening arc.It is after this opening segment where the sense of adventure begins in earnest as we see William embark on his lifelong quest which is driven by what has come before. It is at this moment where I felt the show lost its sense of direction, at least to some extent. Whilst I am not going to say it was outright bad (I did enjoy the subsequent arcs) the thing missing was a clear-cut goal which was always left somewhat ambiguous. This lack of a defined end point meant there was no clear idea where the series was heading. This lack of direction meant we are denied the opportunity for the story to build-up to some climatic point to keep viewers really engaged. This directionless story was not helped by the fact that the conclusions of later arcs never had the same impact as what we got in the opening act of the anime.Still, if you liked the style of storytelling then you will likely enjoy what happens next. Like before, a good amount of time is devoted to world building as William’s horizons are expanded greatly now that he is out in the real world. On top of that many of the key characters introduced are given a considerable amount of screentime so we can really get a good handle on their personalities, motives and life outlook.This slow build-up whilst requiring a degree of patience remains effective and I would say the casting, for the most part, is solid and there isn’t a character that is likely to inspire hate or even annoyance. There are no dumb characters so if you are concerned about Faraway Paladin going down the harem or ecchi route which is so common in the isekai genre then rest assured this doesn’t happen here. It is a serious show that focuses on its story and characters. In fact, if there is one disappointment I had with the show it was that some key secondary characters were not fully expanded on and their motives, even by the seasons end are still shrouded in mystery.Speaking of endings, things are left rather open ended as while there was a climax it was far from conclusive as it was clearly stated that William has a few more hurdles to jump through before achieving his goal. His uncomplete mission, coupled with the fact that some key characters still have opaque motives means that a second season (which is coming) has a lot of potential avenues it can go. I suspect, judging by the style of storytelling this will likely prove to be a more enjoyable affair as many of the fundamental concepts have now been covered meaning that the second season can focus more on driving the plot forward and upping the ante and drama.Animation/music:Big weakness of the show. Faraway Paladin will not gain any fans with the quality of animation which was largely subpar throughout the entire series. Character models suffer from a lack of details even in close-ups and this basic look only looks worse in the more distant shots when the characters almost take on a sketchy look. It is bothersome and this poor animation is made all the worse in the action scenes when we get shoddy CGI and moments when the proportions of characters seem to go out the window.Fortunately, the opening and ending animation sequences are better and the songs used better still. Out the opening or ending tracks I felt the ending ""Shirushibi"" by Nagi Yanagi edged it although the opening beat ""The Sacred Torch"" by H-el-ical// was also a good effort. These strong sequences prevents Faraway Paladin getting a poor score on the animation/music score.Summary:Faraway Paladin is an isekai series that tells its story in a slower and more methodical way than you will see in most anime. If you can bear with this slower pacing then you will enjoy the piece-meal nature of revelations being delivered which are not only relevant but add to the sense of tension and drama. This type of story telling is most effective at the beginning.Unfortunately, this style does not work to the same degree in the later parts of the story as there are no grand villains or goals to drive the story narrative. Instead of end goals we get lots of world building and the addition of extra cast members, several of which are likely to entertain viewers. In many ways this season has set the platform for a second season which will hopefully utilise these tools to deliver an even more enjoyable show.If you are a fantasy lover who is interested in a character driven series with no harem/ecchi antics then you will likely enjoy Faraway Paladin. The only thing worth noting is the animation which is largely subpar.Story 7 – A consistent feature of the plot is its relative slow pacing as it takes it time to provide exposition on either the characters or the general world lore. Any points raised even if seemingly trivial at the time often has future relevance so it pays to keep alert. On the less positive side there is less direction later on and the ending is left open to a second season so don\'t expect a lot of closure.Characters 6.5 – Time is spent fleshing out the main characters so we gain a good understanding of their background and personalities. This also extends to some of the secondary cast adding some depth to the casting. The fact some key players have some ambiguous end goals serves to give you an incentive in watching season two.Animation/music 4 – It leaves a lot to be desired with the character models consistently lacking in detail. This only gets worse in the action scenes where the quality often drops and the CGI used is poor. It won’t win any rewards that is for sure fortunately the opening and ending sequences are better in quality especially the music which was actually pretty good.Overall 7 – A story-driven show that rewards people who follow the small details. Faraway Paladin is more serious in nature so don’t expect a lot of comedy moments or silly harem/ecchi elements.

With some relatively weak dialogue in crucial moments really ruining the chance for a heartfelt scene.  But hey this is not unusual here. But one kind of wishes they could take a few hints on good dialogue from the better shows. *Sigh*overall the show is not bad though. Animation is okay, artstyle is easy on the eyes.

This setup is classic now.Then what make that story different from others?Let\'s summ it up :+ The world building is great, this is well developped and showed. For example, in a fantasy world, there is often higher beings depicted as gods, but rarely fleshed out in isekais (or it is later in stories). Here they are. Another interesting thing is that the...religious aspect is treated in a way that wasn\'t done in any isekai i saw or read (and i\'ve a good number of them on the belt). I won\'t detail to avoid any spoil about what i mean here.+ The main character is not someone with overpowering powers, the dude had for advantage: retaining his consciousness of his previous life, making him quick to learn stuff. That\'s pretty much it, at this point of the story (episode 6), his strength come from his education.+ Powers and battle are very entertaining, the system do not only depends on power or spell strength.+ The story, it\'s not a Mushoku Tensei like contrary to another review said, it\'s completly different (i read the whole novel of Mushoku), the main character start with a very unexpected family in this sort of story. His (first?) big goal is also defined pretty quickly. The similar point between both this stories are the isekai fact. The ""Paladin"" in the title seems to me essential to keep in mind, because the story is about one in becoming (in my opinion).+ Art style and graphism are honest and enjoyable. The animation is also good.+ There is no overuse of fan service (up to epi 6). By fan service i mean, situations made to show some attractive part of woman body very exposed, or that a character (that can be very child like in appearance for example) like the main one for no reason, and so on.All in all, i believe that faraway paladin is a good isekai, in a market inflated with the same cooking recipe, it manage to crawl his own road and assume a adventure without getting himself cramped by things that don\'t help its story. religious aspect is treated in a way that wasn\'t done in any isekai i saw or read (and i\'ve a good number of them on the belt).

Then the writers remember that they need to add something edgy and the story stops making any sort of sense with forced twists and characters overreacting and acting like some sort of emo squad..Even tho the story was somewhat generic, at least i was happy that a lot of the tropes weren't there.. But boy oh boy did they cram all of them into the last two episodes...What describes this show best is that have to try really hard to satisfy the minimum review length on MAL. There is nothing that needs...describing.. describing.."", ""So, let me get straight to the point - Saihate no Paladin was nearly an 8/10 for my during the first arc consisting of the first five episodes. But everything beyond that was very disappointing. I'll go into more detail below.The premise of being raised by three undead caretakers is amazing and what drew me to this show in the first place. Without going into spoiler territory, all I am going to say is that those initial episodes really do live up to the concept’s potential. I really enjoyed the good and the bad, the happy and the sad. Family as a theme really hits...hard here, as do the themes of loss and growing up. The three undead also have appealing visual designs and good voice acting.So, if that initial story was so well executed, why is my rating for the Faraway Paladin so low?Once Will leaves his home, it is as if he steps off a cliff. The quality plummets with that one step. See, Will isn’t that interesting of a character on his own. And the new people he meets aren’t particularly interesting either. His actions and quests immediately devolve into the typical overpowered main character who beats everything easily trope. Which wouldn’t be as much of a problem if Will actually had a personality to go with that power. But he doesn’t. He just does the right thing and advances what passes for a plot, and all of his problems magically work out. There is no wit, no cunning, no real struggle involved. Not to mention that as usual for isekai series, his past life and associated trauma has almost no influence on him in his current life.Let me state it as simply as I can. Everything beyond the fifth episode is a generic power-fantasy isekai with hardly any redeeming qualities.Let’s go over the presentation. The character designs are alright, and like I said before, I especially enjoyed the undead characters’ designs. The animation quality is very low, both for movement and background scenery. The action scenes really could have benefited from a better budget, because I struggle to call the animation there workable.The sound effects are fine and I did notice one or two particularly nice background songs.The worldbuilding, which can be an important part for an isekai or fantasy series, was nothing special. You can tell they did their best with the Greek pantheon rip-off with a twist, and they had a good attempt at a pre-existing world history and magic system. But… it’s nothing memorable. It’s serviceable enough.In the end, I feel conflicted about this series. I’m happy I watched it and I enjoyed myself for the most part, but I feel it could have been so much more. The last third of the series felt extremely rushed, and the naïve main character began grating on my nerves.

Sounds like a typical Isekai doesn’t it? Well, surprisingly enough, Faraway Paladin is not a typical Isekai. For starters, I would go as far as to say that Faraway Paladin is an Isekai in name only. If I hadn’t been told that protagonist William was from Japan I honestly wouldn’t have noticed. His origins do not come up that much. Furthermore, Williams powers are...granted to him for free near the beginning of the series. Instead, it comes from being taught over the course of the first three episodes by his new parents. Furthermore, the plot Is not a power fantasy. True, William is comparatively OP in contrast to many of the people he meets in his journey however the plot treats this somewhat seriously. Not only is the plot devoid of moeblobs and Tsundere’s falling in love with the protagonist left right and centre but his OP nature is actually treated critically- what would such a person be like.  Throughout the two seasons there are moments where Williams OP combat potential becomes a problem- most notably in the finale of season 2 when he encounters an enemy who is vastly more powerful than him. William is presented as powerful- but not the strongest.The plot itself, is not particularly radical as fantasy plots go. In fact the main goal of protagonist William is to deal with the twin threats of the Demons/Undead and a Dragon and to spread the word of his patron Goddess- the surprisingly fashionable, if quiet Gracefeel. This plot-line is not particularly new or different. However the way it’s executed is. Most notably there is a lot of world building that goes into this series and its created and very real world- a world that feels filled with actual people not stereotypes. Several examples impressed me:◦ Religion: The author has clearly gone to some effort to create a realistic feeling polytheistic religion. The Gods play a role in every day life that feels natural. In fact their role, particularly Gracefeel and Stagnate’s role’s feel very ‘greek mythology’. On the subject of which, congratulations on the show for having a mostly accurate Chimera. Chimera's are from Greek mythology and are not a random mix of beasts but specifically a three headed beast with the head of a lion, goat and a snake. Faraway Paladin portrays such a Chimera with a goat, lion and a snake's head. I don't think it had wings.◦ Armour: Faraway Paladin, for once, uses somewhat plausible armour, shields and weapons for its adventurers and the adventures even use proper tactics- for example, when they for a shield wall to protect themselves against a horde of monsters in season one. On a pedantic note, the I was particularly impressed by Williams shield in the later half of season two which is fairly Scutum-Like. Most impressively, they got the grip right! Namely, the shield would have been held by a grip behind the boss, not strapped on to the arm as with some other shield designsOverall, Faraway Paladin is perfect for anyone looking for a break from typical Isekai anime. It features few of the typical Isekai anime characteristics and instead feels much more like an old school fantasy adventure. granted to him for free near the beginning of the series.

This plot-line is not particularly new or different. However the way it’s executed is. Most notably there is a lot of world building that goes into this series and its created and very real world- a world that feels filled with actual people not stereotypes. Several examples impressed me:◦ Religion: The author has clearly gone to some effort to create a realistic feeling polytheistic religion. The Gods play a role in every day life that feels natural. In fact their role, particularly Gracefeel and Stagnate’s role’s feel very ‘greek mythology’. On the subject of which, congratulations on the show for having a mostly accurate Chimera. Chimera's are from Greek mythology and are not a random mix of beasts but specifically a three headed beast with the head of a lion, goat and a snake. Faraway Paladin portrays such a Chimera with a goat, lion and a snake's head. I don't think it had wings.◦ Armour: Faraway Paladin, for once, uses somewhat plausible armour, shields and weapons for its adventurers and the adventures even use proper tactics- for example, when they for a shield wall to protect themselves against a horde of monsters in season one. On a pedantic note, the I was particularly impressed by Williams shield in the later half of season two which is fairly Scutum-Like. Most impressively, they got the grip right! Namely, the shield would have been held by a grip behind the boss, not strapped on to the arm as with some other shield designsOverall, Faraway Paladin is perfect for anyone looking for a break from typical Isekai anime. It features few of the typical Isekai anime characteristics and instead feels much more like an old school fantasy adventure."", 'this anime was huge disappointment for mewhen i first watched the trailer i thought this would be anime of the seasonthe story seemed solid and the animation was goodbut after a few episodes i noticed that they missed on a huge opportunity to make a great anime,the story is not what i expected ,the characters are way too soft even the demons and monsters are not that frighteninganother great story wasted whit a bad adaptationshamei really wanted this anime to be greatthe trailer was promising us a great storybut in the end all we got was soft hearted characters that like to talk more...than to make actions than to make actions', ""I hate long reviews.

They feel somewhat more like DND characters rather than ones written by a middle schooler who did nothing but read isekai growing up.It avoids tropes quite easily though the animation suffers.

Our reincarnated main protagonist William earns his strength and abilities through hard work and a dedication to learning rather than getting given a...cheat ability that lets him gain everything for doing nothing, and the show goes out of it’s way to flesh out his childhood in detail as he is raised by his undead, surrogate family, a ghost wizard called Augustus, a mummy priestess called Mary and a skeleton warrior called Blood.There are no “skills” or “levels” or at the time of watching “ThE hErO” or “tHe DeMoN lOrD” that get in the way of and trivialises it’s pure fantasy world like 99% of all other light novel isekai anime. There is a really cool word based magic system which the show spends a lot of time fleshing out along with setting up the shows overall mystery as to why the world seems so abandoned Breath of the Wild-style except for the three undead and their boy. If you’re a lore nerd like I am then you might enjoy unraveling all the context clues the show gives and piecing together the mystery.Now I made a comparison to Mushuko Tensei earlier, but that’s in it’s fantasy world and vibe only. Unlike Mushuko Tensei and all other light novel isekai there is very little to no weird, perverted content to make your eyes roll (there’s like one scene I can remember that does, but I must stress it’s very, VERY tame compared to some of the other shit you see in isekai) so if you’re someone who doesn’t like ecchi then you are safe here.William is no Rudeus Greyrat too. He has a shy, but child-like curiosity about the new world he’s been dropped into which fuels his desire to learn instead of his masters panties. He can also be a bit of an airhead which can be rather charming when he leaves home and makes new friends who’re baffled by his power, but he’s never a insufferable doormat for the viewer to project themselves onto. I also really enjoyed the dynamic between Augustus, Mary and Blood as they try to raise and pass down their values onto him. The odd family can be very touching to watch.This is a Children’s Playground Entertainment show however and although the animation is miles better than the anime they’ve done there is still a lot to be desired. It’s clear that they actually gave a shit about making this show look good and I do really enjoy the art style, but there are a lot of animation and technical problems which drops the immersion. Some movement and running animations and the CG monsters look very… rushed to put it as nicely. Still it’s not a deal breaker though.‘The Faraway Paladin’ is a nice little antidote to most poisonous rubbish that most light novel fantasy/isekai anime pisses in our faces. It probably won’t cure all ailments and it has a long way to go to crack above the 7/10’s, but for a CPE show it is a good start and I’m looking forward to the next season.7/10 Good. cheat ability that lets him gain everything for doing nothing, and the show goes out of it’s way to flesh out his childhood in detail as he is raised by his undead, surrogate family, a ghost wizard called Augustus, a mummy priestess called Mary and a skeleton warrior called Blood.There are no “skills” or “levels” or at the time of watching “ThE hErO” or “tHe DeMoN lOrD” that get in the way of and trivialises it’s pure fantasy world like 99% of all other light novel isekai anime.

I still would like to see where Will goes from here. A problem I found with the story is that it does not really have an end goal. I get that he wants to spread the goddess of the torch's name, and to banish evil, but that's very vague imo. Is he only fighting demons, is his goal the bad gods, or does he plan to fight evil people too? It...sort of seems like he's just walking randomly and whenever he see's evil, he fights it, which feels purposeless. That is why I gave the story 6/10, because in my opinion it could have been executed better.The art is generally good. The scenes mainly focus on the main characters, and they are well drawn and animated. Even the side characters have individuality and differences, as opposed to just copy and pasting the same model (as they do in overlord lol). The fight scenes are good. It is not on the level of jujutsu kaisen or black clover fights, let alone demon slayer, but it is generally fine. 7/10 for the art.The soundtrack throughout the anime was just there. No soundtrack throughout the whole anime stood out, and the music during the show was just there. It was not good and not bad, it was as plain and inoffensive as can be. I think it could have been a lot better, so I gave it a very mediocre 5/10.Finally the character development is impressive. NOTE THERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS HERE, I WILL PUT SPOILERS BETWEEN *. You see most of the characters grow, for the younger characters they grow both physically and mentally on several occasions, while for the older characters you see the dynamics between them and other characters grow/change. We see Will in several occasions have to make reconciliations with himself, and takes a step forward and grows,* whether from his previous life, his parents death, or his fight with Menel*. In my opinion, the character development is the best aspect of the show. A solid 8/10.In summary I think this show is good, thus my overall 7/10 rating. It gets a bit boring at times, but it is a fast paced story that focuses mainly on the characters and their developments and dynamics, with a somewhat interesting story and world to complement that.

It’s an issekai about a normal guy who dies and becomes a strong guy in a different world. He’s stronger than most people, but not too much stronger than everyone else.What stands about it?NothingIt dips it toes into multiple categories, but doesn’t commit to any, so it becomes this stale, lukewarm show. It tries to be a smart show by having the protagonist think about his moves during battle, but there isn’t a huge focus on this and his moves don’t really combo together, it’s more that he just...uses different moves after others. It tries to be comedic sometimes, but not enough to be a comedy issekai and often the humor doesn’t land. It tries to be serious sometimes with religion and people’s pasts, and this is where imo the show does its best, but ultimately the deeper tones they bring in are rather bland.For example (minor spoiler):There’s a religious leader who, surprise, surprise, doesn’t actually care about religion!!!??? Whaaa!! He actually is in it for the money!!???Now it wasn’t that deep, but if the show continues to do things like that and more complex, then I could see my score rising. But for now, it will remain at a 6.Not bad, but definitely not great. uses different moves after others.

I was completely engrossed with the character Gilbert and I would love to read the manga if I could find it. The story was very interesting - hence my wanting to read the manga - and I love the time period it's set in. I've read plenty of novels set during the same time though usually in other parts of the world. Certain aspects remind me of a few of those novels in particular. It is a bit melodramatic but if you can watch a soap opera without screaming in agony you...should be fine. I thought the romance was beautiful and even the art for it's time. The relationship between Serge and Gilbert was the most interesting to me - especially on Serge's side. I can't really put into words why I liked this one so much. It has to be Gilbert but then I think - no it's Serge. So I can't quite place it.

Like so many short OVAs and series, the KazeKi anime is a compressed version of a small part of a much longer manga series. That said, as someone who has seen this OVA both with no knowledge of the manga and after having ""read"" (in the sense of looking at the pictures, anyway) all of it, I find it a wonderful work to be a wonderful work no matter how familiar you are with it.Kaze to Ki no Uta is an epic boys\' love tragedy oftentimes labeled as the first boy\'s love manga --...this is untrue, although KazeKi\'s mangaka also wrote the real first BL manga, a oneshot called ""In the Sunroom"". It was, however, the first to contain explicit sexual content, including rape, pedophilia, and incest (oftentimes all at once), although all of this is treated with care in the manga and doesn\'t come up all that much in the manga. But historical significance aside, this is the story of one Serge Battour, the kind and talented son of a French viscount and a gypsy prostitute, and one Gilbert Cocteau, a gorgeous boy selling his body for reasons unknown. The anime covers several volume of the manga, starting when Serge and Gilbert become roommates at the elite boarding school Lacombrade Academy and following them as they initially clash and slowly begin to understand each other. Their problems are many -- Serge, due to his mixed-race heritage, is bullied by his classmates; Gilbert\'s promiscuity often gets him into dangerous situations; while Serge intends to make friends with Gilbert, Gilbert refuses... it\'s a story with all the beginnings of an amazing romantic tragedy, and while the anime doesn\'t come close to finishing the story, it\'s a great overview of the full tale.But the biggest draw of Kaze to Ki no Uta is not its significance or plot, but its characters. There\'s a delicious variety of personalities, including not only the leads but the supporting cast. Serge and Gilbert have an amazing dynamic all throughout the story; Serge is absolutely adorable and easy to cheer for from beginning to end, and Gilbert\'s remarkable combination of frigid and manipulative is a powerful contrast. While side characters don\'t have time to get their chances to shine, even their minimally-developed personalities are great fun -- the religious rule-bearer Karl, the playfully rebellious Pascal, the strong-willed and elegant Rosemarine... KazeKi has a very likable supporting cast.While the style of this OVA doesn\'t come close to the beauty of the manga\'s art and atmosphere, it\'s quite a good representation. The music is more or less unobtrusive, but beautiful when one takes the time to listen to it. It\'s a very classic style, full of piano, violin, and the like; elegant and pretty and very much appropriate to the content of the anime. While mangaka Keiko Takemiya\'s soft and elegant art style has been greatly simplified (very much for the worse) in order to be animated, character designs are as a whole faithful to the original. Effeminate boys run rampant and every character, from main to background, is always on-model. The background art is similarly detailed and attractive, using the historic setting to further create a distinct atmosphere.The Kaze to Ki no Uta OVA is a fantastic introduction to an even more fantastic manga; everybody I know that has watched it has gone on to read the manga and become a fan. Even this small bit of the story is intriguing, emotional, and beautiful and downright lovely to watch. While this title may not often catch the eye of anyone except boy\'s love fans looking through the history of the genre, the fact is that not only is Kaze to Ki no Uta -- manga and anime -- one of the greatest boy\'s love titles out there but one of the greatest shoujo titles and tragic manga. Those who can\'t stand their anime to be slow, character-driven, and dramatic should look elsewhere, but for fans of gorgeously painful romances, deep shoujo, and unique and significant anime, Kaze to Ki no Uta is the perfect series.

I'd choose to describe the more sensual scenes as highly palatable and sometimes even intensely beautiful, but if you're unable to handle a story of such nature, then read no further.Basically, this anime uses a prestigious French school as its setting where our protagonist, the virtuous and talented Serge, meets his new room-mate and polar opposite in the manipulative Gilbert who uses his body to gain various favors from other men. Unlike some other anime of the same genre I know of, the...story takes place in a world with enough regard for realism to avoid an ideal depiction of same-sex relationships and instead aims to depict some of the obvious cons; the most prominent one being the lack of consent the ones involved might face in their environments.  Make no mistake though, plenty of scenes are reserved for the sometimes unnerving worship of the male body and intense homoerotic events that I fear might ruin a lot of the appeal for viewers not looking for such things.Furthermore, the characterization stands fairly well for an OVA of merely an hour with reasonable amounts of development and a good foundation for occasional melodrama. Unfortunately, the anime is based on a manga of 17 volumes and lacks the time to include proper explanations for some bizarre plot points revealed later on which causes some confusion. This is not the major issue though as the narrative as a whole eventually ends up in a pit of glorified masochism only to wrap things up in a beautiful, intense and somehow redeeming scene with enough sense to rely on sensuality rather than sexuality.In the end this is a fairly decent watch, with fairly standardized technical merits. The soundtrack is the most impressive part of the OVA, but the animation remains somewhat mediocre despite certain moments of beauty and great character designs. It suffers from the same problems shared by a lot of shounen-ai (it would seem) such as glorifying certain themes like masochism which are made all the more disturbing by the youth of the characters but is undoubtedly very palatable in its depiction. Despite the mediocre score, I was somewhat impressed by this title and will consider giving more titles within the same genre a chance; romanticized adolescent melodrama has its perks as long as it doesn’t drag I guess. story takes place in a world with enough regard for realism to avoid an ideal depiction of same-sex relationships and instead aims to depict some of the obvious cons; the most prominent one being the lack of consent the ones involved might face in their environments.

After being the victim of a few disappointing anime like Koisuru Boukun and Citrus, I was waiting for another disappointment-- after all, most LGBTQ+ representation in anime and manga is notoriously poor as even I can tell, being a straight person myself.However, I was pleasantly surprised. Even for an OVA that's just an hour long, they...manage to encompass a heartwrenching story of two boys in a homophobic climate, one of whom is 'straightlaced' and the other is abused and broken. The writer manages to create realistic plot points that flow and reveal new aspects of the characters while exposing the tragic reality of the boys' lives.While this may be an old work, I have to say that the art is still very beautiful. I can't say that it's realistic or anything of the sort, but it's well-done in a way that surpasses the technological innovations that lead to better animation today. It's just a classic style that takes your breath away every time.The voice actors all did a very good job, especially Gilbert's. The piano pieces Serge played were also very beautiful, and all the other background music was breathtaking. Even with the heavy subject matter and the dread surrounding the premise of the story, the animation and music combined made it seem like a fairy tale, albeit quite the twisted one.I also think the characters were the main highlight of this piece. Without fetishizing sexual assault, the author manages to create a work of art that is Gilbert. He is twisted, broken, pained, and doesn't know what the point of his life is. He's not the nicest person, and the things he does don't always make sense, but they're not supposed to. From what I can tell, he only craves to feel something, and if that something is pain, so be it. He's only human, and I enjoy that about well written characters. As for Serge, he's the honest, rule-following soul that every parent wants-- but when he interacts with 'depravity' and Gilbert's brokenness, we see another aspect of his character that really makes him more three dimensional instead of just being the 'good kid'.All in all, I found this to be very poetic and beautiful out of what I have seen, despite being somewhat of a dark and startling story. Don't be fooled-- this isn't your typical feel-good romance or a yaoi with 'fun' sexual assault that's just supposed to be 'rough and sexy'. This anime is supposed to make you feel disgusted and angry and mad and unsettled. It's just the kind of show it is. It doesn't sugar coat anything-- the homophobia, the bullying, the rape, the pedophilia-- it's all there, and nothing is hidden. And that's what I love about it-- the unapologetic honesty.I would recommend this if you: like honest/gritty shows, like watching anime about real issues, don't mind/can stomach rape/incestyish stuff/pedophilia, would not mind watching a 'gay' anime, would like a realistic representation of gay people instead of the classic heteronormative yaoi, like 1800's AUs, like the idea of children 'falling in love'I would NOT recommend this if you: do not want to watch a 'gay' anime, like sugarcoated things, can't stand violence/depravity, don't understand/don't want to understand masochism/sadism, can't stomach rape/pedophiliaHave a great day everyone! manage to encompass a heartwrenching story of two boys in a homophobic climate, one of whom is 'straightlaced' and the other is abused and broken.

I havent read the manga , but the essense of the story in the anime is simply brilliant.Story of human love and pain.Human cruelty and fear.It should be in the collection of everyone who values anime as art.10/10 ', ""An uninspiring early BL OVA that takes the idea of bishounen to the extreme.PLOT: This is a very early shounen-ai OVA based on a long running 1970s manga series of the same name. As such the OVA is really only geared towards those who have read the manga and have an understanding of the characters motivations and relationships. The copy I watched had a preface that gave a basic overview of the setting and main characters, but even this didn’t really help me much when actually watching the OVA. The pace is extremely slow going too, everything is understated and slow to unravel – it’s...hard to stay interested. There also seems to be large gaps in the storyline which I assume are covered in the manga – as a result the developing relationship between Serge and Gilbert didn’t really feel realistic to me; I just didn’t get why Serge suddenly cared so much about Gilbert.Now this is a shounen-ai OVA and there is nudity and sexual overtones, but its not blatant and is done tastefully as it's a major part of the plot – but do not watch this if you are squicky about BL.ANIMATION: The animation is very dated as this OVA dates to 1987 and is based on a 1970s manga. I found the character designs extremely unappealing as lots of the boys just look like girls (especially Gilbert) and there really isn’t a lot of detail to them or a lot of facial expression. The colours are muted and predominately on the yellow/brown side of the spectrum which just makes everything all the more dull. The backgrounds are nicely done though – they look like watercolour paintings and the set designs are very true to the time period depicted (1800s).MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: The score is excellent. Lots of classical piano and harpsichord pieces, which are very in keeping with the time period. I can’t really remember much of the voice acting though, don’t think it was anything spectacular.Overall Song of Wind and Trees makes for slow paced, melancholic viewing – I’m sure that fans of the manga must have enjoyed it, but without that background this OVA came across as dull with muddled storytelling and much of the subtle nuances and symbolic motifs in the animation where completely lost on me I’m afraid. hard to stay interested.

The reason I was hesitant about bothering with it was because the characters are more than a little bit androgynic and I usually don\'t like that, plus it came off as this really glittery and over-beautiful, romantic anime-cliché story ( save the fact it was about a boy and a boy, rather than a boy and a girl ). Well, the funny thing is that it kinda was all of those things I said but it was wonderful. Reminded me that anime doesn\'t always need to be comedic to entertain me....As soon as I started watching, I was almost immediately entranced by the skillful and detailed animation and drawings ( remember that this is old anime ). Classical music playing on the background suited the feeling really well. Usually, when I watch something alone, I constantly mumble out some remarks about what\'s happening ( ie. with Weiss Kreuz, every five minutes, I said ""angst"" ), but this kept my mouth pretty well shut, even while some stuff did strike me a bit lame. The story moves on quickly but at the same time, kinda slowly... erm... hard to explain. The story ""stopped"" at just the right moments to create a feeling and then moved forward just the right time so that it didn\'t become boring. Like the parts where the main character is playing a piano... it was very wonderful to watch and I really raise my cap to the animators for actually making it look like the character was playing that song he was playing and not moving his fingers around the keys randomly.Sure, I could find plenty of things to pick on about the anime but the general feeling in it was so good that little stuff like that is kinda unimportant.Only bigger thing that bothered me - which is also the reason I would rather talk about this as an animated poem rather than a story - was the fact that the ending was unclear and sudden. I would\'ve liked some kind of epilogue. What happened to Gilbert? It left me perplexed but still the general feeling is good. Of course, this is based on a manga ( which, I believe was based on a novel ) and I supposed the anime kinda relies on the thought that those who see it, have read the manga.Rather than reading the manga, I\'d love to get my hands on the original novel. As soon as I started watching, I was almost immediately entranced by the skillful and detailed animation and drawings ( remember that this is old anime ). Classical music playing on the background suited the feeling really well. Usually, when I watch something alone, I constantly mumble out some remarks about what\'s happening ( ie. with Weiss Kreuz, every five minutes, I said ""angst"" ), but this kept my mouth pretty well shut, even while some stuff did strike me a bit lame.

As a BL fan that usually tries to stay away from the more sexually explicit  scenes, it's not bad at all.The plot flowed nicely.  Easily understood.  It went through a more poetic like theme to the entire story.  But the story was boys sharing the same room in a dormitory and developing a love-hate relationship.  Kind of cliche for BL though.One complaint, I have is more of a personal taste issue...I just don't like the art.  It was bothering me the entire movie.  I never had a taste for...the...like any pre-00s art style, over beautifying eyes on characters/guys...just not my taste.  (And what was with Rosemarine's eyes?!!?!...creepy)I would say the voice actors did pretty well to portray each part of the story.  I was questioning the feminine voice choices though, but I guess, considering when this was in production...To be completely honest, I wouldn't rewatch it.  It's not poorly done that's for sure.  A decent BL film with palatable sexual scenes that don't go over the top...decent plot...poetic theme...good flow through out. the...like any pre-00s art style, over beautifying eyes on characters/guys...just not my taste.

Like, I’m not really sure what they wanted to tell us, but I guess they wanted to focus on how the relationship between Serge and Gilbert developed, but they way they ended it seems like they just ‚got together in the end‘ when in reality, this is like 1/4 of the story. Again, I know it’s too short for the whole story. Maybe it was indeed more like a trailer for the Manga?It’s just strange to me that they put in a single shot as a hint of how the story in the Manga is gonna end, but if you didn’t read it, it’s just really confusing. They hint at the weird relationship with Auguste, they hint at the end, at sorrows in the future, then ends.My point is: as a stand-alone anime, I’d be like…what. It’s hard for me to understand the thoughts of people who have only seen this OVA (I don’t mean this in a offensive way at all, I’m saying I can’t forget the Manga while watching this so it’s harder to judge this on its own) I really hope more people will read the Manga after seeing this.The animation itself was fine (not everyone likes older Anime, I personally like it a lot) and as true to the Manga as it could get, I think. The backgrounds and buildings were especially beautiful. The music itself I also liked, except that I personally expected something more melancholic (especially for Gilbert) but fine.All in all, it’s a ‚trailer‘, in my opinion, or bonus material for fans of the Manga.Thank you for your time.

I\'m guilty as well since I\'ve come to realize that rather late in my life. I\'ve mentioned that because one of the few things that struck me in this OVA is how the still backgrounds were handled, the ephemeral and almost vapory forms and darkly enveloping spaces of 18th century European aesthetics, especially the furniture and architecture, even the hair and eyes of some characters, there\'s a certain feeling...and curvature you won\'t see anywhere else, and it\'s something peculiar to the Japanese, their lens of European culture is so different, dare I say they reinvent the spirit of that culture.That\'s mainly the reason why I watched this, but also there\'s the poetic sexual violence.

Kimi to Boku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20505/Kimi_to_Boku,"[""Kimi to Boku is a flash animation created in early 2001 that has since been lost to the sands of time after being overshadowed by Makoto Shinkai's Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko, an eerily similar animation project released just a year later. It's very clear that Shinkai drew a great deal of inspiration from Kimi to Boku, from the idea to the narrative and even the art style, dialogue and overall portrayal. Hence, Kimi to Boku is the predecessor to Shinkai's work, and it might be worth it alone just to learn about the animation that inspired Shinkai.However, Kimi to Boku also excels in...ways that Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko doesn't, delving deeper into its subject matter and forming a more cohesive, complete story with every loose end tied up. By the same token, the dialogue quickly wore repetitive, and the animation started to drag on as it neared its end, but because of that sacrifice, the narrative is multi-faceted and deeper in ways that Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko isn't, speaking more intimately to the viewer's heart. That said, four precious minutes are spent on expositing the tale of Orihime and Hikoboshi that only parallel very loosely with the narrative by the end, which ultimately detracts from the narrative and possibly sending the viewer to sleep. It isn't difficult to imagine this actually happening, either, as the music pieces that are constantly overlayed on the animation are slow and soothing tunes, though it's nothing very special.If you've ever owned a cat, this story will most definitely resonate with you, though some narrative and character elements may seem foreign.

King of Prism: Pride the Hero,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34032/King_of_Prism__Pride_the_Hero,"['If u thought that the first movie was great, you\'re in for a real fuckin ride with this bad boy. My review for the first movie was serious but I honestly couldn\'t take this movie seriously even if I tried so here we go.I watched KingPri: Pride the Hero for the first time at about 1 am. I would have thought the whole thing was some sort of weird lucid dream I had if it weren\'t for some of the notes I took.Here are some of those notes just so u can get a feel for what I thought while I was watching this shitpost...of a movie:""Energy orbs from abs???""""I\'m pretty sure I just saw a panty flash""""AOI SHOUTA WHIPPED OUT A STRIPPER POLE!?! where the fuck did that come from???""""Why is taiga doing pull ups on a 40ft tree?""""These communal bath scenes have literally no purpose other than fanservice. Not that that\'s a bad thing""""Is there some sort of PR religion/cult??? why is June a nun??""""Battle mode outfits look kinky AF""""their catchphrase is \'ready sparkling\' but it sounds like they are saying \'ready spanking\'""And there\'s still moreStoryAssuming you\'ve watched the first movie and PR rainbow live, we finally get to see the fricking KingPri Cup and see who really is the King of Prism (you\'re probably able to tell from the title who wins if u know what\'s up). While this movie does tie up a lot of loose ends from the other movie, it leaves me with more questions than answers. It doesn\'t give enough attention to Louis and Shin\'s weird relationship, Louis\' backstory, and hiro\'s struggle through losing pride and his other scandals. The producers really tried to pull off more than they could handle in an hour.The entire movie has no concept of subtle storytelling. Every character and every action is really fucking exaggerated. It goes as far as having the main villain act like a maniac, have some sort of weird dictator outfit, and have him literally whipping his students to show that he is evil. A dude literally spits on Hiro just to show that Hiro isn\'t well liked.It also kinda just ends on a high note right after the tournament ends. A lot of the other characters feel underdeveloped and had very little screentime so they just are kinda there. They honestly could\'ve made the movie without 95% of the new cast and it\'d be better( they probably only put them in because of the upcoming anime).Overall, it\'s interesting but the way they tell it is forced, lacks maturity, and rushed. The surplus of characters makes it confusing.ArtIt\'s all sparkles and bright colors with ok animation. The CG animation is actually fantastic for the live shows and they put a lot of detail in it. However, because of how detailed and almost out of context they make the live show\'s art and animation, it seems like a surreal shitpost. The outfits for the show are hilarious because it\'s either ""generic idol boi outfit"" or ""do u work at a strip club???"". Also,,, the main villain dude\'s facial expressions are hilariously exaggerated and remind me of what you would see in Kakegurui. During the live shows, every character becomes or already is half naked. All the boys are cute except for maybe one or two depending on what your tastes are.SoundI actually, unironically like some of the songs. Other ones gave me a pretty good laugh because it was cringey. All the idol characters are supposed to be around the same age but some of them sound like a chipmunk while others sound 30 but I didn\'t really mind it. At one point during a live show, I distinctly remember that Louis made this weird orgasming sound so yea that\'s a thingCharacterBOI there are a lot of them. It\'s the same cast from the first movie but I still don\'t remember any of the new(as in not in PR Rainbow live) character\'s names other than Shin, Louis, and Alex. Even then, I only remember Shin and Louis because they were kinda the main characters and Alex because his actions and outfits are so fucking extreme it\'s hilarious.EnjoymentWhile I really do love this movie, it\'s only mostly ironically. The other small part of me likes it because it has the PR Rainbow Live boys in it and it was nice seeing them since I like Rainbow Live so much. I also really liked that they used references to past PR series and the girls from Rainbow Live. I knew I was in for a hell of a ride right from the opening where all the main characters were naked and had their junk blacked out to censor it.OverallIf u liked the first movie, you\'ll like this one even more.

Especially how fabulous King of Prism is.This movie is just a mix of crazy, ridiculous, gay, and shining epicness. Yes. It is like a mix of JJBA\'s crazyness and Naruto x Sasuke\'s gayness.The story itself isn\'t super good. It\'s rushed, lukewarm (as Ito says) and might be dull if you didn\'t watch Pretty Rhythm Rainbow Live. But actually, it is deeper than just ""guys dancing on ice"". Just like Rainbow Live, King of Prism story\'s is more complicated than it seems. It\'s talking about friendship, rivalry, duty, family issues, medias,... They just couldn\'t develop...everything in the movie (maybe the couldn\'t afford a longer one), so they just put the most important elements. It\'s really subtle, so you have to rewatch the movie a few times before knowing everything.But isn\'t that great ? You discover the movie everytime you watch it again. Another great point.The characters can be an unappealing point too. We have 7 main characters from Edel Rose that we don\'t really know. They\'re just archetypes here to please everyone. All those names must be complicated. And here, I just talked about the \'main 7\'. There are more characters actually. Some of them were from Rainbow Live so I know their story, it\'s surely confusing for a new watcher.I also understand how the yaoi fanservice shit isn\'t appealing. I don\'t like this either, it makes me super uncomfortable usually, but HERE. It\'s just so ridiculous.Like HOW is it possible not to laugh when you see two half-naked men fighting eachother, knowing one is FIGHTING WITH HIS ABS.Alec was litteraly bombarding the crowd with his abs and created a tornado just by dancing.Louis was embracing the whole planet.Hiro became all dictator and played billard with the solar system.Kazuki was surfing with a sword coming from the sky.Prism Shows are just perfect. It makes me forget any negative point of the show. The 3DCG is fantastic, it\'s one of the best I\'ve ever seen, I think. I love the music even though the lyrics don\'t mean anything.I think if you take time, you\'ll see how funny King of Prism is. And maybe after that, you\'ll finally see the light.

"", ""When I first saw that these episodes were only 6-7 minutes long I didn't think they could accurately capture a couple and anything they went through.  Boy was I wrong!So there are 6 episodes with 3 couples, which means each couple has 2 episodes.  Each story was simplistic yet was able to give you a picture into each relationship.  I really enjoyed each story as each was different and offered insight into different issues that can arise from being a couple or becoming a couple.  I liked each character as their role meant something they didn't just play a meaningless...part.  They all complimented each other instead of making it awkward or weird even if it was about a break up or a fight.I was surprised that there weren't more reviews on this. I really think if you are looking for an anime that can give you emotion in a short amount of time than look no further.  I enjoyed it and there were moments that were cute, sad, and fun.

The characters are drawn in a soft style that really suits the mood. But, the thing I liked most about the art are the locations.

In one of them the character development is better than the other, but overall the characters are likeable and add value to the story.Enjoyment - 9/10Even though the episodes are only seven minutes, I felt like I enjoyed myself a lot. Maybe because the episodes are only seven minutes, there is not enough time to add comedy sketches or lead the story astray. It is straight to the point, and even though this is uncommon in the romance genre, it works.Overall - 8/10This is more than just your regular short show. In those few minutes this show lasts, it will keep you hooked to the story and give you a happy feeling afterwards.

I mean—fuck me backwards—some would say I was never intellectually capable of critically analyzing anything. “Thank god you quit reviewing, your reviews were borderline headache...inducing and a blight on any anime review section. You act like this is a full time job and it\'s sad, go outside. It\'s okay you can maybe review the sky or the grass instead of anime :)” So now? All bets are fucking off. Even reading through my own past reviews is difficult, with me subtly slurring my words and tripping over my tongue. I’m literally, not-a-joke fucking dying. This isn’t even mentioning how my short term memory nowadays is completely zero. I still remember my life, and I remember who I am, and why I am who I am. I remember things and the world. But as far as events that happened recently, or what I said recently, or anything recently? That is all fucking dead, zero, nothing. Tiny little minutes will pass where, blink, I’ll just forget everything and all thoughts will have permanently evacuated my fucking skull. Randomly, in the middle of the day. Most of my reviews are drafted, written, and edited weeks—even months in advance, but I watched all twenty four episodes of SAC_2045 in the last two days and wrote this review in the exact same time frame…hopefully, at least, it isn’t as bad as I think it is. I suppose you, my sweetheart reader, will be the ultimate judge, jury, and executioner on this trail. [laughs nervously] Please just try to be lenient. I’m SO sad and lonely. Hug me, please; don’t hate me. Squeeze hard. I’m small and thin and fragile, but I promise you won’t break me. So squeeze, like you mean it. I’m ready.So…the sequel no one wanted to the series no one asked for. What an enviable position to be in? I’m speaking as if there are separate seasons of this and not just one, twenty-four episode show that Netflix cut in half and budgeted separately, but whatever. Point is, we’re back, and the curtains have closed properly. At the end of the day, I would say SAC_2045 was essentially consistent. In my review for season one, I think I remembered ending with the CG talk, but, this time, I think I’m going to start with it. Most people seem to be approaching it from the perspective of, “Oh, wtf lol. This is shit. These faggots are incompetent.”  But they unfortunately aren’t. They’re some of the best in the industry. This look? This was intentional. It may not look good to you (or fucking me), but THIS is what they were aiming for. So please realize that. This wasn’t a technical failure. It was an audience failure. They didn’t fail to animate what they set out to animate; rather, they failed to look at their audience and agree on what the end goal and end product should’ve been. Berserk 2016 was a failure; Ex-Arm was a failure; Hand Shakers was a failure; all the other CG trainwrecks you’re thinking of were failures. This was not a failure; this was a miscalculation. I mean, if we’re at the point now where Scott Matthew is coming back and participating in Ghost in the Shell productions, who are we to continue crying that this project was an unnecessary bastardization of anything? This is all original creative staff, with the original cast, and everyone’s original spark. The balance is just slightly trifled with by the sometimes excessive Shinji Aramaki visual action. So, Max, you’re right. Atsuko Tanaka’s performance as the Major really was commanding enough to overcome Ilya Kuvshinov’s sex doll female character designs. It’s not that our cyberbrains are infected with the nostalgia virus. It’s that we’re simply watching a well-written, well-acted show, and no amount of “muh CG” is going to change that, especially when the CG’s shortcomings are exclusively stylistic.The visual post-processing in the second half is much more shiny and the definition on the models is much more, for lack of a better term, “bright” and defined, and the colors are infinitely superior, but the actual animation techniques and the energy which results on screen is identical to the first. Whether you like the designs they use or not, Sola Digital Arts has perfected their mocap animation style. Every step of every character looks technically flawless. The mocap approach to animation results in natural, weighty, anatomical movement, and after taking into account whatever engine they use to render the shadow placements and whatever program they use to apply so much body definition, you’re left with the perfect CG anime, assuming we’re still talking exclusively about anime that we want to “look like anime” (think GANTZ:O). Again, I don’t think I’ll ever truly welcome the change entirely, especially in the first half which wasn’t nearly as polished as the second [insert Ilya Kuvshinov’s self-insert backflipping naked up the stairs], but I suppose I’m just trying to be as objective as possible here. There’s this one retrohead who writes pretty good reviews about retrohead anime, but he tried writing one for Hathaway’s Flash, and it just came across as completely out of touch. According to MAL guidelines, you cannot comment on other people’s reviews, so I can’t tell you the user’s name or link the review itself without putting this review in jeopardy, but his argument was essentially, “As we all know, old thing good, new thing bad. And this new thing doesn’t resemble old thing enough, so it’s bad.” The only tangible complaint in the whole review was the movie looked too modern, as if that wasn’t only a bad thing according to his personal opinion. I think I’m just scared of coming across like that, especially when it was far from SAC_2045’s CG which turned me off to its visual presentation. I mean, “Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex” doesn’t exactly jump to mind when I see a wacky waifu with pink hair exclaiming, “EEEEEHHHHHHHH?!!?!?!”However, speaking of the nostalgia virus and what I personally see as being tonally appropriate to include within a season of Stand Alone Complex, I must say that when I see a Tachikoma laying in pieces on the ground, expressing its excitement to finally see Togusa again, with Sakiko Tamagawa’s ever-adorable voice, and I feel something, is that all nostalgia, or is it that these are still engaging and endearing characters? Does it matter? I, personally, am increasingly doubtful it does, because these twenty four episodes—comparisons to anything aside for a moment—are really fucking well written. When I’m watching an episode about Japanese pensioners robbing a bank, because they don’t understand anything about how the financial system has evolved and how it’s not terribly possible to really even quote-unquote “rob” a so-called “bank” anymore, and they’re doing so because 1) two of them had their retirement funds lost to a global banking default that they don’t understand 2) because one of them was an employee at said bank who was trying to get revenge against his much younger manager, who manipulated him into putting up his pension as seed money for crypto investments, only for it to all be lost to the markets, and 3) because one of them came to the bank to withdraw all her savings, fly to a country like Switzerland where euthanasia is legal, and literally pay to die, only to learn that all her savings were in an outdated currency which, when converted to current yen-dollar bills, wasn’t enough to enact her plans, I don’t sit back and think, “This episode is nothing but an imitation of my precious Koukaku Kidoutai! Look at that CG! Fucking GAY LMAO!” I think, “Wow, Kenji Kamiyama has done it again.” His ability to get so technical yet keep it so grounded is astonishing. That, combined with Shotaro Suga’s character writing and Masayuki Yoshihara’s visual direction, is what made Stand Alone Complex the masterpiece it was. However, as I described at great length in my review for part one, SAC_2045 is sorely missing two of those three factors.Half the episodes in each season of Stand Alone Complex were “complex,” which is to say, they were connected to the main overarching narrative, and the rest were “standalone,” yet at no point was the series repetitive or dry of ideas. It was always fresh, innovative, and thought-provoking. It was also never dry of imagination or emotion. It was always surprising, dazzling, and emotive. This entire twenty-four episode series, however, has I think two truly stand alone episodes to flesh-out the updated world, and, while those two were admittedly fantastic, the fact remains that much of the runtime is devoted to action scenes and prolonging physical conflicts without actually using any of this time to deepen the ideas, merely to have fun realizing the visual action potential they’ve made for themselves. This is fine, I suppose. I mean, it isn’t like it’s plagued with particularly poor execution, especially throughout the second half, but this was never the original appeal of Stand Alone Complex. Stand Alone Complex had action, and those action set pieces remain fucking brilliantly stunning to this day, but there were never long stretches of episodes which were JUST action scenes. SAC_2045, on the other hand, can sometimes be JUST an action scene, followed by someone explaining something with enigmatic technobabble, then another cliffhanger action scene leading into the following episode, which then begins with the previous cliffhanger and subsequent continuation of the very same action scene you just saw. I hate contributing to the “muh Netflix” shit-flinging which we love so much around here, but I must also admit that the Netflix model really didn’t help out here, because Netflix autoskipping the ED and not giving you that breathing room between episode breaks really highlighted how the series was just going from meaningless cliffhanger to meaningless cliffhanger when it was focusing more on action, less on…well, what all this was actually supposed to be about. Luckily these fucking roaches didn’t autoskip the OP, or I’d be pissed.Wait…hold on. That was supposed to be the positive paragraph. How’d I fuck that up so much? Okay, so I was talking about how this show feels like OG SAC in how smartly written it is, and then I got sidetracked with bitching about how the emotional genius of Shotaro Suga and the directorial genius of Masayuki Yoshihara on the original “Kamiyama Team” was replaced by Shinji Arakami’s CG action overload, and how that ultimately ruined SAC_2045…which it did. Wait…okay, I guess we’re not going to have a positive paragraph then, because yes. That’s the problem. Kamiyama’s ideas are never constrained or balanced by his old coworkers who kept his genius creativity in check, and this is made worse by Aramaki exacerbating his love for physical, technical concepts expanding outward into these super-cyber-techno-whatever action spectacles. The old Stand Alone Complex always had, one might say, a point. It was always grounded within the boundaries of the technology, without ever diving into anything like spirituality. The Oshii films did, but that’s because their overall message and themes were profound enough to warrant such moments, and their particular directorial atmosphere was so compelling and different than the technical and “simply realistic” presentation of Stand Alone Complex. In SAC_2045 (and fucking Ubukata’s Arise series, now that I think about it), the technology is no longer the limit. Indeed, someone much funnier than I may refer to it as the “limit break.” I’m just bitching about the ending everyone’s already bitched about at this point, so, before this gets away from me, let me assure you, all SAC_2045 really has to dissuade heavy praise is CG, excessive action, and an ending that made episodes one through twenty-two feel like The Matrix (1999), episode twenty-three feel like The Matrix Reloaded (2003), and episode twenty-four feel like The Matrix Revolutions (2003). The rest is a technically and narratively ambitious comeback by the original creator himself, who made I think the best thing he still could’ve.The metaphors simply got out of hand. References are one thing, but when I’m at the point where the show I’m watching is so obsessed with codifying all its concepts so strictly in line with George Orwell’s 1984 that I have to pause the episode, stand up, walk into the other room, get 1984 off the shelf, and start flipping through it again, then I think the writer has bitten off a little more than they could chew. In Innocence, for example, characters practically spoke to each other in quotes. Batou has two conversations, one with Togusa and one with Chief Aramaki, where literally the entire back and forth is conducted via quotes. But these quotes were not simply references to larger works which the film required you to intimately comprehend. Rather, they were quotes that were themselves self-contained parables, or allegories, or whatever. They could say it, and you, a thinking adult, could say, “Okay, well, the source escapes me on that one, but I still get the point he made, because I’m literate and can understand words.” I wrote MULTIPLE papers on Orwell’s work in college, and I’ve read 1984 specifically at least five times, yet even I have to sit here and think, “Wait…how is the Miniluv (Ministry of Love) giving you the Room 101 (phycological torture chamber for political dissidents) going to further your goals, when you yourselves use the Thinkpol (Thought Police) to enact justice already and start Sustainable Wars? Sustainable Wars are just societies where the ruling class has allowed for inequality to grow to the point of social collapse, so they can profit off the ensuing riots and violence fueled by weapons they manufacture. Is this sort of chaos not the exact opposite of the regimented Stalinist nightmare depicted in 1984? Is this partisan split within society not the exact thing Big Brother and the Thought Police would want to suppress? Where radicals run around with AK-47s, screaming about who’s N and N-Po, and railing against the one percent???” We’re so many allegories deep by the end of the series, I honestly forgot the original point being made, if there ever was one.At some point during the first few episodes of the show, we get this exchange between Chief Aramaki and this American official who he knows to try and use her as a connection to get some leverage on the mission Section 9 had gotten itself wrapped up in, and at the end of the exchange she looks at him longingly and says, “I envy this woman you need so badly.” I was just like, “I’m sorry, WHAT?! Who was that?! What’s their history together?!??! Give me that sweet, juicy gossip!!!” But, looking back, that’s how Stand Alone Complex always was. Stand Alone Complex, Guardian of the Sacred Spirit, Eden of the East, etc. They featured humans, more than they did characters. SAC_2045 proceeded after that exchange to shower me with blissful character moments and dialogues which perfectly recaptured the chemistry of Section 9 as it always had been. Meanwhile, all these plot-relevant ideas for the main narrative build and hint in the background, and as the characters became interested and invested, so did you, because that’s what good stories do to you, and this continued until the final few episodes revealed them all to have been one giant nothing burger that was a complete waste of the minds and technical talent which brought it to screen. It’s not that it’s bad or particularly nonsensical. It’s just unsatisfying and, emotionally, predictable. Max, I see what you mean when you call it a “character assassination,” but the final episode’s script was so fucking bewildering that I can\'t really examine Motoko\'s decisions as if I was actually watching the well-established character, ""Motoko Kusanagi."" It’s not that she’s okay with the entire world living in a simulation, because they aren’t. When you typed, “Doublethink, N, and Shimamura’s grand plan are utterly lost on me. (On second thought, they\'re all just synonymous with each other, aren\'t they?)” I just giggled, said, “yes, they are,” and swiftly continued reading. There was no pot of gold you failed to appreciate at the end of this rainbow. It was just, “Oh, ghost hack. That didn’t really happen. Understandable, have a great day.”Thank you for reading. inducing and a blight on any anime review section. You act like this is a full time job and it\'s sad, go outside. It\'s okay you can maybe review the sky or the grass instead of anime :)” So now? All bets are fucking off.

There was no pot of gold you failed to appreciate at the end of this rainbow. It was just, “Oh, ghost hack. That didn’t really happen. Understandable, have a great day.”Thank you for reading.', ""In my initial review of the first twelve episodes of this season, I lamented over how so many franchises were being brought back tailored for new audiences that completely miss the point of the original show. At the time, I didn’t think I’d ever see a legacy franchise successfully resurrected with the way entertainment is being handled lately.But then Top Gun: Maverick came out. So, it is possible. With the right writing. Any idea can work with good writing, really. But the people who did this show? I wouldn't trust them to do a nursery rhyme.As before, I will limit myself to five points. Spoilers...ahead.Use what worked before. That’s fine. But don’t depend on it. The first season dealt with someone who took a book too seriously. The second season dealt with a dude who attempted to get his hands on a nuclear weapon to get his point across. Let’s use them again! The new idea is post-humans, which had the potential to be interesting on its own, but they just go ahead and do what the Laughing Man and Kuze did because nobody will notice. Leaning too heavily on what worked before is a subtle way of your plot not being strong enough to stand on its own.It had previously been my understanding that the members of Section 9 were the best of the best, mainly by their own merit. And then Batou admits to an AI helping all of them aim. Great. This is as bad as the Major downloading how to box. Our heroine and her heroes are not the best of the best. They have the right bodies to handle enhancements that make them superhuman.Saito’s augmentation makes sense. He had to have his eye ruined before he was able to use his little gizmo. A sacrifice was necessary. That’s compelling and adds to his character. Well, now we can all be Saito! And we don’t have to have the Major poke our eye out! Just so long as we have the right prosthetic body.Why should I care about characters whose talents are not unique? I guess all one must do to be special here is download a Wikipedia article and find an AI to fill in the blanks. How does one get to be a member of Section 9? I mean, they let Purin in. It can’t be that hard to join them.Accepting the finality of death demonstrates a mature perspective of life. Of all characters, I would have been willing to bet the Major would understand this. But she is not interested in the ethical implications of her decision, despite how philosophical she can otherwise be. They needed Purin’s brain. Because nobody else in Section 9 is talented enough to hack the Pentagon. Uh-huh. Here’s a thought. Did the writers really have to kill Purin in the first place? Evidently, because they wanted to use this trope, and they made the Major look like an absolute idiot while doing so.Having said that, it will come as no shock that I found the ending to be on par with how Neon Genesis Evangelion concluded. Rebuild included. Everyone’s consciousness is in “heaven” because the world is in the throes of nuclear war. The Major is given the chance to pull the plug, but relents. Yet she can’t live in a fantasy world, so she decides to retreat into the net. To essentially live in a fantasy world.Yet it is not all negative. As before, I applaud the dub. Everybody did fantastic. I got mad respect for Cherami Leigh's portrayal of Purin. This is one of the few shows I prefer to watch in English, but the dub was not ready at the time this first came out due to the pandemic. I wasn't enthused enough to watch the first twelve episodes a second time despite how much I like the English voice cast for this show, so I missed Leigh's performance. Until this season. As much as I do not like Mary Sue---oh, excuse me. Purin! As much as I do not like Purin, Leigh made her tolerable.Where do they go from here? It would take a miracle to come back from this. Oh, wait! A Rebuild. That’s right, it would take a Rebuild to come back from this. Maybe when they get to 2045 a second time around 2055, they’ll get it right. But I doubt it. ahead.Use what worked before. That’s fine. But don’t depend on it. The first season dealt with someone who took a book too seriously. The second season dealt with a dude who attempted to get his hands on a nuclear weapon to get his point across. Let’s use them again! The new idea is post-humans, which had the potential to be interesting on its own, but they just go ahead and do what the Laughing Man and Kuze did because nobody will notice. Leaning too heavily on what worked before is a subtle way of your plot not being strong enough to stand on its own.It had previously been my understanding that the members of Section 9 were the best of the best, mainly by their own merit. And then Batou admits to an AI helping all of them aim. Great. This is as bad as the Major downloading how to box. Our heroine and her heroes are not the best of the best. They have the right bodies to handle enhancements that make them superhuman.Saito’s augmentation makes sense. He had to have his eye ruined before he was able to use his little gizmo. A sacrifice was necessary. That’s compelling and adds to his character. Well, now we can all be Saito! And we don’t have to have the Major poke our eye out! Just so long as we have the right prosthetic body.Why should I care about characters whose talents are not unique? I guess all one must do to be special here is download a Wikipedia article and find an AI to fill in the blanks. How does one get to be a member of Section 9? I mean, they let Purin in. It can’t be that hard to join them.Accepting the finality of death demonstrates a mature perspective of life. Of all characters, I would have been willing to bet the Major would understand this. But she is not interested in the ethical implications of her decision, despite how philosophical she can otherwise be. They needed Purin’s brain. Because nobody else in Section 9 is talented enough to hack the Pentagon. Uh-huh. Here’s a thought. Did the writers really have to kill Purin in the first place? Evidently, because they wanted to use this trope, and they made the Major look like an absolute idiot while doing so.Having said that, it will come as no shock that I found the ending to be on par with how Neon Genesis Evangelion concluded. Rebuild included. Everyone’s consciousness is in “heaven” because the world is in the throes of nuclear war. The Major is given the chance to pull the plug, but relents.

But I doubt it."", 'As a huge fan of Stand Alone Complex, and GITS in general, I find myself to be very, very, very, very, very, very, very conflicted over this season, and understandably so, as this iteration of GITS came the closest to reimagining the genius of Kamiyama Kenji\'s first outing with the franchise, but, as you\'ll soon find out, somehow managed to crash and burn gloriously in the final lap and right before the finish line. I have a lot of scattered, disjointed and eager thoughts I feel I need to dispel, but I don’t really know how to organise them into anything resembling a legitimate review...of this show, so, this write-up will be mostly stream of consciousness. With specific regards to any mention of the visuals, this ""review"" will, more or less, cover both seasons, as they are ostensibly the exact same. And do be wary. I’m going to drop random spoilers whenever I feel like it.In hindsight, I probably should have rewatched season 1, despite 2020, and the release of said season, only feeling like it happened a couple of months ago. But, I guess it’s been long enough that upon starting up episode 1, I had initially completely forgotten all this series’ specific jargon. No matter though, because unlike the original Stand Alone Complex, this series isn’t too reliant on it, plus I have google on my side. And it’s only now dawning on me that this exact reason is probably why the compilation movie exists, but, well, I wanted my fix of GITS, so I guess you could say I got what I wanted.Nevertheless, I can safely say that, for most of its run, I enjoyed what this season, and SAC_2045 as a whole, had to offer. It almost felt like a well-needed return to form, but at the same time, something new altogether. However, despite that, the show still finds itself with a fair share of issues, some more glaring than others. So, I’ll get one of the most contentious aspects of this show out the way first: the character designs. I think Ilya’s art is nice enough to look at in isolation; I can very much appreciate that. But, for whatever reason, I find his designs have always had this air of pretentiousness to them, which is especially true for these redesigns, particularly the female ones. See, unlike their Arise counterparts, the Section 9 of SAC_2045 sounds, acts and emotes like their usual, badass, slick \'n cool selves, however, due to Ilya\'s radically different take on the cast, and the new 3DCG look, there\'s this insufferable dissonance going on between the writing and the visuals, and that goes double for the Major. Thankfully, the woman is so astoundingly charismatic, that at times, I\'m tricked into thinking Ilya\'s redesign doesn\'t suck. So, even though she looks like a—as SingleH so flatteringly puts it—sex doll, she continues to, without falter, command attention with her mere presence every time she graces the screen, which I think is a testament to how powerful Atsuko Tanaka’s performance is, despite how unauthorative the new design looks. As for the rest of Section 9, everyone looks objectively (if I can use that word here) passable, even if I find Togusa’s rework to be absolutely awful in terms of representation. The design is just so, 2020, for a lack of a better way to describe it. Strangely, it’s not even really Ilya’s fault either. Episode 5 restores Togusa’s glorious mullet, but it’s just that the CG engine is incapable of truly capturing its glory the way I.G did so masterfully two decades ago. Speaking of the CG, it looks—and I don’t care what anybody has to say about this—fucking amazing! Sola and I.G finessed the absolute shit out of what they were given to work with. Everything looks incredibly polished across the board—it really grows on you over time, although, still nowhere near as breathtaking as Kise\'s Arise. As I said in regards to Vampire in the Garden, there are many ways to say something looks great, and SAC_2045 season 2. Looks. Great. I couldn\'t really tell if anything was upgraded, visually, since season 1, but I’d like to believe it looks different, somehow—maybe it\'s smoother? Anyway, this segues into my main issue with how the CG, despite its evident polish, negatively affects the show on a scene-to-scene basis in comparison with the original SAC. So let’s move down a paragraph.SAC_2045’s greatest strength is also its greatest weakness, that being the mode by which its story is conveyed: the virtual environment. Don’t get me wrong, the way it’s used here is genuinely great, so great in fact, that I’d argue SAC_2045 might be the best-looking CG TV/ONA series I’ve ever seen. It’s quite enthralling to see the characters traverse the environment as well as interact with props, and one another, in fully realized, aesthetically pleasing renders, masterfully brought to life by I.G and Sola. It\'s that same filmic movement Kamiyama sought to capture in animation during the original SAC, now given the tools to flat-out do so. For instance, Purin climbing over the hotel bed to get to the robot charging port kinda blew me away. It’s a fairly small, inconsequential scene in the scope of the entire series, and there are definitely better examples I could have used, but you don’t often see characters move through a ""set"" like that. I was fully expecting her to walk around the bed, but the staff took full advantage of the liberty that the 3DCG allowed them and had her traverse through the z-axis with the camera in tow. I hope any of what I’m explaining doesn’t sound too mundane, but getting back on topic, my point is, that while the virtual environment stuff is great, the freedom it gives the staff hinders their ability to really frame a scene impactfully—if you get what I mean. A lot of really big scenes seemed to fall flat because of the focus on intractability and life-like movement. I feel a more traditional approach to presentation, like in Arise, for instance, would have forced the staff to think long and hard about how to storyboard specific segments, upping the visual impact that I think SAC_2045 was sorely lacking. The trade-off for this, I suppose, was the big-budget action feel a lot of others noted and attributed to Aramaki Shinji, however, I feel this is just as in line with the type of media Kamiyama enjoys consuming (and I guess creating), as he’s stuck his neck out on several occasions to profess his love for well-oiled, Hollywood action, popcorn flicks. As a matter of fact, we\'ve been seeing more and more of this style from Kamiyama as of late—well, relatively—starting with Hirune Hime, or maybe even Re:Cyborg. Of course, that isn\'t to diminish Aramaki\'s role on this project, but SAC_2045 just seems more mutually collaborative than most make it out to be. But hey, I know literally nothing about animation, and I have no idea what I’m talking about.However, I do know what I’m talking about, especially when it comes to things that I know what I’m talking... about, and the ending falls into that category. The ending of SAC_2045 was absolutely atrocious—or was it? I really don’t know whether or not I absolutely despise this ending, but what I do know, is that it left me incredibly disappointed and wholly unsatisfied. It\'s for sure going to be the most polarizing component of SAC_2045’s narrative. Like, what the fuck were they thinking? At first, I thought ‘N’ was a relatively cool idea, though nothing as ingenious, inventive, intelligent, imaginative, innovative, incredible, intuitive, impeccable, impressive, indispensable, or inspired as the Individual 11 nor The Laughing Man, but still, relatively cool all the same. But the idea just kept growing and growing until the stakes were at a global level, and here I thought Gouda’s nationalist renaissance was big money. Boy, was I wrong. This ‘N’ bullshit just kept getting more and more contrived the further it went, until it eventually imploded in on itself like it was the end of some cookie-cutter, milquetoast, bag-cereal, run-of-the-mill, garden-variety, top-ramen, dollar store, teen-fiction, dystopian novel, where there are seemingly no consequences for the character\'s actions. But who knows, this might just be another case of, “I’m too stupid to understand the nuance, and with time, I’ll accept this as some legendary subversion, or extension, of GITS as an intellectual property.” I hope the fuck not, though. The concepts got so big and ill-defined that even the characters couldn’t explain them. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was where Satou Dai’s authorial hand came into the picture. I love the man’s work, but this is right in line with the big-concept stupidity he often indulges in. LIKE, WHAT IS THIS? THE MATRIX? THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE STAND. ALONE. COMPLEX! DOUBLE-THINK IS JUST PURE TECHNOMANCY BULLSHIT! I don’t even remember any of this being established in season 1, apart from the aptly named “nostalgia virus,” though its connection to double-think, N and Shimamura’s grand plan is utterly lost on me (on second thought, they\'re all just synonymous with each other, aren\'t they?). Like, I understand what the plan is, and how it works, but isn\'t it just a little juvenile, especially for SAC, given its reputation for grounded, hard sci-fi? Also, that ending scene was absolutely masturbatory—undoubtedly the worst version of the backdrop (or whatever you want to call it) to date. And man, what were they thinking with Shimamura’s final design anywho? He’s decked out in a school-shooter trench coat on top of already looking like a cross-bred Joker and Minato Arisato. That’s just a recipe for disaster. And a disaster it was, as I attribute everything wrong with SAC_2045’s rushed, frankly baffling conclusion, to him. Now, in the same vein as Shimamura, Purin is a character I SHOULD hate, but surprisingly, don’t. I don’t know what to tell you: she just grew on me. All that Ilya pretentiousness I was talking about earlier melted away thanks to Megumi Han\'s (huh, wait a minute, I was just explaining a couple of days ago how I thought she carried Vampire in the Garden’s emotional crux, go figure) brilliantly emotive performance. And hey (I bet you just love how I keep using ""and hey"" to nonchalantly add some stupid, obvious tidbit), they even decked her out in a plug suit, so I guess Eva really did alter anime eternally. Anyways, I thought that was real cool and—to use a smark term—it got a pretty huge pop from me. But you know what also got a pretty huge pop from me? Scott “basically god” Matthew, that’s what. When was the last time you heard an Australian singer in an anime? That’s a rhetorical question of course, and yes, this is ironic lampshading. So anyway, on top of receiving an insert song from the man I’m going to dub, ""the voice of SAC,"" we also got an insert song from EMI FUCKING EVANS of all people! Those two additions to the soundtrack fixed what I thought was lacking from season 1’s OST—an emotional punchline that underscores those big scenes, which are supposed to make us, as viewers, care. It’s what Kanno’s score did so flawlessly on the original SAC, and, to an extent, it’s replicated to decent effect here (wow, this paragraph is huge).Alright! I’m going to end this “review” by mentioning a few things I thought were interesting.So, first of all, you have no idea how happy it made me to see Batou in his original SAC design during that Purin flashback, as blatantly fanservice-y as it was. It made me so happy, in fact, that the unfortunate co-occurrence of it, and a retcon to the stand-alone Marco Amereti episode, didn’t even matter, although it probably should have. Secondly, it really seemed like someone on the team lifted the whole soldiers crying, laughing etc thing right from Guns of the Patriots, anyone else? Thirdly, when the fuck did “3D printing a cow” become a thing in SAC? What is this, Star Trek? I half expected to see Data come out of that thing instead of Mizukane, lol. And lastly, as hard as that one rock track is trying—and failing—to be Run Rabbit Junk, it surprisingly, like Purin, grew on me, to the point whereby the last couple of episodes, I was doing air guitar every time it played. Yeah, isn\'t that cool?So, while SAC_2045 had some really, really interesting ideas pertaining to the American empire, a sustainable war, post-human cyborgs, and crazy world-building events like the synchronized global default, it also had some really, really rushed, horrible ideas that only served to muddy what could have been a legitimately good sequel to one of my favourite anime of all time. Though, despite its lopsided shortcomings, watching the Section 9 gang get back together at full force warmed my cold, black heart. I expect to revisit this “review” to add or fix some things, seeing as it’s 6:22 AM, and I’ve spent the entire night watching this show and writing this garbage, so I can only imagine it’s riddled with spelling errors and inconsistencies. Hopefully, someone more adept at writing can produce a review that clarifies what the actual fuck was going on with those last two episodes plot-wise, so they can explain to me, in clear terms, why the ending didn\'t suck. Well, the net is vast and infinite, so I imagine that\'s not a big ask.Thanks for reading. of this show, so, this write-up will be mostly stream of consciousness.

It still looks like bad PS4 game graphics (occasionally with ray tracing or other next-gen features turned on). Characters still look like polished plastic dolls, and Mokoto Kusanagi still looks like a super legal loli or something. With the first season taking hours to get to the important story and compelling mystery, my expectation for Season 2 was a 7 or 8 out of 10 at best. But wow, how wrong...I was. Alas, we do not live in a perfect world where the best anime screenplays always get the best animation team. By that, I mean the story of 2045 completely blew my expectations out of water, and it deserves much better budget for the creators to realize their vision. In my anime philosophy, I stated that image quality/visual fidelity of an anime is not high on my priorities, and as long as the animation/visuals adequately convey the intended story in a consistent way, I would be fine with it. With that said, 2045 is about 85% there, with most important sequences rendered properly and sometimes even beautifully. Yes there are a few poorly rendered sequences where the 3DCG quality drops to PS3 standard but they don\'t totally ruin the show for me (unlike Togusa\'s over-the-top Bruce-Lee impressions in Season 1 which was painfully scorched into my brain), but most of the time I was pretty immersed into the story.The story could have been a retread to all the familiar waters with the GITS franchise, and I would still have given the show a 7.5-8/10. They could have just pulled another Mokoto badassery final battle, with another Tachikoma heroic sacrifice which saves the day, or another 26-episode season riddled with philosophy and political exposition like the amazing SAC 2nd Gig. There are certainly familiar waters they treaded with this season, yes, but the final resolution and outcome are on another level. Had this season been in the hands of Wit Studio or Madhouse, it could have totally been a modern classic.Baseline quality: 9/10 for me. Look past the awkward character models and you will find one of the best sci-fi stories in anime.Recommended to: Viewers who prioritize story, thematic coherence and philosophy over visuals in anime.  Fans of Philip K. Dick, fans of Deus Ex. GITS fans who loved analyzing sci-fi stuff.Pros and Cons: (minor spoilers)++ The writers took the risk to break the mold with the classic GITS story formula, and for me they hit the mark. I have never been a fan of transhumanism as a viable concept in reality, and have been critically appreciating the GITS franchise for more than a decade now. However, 2045 Season 2 was able to enlighten me in a different way and open my mind (a little more than before). One of the criticisms I had with Season 1 was how underwhelming the concept of ""posthuman"" gradually became towards the end of Season 1, as the more we got to know about them, the less original and horrifying they felt (in comparison to the first posthuman they encountered). Season 2 mostly overcame that issue and elevated the whole concept with its ending.++ Great action sequences balanced with mystery and quite character moments. One of the common criticisms for Season 1 was how the initial episodes felt like an MCU movie rather than GITS. I am glad to say that Season 2 has both brain and brawls ready from EP1.++ Consistently thoughtful and chewy. GITS as a franchise has been famous for the mind-bending, humanity-warping consequences and implications of technology (seeing the advancement of neural-computer interface in 2022, not too far from us). 2045 is no different, and in my opinion the most worthy sequel to the original movie and SAC series since 2004 in this regard.++ Thrilling camera work and amazing editing. Say whatever you want with the 3D graphics, but one thing I cannot fault the direction of the show is camera work/editing which held the presentation together. Some sequences towards the end are as white-knuckled as the franchise has ever been.- Character models and facial animations left a lot to be desired. Funny thing is there is something resembling a ""cyborg zombie"" in the show, as if lots of facial animations of human characters do not already remind people of zombies.- There are no reasons (save for the limited budget) for certain sequences to be so cel-shaded or loaded with simplistic background geometry/textures, and those sequences can leave a bad aftertaste (Togusa\'s memory/dream sequence, for example). Again, like I said, for me it\'s not as bad as everyone said since 2045 Season 1.Extra thoughts (heavy spoilers):I have seen quite a few works in different media that tried to present transhumanism/technological singularity in a charitable light. Deus Ex 2 (if anyone still remembers the JC Denton human empowerment ending) and the movie Chappie are some of the examples. As fascinating as their depictions of this concept were, I never went like ""yeah, that could totally happen"" or ""maybe it\'s not such a bad thing after all"" until 2045 Season 2. I was.

Period. Hell I even really enjoy the finale OVA film “Solid State Society” even if it hankered back way too much to the first GitS film. After finishing this new SAC anime though...I feel like a lot of its issues could easily be brushed of if it didn't share that “SAC” branding.It's honestly the same feelings I had with all the “Arise” stuff; not particularly amazing but was willing to see what direction the show(s)/film(s) would go in because it was an entirely new thing. To me, my experiences with the SAC entries is that it is...distinct from the main-line films, it is distinct from Arise. This new anime feels pretty close, in my opinion, to the core values and “feel” of Arise. Sure there are some instances that make me feel like it could be a SAC themed entry, but overall the aesthetic, pacing, and how the majority of the shots are composed really make me feel like I'm watching something more akin to the “feeling” of Arise rather than SAC. That's my main complaint; I really feel like calling this a SAC entry really does the anime a serious disservice.To get the easy point out of the way, I honestly am mostly in favor with the new look of the show. In nighttime/dark scenes, the CG looks quite good. However in more sunny-lit scenes, it can range from good to amateurish. This seems to be indicative of CG in-general though many Western studios such as Disney and Pixar have seem to have nailed how to make super lit scenes look really well done. The art style looks great, the action scenes are super fluid, and in general, the characters don't really do anything to stand out in a negative way. There are for sure some moments that look worse than they should, but they are outliers. I am 100% ok with this new direction though of course as many others will agree, I do miss the more traditional looking animation (I think SAC was mostly 2D hand drawn but I know in that era of animation for Japan digital animation was starting to be tinkered with).The plot of the show is not necessarily bad; it's the pacing that really brings it down. I really feel like the first season meandered way too much then all of the sudden at the end, realized they needed to bring the important elements forward so that season 2 could finish things off. It felt honestly like a separate film separated from the second season which was more concise but messy with so many different ideas going on. I wouldn't be surprised if the show wasn't fully written and realized when they actually started making season 2. This show could have benefited, given if season 1 wasn't altered at all, a good 3 or more episodes to really flesh out the plot of the show. And that plot...in a lot of ways it feels like a re-hash of the “antagonist's” ideals from season 2 of SAC though with a couple important differences. Those differences though...don't matter much in the grand scheme of things; the thing that matters the most is that the overall pacing and order of key moments feels quite similar to the ending episodes of that second SAC season. Because of that, I felt a little apprehensive when watching the ending of this show. It just felt like a rehashing of so many previous ideas which really conflicts with the rest of the vibe of the show (whole new art style, animation, musical cues, ext). The ending itself is, for the most part, pretty open-ended to interpretation...but in my opinion not in a good way. It's open-ended because the show didn't do a great job setting up this ending. It's fine to let the audience interpret what they think happened but you need to not leave out so many important details in doing so. Films like “Inception” give you clues throughout the film that go hand-in-hand with an open-ended ending; giving much more context to it. This new SAC anime doesn't really give you any of these ideas leading into the ending; the ending just ends in such a way that you HAVE to decide on you own what happened. It just feels a little fragmented and not well handled.My overall opinion of this new GitS anime is quite conflicted. If I just try to take a step back and have a more general overview of it, I do like it. There is a lot here to like. However, and again I apologize if this feels pedantic, but because this was touted as a “SAC” entry, I cannot help but feel disappointed. It doesn't at all in any way come close to the overall quality of the two SAC seasons or even the mixed reception of the SAC:SSS OVA film. This new SAC anime is worth watching, it's just severely lacking that “special sauce” that the previous SAC properties had.Enjoyment: 6.6/10Overall: 6.7/10 distinct from the main-line films, it is distinct from Arise.

I will say this, the story is quite vague and it the effort to explain it isn't quite there compared to the original SAC series and there is a disconnect from its precursor movie Solid State Society. I can not justify this as it's been a while since I've watched any of it and I'm also just not as invested as those fans.However, there are a lot of nuances that I think people...failed to appreciate in line with the original concept of what it means to be a human (having a ghost or not) and the story they presented with this show was OK. Not amazing, not spectacular, but it wasn't a complete dumpster fire as some of these reviews might lead you to think.

Also the graphics have improved massively compared to the first season. On that topic I will say that if you have a 1080p monitor or tv, you probably won’t enjoy the new graphics that much or look that much different. But I Watched it on a Macbook 2020 that has a good retina display, therefore; it looked really good on my end. 1080p just doesn’t give this show any credit it deserves as it doesn’t look great in 1080p.Story:8/10Really good, but...it also was a little confusing near the end especially the last episode [episode 12] even the major was lost.Art:10/10Like I said at the start of this review, if you don’t have a good monitor over like 2k I reckon you will struggle with the quality of it but if you do have a nice monitor or tv then the art looks really good. Massive improvements to the first season with more details on characters and background.CGI:7/10Much improved from season 1, it felt more natural and more smooth.

Some fairly interesting ideas, cool action, gripping tension and (somewhat) more compelling drama. I did like the final episode, with some reservations about its lack of detail and explanation. I now buy that this series was written and directed by Kenji Kamiyama; the man who gave us the classic Laughing Man and Individual Eleven arcs, as well as a disarmingly affective backstory for one of anime’s most enigmatic...protagonists. Additionally, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and the rest of the English cast continued to do their damnedest with this material.But… it’s a Netflix show, through and through. Everything happens so fast, and ultimately so little really ends up being of consequence. So much more could have been done with this story, especially following the events of Solid State Society… Some antagonistic players are more cartoons than ever. And perhaps, at last, Ghost in the Shell the property has become such a meme as a concept that its echoes of itself (and for that matter, of venerable sf works) have ceased to be cute and clever.I can’t say I’d recommend it to longtime fans, or that I’d be down for a 4th/5th “gig”.

Let\'s see what we\'ve got this time - in the second part of Stand Alone Complex 2045.Before you continue reading I just want to let you know that I\'m not that good at writing reviews or have I completely understood this series.OVERVIEWThe main antagonist that poses a threat to Section 9 this is Shimamura Takashi the so-called ""Big Brother"" (reference to ""1984."" by George Orwell I presume). He is one of the post-humans who play a vital role in this season. Those individuals...have been fundamentally transformed on a mental level, giving them unprecedented intelligence, cognitive and hacking speed, and focus while altering their personalities.\xa0To summarise Takashi - he almost started a nuclear war before the reality was, let\'s say, replaced with another, better one.CHARACTERS - 7/10Main characters\' personalities thankfully remained mostly the same. Major is still the same cold, quiet and mysterious yet romantic persona. In duo with Batou they are still as fun as they were in the original GitS series. I never really found anything special about S9 chief Aramaki and he is still like that in this part. Section as we know from the last part got two new members - Clown and Purin. Clown was absent for the most part of this season, thankfully as I do not like his personality at all. I feel as he does not belong in a series such as this. Purin, on the other hand, started off being really annoying and obnoxious. She became a secondary antagonist later on and then I began liking her more (still don\'t like her that much though).STORY - 6/10Here comes the tricky part. The concept of the story itself was phenomenal, but the execution was lacking. I was quite bored at the beginning, but I became invested into it a few episodes before the end. To say the least, I think I didn\'t really understand it that much and that\'s why I can\'t give my view clearly. Also, the ending was really rushed so that contributed as well.ANIMATION AND ART - 5/10I normally completely dislike CGI in anime and am a fan of more traditional anime making, but I can\'t say it was done badly. It also fits a series such as this. Only thing is, I didn\'t expect it and I needed some time before I was used to it.MUSIC - 2/10The soundtracks were almost non-existent. I also didn\'t like its opening nor its ending that much.ENTERTAINMENT - 4/10All in all, it was a good pastime, but that\'s about it. I would never have watched it if it wasn\'t a part of GitS franchise. Still, it was nice to see the charcters we all know and love once again even in this sort of butchered story. have been fundamentally transformed on a mental level, giving them unprecedented intelligence, cognitive and hacking speed, and focus while altering their personalities.\xa0To summarise Takashi - he almost started a nuclear war before the reality was, let\'s say, replaced with another, better one.CHARACTERS - 7/10Main characters\' personalities thankfully remained mostly the same.

My initial feelings towards the first season were mixed. It had some great ideas and unique concepts to explore but it didn\'t deliver it as it promised. The artwork and music were some its stronger aspects. Though it couldn\'t be said about its storyline and new characters. I found some episodes average at best and some are just downright forgettable.GITS is one of my all time favorite anime franchises to pre-phase something before going in a lil further. I was excited to see what S1 of SAC_2045 had...to offer. At the end of it I found myself a lil disappointed by the end results.S2 comes out, hoping that it would make things better but it felt like the same issues I had with S1. Throughout watching S2 I tried so hard to pay close attention to the plot I couldn\'t be engrossed into it either. The post-humans is an unique concept to explore and expanding upon the post-humans for what they\'re goals and purpose in life are is a great way to get my investment.I dunno if its my attention span or its convoluted/disconnected plot. The plot tries to keep you invested into what\'s going on. Given how forgettable the first season was, I lost complete track to what was even going on half the time.The new characters I still couldn\'t grow any attachment to. Esaki is the one that seems to have a more character arc going on in comparison to Clown and the main antagonists. Esaki was a character upon first viewing, I literally forgot her name because she was just sort of there in S1. She didn\'t really had a whole lot to her and she struck me as someone\'s fan-character who got into the show.I wanted to like these new characters but they don\'t strike me as anything interesting nor worth grasping about. Clown I\'ll say is a character has been done so dirty. He doesn\'t comeback until the later episodes of the show which makes me think. Why the fuck bother with this guy if he has zero purpose to the storyline. Is he just there to be a burden?Comic relief character\'s can have depth to them but this guy is such a footnote.As for the main antagonist. I had absolutely no clue to what they wanted to do. Nothing felt fleshed out to me. I even forgot their names so I called the main one ""P3 protagonist"" and the other one ""Hot milf assassin"" (To be honest and fair with you she is real damn hot for a character with superhuman strength)The old crew is always nice to see (including Paz and Borma) even if they don\'t have a whole lot to add. Even with the new and old, nothing seems characterized for both parties enough and gets to the more action/thrilling sequences that want you excited for then plot.The animation in this is not half-bad compared to S1 but the criticism\'s feel the same. The backgrounds are great and the character designs by Illya Kuvshinov are very nice. But seeing the 2-D credits at the end makes me wish this was in traditional animation because I think their be more beauty to it. I\'ve gotten quite used to the CGI animation while not super fluid but it does maintain a nice job within the action sequences of the show. One of the more stronger elements of this season would be its music.The music in this show is incredible to hear with some nice synth tracks that reminded me a bit of Blade Runner 2049 at times. The voice-acting from the original cast is great to hear as per-usual.I dunno if I have anything else to add given how lost I was. I don\'t wanna repeat myself but the criticism\'s I had with the first season remain the same with this one.If you\'re a fan of GITS, I\'d say watch S1 to see how you feel before jumping into this one (well duh its not only the first season but for more context though be warned you might get lost) If you\'re not a fan, my recommendation. Give SAC_2045 a pass. It\'s a very run of the mill experience to the end that\'ll have you moving onto something else and leaving with the feelings of \'meh\'. While some action sequences might have you entertained but its not enough for its disjointed plotline and minimal character developments.I\'ll stick Stand Alone Complex which I highly recommend over this. to offer. At the end of it I found myself a lil disappointed by the end results.S2 comes out, hoping that it would make things better but it felt like the same issues I had with S1. Throughout watching S2 I tried so hard to pay close attention to the plot I couldn\'t be engrossed into it either. The post-humans is an unique concept to explore and expanding upon the post-humans for what they\'re goals and purpose in life are is a great way to get my investment.I dunno if its my attention span or its convoluted/disconnected plot. The plot tries to keep you invested into what\'s going on. Given how forgettable the first season was, I lost complete track to what was even going on half the time.The new characters I still couldn\'t grow any attachment to. Esaki is the one that seems to have a more character arc going on in comparison to Clown and the main antagonists. Esaki was a character upon first viewing, I literally forgot her name because she was just sort of there in S1. She didn\'t really had a whole lot to her and she struck me as someone\'s fan-character who got into the show.I wanted to like these new characters but they don\'t strike me as anything interesting nor worth grasping about. Clown I\'ll say is a character has been done so dirty. He doesn\'t comeback until the later episodes of the show which makes me think. Why the fuck bother with this guy if he has zero purpose to the storyline. Is he just there to be a burden?Comic relief character\'s can have depth to them but this guy is such a footnote.As for the main antagonist. I had absolutely no clue to what they wanted to do. Nothing felt fleshed out to me. I even forgot their names so I called the main one ""P3 protagonist"" and the other one ""Hot milf assassin"" (To be honest and fair with you she is real damn hot for a character with superhuman strength)The old crew is always nice to see (including Paz and Borma) even if they don\'t have a whole lot to add.

The bastardization of the characters, the absolute nonsense of the new world building elements, the seemingly arbitrary way the plot flowed around the characters rather than it being the normal push and pull of them and the factions they are fighting against, the muddying of the message regarding the nature of human relationship to technology and the implications it has to both our sense of self and our sense...of a cohesive society, the annoying additions to the casts which seem to serve no purpose but to fulfill market preferences.Again, I absolutely detested the first season. And I tell you this to say that I think this one is ok and might even retroactively increase my score of 3 to a 4 for the first season, maybe even a 5. Rather than being some weird addition to the canon interested in just making oethe characters status quo chance for the sake of being different, the second season, at least to me, seems at least a bit interested in cluing you in as to why all these changes which do not make sense with the latest interaction we had with these characters (the SAC universe, I mean, the argument SAC2045 is supposed to be a completely different one doesn't hold water with me because they keep referencing that previous series very heavily to the point that trying to separate the two is only needed because they messed up the first season so badly), and just in general focusing on showing Section 9 as competent people whose decisions are all part of a game where both sides are playing chess rather than playing tic-tac-toe while their enemies play Go.Does the story reach the heights previous entries reached? No. Season 1 is a base of sand bricks which Season 2 tries to work on with mud ones, all in a failed attempted to resemble the stone temples that preceded it, but at the very least it doesn't feel that it's insulting the intelligence of the viewer while doing so. It's still probably the weakest part of the whole thing, but while the first season had me stopping after each episode to do just about anything else, I watched this season in three chunks not because I couldn't stand it, but because those felt like comfortable points to do so.As for the rest, the visuals are amazing, even if I would prefer we had stuck to the old style, but then again I am a cell supremacist so I am just being an old curmudgeon about it. The fights do sometimes look very silly, however, with some sense of lack of weight to the movements or the impacts, although it was very inconsistent so I am not sure if it's just me or if I did something to mess with the image.The music and the foley is ok. I still keep SAC's OST as part of my regular rotation of music. I don't think there was a single song here that I will remember by next week, but I didn't outright hate any of it. It worked, what else is there to say?So yeah, this was ok, I wish that they had made the first season as good as this one so it wasn't a hate watch and this had a better foundation, but overrall... if they decided to continue this somehow, I wouldn't dismiss outright like I almost did for this one. of a cohesive society, the annoying additions to the casts which seem to serve no purpose but to fulfill market preferences.Again, I absolutely detested the first season.

The original Detective Conan is THE series of my childhood (besides with One Piece), and to this day is one of my favorites of the medium (as is readily apparent). Detective Conan is a masterpiece for me and ever since I heard about an anime adaptation of the manga ""Detective Conan: The Culprit Hanazawa"" coming out, I\'ve been hyped.The anime is a parody of Detective Conan through and through and never takes itself too seriously. This is evident right from the opening ""Tsukamaete, Konya."" Our protagonist Hanazawa doesn\'t dance in the opening by accident....The entire dance, as well as Hanazawa\'s final pose, is a parody of Detective Conan\'s eighth opening, ""Koi wa Suriru, Shokku, Sasupensu."" And the series is also full of such self-referential parodies. For example, the anime addresses the question of what it\'s like for the citizens of Beika to live in such a district with so many murders. Also, the character design of Ran Mori or Hanazawa are obvious parodies. But that\'s all I want to anticipate in this review.To watch this spin-off, you should know Detective Conan, otherwise almost all the jokes won\'t work. But that\'s exactly what I like about this spin-off. It\'s precisely because this series is so self-referential that the spin-off parodies Detective Conan so well. And that\'s all the series wants.

Hannin no Hanzawa-san is cleverly written, unique, with relatable characters living in Beika Town, constantly scared of falling victim of the next crime.

Is it funny? It probably won't make you laugh your ass off (though it did get a few chuckles out of me), but it is very...entertaining nonetheless.If you haven't noticed by now from the title, cover and trailer, this show is about the shadowy figure that represents the culprits in Detective Conan, it's presented as a character named Hanzawa (which translates to culprit), so you already know what to expect from the kind of humor this show has to offer, but one thing I personally wasn't prepared for and found to be a pleasant surprise, is how the main cast from the original series is portrayed in this one.Hanzawa-san portrays the world of Detective Conan in a silly way, as an apocalyptic city full of murder, which is hilarious by itself, but instead of doing that as a one time joke they actually build upon it, making it some sort of sarcastic world building, and it works well.And then there's the main cast, whom instead of being characters with roles in the story, they are used as the punchlines of their own parodies, for example in one episode Hanzawa shows murderous intent, suddenly out of nowhere Conan and Heiji start following him, they don't even interfere with what's going on at the time, they're only part of the background and never even say a single word, they're almost creepy in a funny way, makes you feel like they're watching you all the time in this world, it's a subtle joke parodying how Conan and Heiji often tend to randomly look at a person and find them suspicious for no reason, and they're always at the right place and right time for a murder case.The visuals are surprisingly pretty good, the characters may look a bit different due to the art-style, but you'll get used to it in no time, especially if you never skip the opening song (which is simply fantastic).There's really no reason not to watch this show if you're sold on it already and can find its episodes, it's very light and easy to watch without worrying about time, either way I hope you got something out of this review.Your feedback will be appreciated, have a good day. entertaining nonetheless.If you haven't noticed by now from the title, cover and trailer, this show is about the shadowy figure that represents the culprits in Detective Conan, it's presented as a character named Hanzawa (which translates to culprit), so you already know what to expect from the kind of humor this show has to offer, but one thing I personally wasn't prepared for and found to be a pleasant surprise, is how the main cast from the original series is portrayed in this one.Hanzawa-san portrays the world of Detective Conan in a silly way, as an apocalyptic city full of murder, which is hilarious by itself, but instead of doing that as a one time joke they actually build upon it, making it some sort of sarcastic world building, and it works well.And then there's the main cast, whom instead of being characters with roles in the story, they are used as the punchlines of their own parodies, for example in one episode Hanzawa shows murderous intent, suddenly out of nowhere Conan and Heiji start following him, they don't even interfere with what's going on at the time, they're only part of the background and never even say a single word, they're almost creepy in a funny way, makes you feel like they're watching you all the time in this world, it's a subtle joke parodying how Conan and Heiji often tend to randomly look at a person and find them suspicious for no reason, and they're always at the right place and right time for a murder case.The visuals are surprisingly pretty good, the characters may look a bit different due to the art-style, but you'll get used to it in no time, especially if you never skip the opening song (which is simply fantastic).There's really no reason not to watch this show if you're sold on it already and can find its episodes, it's very light and easy to watch without worrying about time, either way I hope you got something out of this review.Your feedback will be appreciated, have a good day."", 'So this one is a little tricky because I’ve seen many comments about how disappointing this mini-series was but let’s just take it as what it really is: a spin-off of an amazing series and even a parody of it. And I went in with basically zero expectations (unlike the “Zero’s tea time” spin-off and believe it or not but pun not intended). So let me start with what I really liked about it.Ending: 9/10Normally I don’t rate openings and endings but I make exceptions for those that are either special or that will haunt me for life. This series has both. And...while I love the ending song even though the serious theme is not fitting what makes it fitting is the hilarious opening which is – no joke – the most terrifying thing I’ve ever watched (maybe because I don’t watch horror movies). Don’t get me wrong… I kind of hated the opening so much that I only bothered to watch it once or else I’d have lost either my eyesight or my sanity (although that might be too late now) but it was a perfect fit for this series. Still I’m only rating the ending because Mai Kuraki can’t do any wrong.Animation: 7/10Yes, if I had to rate the animation based on style it would be a 0/10 or let’s give it 1 out of pity. But it was enough for what it was and I had a blast watching our well-known characters with this silly over the top re-design. Especially Ran. You gotta appreciate the love for details and to pull off something funny without pointing at it with a stick (actually that’s kind of what her hair did but you get my point?). Yes, Hanzawa’s design was lacking in some aspects but even this was intentional. The only complaint I’d have is that some of the characters didn’t look silly enough and more like themselves. Like Furuya. I get he only had a short appearance and he’s popular but it doesn’t justify making him look cool in every Conan-Universe. So I felt that was a little sloppy. Plus I’m 100% sure he only appeared because of fan service and I’m mad it even worked on me!Characters: 6/10To be honest I was a little surprised to see some of the characters making an appearance. Loved all these references and accuracy by “sticking true” to their characters and I won’t go into too much detail so not to spoil anything but I especially had a laugh with one of the frequent characters of the original show and I don’t think I’ll ever see him the same way after watching this. It kind of made my day. But that’s where I have to get a little bit critical and while enjoyed the comedic part of the characters, it was Hanzawa who lacked the most. And yes, I still know it was supposed to be like this but it doesn’t change the fact that a part of me wished to really look into the mind of a criminal a little more and even get some motives behind his actions, some character depth (I know, what am I expecting from a silhouette character to begin with?). It’s just that I think it would have been even more hilarious if he wouldn’t have been too much of an amateur all the time. Or at least not in all areas. If you watch this you might understand my reasoning.Story: 6/10My points for this aspect pretty much fall into the same category as my rating for the characters. The plot is basically about a guy who moves to Tokyo (Beika) in order to kill someone. Just for him to discover it isn’t that easy and that it’s especially tough in Beika where crime never sleeps (as well as the police solving them). There were many nice references and issues poked fun at which will make you really laugh hard as a fan of the original series or even for someone who doesn’t know the series (although it feels like it’s full of insiders you mostly get if you are familiar with the source material). Especially since it’s addressing many issues that might been bugging most of us for decades now. But as the series continues I felt like these references became less. They picked up some more in the last episode but especially that episode was a big let-down for me because even though it’s not a series to take seriously, it made it even more disappointing they didn’t end it on a different note. Like a plot-twist but it’s hilarious. Just as the series was supposed to be. It’s still better and more than I would have expected and at least it was short enough to never feel dragged out but there were still some missed opportunities and lost potential.Overall rating: 7/10I had a great time watching this and a part of me would hope for another season, maybe even with another “culprit” and much more references. Don’t take it too serious, don’t view it as completion to the original series because it’s not but it’s still fun to watch and won’t hurt since these 12 episodes are really short. A nice “snack” for in-between. I’m glad I finally watched it and a certain character watching the “spring side” of Beika will now forever live rent-free in my head.

Yes, Hanzawa’s design was lacking in some aspects but even this was intentional. The only complaint I’d have is that some of the characters didn’t look silly enough and more like themselves. Like Furuya. I get he only had a short appearance and he’s popular but it doesn’t justify making him look cool in every Conan-Universe. So I felt that was a little sloppy. Plus I’m 100% sure he only appeared because of fan service and I’m mad it even worked on me!Characters: 6/10To be honest I was a little surprised to see some of the characters making an appearance. Loved all these references and accuracy by “sticking true” to their characters and I won’t go into too much detail so not to spoil anything but I especially had a laugh with one of the frequent characters of the original show and I don’t think I’ll ever see him the same way after watching this. It kind of made my day. But that’s where I have to get a little bit critical and while enjoyed the comedic part of the characters, it was Hanzawa who lacked the most. And yes, I still know it was supposed to be like this but it doesn’t change the fact that a part of me wished to really look into the mind of a criminal a little more and even get some motives behind his actions, some character depth (I know, what am I expecting from a silhouette character to begin with?). It’s just that I think it would have been even more hilarious if he wouldn’t have been too much of an amateur all the time. Or at least not in all areas. If you watch this you might understand my reasoning.Story: 6/10My points for this aspect pretty much fall into the same category as my rating for the characters. The plot is basically about a guy who moves to Tokyo (Beika) in order to kill someone. Just for him to discover it isn’t that easy and that it’s especially tough in Beika where crime never sleeps (as well as the police solving them). There were many nice references and issues poked fun at which will make you really laugh hard as a fan of the original series or even for someone who doesn’t know the series (although it feels like it’s full of insiders you mostly get if you are familiar with the source material). Especially since it’s addressing many issues that might been bugging most of us for decades now. But as the series continues I felt like these references became less. They picked up some more in the last episode but especially that episode was a big let-down for me because even though it’s not a series to take seriously, it made it even more disappointing they didn’t end it on a different note. Like a plot-twist but it’s hilarious. Just as the series was supposed to be. It’s still better and more than I would have expected and at least it was short enough to never feel dragged out but there were still some missed opportunities and lost potential.Overall rating: 7/10I had a great time watching this and a part of me would hope for another season, maybe even with another “culprit” and much more references. Don’t take it too serious, don’t view it as completion to the original series because it’s not but it’s still fun to watch and won’t hurt since these 12 episodes are really short. A nice “snack” for in-between. I’m glad I finally watched it and a certain character watching the “spring side” of Beika will now forever live rent-free in my head. Thanks for that :D', 'So unlike most people who reviewed this, I have not watched the original detective Conan. I picked this anime up cause of a 5 second clip I saw on Netflix and decided to give it a try.I have to say that it\'s one of the best comedy animes I\'ve watched in a while. The episodes are short ( around 10 minutes) and the simple animation style perfectly matches the hilarious tone of the show. It doesn\'t take itself seriously and you don\'t need to be aquatinted with the detective Conan series to enjoy it.If you\'re looking for a genuinely hilarious anime (not ""comedy""...animes who\'s entire bit is just screaming dramatically whenever something happens) with a solid English dub that you can casually binge in less than 2 hours then this is definitely the one for you. And if you\'re a detective conan fan then you\'ll definitely enjoy it as well as other fans have said it\'s a great parody. Have fun with all the inside jokes😁. animes who\'s entire bit is just screaming dramatically whenever something happens) with a solid English dub that you can casually binge in less than 2 hours then this is definitely the one for you.

I do actually kinda dig the artystyle innit. Ion know bout' u but it looks exactly like the old artsyle for Detective Conan of when it first began, just in higher resolution. The only problem is that some characters looks so weird and strange due to the alteration of art style. I'm also quite glad they also use the same VA's.The show is actually quite funny innit. Its quite understandable why its rated under 7. The plot of the series is about a quite unknown figure named Hanzawa that moves to Beika City, where all the crime basically exists in Detective...Conan. For some quite reason Hanzawa looks up to the various criminal activity that occurs and wants to start doing criminal activity such as murder.Detective Conan betrays the expectations of the public eye with various different aspects such as murder, drug usage, gang violence, etc... However, this series just seems like a kid show with a bunch of cliché moments that interrupts the mc's mentality of actually committing a crime.It'd be quite cool if they made it like the series Kid Kaito. Kid Kaito is an alternative story of a phantom thief that rivals with Conan and DOES appear in the base show Detective Conan. Maybe they can somehow implement Hanzawa innit. idk.Overall: Watch it if u bored its quite funny innit, however it ain't part of main story or non Conan.

Micchiri Neko,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36982/Micchiri_Neko,"[""I started watching this while I was joking around with my brother but there is more to Micchiri Neko than meets the eye.Each episode is roughly 3 minutes long (the ending theme seems longer than the actual episode lol) and is divided into short, random sketches that are cute, funny and basically enjoyable. Very deep-going and important (and sometimes relatable) character info is displayed in between the sketches which makes Micchiri Neko even better! And the jokes aren't that bad either.I recommend this to everyone who wants to turn their brain off and just watch some random scenes of random cute cats doing random things.

It certainly isn\'t for everyone, but if you\'re like me and a lover of cats and anything cute, then you will love it.

Secondly, the puns are delicious. Some of the puns are not easily translated to English, but if you have an intermediate understanding of Japanese you should be able to get most of them. I liked the variety of cats, such...as the Cow Cat and the cat with the chick on its head. Also the voice acting, though scant, is great.

One Piece Movie 03: Chinjuu-jima no Chopper Oukoku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/461/One_Piece_Movie_03__Chinjuu-jima_no_Chopper_Oukoku,"[""One Piece: Chopper Kingdom of Strange Animal Island is like watching an extended episode of the One Piece and that's why it's a worth the watch. In truth fans of One Piece will get a bigger kick out of watching this then people who aren't familiar with the anime, it's more or less made for them. The story in the film is typical One Piece affair with one thing unexpected happening, resulting in the crew trying to resolve the situation while something else happens that will interlock with the main plot and then the situation is sorted through the power of courage and friendship.Watching this...was just like watching the series except with a higher degree of animation and it is the quality of animation that makes the film shine. One Piece episodes around the time of 2002 looked okay but the movie quality allows for some really smooth character animation and richer colours for backgrounds which really adds to the overall experience. The characters in the film are just as good as they are in the series and in terms of sound and music they happen to be in good supply too. Overall I really liked the film just because it was One Piece in a higher quality animation; it's definitely worth the watch if you can't get enough of the One Piece adventures. was just like watching the series except with a higher degree of animation and it is the quality of animation that makes the film shine.

However, the movie is just 55 minutes long and you can watch it if you have seen/read at least until Drum Island arc, when Tony Tony Chopper joins the crew.In this review I will talk about One Piece 3rd movie and first of all, I have to say that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE One Piece, but this film just pissed me off. This morning I decided to watch the first OP film...and I enjoyed it a lot, so I binged two more. I just hope it doesnt keep getting worse, as I plan to watch them all.So the movie starts the same way the other two did: The mujiwaras go after a treasure (what?) and they end up helping the good people defeating the bad guys. I have zero complainments about that, its a long running shonen movie so I didnt expect Toei to surprise me in that aspect. Then, why am I that triggered if I didnt expect anything from Toei? Well, lets talk about it.The film\'s MC is supposed to be Chopper, as he is isolated from the crew and he is proclaimed as the king of the animal island. Then, why does he end up in a second place? Does every OP story arc - or movie - need the monster trio to have a fight?Toei missed a great opportunity to develop Chopper and they didnt take advantage of it. But if you think a little bit about it... Chopper DID receive a development in this movie but, does it make sense?In Drum Island, we meet Tony Tony Chopper, a timid reindeer with self-esteem issues, that keep being a coward until Arabasta arc, when he gets developed after watching Ussop suffering. So, if this film takes place after Drum Island (remember that this arc is part of the Arabasta saga, but occurs before the Arabasta arc) why does he overcome his personal problems dealing with the villains? It just doesnt make sense in the OP timeline (well, only few things in this series does make sense).I love Chopper, but if you are going to let him behind after putting his name in the fucking title and you wont respect the canon timeline, I dont want him to be the ""protagonist"". Just fuck you Toei.Early OP villains arent the best of the show, but the enemies of the movies are just pathetic. First movie had a nice story and it was related to some canon characters like Woonan and second one at least had some good characters as Borodo. But if you dont have a good story nor charismatic characters, the TRASH villains take more and more importance. Dude just give the guy the violin violin no mi so, at least, he doesnt rely on improvised power-ups.As I already said, this movie does not have good characters. You have the mujiwaras, your typical OP child with a sad backstory, 2 weird animals that can talk and 3 sad villains. The rest are just animals that doesnt even talk. Trash out of 10 for the characters.The first thing I noticed when I started this film was: why the fuck are the strawhats shining? are they using lotions now? The art style is so bad it made me cringe for the 10 first minutes of the movie. About the OST, I cant deny that OP soundtrack is amazing, but as a guy that has seen this show twice and that listens to it while studying I can say Im a little bit bored of some pieces.In conclussion, this is the worst of the 3 first OP movies and I cant believe that something will be worse than this piece of shit. Hey, at least it was funny, they made strawhats interactions believable.As always, I find myself losing time in MAL in exam time, I hope that some of you made it to the end.

Nothing special, nothing notable.Nevertheless, I can not deny that music in general , in this movie, liberates a very nice nostalgic feeling, which make me think of an pleasant 80\'s OST!•Character (01/10):(I do not talk about One Piece\'s character in general, but only about those who appear in this movie.)They are all PATHETIC.Mobambi, the main character in this film is annoying as f... and his story is just ridiculous. We don\'t care about him, and we\'ll never be.Beside, we don\'t care about animals, because they\'re not talking, and because they are useless.Furthermore, the wicked.... any charisma, useless, as weak as an atrophied cow.... I just want to forget them.•Enjoyment (02/10):This movie is annoying, frustrating, boring...I never managed to get into it , and the time seemed interminable .•Overall (02/10):""One Piece: Chinjuujima no Chopper Oukoku"" is a bad One Piece movie, and a very very very bad movie in general.Even if you want to watch every One Piece movies, I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU TO WATCH IT.

They messed up the crew roster though; there should be Vivi in there too but they chose not to add her. Probably because she was so useless, lol. Just like all movies, it is a filler mission with a good budget and a simplistic plot. The story is just about the Strawhat Pirates getting to an island full of weird animals, were poachers are looking for some magical horns that will make them powerful and a token kid asks them to help out.This is...by far the most unimpressive premise of all the movies since there is absolutely nothing grand scaled going on here. Ok, supposed the bad guy is going to be super powerful if he finds the horns but even after he succeeds he is nothing before Luffy’s plot armour. Just imagine that although Oda takes ideas from these movies into the canon story later on, there was anything worth to tribute here, since everything is so damn simple in terms of themes. There are many islands with jungles and weird monsters in canon anyway.In reality the whole movie is dedicated to the latest addition to the crew, Chopper (and his voice actress). It even tries to build a sort of drama around his personality where he finds a place to call home. There are many animals like himself there and he had the chance to leave the crew and stay there for a happy life. Ok, it is clear that he won’t in the end but supposed the drama is there to make us feel sad or something.As unimpressive as the premise may be, the artwork makes up for it somehow by being extremely detailed and weird. I mean, damn, there are so many colours and weird animals in here to give you a seizure. The screen is constantly filled with a hundred things to look at and there is even a weird orchestra of villains that mesmerize you with their song. It all feels very quirky for a shounen adventure and I guess that is what makes this movie eye-catchy but otherwise boring for most of the target audience. The action is after all closer to crazy than cool and personally I didn’t like them at all. And the monsters felt like ugly aliens so I almost ended up hated them. So in all, it is not just another passable movie but also something you will most likely dislike in overall.Oh and don’t miss the special short that comes with the movie. “Soccer King of Dreams” may only be 5 minutes long but has some really good jokes in it.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 9/10Analysis: General Artwork 2/2, Character Figures 2/2, Backgrounds 2/2, Animation 2/2, Visual Effects 1/2SOUND SECTION: 6/10Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 2/4, Sound Effects 2/3STORY SECTION: 4/10Analysis: Premise 1/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 1/2, Plausibility 0/2, Conclusion 1/2CHARACTER SECTION: 4/10Analysis: Presence 2/2, Personality 0/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 0/2, Catharsis 1/2VALUE SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Historical Value 0/3, Rewatchability 0/3, Memorability 1/4ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Art 1/1, Sound 0/2, Story 0/3, Characters 0/4VERDICT: 4/10 by far the most unimpressive premise of all the movies since there is absolutely nothing grand scaled going on here.

So in all, it is not just another passable movie but also something you will most likely dislike in overall.Oh and don’t miss the special short that comes with the movie. “Soccer King of Dreams” may only be 5 minutes long but has some really good jokes in it.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 9/10Analysis: General Artwork 2/2, Character Figures 2/2, Backgrounds 2/2, Animation 2/2, Visual Effects 1/2SOUND SECTION: 6/10Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 2/4, Sound Effects 2/3STORY SECTION: 4/10Analysis: Premise 1/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 1/2, Plausibility 0/2, Conclusion 1/2CHARACTER SECTION: 4/10Analysis: Presence 2/2, Personality 0/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 0/2, Catharsis 1/2VALUE SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Historical Value 0/3, Rewatchability 0/3, Memorability 1/4ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Art 1/1, Sound 0/2, Story 0/3, Characters 0/4VERDICT: 4/10', ""One Piece Movie 3 : Chinjuujima no Chopper Oukoku ReviewStory (6/10) FairThe story in the third movie of One Piece is fair, as you can tell this movie is Tony Tony Chopper orientated it'll focus on him a lot more than the other characters, which is fine but I do think the fact that Chopper doesn't get the final shine against the main antagonist in this movie it kind of disappointed me. I understand that Chopper isn't that type of character and he did give it his all and when he was actually fighting the main antagonist he was use all of his abilities. I'm...just saying that it would have been cool in that One Piece movie that goes down have the Tony Tony Chopper One Piece movie that he would have been the one to do the concluding blow but it is what it is.Art and Animation (7/10) GoodFor the 3rd movie in the One Piece Movies and literally coming out almost exactly a year after it's previous movie you would assumed that it would look a tad bit more updated than the last one. When it actuality the art style in this one reminds me more of the first movie without it's animation. The animation in this one I think was better than the 2nd movie but not as good as the first. Either way it's still good but for movie standards it definitely could have been better but I think since they are farting these movies out almost annually now that quality when it comes to animation wouldn't be seen that often even by anime movie standards.Sound (8/10) Very GoodMore Specifically (8.5/10) Very Good+The authentic JP voices and BGM are all heard in this movie which required and applaud but the reason why I'm giving this section just a little extra points is because of the outro music played at the end of the movie stood out to me it was very very good.Characters (9/10) GreatThe Straw Hat Crew is slowly getting bigger as this is the first movie Chopper debuts in. All of the characters we know up to this point are present and are entertaining nothing really wrong with them. The movie characters and villains ok not better than the previous movies but not bad enough to nitpick on any level in my opinion.Enjoyment (7/10) GoodThis movie didn't have me at the edge of my seat but it didn't put me to sleep either. It was entertaining enough for me not to feel like I wasted my time with it. I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if someone ask me how I enjoyed I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy it. The movie was over before I knew it so it didn't felt like it dragged on anywhere so that's a good thing in my book because to other two I felt had that issue to an extent.Overall (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.50/10) Good+Since we are around the point where these movies are going to come out annually I'm sure the quality most likely will drop. I've heard the only two movies I should really judge is Strong World and Film Z any other One Piece movie is debatable if they can be considered recommendation quality and so far I can agree with this statement if you are a fan of One Piece I can so give it a shot in the dark with this one but if you are looking for something really good this might not suffice you on that level but it's not bad if that counts for anything. just saying that it would have been cool in that One Piece movie that goes down have the Tony Tony Chopper One Piece movie that he would have been the one to do the concluding blow but it is what it is.Art and Animation (7/10) GoodFor the 3rd movie in the One Piece Movies and literally coming out almost exactly a year after it's previous movie you would assumed that it would look a tad bit more updated than the last one.

Consequently, I went into it with pretty much zero expectations but was pleasantly surprised; though it’s not cinema gold, Chopper’s Kingdom on the Island of Strange Animals was far more enjoyable than I thought it would be.The plot is lackluster, and definitely the weakest aspect of the film. Honestly, one could probably tell that from the title. The narrative is silly and convoluted and does not fit in with the One Piece universe, which is saying something since the One Piece universe allows for a lot of silliness. The...villains and movie-exclusive side characters are weak and unmemorable, and the two primary talking animal characters just come off as pointless.Bonds between nakama are pretty much the backbone of One Piece, carrying the audience through occasional bouts of mediocrity. It is undoubtedly the most important aspect of the show and all of the franchise’s additional installments. What is great about this movie is that the chemistry between  the Straw Hats is very natural, and touching more times than one would expect. Sanji and Zoro stand out the most in that regard. Everyone has a role in the plot, even though they don’t all get fight scenes. Luffy is actually the one crew member that stands out the least; Luffy is his normal lovely Luffy self and Mayumi Tanaka is a goddess as usual, but he does not do anything out of the ordinary when it comes to his role in the story.Fight scenes in this movie are short and generally unimpressive, but they are still fun to watch. Fights including Sanji and Zoro pretty much always have some pay off. Zoro’s last little battle with one of the henchmen was definitely neat, and Sanji’s was as well. Mainly because of  the return of a certain princely alter ego. Unnecessary, but still magnificent.As a side note, the ending credits are cute and honestly justify watching the movie anyway, though I am a sucker for stuff like that.Though the plot of Chopper’s Kingdom on the Island of Strange Animals is lacking, strong character interactions and entertaining fight scenes almost eclipse it and make this movie worth watching. My overall rating for it would be much higher if the plot was even the slightest bit stronger. villains and movie-exclusive side characters are weak and unmemorable, and the two primary talking animal characters just come off as pointless.Bonds between nakama are pretty much the backbone of One Piece, carrying the audience through occasional bouts of mediocrity.

Worst One Piece ever!Jokes aside, one thing that cannot be denied is that the setup is pretty forced. Chopper\'s cowardice is turned up to 11 so that he can go through a very obvious arc of becoming more courageous, which will leave him... pretty much where he already was in the series. (Seriously, did we just forget about the ass-kicking he delivered in his introductory arc?) The way he\'s mistaken for a king by all the animals is also more than a little convenient. (I\'ve wanted someone to...make that kind of pun ever since I learned that the Japanese word for king is hou, (pronounced ""aw"",) but still.)But beyond that, the film really isn\'t that bad. The story is silly for sure, but it\'s an excuse for wacky adventures rather than a string of action scenes, (like in Clockwork Island Adventure,) which is what I think the more lighthearted parts of One Piece should be. I can understand not liking it, especially as this film came out during the Alabasta arc, which was a lot more interesting and had a lot more going on for it, but for what it is, I find the comedy of this film pretty good with some genuine laughs in places and a delightfully silly villain. Sanji in particular had some good moments, particularly as he took offense from someone calling themself the most handsome man in the world.  The humor is helped by the animation taking a step up and being much more creative and expressive than in previous film.There\'s also the scene where Sanji and Zoro fight the villain\'s henchmen. At first I thought it was a bit weird that Zoro was fighting a guy who kicks and Sanji was fighting a guy using a sword, but it actually lead to a pretty nice moment showing that the two secretly respect each other that complemented their relationship pretty well in my opinion.This film also made me realize how much of a mess the writing of Clockwork Island Adventure was by not being full of things that didn\'t go anywhere. A good example is the villain eating horns, which in stark contrast to the villain of the first film\'s obsession with gold actually has a reason behind it that\'s relevant to the plot, so it\'s not just a weird quirk for the sake of it, (even if it is indeed a very weird quirk).If there is downside with the story, it\'s that even though it\'s fine for the story just to be an excuse for shenanigans, the story does feel a bit empty. The film is clearly an excuse to cash in on the marketability of Chopper, which isn\'t really a problem since he\'s a good character and Ikue Ōtani is really selling it here, (not that she usually isn\'t,) but they don\'t really do anything new or interesting with him. Most of all, the emotional investment just isn\'t there. I think the character of Mobambi, (yes, that really is his name,) is supposed to carry the emotional weight in the same that Tobio and Ganzo from the first film and Akisu and Boroudo from the second film did, but even by those characters\' standards, he\'s pretty simple. Those other characters at least had the advantage of already having known each other for years, but in this film they try to immediately create a relationship between Chopper and Mobambi despite them not spending much meaningful time together and Mobambi mostly just insisting that the two are friends for no reason, and that just doesn\'t work. It does reassure me a bit that Luffy actually calls Mobambi out on this by saying that just being with someone doesn\'t make you friends and that Mobambi does try to act on that later, but it\'s still hard to care about the relationship of two characters who have absolutely no chemistry. Say what you will about the characters from the previous films, it\'s perfectly understandable not to find them that engaging, but at the very least they did have chemistry.This is the third One Piece film directed by Junji Shimizu, and these three films have had in common that they\'re all very simple and not that interesting, but enjoyable enough for One Piece fans. It will, however, be interesting to see what a different director can bring to the table with the next film.Story: 3/10Writing: 6/10Animation: 7/10Voice acting: 9/10Personal enjoyment: 6.5/10Overall score: 6/10 make that kind of pun ever since I learned that the Japanese word for king is hou, (pronounced ""aw"",) but still.)But beyond that, the film really isn\'t that bad.

I can see that it disregards the canon timeline and just goes with the silliness while even including potential spoilers. But it's still the silliness that is always part of One Piece with the adventure spirit and the friendship among the crew always in the forefront. It's not the best but still maintains the spirit of the anime in some form and I was smiling throughout it. But it is pretty clear that this was not part of the vision of the mangaka and is more or less a short filler movie. "", ""I enjoyed this one. It was a little more of what I was hoping for from these standalone, mini adventure movies. It does start off with one of the things I complained about with the first two-- that it literally just throws you into the adventure the second the movie starts... (I just feel like it would flow a little bit better if they eased into it. Like, 30 seconds of just a scene of everyday life aboard the ship before Nami pulls out the map or something. That's all I'm asking.)But this one was a lot more fun. And had a specific focus....It's the movie meant to be watched right after Chopper joins the crew, so it felt really fitting that it was focused on Chopper. I think it would be pretty cool if they did something like this for all the new characters who get introduced.

But, I gotta say... the art style gave it new life and Tony being there with them did as well! It was fun.There are enough inconsistencies with the canon that it's laughable. I know it's supposed to be after the Drum Island Arc, but before the Alabasta Arc, just without Vivi. I look at it as a cliche yes, but giving us what it would be like if it was only them together. Since there's other characters that overlay eventually and being only finished with the Alabasta Arc so...far it seems that we might not see what it's like with the OG strawhats and only Tony Chopper as a new addition. Seeing only them working together on a run of the mill find island/save people scenario. :) You can also look at it as an alternate universe thing. Like if they only dropped Vivi off instead of helping her or somthing. This makes the most sense as to why Chopper is still struggling so much with thinking about Doctor, we get a flashback of the Jolly Roger and he pulls out a pic of it from in his hat.Just the few inconsistencies I noticed.How are they using a map in the grand line? I thought with the Log Pose that's the only way to get to the next island. ?Nami doesn't have her Clima TactSanji has his glasses still (maybe he could have kept them from getting them in alabasta?)oh yeah and they call him prince again lolNo vivi, or othersBut don't you just love it when a series makes you think that hard about fitting it into timelines and what not? I do!But a few other things I loved this episode..Tony Chopper with The Straw Hats Jolly Roger as a cape! w/ a flower crown! Figurine PleaseI loved all there clothes, you can tell they added some style to each one!The Hoofmark Petal Attack the Chopper does (didn't realize they look the same!!! Interesting!)Nami and Usopp's Teamwork with the Horn Eaters, They are just so great together!The Animals my goodness they are so bizarre! I love them, the animators looked like they just had a ton of fun lol they look like the animals on Episode 16: You Are a Special Animal! Gaimon and His Bizarre Friends.And the former King of the Animals was SO beatuiful!!Overall alot of fun and looked so good.

The lighting and bold color scheme made every scene feel reminiscent of a 90s toon. From the rich reds to the deep purples, this movie feels like the embodiment of a lively summer day. The lighting shifts dramatically through the movie, which transforms the scenes of the movie into like paintings. Even with the already colorful tone of anime and cartoons, this one stands apart. Or maybe I\'m just a sucker for sunset colors.It was cool that Chopper got a spotlight story. The supporting cast of...animals and the little kid were kinda annoying though. Anyway, this movie got a bit darker than I expected. People get severely beat up. Even chopper and the little kid get walloped. Though I was disappointed that a lot of the fights were resolved by ""willpower"" rather than any tactics or anything creative. That\'s kinda par for the course with one piece.The main villain always spouting off his plans was pretty funny. I always like the sillier one piece villainsThe ED was bomb though.

Project A-Ko,https://myanimelist.net/anime/212/Project_A-Ko,"[""Stupid but somehow lovable. Space transvestites, great blink-and-you'll-miss-it animation, bad synthpop, and giant robots every 10 minutes FOR NO REASON. At a brisk 80 minutes, it just flies by and is a lot of fun. As a child of the 80s, everything about how this movie looks and sounds just resonates with me. "", 'Overview:Time to review a true blast from the ancient past!History:Project A-KO came out in 1986. It was originally supposed to be part of an early hentai anthology called ""Cream Lemon"" that started in 1984 with ""Lolita: the anime"". Wow! If you thought Alan Moore\'s response to Watchmen the movie was bad, Vladimir Nabokov\'s response to the first Loli anime would have been on a different league of anger. He might have even gone full Super Slav in sheer rage.Anyways, A-KO was changed at the last moment to be a zany spoof of all the popular anime of the time. However, the nudity and lesbian...relationships were still left in...because why not? A-Ko spoofs Fist of the North Star, Space  Battleship Yamato, Captain Harlock, and many others. Despite being a very goofy and frankly idiotic anime, it left a massive impact on comedy anime for years to come. The whole scene with the schoolgirl running with toast in her mouth has actually become a cliche at this point! That\'s how many anime ripped off A-KO!Reception in the West:Generation X: Loved itGeneration Y or ""Millenials"": indifferentGeneration Z: What the FUCK is this old piece of shit?!!Story and characters:The main characters are the energetic and super powered A-ko, the devious robot inventor B-ko, and the incredibly obnoxious C-ko. To get this out of the way, the suffix Ko is often attached to female characters. The names A-ko, B-ko, C-ko is animator shorthand for unnamed background characters. This was one of the first inside jokes in anime history aimed squarely at fellow anime workers.The plot is that A-Ko and C-ko must constantly try get to school on time while fighting the robots that B-ko makes each morning. B-ko is the class bully, token rich kid, and also a lesbian who is after C-ko. One day, aliens invade the city to retrieve their long lost princess, who turns out to be C-ko. This means A-ko and B-ko must put aside their rivalry to defeat the aliens and rescue C-ko. The status quo is quickly restored and A-ko is revealed to be the daughter of Superman. The End.Animation:Fairly decent for its time. Really nothing spectacular today although it helps if you are a nostalgic sucker for all hand drawn animation.Music and sound:The English dub I watched was representative of other Central Park Media titles, which is to say pretty bad. The music is ok, but nothing great.Overall:Project A-ko was a monumentally influential anime in its day despite its odd beginnings. It set the standard for spoof anime and its influence can be seen in Excel Saga, Kill la Kill, FLCL, Gintama, and many more. Despite this, A-ko hasn\'t aged particularly well in my opinion. Most young anime fans wouldn\'t even understand what shows A-ko was trying to spoof. The comedy that worked for A-ko has been beaten to death by later anime. The random nudity isn\'t as titillating and awesome as it was in 1986, because nudity is FAR more common in anime these days. It is an interesting series from a historical perspective, but I really wouldn\'t rank it as one of the funniest anime I\'ve ever seen.

This was one of the first anime movies I ever rented on VHS from Blockbuster, back when dinosaurs ruled the earth. (man I feel old) And while it may not have aged well at all, it may still be worth a peek for some, if nothing else to laugh at its content.Story: 6/10If you are unfamiliar with this old time franchise, it can best be described as very exaggerated and over the top! Well in this OVA movie earth is living a peaceful life after many years of war with an old alien race, until a mysterious ""new"" alien race threatens it!...Now earths only hope comes in the way of 16 year old A-ko, she is no ordinary girl though--for she has super human strength (literally). When the new alien force arrives it is up to her to save the city. This is where things really get weird too, the alien force consists of males that dress in female clothing! Now I would like to think they are simply cross dressers, but since one is overly muscular and the other is very scrawny looking--it would appear to simply be part of the humor. What follows is non-stop over the top action and comedy. The main plot is never really explained very well, for one thing we never even really know just why A-ko has these super powers to begin with. She just sort of...does! There are a few bits and piece of echhi style humor in the story, nothing really to over the top though, mostly consisting of a brief panty or cleave shot every now and then. Again, very brief though. You get some decent action scenes and explosions that come with it, but nothing is ever handled with any sort of fury in mind. As the main plot to this series is ""action style comedy."" So even the fight scenes themselves can be down right cheesy at times. Along with the alien force, A-ko must also handle her rival ""B-ko, "" who is trying to take her best friend ""C-ko"" away from here. (Again with the whole corny humor, only this time with the alphabet) When watching this show you simply have to know what to expect, and thus be in the mood for its content. If you like your action over the top and not taken seriously, then you’ll love this movie. Now don\'t get me wrong, I am not saying that all the action scenes are goofy, because you do get a few good action scenes here. Its just that a majority of them take a more comical style of approach, or do indeed end in one.Depending if you get the edited version or not, there is a brief scene at the beginning that shows A-ko topless. It is very brief and never happens again, but just be aware of that fact.Side Note: The project A-ko series comes in the form of 5 OVA style movies. However they don\'t always follow the same linear plot line. As some of the titles have the characters in different situations, some of which they are complete strangers to one another. Think of it as an alternate realty of sorts. (for the record, this is the first one)Artwork: 8/10Well 1986 was a pretty long time go, so don’t expect to see the most sharpest of special effects. This again is another one of those titles that you have to take its quality upon its production year. Meaning that this OVA looked great for its time. Nice explosion affects, somewhat unique style facial expressions and character design. Which I have to say was pretty popular in this era. The background can be pretty lifeless at times, but never really come off as bad.Soundtrack: 6/10Well you get quite a bit of 80’s style pop in this title, if you’re not a fan of that to begin with then you might want to put the sound low when viewing this. Its not really bad or anything, it just doesn’t give off any kind of distinctness to it. Sadly I have only watched the dub to this anime, since back then only dub VHS versions were available at video stores. I didn’t really like it at all, the English voice actors sounded too weak, and you could tell that they were simply saying lines from a script. I would like to think the the sub version is better, but it may be pretty weak in the audio clarity department, since this was made a long time ago. (other titles such as Sailor Moon suffered from the same thing back then)Characters: 6/10They are by no means awful, just pretty shallow as a whole. They don’t really have a certain depth-ness to them, and are not really explained very well. We never really get to know just who A-ko really is, or any kind of history behind her. Most are simply thrown into the show in attempts to make you laugh. Which to the series credit, is what its really all about. Though in truth we do get a little bit more info on ""B-ko"" than anyone else, which explains who she is over all, and what she is after.Bottom Line: 6/10Project A-ko might be too cheesy and over the top for newer viewers out there. But if you’re interested in its content I mentioned then by all means you should take a look. The OVAs are only about and hours worth, and may draw some people into the older generation of anime. While its not really a solid watch compared to other titles in this era, its also not really a bad one either. So long as you can appreciate its whole campy style of content.. Now earths only hope comes in the way of 16 year old A-ko, she is no ordinary girl though--for she has super human strength (literally). When the new alien force arrives it is up to her to save the city. This is where things really get weird too, the alien force consists of males that dress in female clothing! Now I would like to think they are simply cross dressers, but since one is overly muscular and the other is very scrawny looking--it would appear to simply be part of the humor. What follows is non-stop over the top action and comedy. The main plot is never really explained very well, for one thing we never even really know just why A-ko has these super powers to begin with. She just sort of...does! There are a few bits and piece of echhi style humor in the story, nothing really to over the top though, mostly consisting of a brief panty or cleave shot every now and then. Again, very brief though. You get some decent action scenes and explosions that come with it, but nothing is ever handled with any sort of fury in mind. As the main plot to this series is ""action style comedy."" So even the fight scenes themselves can be down right cheesy at times. Along with the alien force, A-ko must also handle her rival ""B-ko, "" who is trying to take her best friend ""C-ko"" away from here.

This is probably due to the fact that it was released at a time where most localized anime geared for adults was rather mature and gritty (think Evangelion or Cowboy Bebop,) while this was more immature and lighthearted. Regardless of why other people like it, I did not enjoy it; finding it to be rather boring and uninspiring.There\'s nothing particularly good about the story or plot, but that\'s forgivable seeing how this is a comedy. It\'s about three highschool girls, A-ko, B-ko, and C-ko,...(literally “Girl A,” Girl B,” and “Girl C.”) A-Ko and C-ko are best friends–the former of which happens to have super strength and speed. B-ko is A-ko\'s rival from kindergarten, and has a crush on C-ko, and thus uses her mad scientists skills to constantly challenge A-ko in an attempt to win C-ko\'s heart. There\'s also an alien invasion later on.The biggest problem with this film is that more often than not, it\'s unfunny and doesn\'t deliver as a comedy. Supposedly there is a fist full of references parodying various anime from the 1980s, and a large portion of the comedy relies on these references. If this is true, than that would explain why I didn\'t really find Project A-ko to be very enjoyable. As far as Japanese cartoons go, I\'m not exactly well cultured when it comes to anything prior to the \'90s, so most of these references were invisible to me. I did catch the jibe they made at Fist of the North Star, which I found pretty hilarious–so had I been able to understand all the other references, maybe I would have liked this more. I doubt it would have much of a difference however.Perhaps it\'s not the best idea for me to criticize for not ""understanding"" it, but I can at least say this: comedies that rely on parodying other stories tend to not age well. As time passes, less and less people will be able to appreciate the work, until eventually only a niche group of people will be able to truly appreciate it. Some more time later and maybe no one will understand it–which is actually kind of depressing, but hey, that\'s how it is.As I said, the story and plot is nothing special, and this in part due to the fact that all of the characters are rather shallow and uninteresting. B-ko is your typical one-dimensional villain/rival, who really wants nothing more but to kill A-ko and win the heart of C-ko–which was probably supposed to be funny, but wasn\'t. C-ko in particular is rather annoying and unlikable, as all she ever does is act like some sort of seven year old, and cries whenever someone calls her out for being a cloudcukoolander. Which again, was probably supposed to be funny, but wasn\'t. A-ko would be the best of the characters, but only because there\'s nothing particularly good or bad about her.The only thing about Project-Ako that\'s consistently good would be the huge action sequence in the final thirty minutes of the film. It starts with A-ko and B-ko\'s final duel, and than sort of escalates once the city is attacked by aliens. It\'s ridiculous and exciting, and actually pretty enjoyable. One scene that stand outs is when A-ko ascends to the floating alien spaceship by hopping on and off missiles that are being shot in her direction.Since Project A-ko is considered to be one of the classics, you might want to watch it anyways–just don\'t except anything to be enjoyable apart from the action sequences.

It was the first animation I had ever seen and I immediately became a fan after. I was very young when I watched it on the Sci-Fi Channel and thought it was an incredible watch for its time. The strange thing about Project A-ko is that of the story in which is probably a dreadful and weird experience for an audience. Nevertheless, it doesn't take away from the outstanding work displayed. It's got great action sequences, hilarious comedy and Anime art at 100%. This Japanese animation would have been the...perfect Anime if it had a better story. However, I believe the story that they put together here is what accidentally made it into the classic it is today.

So if you haven't seen Project A-ko, you're in for a wild ride."", 'Project A-Ko was a 1986 screwball/ sci-fi comedy anime film made in mind to parody popular anime genres of its era such as school comedies, mecha titles, and space operas. The film focuses on high school student A-Ko Magami attempting to go through her everyday routines as a student with her close friend C-Ko Kotobuki, while possessing superhuman physical capabilities and evading the wealthy B-Ko Daitokuji who has romantic affections for C-Ko. Complicating things is the presence of a mysterious alien ship seemingly observing the actions of A-Ko and C-Ko.I’ve heard a good deal about Project A-Ko being a gateway drug of sorts for anime...fans who lived through the late 1980s to early 1990s when this and the later four installments of the A-Ko franchise got releases in Japan and America. How receptive you may be to Project A-Ko’s humor will come down to how well you appreciate its manic comedy and picking up on the nods and references to popular anime titles and storytelling cliches of the film’s era, so it may not be everyone’s cup of tea. One amusing fact I was not aware of with A-Ko until I researched it was that it was originally going to be animated as part of the Cream Lemon hentai OVA series before the decision was made to make it a mainstream anime film.Far as my reception to Project A-Ko went, I was largely entertained with it. I did enjoy the anime’s showings of A-Ko’s ridiculous physical abilities causing destruction to her surroundings and her later skirmishes with B-Ko and her goons. There is a rather funny and sly cameo appearance revealing who A-Ko’s parents are at the end of the film, so keep a look out for that. Fair warning to those who hate it, the film does come with a decent amount of fan service with a good deal of upskirt shots with a number of female characters, some onscreen nudity, and skimpy attire worn at points.The film had some misses with its humor for me. I wasn’t a fan of C-Ko’s character, as she came off quite obnoxious with playing the character type of the lead character’s energetic and childish childhood friend. I did also get more creeped out than amused with the anime featuring a couple heavily muscular girls who look more like guys with how they are designed, most notably one of B-Ko’s flunkies meant to be an obvious nod to Fist of the North Star’s Kenshiro.While I did enjoy Project A-Ko for the most part thanks to its manic humor and parodies of popular anime genres of its era, I think a good deal of this came down to me appreciating the manic approach of its humor and having dabbled into enough older anime titles to know what the film was making nods to. Those not fans of the manic humor approach to the film or haven’t dabbled enough into older anime from the early to mid 1980s may not get as immersed into it, so mileage may vary with fan reception to it. fans who lived through the late 1980s to early 1990s when this and the later four installments of the A-Ko franchise got releases in Japan and America.

The studio is in fact a popular 80s hentai studio, also known to have produced the famous ""Golden Boy"" ova adaptation, considered the first ecchi anime ever made.However, the studio will decide at the last minute to produce it like a normal anime movie instead of a porn, producing one of the first mecha animes example and...as well one of the first anime with yuri elements, even though the presence of a lesbian character was made purely for fanservice.Also, an important thing to remember, is that the teacher of the main characters of the movie-series looks a lot like our beloved 80s idol ""Creamy Mami"".The protagonist of the story is, like the name says, ""A-ko"", who true name is in reality Eiko Magami. The movie begins with her waking up and having breakfast like a normal teenager \'till she realizes she is late for school: that\'s when we\'ll discover that she has incredible super powers, like super-sonic speed or amazing force. She will in fact arrive at school just in time taking along her best friend Shiiko Kotobuki (C-ko) who is an annoying crybaby who only thinks of having fun and cute things and that also doesn\'t have any powers in contrast to A-ko.Everything will be pretty normal, except for the fact that the smart, rich and arrogant classmate Biko Daitokuji (B-ko) will start observing C-ko insistently, and we will later understand that she has a crush on her.She will then try to take A-ko away from her, by using her mecha robots or her submitted (a trans woman who has an incredible force), however A-ko will slay all of them.We will later discover that B-ko and A-ko have a matter to settle from 10 years ago: B-ko in fact, used to bully C-ko because she was madly in love with her, and one time A-ko will save her from her bullying. They then became really close friends never leaving each other\'s sides, and that will made B-ko jealous.That\'s why she launched a challenge to A-ko, saying that the prize would have been C-ko, so that she coud have her all for herself.However, the day of the challenge, A-ko will transfer and go to another school along with C-ko, so she didn\'t come to settle matters with B-ko.She will never forget that, and she will always wait to see them again thinking on how to beat A-ko.She will then decide to face her hand-to-hand with a very revealing outfit (of course made for fanservice). However A-ko, despite B-ko being very strong, will obviously beat her.Anyway, this is only the first movie, in fact its end will show B-ko observing A-ko, making us understand that she hasn\'t given up yet and that it awaits us other battles between them  two.This movie is pretty stupid and has nothing of special, however I love its dumb and predictable humor.What I like the most about this series is the art of the 80s and the music, I don\'t even know how many times I\'ve listened to the soundtrack.What I also like, is that this movie despite being old, isn\'t ashamed of portraiting women ""less feminine"" and more strong, having the capacities and super powers that male characters of the 80s animes used to have. We would always see heroines like Creamy Mami or Minky Momo, all portrayed very feminine and delicate and often helped by their love interest. However is A-ko who will save her male crush in one of the other sequels of the series.Also even though it was mainly fanservice, it must have been pretty difficult to release a 80s anime with yuri elements, also from what I know, the studio worked a lot of years on it, so it was probably produced during the 70s.It\'s not a deep movie that makes you reflect like I usually like, however I thought it was very good despite being an 80s anime. Even though I\'m a big fan of Creamy Mami, I never gave to the show more than 6, so it really surprised me on how I could give an 80s anime more than 7 along with Kaze To Ki No Uta OVA or Studio Ghibli Movies.It was really entertaining and well-made, so I recommend it for the ones who wants a good laugh or that don\'t know what to watch and how to spend their time, or that simply want an approach to 80s animes.If you want an entertaining one, then this one is for you!Thanks for reading my review, and as always, have a great time on mal! <3 as well one of the first anime with yuri elements, even though the presence of a lesbian character was made purely for fanservice.Also, an important thing to remember, is that the teacher of the main characters of the movie-series looks a lot like our beloved 80s idol ""Creamy Mami"".The protagonist of the story is, like the name says, ""A-ko"", who true name is in reality Eiko Magami.

The main reason to seek out and enjoy this film is for the fact that it revels in the self-referential nature of anime. The more of an otaku you are, particularly of things released by before this came out, the more you will ostensibly get out of it. Although, certainly, you can notice things that were influenced by this in turn. I liked the Gurren Lagann drill mech.I think the reason this has a high reputation is because of the sci-fi action direction it takes in the second half. Some of that material, such as A-ko hopping on the fighter...jets or the part where A-ko and B-ko fought in the middle of the war between the Earthlings and aliens, was extremely good. They just went wild on it. But, in general, action alone doesn't sustain my interest very well. And it took its sweet time getting to that point; I started watching this movie in April and got bored in the first half. When I restarted it, I fell asleep at some point. (Which shouldn't be taken as a strong objection. Dealing with COVID stress every day has made me tire easily. I somewhat often fall asleep early for no reason.)Love the character designs inspired by Rumiko Takahashi's work.This is worth watching if you like 80s anime. But it's not, like, spectacular for me. jets or the part where A-ko and B-ko fought in the middle of the war between the Earthlings and aliens, was extremely good. They just went wild on it.

And then there are aliens who are looking for somebody. What these two stories have to do with one another? Well, that's the problem: for most of the movie...nothing. Only in the last third do things get together, which for me, is a bit too late. Up untill that point it felt like two different anime cut together. Maybe it would have been better if they concentrated on just one of these, as with the final product, neither feels completely fleshed out.5/10Art:Well, it's...the 80s, so you surely wouldn't expect something breathtaking (*cough* Akira *cough*), but for its time, it's absolutely okay. The manly girls were pretty funny, and the brief space scenes were cool.7/10Sound:The soundtrack is pretty cool, totally 80s (if you like that). The voice acting was good, though I really wanted to strangle C-ko for being so squeeky. They overdid it a little with comedic sound effects in my eyes (or ears?), but it's not annoying or anything.8/10Characters:While C-ko could go die for all I care, A-ko and B-ko filled out their roles well. B-Kos sidekicks were quite funny, but they didn't have much screentime. Speaking of that, the aliens had no time whatsoever to develop a character, which was a shame as they seemed interesting, but were only in it for the showdown.6/10Enjoyment:This movie wasn't horrible or anything, but it felt a lot longer than it actually was. Maybe that's because of the incoherent storytelling. When A-ko was finally starting to get good, it was over already. Maybe making an OVA series with mulitiple episodes would have been a better idea. The way it stands, it leaves me quite unaffected. Not bored or angry, but unaffected.5/10Overall:6.2/10 the 80s, so you surely wouldn't expect something breathtaking (*cough* Akira *cough*), but for its time, it's absolutely okay. The manly girls were pretty funny, and the brief space scenes were cool.7/10Sound:The soundtrack is pretty cool, totally 80s (if you like that). The voice acting was good, though I really wanted to strangle C-ko for being so squeeky. They overdid it a little with comedic sound effects in my eyes (or ears?), but it's not annoying or anything.8/10Characters:While C-ko could go die for all I care, A-ko and B-ko filled out their roles well.

Thus, there’s a lot of nostalgia associated with it, and it has a bit of a cult following.The story follows A-Ko, a girl with superhuman strength; her best friend, the whiny and clingy C-Ko; and B-Ko, the rich, mad scientist-like girl trying to kill A-Ko and take C-Ko for herself. Concurrent to the fights between A-Ko and B-Ko, which seem to...grow more outrageous and over the top by the day, the movie follows a group of strange and powerful aliens trying to find their princess, who apparently crash-landed on Earth 16 years prior, and they’ll stop at nothing to bring her back with them. These two stories intersect, leading to the grandiose finale.The basic elements of the overall plot make sense, but leave me with more questions than answers. I was left wondering why all of this happened in the first place, why the princess is who she is, why the aliens are the way they are, and how the streets/walls in the city managed to get rebuilt every time before A-Ko went on her daily destructive run to school. I’m hoping that the subsequent OVAs will shed light on some of these mysteries.I felt that there was a fair amount of tonal whiplash throughout the movie. It starts with a serious tone, as we see a bunch of people wiped out by a mysterious object crashing onto the Earth. Later we see aliens mercilessly blow a spaceship full of people to smithereens, only for the movie to depict the same aliens as funny characters soon after. Overall, the movie is goofy and humorous, so the few scenes where people are killed are somewhat jarring, especially since they aren’t really addressed afterwards.The dialogue is good, but I got the feeling that it’s peppered with a lot of old anime/pop culture references that I’m not aware of, so it comes across as a bit abstract at times if you’re not aware of what’s being referenced.The characters are simple, yet developed enough during the movie’s runtime to be distinctive. The main three are easily memorable, and some of the side characters are as well.The voice acting was decent, but I thought that C-Ko’s voice was annoying, and Mari didn’t have enough lines to emphasize the uniqueness of her voice.As far as other technical aspects go, I was impressed with the music, both the background instrumentals and the theme songs with vocals. The theme songs are sung in English and are catchy tunes in their own right, and the background music fits the scenes it’s used in well.The art is good; I like the character designs, although Mari and D looked a little too similar (I thought they were the same person at first). B-Ko reminded me of one of the main characters of “Blue Sonnet,” a late ‘80s OVA that had a manga running at the time this movie was released. Perhaps B-Ko’s design was a reference to that character, as “Project A-Ko” is full of references to lots of older shows that I just wasn’t able to catch. The designs of the city, the townscape, the school, and the spaceships are all nice.As for the animation, it’s fluid and colorful, and for the most part, it’s good. I noticed there are lots of scenes where characters are yelling but their mouths are closed, though, so I had the impression that relatively minor details may have been overlooked in favor of the “big picture.” I also noticed some blink-and-you’ll-miss-them Easter eggs, including a person’s name tag that says in romanized Japanese something like “I’m the commander; I’m an important person,”  which reminded me of similar Easter eggs in “Gunbuster,” an anime which would come later.Direction-wise, the action scenes are choreographed well and are pleasant to watch. Other scenes are also done well for the most part, except for maybe some of the scenes at the beginning, where I thought things dragged a bit.Regarding objectionable content, there are stereotypical and extraneous nude scenes of a girl getting dressed and bathing, probably owing to this movie’s production origins as an adult anime. There are also upskirt and panty shots galore, more than I’ve seen in any other anime. There’s a scene where a girl stumbles into a room full of dirty underwear. There are characters who look masculine but are actually female, and this is played off as being funny, so the humor in that aspect is outdated. The violence is cartoonish, except for the aforementioned mass death scenes that seemed out of place.Finally, a word of warning — there are a lot of flashing lights in this movie, particularly for a few minutes during the beginning in a scene that takes place in a movie theater.Overall, this historically important anime has good aspects — the music, character design, direction and animation, to name a few — but has some issues with tone and outdated humor which may make people uncomfortable or confused while watching it. I would still recommend seeing “Project A-Ko” as long as you keep an open mind and don’t go in expecting a masterpiece. grow more outrageous and over the top by the day, the movie follows a group of strange and powerful aliens trying to find their princess, who apparently crash-landed on Earth 16 years prior, and they’ll stop at nothing to bring her back with them.

It is good mindless fun if you are in the mood for it. Don’t think about things too hard and you will have a good time.Nostalgia alert: I caught this one on the Sci-Fi Channel back in the 90s. I woke up super early Sunday morning to watch it and loved every minute of it. It was just so much more than the cartoons that I was watching at the time. Ahhh, fond memories.Story 4/10The story is a love triangle between the three main girls. A-Ko is our...super-powered, tomboy school girl. B-Ko is our rich and spoiled, jealous, robot-genius school girl. And C-Ko is the hyper-annoying school girl. They fight. There are robots. And then some space people show up. Don’t worry too much about the plot. It’s all about the comedy and action.Art 7/10This anime was from the 80s and it shows. The characters had big hair and strange noses. It was all hand drawn and looked pretty good for its time.You could tell who the characters were from their designs. Our energetic hero had wild, red hair. The rich girl had long, curly sideburns. The saccharine girl had the flower in her hair. The robots and the machines had good looks and are well-animated. The action was good. The punches, kicks, missiles, and robots had weight and momentum. The knockout moments were impactful.I never thought that any of the images were inconsistent or low-quality. It’s good stuff for the 80s.Sound 6/10The voice acting was good. A-Ko sounded like a cute tomboy. She grunted and shouted with conviction during her fights. C-Ko was gratingly annoying, as intended. B-Ko had some good maniacal laughter.The music was 80s synth-pop. There were a couple English language tracks that played – one during the date scene and the other at the end. My nostalgic self appreciated it.Characters 7/10The characters were fun. The three main characters had their personalities and their play off each other was what this movie was all about. They weren’t given backstories or explained much at all, but it was fine.The school people were forgettable with the exception of the man/woman. And the space people were forgettable with the exception of the man/woman. What was up with the burly men/women?Enjoyment 8/10How much you enjoy this movie is about what type of mood you’re in. If you’re drunk and/or looking to watch schoolgirls fight robots, you’ll have a good time. If you are feeling introspective and are looking for something deep and meaningful, you should probably watch something else.Overall 7/10I had a good time watching it.

People talk about how many references there are to classic Anime, but often these references are superficial not to mention I remember all to well how certain fans...played up how a given show might have references to other shows and if you didn't like the show you obviously didn't know enough about Japanese pop culture to appreciate the Anime.The problem is, a person can actually get the references to the Japanese pop culture and still say the show isn't anything to write home about. Truth is, any show in Japan can make cultural references to the current Japanese pop culture just like any show in America can make references to the current American pop culture. That doesn't make any of these shows good shows, but there's the issue of how these references and handled.And me - I guess my reaction to the references is to bring up the fact I actually loved Captain Harlock - one of the series referenced - to the point I'm attempting to find anything I can, yet the reference to that particular series I found honestly insulting to the Captain Harlock franchise.  The references honestly weren't even remotely funny and felt too much like a young fanfic writers attempt at writing - well, any fanfic which makes reference to current popculture. It's painfully unpleasent.Another painful experience is the whole rivalry going on between A-ko and B-ko, but in cumilation one might say B-ko's character is a painful experience given how unrealistic her rivalry is and how all the crap she pulls goes unnoticed in the same manner nobody really talks about A-ko's powers - except it's worse given the fact she is an outright bully who never develops as a character. Then again, neither does C-ko due to how dumb she is.Then there's the LGBT content. It's rather hard to say it's simply subtext given the implication of the ending reveal, but my ultimate take away honestly resulted in thinking how the show portrays lesbians in a negative light - apparently they're majorly dumb or if they do have any intelligence they are incapable of properly using said intelligence.Of course, then there's the redeeming qualities of the show, one of which is - well, A-ko. A-ko does manage to grow as a character even though it is by the minutest amount. She's also a likable character, which makes her in the very least a character one might watch the movie for - in fact, that's why I stuck around. The climax of the series - let's just say I wished the series had more of that, and a whole lot less of her and B-ko's rivalry. played up how a given show might have references to other shows and if you didn't like the show you obviously didn't know enough about Japanese pop culture to appreciate the Anime.The problem is, a person can actually get the references to the Japanese pop culture and still say the show isn't anything to write home about.

It may not be madcap enough to hold a candle to modern works such as, say, Lego Movie or something, but it's a fine film indeed, and A-Ko, B-Ko, and C-Ko have all since become iconic character archetypes for gay and kinda-gay female leads in anime.What surprises me most is that the entire rest of the...series is actually able to contain the same energy and wackiness that the original has. It's extremely rare for comedies to do as well in its sequels, but Project A-Ko is quite special in that regard. series is actually able to contain the same energy and wackiness that the original has.

A movie like this only comes once in a while, even if it felt like a parody of some sorts.

Most of the scenes from fighting female aliens deployed from another planet to a character in a suit and hat being used for slapstick purposes seem all over the place, but it’s a good show to get through for almost two hours.Project A-Ko is still a memorable hit for the 80’s, even if the plot line for this shows that it’s always love and war between a female interest that doesn’t even remember nor recognize your existence.

"Ququ Bucai, Zaixia Yeguai 2nd Season",https://myanimelist.net/anime/55762/Ququ_Bucai_Zaixia_Yeguai_2nd_Season,"['With the world exposition done in previous season, more stress is being put on the overarching plot of the story.The crisp feeling of discovering a new world fades bit by bit, and storytelling is in my subjective opinion markedly worse than the preceding season.With the plot armor of being fundamentally and inextricably linked to the THE mystery of being isekai-ed, our protagonist uncovers new facets of the plot wherever he goes, despite having no real agency to understand it.Other characters linked to the mystery tend to push the protagonist where he needs to be in order for plot to progress.It is not a good thing...in a show where there is a progressing conspiracy of secret to uncover, and it rightly leaves an unpleasant aftertaste.In a bid to make characters more memorable, majority of them have now been given bargain bin sob story flashbacks, whether the character is freshly introduced or had a role in the first season.This too isn\'t very interesting or pleasant to watch.The worst thing that happened structurally is that the shows battle dynamic shifted from the \'clever MC does the smart thing to win by using his brain\' to a milked to death shounen \'OUR BONDS AREN\'T WEAK ENOUGH TO BE SUPRESSED BY THE DEMON KINGS TYRRANY!!! LET\'S JOIN HANDS AND SHOW OUR FOES THE POWER OF TRUE FRIENDSHIP!\' with a sprinkle of dragon ball powercreep ping-pong (think battles that go ""-HAAAAH, NOW I\'M STRONGER"" ""-ku ku ku, are you sure, hero?! because HAAAAAAAAAAH!!

Musaigen no Phantom World,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31442/Musaigen_no_Phantom_World,"['Over the past few years, I have been a witness to the rapid decline of KyoAni. First came Chuu2, a middling but otherwise inoffensive rom-com. Then came Kyoukai no Kanata, an absolute disaster of writing, and the creaking of KyoAni\'s creative efforts could start to be heard. And now, several more mediocre series later, we have Musaigen no Phantom World, a title so vapid and effortless that I believe KyoAni has finally reached the point of being irredeemable. KyoAni is over. It is over, and it\'s not coming back.If not for the KyoAni name—now worthless— nobody would have cared about what Phantom World has to...offer. It is your typical, uninspired rom-com that we get in the dozens every single year. There is nothing you have not seen here before, and nothing to inspire a viewing aside from the fact that it \'looks and sounds nice\'. They stayed KyoAni on the outside, but on the inside they are merely a shallow, rotting husk of what they used to be.It is not even worth the time to discuss the art of Phantom World. Anyone who has seen even a single KyoAni anime knows exactly what they\'re getting here. Their art no longer impresses me. I am also getting tired of forgiving their shows\' terrible plots and characters just because they happen to look pretty. If all they are now capable of is drawing cute characters and flashy OPs and EDs, then perhaps they should leave anime and go work on manga and TV commercials instead?KyoAni seems to have forgotten what made previous titles like K-ON and Haruhi so successful: characters. There is not a character within the show who is developed in any meaningful way, and only one—Kurumi— is even worth a damn, and that\'s not just because I love twintails and wish to be surrounded by twintailed beauties for the rest of my days. Kurumi is the only one who actually feels like a person and not just an assortment of tropes slapped together (\'cool\', \'big boobs\', \'tsundere\'). She acts remarkably her age; her seiyuu even goes as far as to stutter and poorly enunciate her words, as a girl in primary school would. Minase? I had to look through the character listing to even remember her name.Phantom World has another one of those \'dumb male friend\' characters, similar to Ishiki from Chuu2, but manages to do so little with him that you forget he even exists. Not only is he a waste of space like just about every character in this show, but it is real tiring seeing all these pseudo-harem anime incapable of making a second male character who is actually a competent person and not just background fodder or some dumb, running gag.Ruru, the show\'s mascot character, clearly exists only to sell merchandise and figures. Unlike, say, Tamako Market\'s Dera-chan, who was actually a unique and amusing character, the little fairy here is nothing but an annoyance. Her small size is quite fitting, being little more than a fly buzzing around in the protagonist\'s and the viewer\'s faces. It is also quite pathetic how the show attempts to make us care for her suddenly, the protagonist stretching his hand out towards the sky and screaming! Tears! Drama! Give me a break.Phantom World regularly treats its audience like it is a mass of buffoons who have never been to school. It uses—you guessed it— Schrodinger\'s Cat in a vain attempt to seem more philosophical and meaningful than it actually is. Yes, we know what Schrodinger\'s Cat is. We are not idiots. It does not need to be explained to us for the umpteenth time in anime. The show even goes as far as to explain what a trojan horse is, as if we know absolutely nothing about the world and have been sitting on our mommy\'s lap sucking our thumb since the day we were born.Not only does Phantom World pull the awful transfer student trope, but the character is literally accepted into the school within hours of attaining their \'human form\', and they do so without any form of identification or previous educational experience that would, you know, be necessary in a school transfer? It is true that the series is not attempting to be perfectly realistic, but if it wants to use the high school setting then at the very least it should actually try to have its high school resemble a high school.Nothing interesting is done with the premise, aside from, say, creating excuses for nonsense like all the characters suddenly turning into cats. I\'m sorry, but giving the girls cat ears and tail and making them end all their sentences with ""nyan"" does not do anything to improve the quality of the show. I enjoy cuteness in anime quite a bit, but the least KyoAni could do is try to make it more natural and less artificial, less like they are writing and structuring the anime by checking off boxes for everything that has ever been considered \'cute\'. I half-expected there to be an episode where everyone starts calling the protagonist ""onii-chan"".There are regular doses of fanservice, in scenes such as the main heroine, Mai, doing the limbo dance, her boobs jiggling and bouncing all over the place for the viewer\'s apparent satisfaction. Fanservice as a whole really needs to go away from anime, at least as far as its sexual incarnation is concerned. There exist hentai, doujins, eroge and other forms of pornography for a reason. If I wanted to feel aroused, I would watch or read one of the above-mentioned media—they do it far better. I do not come to anime to see butts and panties and girls being licked by slimy monster tongues as if I am a child who does not know what porn or sex actually is. I love sexy things about as much as I love the story-driven stuff, but the two really need to not mix unless it is absolutely necessary. I can count on one hand the times an anime has been able to pull that off successfully.At least Kyoukai no Kanata, as poorly-written as it was, could be given the slightest bit of credit for trying. Phantom World doesn\'t even do that much. It is as if KyoAni has accepted that their best days are forever behind them, and have now resigned themselves solely to producing lifeless, mediocre rubbish that will be forgotten after a month\'s time. Even producing something completely middling like Chuu2 now seems to be beyond their reach. Their in-house writers are so incompetent that they may as well just go back to adapting visual novels again; they\'ve clearly demonstrated how incapable they are of doing anything themselves.People will still watch Phantom World because it is made by KyoAni. There are many people who still hold fond memories of the anime KyoAni used to make, and there are those who have only just started watching their more successful titles and do not yet know what the KyoAni of today is like. These fans are being manipulated and lured into watching a bad anime merely because it looks and sounds like a KyoAni title, and not because it is actually a worthwhile story on its own merits. It is a husk. Shiny it may be, but empty it is and will ever be. A sad sight indeed.But the anime industry is a big place, and it will live on regardless, even if one of its most influential studios has withered away. Anime doesn\'t need KyoAni anymore. It\'s time to move on. I already have. offer. It is your typical, uninspired rom-com that we get in the dozens every single year. There is nothing you have not seen here before, and nothing to inspire a viewing aside from the fact that it \'looks and sounds nice\'. They stayed KyoAni on the outside, but on the inside they are merely a shallow, rotting husk of what they used to be.It is not even worth the time to discuss the art of Phantom World. Anyone who has seen even a single KyoAni anime knows exactly what they\'re getting here. Their art no longer impresses me. I am also getting tired of forgiving their shows\' terrible plots and characters just because they happen to look pretty. If all they are now capable of is drawing cute characters and flashy OPs and EDs, then perhaps they should leave anime and go work on manga and TV commercials instead?KyoAni seems to have forgotten what made previous titles like K-ON and Haruhi so successful: characters. There is not a character within the show who is developed in any meaningful way, and only one—Kurumi— is even worth a damn, and that\'s not just because I love twintails and wish to be surrounded by twintailed beauties for the rest of my days. Kurumi is the only one who actually feels like a person and not just an assortment of tropes slapped together (\'cool\', \'big boobs\', \'tsundere\'). She acts remarkably her age; her seiyuu even goes as far as to stutter and poorly enunciate her words, as a girl in primary school would. Minase? I had to look through the character listing to even remember her name.Phantom World has another one of those \'dumb male friend\' characters, similar to Ishiki from Chuu2, but manages to do so little with him that you forget he even exists. Not only is he a waste of space like just about every character in this show, but it is real tiring seeing all these pseudo-harem anime incapable of making a second male character who is actually a competent person and not just background fodder or some dumb, running gag.Ruru, the show\'s mascot character, clearly exists only to sell merchandise and figures. Unlike, say, Tamako Market\'s Dera-chan, who was actually a unique and amusing character, the little fairy here is nothing but an annoyance. Her small size is quite fitting, being little more than a fly buzzing around in the protagonist\'s and the viewer\'s faces. It is also quite pathetic how the show attempts to make us care for her suddenly, the protagonist stretching his hand out towards the sky and screaming! Tears! Drama! Give me a break.Phantom World regularly treats its audience like it is a mass of buffoons who have never been to school. It uses—you guessed it— Schrodinger\'s Cat in a vain attempt to seem more philosophical and meaningful than it actually is. Yes, we know what Schrodinger\'s Cat is. We are not idiots. It does not need to be explained to us for the umpteenth time in anime. The show even goes as far as to explain what a trojan horse is, as if we know absolutely nothing about the world and have been sitting on our mommy\'s lap sucking our thumb since the day we were born.Not only does Phantom World pull the awful transfer student trope, but the character is literally accepted into the school within hours of attaining their \'human form\', and they do so without any form of identification or previous educational experience that would, you know, be necessary in a school transfer? It is true that the series is not attempting to be perfectly realistic, but if it wants to use the high school setting then at the very least it should actually try to have its high school resemble a high school.Nothing interesting is done with the premise, aside from, say, creating excuses for nonsense like all the characters suddenly turning into cats. I\'m sorry, but giving the girls cat ears and tail and making them end all their sentences with ""nyan"" does not do anything to improve the quality of the show. I enjoy cuteness in anime quite a bit, but the least KyoAni could do is try to make it more natural and less artificial, less like they are writing and structuring the anime by checking off boxes for everything that has ever been considered \'cute\'. I half-expected there to be an episode where everyone starts calling the protagonist ""onii-chan"".There are regular doses of fanservice, in scenes such as the main heroine, Mai, doing the limbo dance, her boobs jiggling and bouncing all over the place for the viewer\'s apparent satisfaction. Fanservice as a whole really needs to go away from anime, at least as far as its sexual incarnation is concerned. There exist hentai, doujins, eroge and other forms of pornography for a reason. If I wanted to feel aroused, I would watch or read one of the above-mentioned media—they do it far better. I do not come to anime to see butts and panties and girls being licked by slimy monster tongues as if I am a child who does not know what porn or sex actually is. I love sexy things about as much as I love the story-driven stuff, but the two really need to not mix unless it is absolutely necessary. I can count on one hand the times an anime has been able to pull that off successfully.At least Kyoukai no Kanata, as poorly-written as it was, could be given the slightest bit of credit for trying. Phantom World doesn\'t even do that much. It is as if KyoAni has accepted that their best days are forever behind them, and have now resigned themselves solely to producing lifeless, mediocre rubbish that will be forgotten after a month\'s time. Even producing something completely middling like Chuu2 now seems to be beyond their reach. Their in-house writers are so incompetent that they may as well just go back to adapting visual novels again; they\'ve clearly demonstrated how incapable they are of doing anything themselves.People will still watch Phantom World because it is made by KyoAni.

I already have.', 'If there\'s something strangein your neighborhoodWho ya gonna call?PHANTOM BUSTERS!Musaigen no Phantom World is what I like to call the King of Stereotypical! What do I mean by that? Well, let us begin the lecture! Take notes, young lads!High school setting?Light novel adaptation?Main character is a male, and the only male?...Main character is also pretty darn useless?Harem of girls with different tropes?One has big boobies?One is flat?One is a loli?The girls are only known for said one note features?Accidental fan service?Nothing actually happens?See what I mean? This show is full of cliches! In fact, it\'s a bit too cliche. But the thing is, it isn\'t a bad show! One thing for sure is that it can get very entertaining! The animation and art is incredibly high quality, the soundtrack is also good, and the waifus are adorable! Sure, it\'s got no substance in terms of plot and whatnot, but really, waifus are the only reason you need to watch this show.Pros:- Beautiful art and animation! A really great show to look at!- OP is catchy and the soundtrack is good too! A great show to listen to!- You get a waifu, he gets a waifu, she gets a waifu, everybody gets a waifu!- Characters, albeit not developed or original in any sense, are still very likable!- Entertaining action and jokes!- Fanservice ;)Cons:- What is a story?- What is character development?- Generic as balls!- Pretty boring MC.- Fanservice ;-;Story: 3Hmmm, is this even a story? Musaigen no Phantom World\'s story is all over the place, and by that, I mean it\'s absolutely nowhere. It\'s basically episodic, with each episode dealing with a different phantom or situation that has absolutely nothing to do with any of the other situations the characters faced. Any explanations throughout the story are undetailed or forced, the stakes aren\'t high at all, characters come and go on a whim, and yeah, it\'s basically just a really messy story. But some episodes do redeem this story from being a one, as some of them are actually pretty touching or funny! Either way, don\'t watch this show expecting a Shinsekai Yori tier story. Nah, don\'t do that.Art: 9Take my money, Kyoto Animation, take my damn money, for Musaigen no Phantom World has some really high quality art and animation! In fact, the only reason it isn\'t a 10 is because it gets lazy sometimes. The action scenes are like borderline ufotable, and the character designs are so damn colorful and crisp to the maximum! Sometimes I feel like I\'m watching Pokemon but with Fate/Stay Night UBW budget.Sound: 7That OP though, so damn catchy! The soundtrack is also good, although nothing to write home about. In reality, it\'s the seiyuus that shine in this series, for they definitely capture the ""characteristics"" (cause really, how characteristic can these waifus be?) of their characters! All in all, the sound is great, nothing special, but still up there.Character: 6WAIFUS!!!! So, besides the generic and boring MC, you got a nice selection of girls to add to your waifu collection. Sure, the waifus are generic as well, but they still have a lot of character and are really likable if thou art a casual. You got the hot tempered and big boobied Mai, who can beat anyone at limbo. You got the shy, flat, but incredibly moe Reina, who is one of those filthy bastards who can eat 5000 caloriesa day and gain 0 pounds. (Screw those guys). You have the underaged loli Kurumi, who is just pure moe (and a good reason to go to jail). You got Koito, the cold and serious one who, you guessed it, opens up to the MC for some reason. And of course, you got the little fairy Ruru, who is just there for comedic relief and midget fan service! Pretty unoriginal? Yes. Still likable? I guess?Enjoyment: 7Musaigen is one of those ups and downs anime. Due to its episodic nature, some episodes will be better than others! While there were some that were kinda boring and a chore to sit through, there were some that were genuinely entertaining or even feels heavy! Those good episodes overshadowed the bad ones for me, but not everyone is gonna agree on that one.Overall: 5Generic, unoriginal, shit story, but not a bad show overall! It\'s another one of those entertainment > quality kind of shows, and I\'m not a hater of those! Go you, Musaigen!TL;DR: I ain\'t afraid of no Phantoms. Main character is also pretty darn useless?Harem of girls with different tropes?One has big boobies?One is flat?One is a loli?The girls are only known for said one note features?Accidental fan service?Nothing actually happens?See what I mean?

Go you, Musaigen!TL;DR: I ain\'t afraid of no Phantoms.', ""Nearly every year for the past few years, we’ve been getting a new series by Kyoto Animation. The studio alone invites attention as they are a powerhouse studio for high quality production in terms of technical visuals. But when it comes to storytelling, there’s a mixed bag there. Just ask Kyoukai no Kanata. However, this is Myriad Colors Phantom World, a series about a group of teenagers dealing problems with Phantoms, creatures that comes in forms of all different shape and sizes due to imaginative perception. What I like to describe this show is a festival of fan service and nothing more than a punch...in the face to fans who thought they were actually expecting some good.Adapting from the light novel of the same name, it’s noticeable that the series itself has very limited volumes. Prior to the animation adaptation announcement, there was only 1 volume published until they decided to release another volume around Fall 2015. What does this mean? It basically implies that the show follows a lot of original concepts. Light novel adaptations are usually a big hit or miss and this is no exception. As a matter of fact, it’s far from it. Myraid Colors Phantom World has a lot of potential that can be explored. What does it do instead? It executes a messy story with no coherent plot. Rather, it takes advantage of its female characters like the big boobed Mai and advertise them like a walking billboard of Ms. Fanservice.The first episode isn’t just merely dumb but also trades its potentials for eye candy fan service. Now, I don’t have a big problem with that as it should be expected from a show like this. The real problem is that the show strives on it and ante so aggressively that you’ll soon find yourself wondering what the hell the show is really about. To paraphrase, the show is about an incident that happened 10 years ago that changed how humans perceive the world. And this incident also granted certain humans with special abilities to fight the Phantoms, mystical beings that pollute the world with their presence. The main male protagonist is Haruhiko, a young boy with the ability to seal Phantoms by drawing them into his sketchbook. Joining him on his quest is Mai Kawakami, a girl who can fight using an ability called 'Spirit of the Five Elements' that allows her to channel elemental energy into her fists. The problem with the duo is that their performance have been dreadful so they recruit new members to their team. In essence, the story is about these characters fighting phantoms although there will be times when you’ll be scratching your head because of how farfetched the show attempts to focus on its gimmicks.As for the other characters, we got Reina Izumi, a girl with a large appetite and ability to seal Phantoms by eating them. Koito Minase, a loner with the ability to use soundwaves and music to fight off Phantoms also gets involved in their affairs. The four main characters are basically established as crusaders to rid the world of Phantoms. As heroic as this sounds, the show is hard to take seriously with their daily misadventures and shenanigans. Almost all the characters suffers from some generic trait that is easily forgettable. Haruhiko is also a very dull male protagonist as it looks like the girls are often the ones dominating the missions and he is more of the supporting player. The show is also structured more based on individual characters for the first half of the series but Haruhiko gets almost no characterization at all. Even Kurumi, a little girl with a cute teddy bear gets her own spotlight episode while Haruhiko is on the sidelines drawing pictures and being nearly irrelevant.Despite my issue with the storytelling, the creativity of the series is actually quite fun to get attached to. Phantom World takes advantage knowing that and puts characters into imaginative worlds that seems to be inspired by other fantasy fiction. In addition, the show’s Phantoms are all diverse and nothing seems repetitive with what the characters fight on a weekly basis. It also ties to their interpersonal problems at times so there’s more purpose than trying to increase the team’s performance scores.  On the other hand, the comedy is generally a miss. The lewd jokes quickly becomes old and repetitive with no sense of purpose other than being what it is. Then, there’s Ruru, a character that adds nothing more than as a comical foil and often suggestive remarks. Many of the other comedic moments deals with the episodes themselves like cat shenanigans, awkward dialogues, and fan service that’s shoved down our throats.As with most Kyoto Animation series, the visual quality is solid. Ranging from the artistic backgrounds to the imaginative concepts, the studio puts a fair amount of effort to make the show look gloriously good. Character designs are what people will expect from the studio with a high concentration of colors. Then, there’s of course the fan service. The camera really seems to have a fetish or something for Mai because every episode focuses on her body more than her character. Just watch the infamous limbo scene if you’re wondering why. It also seems like her breasts bounces up and down nearly every episode like it’s denting the laws of physics…Soundtrack is moderate. Nothing more or nothing less is the easy way to say it. The OP song has some decent choreography while the ED song is very playful with the main girls. Character voice mannerism is also moderate although Ruru acts like she is trying to be as irritating as she can be each time she’s on screen. Koito’s cold personality is reflected in her voice and she has an emo-like voice mannerism that’s easily forgettable. I guess that can be said the same for Haruhiko since he’s about as dull as watching paint dry. The battle OST is another story though. That’s actually quite decent.It’s a silly series in the end. Really, there’s not much to it besides the show being somewhat self-aware and trying to capitalize on its premise. In the end, what it delivers is a less than average story but more of a generic fest of ridiculousness. And if you ask yourself why, it’s probably because the show isn’t met to be taken seriously in the first place. However, it’s still a foolish show to embrace because almost every episode feels like a lazy grab bag of uncharacteristic ideas that’s executed by the characters. There will be some episodes that have better characterization than the others. But for all it’s worth, the show is a joke of itself. And it’s not really funny at all. in the face to fans who thought they were actually expecting some good.Adapting from the light novel of the same name, it’s noticeable that the series itself has very limited volumes.

And it’s not really funny at all."", 'There are many things I found interesting and not so interesting about Musaigen no Phantom World. Perhaps one of the most notable things about the damn show is that it\'s entire story, characters, and other plot related things are overused. During my time watching this show, it felt like I have literally seen this type of show with the same concepts, plot and similar characters way too many times.. It was too typical, better yet generic. Now, don\'t get me wrong the show itself is pretty decent, good amount of fan service, watchable and has its moments of where it stands out sometimes, however I...just didn\'t think the original creator and KyoAni used their full potential while making the anime adaption.Now I won\'t go rambling on too much about how much I was dissatisfied with it. Because as mention earlier I said it was interesting, here is why. While the show may lack creativity the characters and entertainment that occurs during the show is actually at time completely enjoyable. a few of the things I liked most about it was that the episodes were sort of refreshing in a way. The show doesn\'t spend too much time focusing on many different and unnecessarily convoluted problems for like 2-3 episodes. Just about Every episode you can expect a new phantom to appear, new problems to develop plus you, well I got to enjoy seeing so much craziness occur.Now, back to characters again, I didn\'t really care for our main characters. As far as character personalities, appearance, and design the character sort of felt like, or came off as if they being forced to be cute. The guy, our plain, vanilla MC was so generic that I really cannot add any sort of personal opinion on him. I kid you not, and I am so glad many other users have noticed too, but there is a character like him every other anime season. ""plain"" ""generic"" ""Special power only the MC"" and same personality that is shared many other Main characters in shows like this.Aside from them being boring I noticed that a lot of the characters special abilities were kind of ripped off from the series Date-A-Live. I only noticed this after watching the latest D.A.L. movie. both girls use their voices to attack and repel enemy attacks and Loli\'s both have an attachment to their animals, although one is a teddy bear and Yoshino\'s is a puppet.Now with that said, I cannot delve too much into characters being ripped off of each other. That is because original characters died around the late 90\'s or at the very latest early 2000s\' If I had to guess I would personally say around 2002-2006 was the era in which OC characters died. In a way I do believe it makes since though because after time, the only logical thing to do is take old characters and try to mold them into your own characters. For example many artist and creators, like to take characters from other shows and add their own personal experiences to those characters and things usually take off from there.Moving on from characters and stuff, which agitated me for some odd reason, the animation was pretty damn fine. Characters were very well animated from their original designs. Lots of the fighting scenes were great, however not too special. There were some exciting moments and some less, overall I\'d have to say a fair amount.In the end I ended up giving the show a 6/10 because there is lots of potential, or unused potential in this show. Overall I felt like it was Musaigen no Phantom World was simple. Nothing too extraordinary or extravagant enough worth mentioning. I personally believe that it will be a title that will soon be forgotten. Lastly, yes, I do have to agree that  it is not the best thing to come out of Kyoto animations... Animation was great, music was okay however the overall presentation was mediocre.. or ""Fine"" at best. just didn\'t think the original creator and KyoAni used their full potential while making the anime adaption.Now I won\'t go rambling on too much about how much I was dissatisfied with it.

Animation was great, music was okay however the overall presentation was mediocre.. or ""Fine"" at best.', ""I'm writing this review in defense of Musaigen no Phantom WorldSo, a lot of people have rated this anime pretty critically (it only scoring a 6.8 as an indicator) and reading, and after reading through some reviews, I wanted to defend (and concur) with some of the reviews.STORY - 6: Many people have criticized Musaigen no Phantom World's episodic storyline; citing that there is no plot. In my opinion, the plot of Musaigen wasn't the greatest, yet by far it is not as bad as some might claim. True, there is a new phantom to fight in each episode, but that is a tool that...the author uses in order to develop Musaigen's characters. With each phantom, it has some sort of connection to one of the characters. That character develops throughout the episode, and eventually overcomes their shortcomings to defeat whatever evil has sprouted once more. Plotwise, the anime is simple. High school kids go toe to toe with mysterious phantoms. You can't go expecting Attack on Titan or Fullmetal Alchemist-type story and plotlines. Musaigen only had 13 episodes to work with, and half of those episodes were spent on developing the large character cast. It's plot serves its purpose in being a simple, fun 13 episode anime. So that's why, in my opinion, the plot and story of Musaigen isn't as bad as some claim.ART - 10: The art style and animation in this anime is amazing. It's comparatively better than most Shonen animes. In fact, it competes on level with high-budget anime. The fights are well choreographed and smooth as butter. There aren't any awkward frames or scenes anywhere in the anime. In my opinion, Kyoto Animation knocked it out of the park with this one.SOUND - 10: The voice acting and soundtrack, likewise with the art, is amazing. The voice actors are all very talented, expressing emotion perfectly through the characters. The voice actors really bring the cast to life. The soundtrack is also nice. The upbeat music really brings in the action and fight scenes. The OP's and ED's are also amazing.CHARACTERS - 8: This is another category in which many people criticize Musaigen. True, the stereotypical kuudere, tsundere, and loli are there, but they don't let those stereotypes define the characters. The MC also doesn't end up in exaggerated, cliche situations with the cast either. Each of the characters has their own personality. Although you could call Mai a tsundere, she doesn't really act like how a stereotypical tsundere would act. The same could be said with all the characters. Each character also gets a chance in the limelight with the MC, providing a welcome space to develop themselves, aforementioned. The MC also doesn't get himself involved in the stereotypical harem-y type situations with the cast. Although there are hints of romance, they are light and fluffy, adding to the overall enjoyment. The same goes for the fanservice. Although it is there, it's not really done in a sexual sort of way. The anime doesn't sexualize the loli-type character, and what fanservice is there is mostly done for laughs.OVERALL - 10: I personally really enjoyed this anime. If you're looking for an immersive world, with a deep storyline and tension, then this isn't the anime for you. Musaigen no Phantom World is a fun, fluffy anime that you could enjoy on the weekends. It certainly isn't a gamechanger, but the 4th wall breaks and references are a welcome surprise. It's an enjoyable anime, that shouldn't get the 6.8 it has. So in all, if you're into a light, fun anime, I would give Musaigen no Phantom World a chance. the author uses in order to develop Musaigen's characters.

So in all, if you're into a light, fun anime, I would give Musaigen no Phantom World a chance."", ""Let's put the negative review aside.I can say that KyoAni is trying to improve in somewhat action-oriented animation prodiction. And I found Musaigen no Phantom World to be enjoyable, of course it's really different from their earlier works, but it's a good presentation of what they're trying to do.I want to point some of the things that actually I considered to be a good change.1. Their presentation of animation style in action is actually really good. You can't deny that the characters movement while fighting is really smooth than most of action anime. Also the added effects in fight scenes might need to be brushed...a bit, but they're pretty neat so far.2. For me, Story plot is really interesting, the world setting might be similar with most fantasy anime but this one is really refreshing, and I found every episode is pretty fun to watch.And the thing that I found lacking, is.1. At the end of Episode, Like most anime, the ending is pretty proportional with the weight of the whole story, and I find that really predictable which made me unsatisfied. And after watching the final episode, those whole interesting story became not so interesting, because of the not-so-significant plot twist, and that's really predictable, I just know it from watching the 5th episode that there's no real plot twist, but still, it's really unsatisfiying.2. Those plot might be a bit inappropriate for underaged viewer, and I think they should made it clear to whom this show is being shown at. But I have no problem with how the story is being stringed up. Pretty interesting If I say so. Some people might think KyoAni confused personal fetishism with people amusement. It's okay, like as I said before, they should made it clear to whom this show is being shown at. I won't be hypocryte, I like what KyoAni did there.And so, I declare Musaigen no Phantom World to be a good Anime to watch, if you're looking for amusement, and a bit interesting environment setting. Just don't ask children to watch it so seriously because.. uhm.. you know.... a bit, but they're pretty neat so far.2.

Wait a minute though, how can that be? Aren\'t those mutually exclusive? Not at all. To understand what is going on here, we must delve into some basic history of Kyo-ani.For the past few years, Kyoani has been keeping this pattern of shows that feature cute girls with some supernatural elements thrown into a fairly straightforward story plus an overall lighthearted atmosphere. Amagi Brilliant Park, Kyoukai no Kanata, and to a lesser degree Chuunibyou are examples of this trend. And now comes Musaigen to add to...this growing pile.The thing that seems to be annoying fans is that Kyoani is somewhat guilty of self plagiarism. The characters in Musaigan all feel somewhat...familiar. Very familiar. ""Didn\'t we see this character in that other show Kyoani did two years ago?"" familiar. Musaigen is also very episodic, which is something anime fans probably didn\'t want. The result is a lot of people love to hate this show. It gets put up on a spike and hailed around as proof that Kyoani is done for. They have nothing left. Problem with this mentality is it just isn\'t true. It\'s hating a show for reasons that have to do with other shows by the same studio, which doesn\'t really tell you much about the quality of Musaigen as a stand alone work.On the flip side, rabid Kyoani fans who love everything they do absolutely gobble it up like it\'s another masterpiece. Musaigen is decent, but a masterpiece it is certainly not. The story is enjoyable and the characters are entertaining, but it\'s also very forgettable. The last couple of episodes of Musaigen was the only thing that made the show stand out from the rest. The only key ingredient that makes the show worth watching over others from the same season is the higher standard of art and animation quality that Kyoani generally aims for.The reality here is if Musaigen and Amagi switched air dates, they would probably switch critical reception as well. People would be hating on Amagi for being a clone of Musaigen. Musaigen, for all its troubles, isn\'t actually that bad.If you can look past the controversy and just judge Phantom World for what it is and not what you want it to be, it\'s a good weekend watch. Just don\'t expect anything seriously deep or amazing. Go into this show with realistic expectations and it\'s fairly enjoyable. this growing pile.The thing that seems to be annoying fans is that Kyoani is somewhat guilty of self plagiarism.

Look, I know everyone thinks “waaahhhh kyoani is rip!!!” But, come on. It can’t be that bad… right…? Ri--oh GOD she won a game of Limbo by bouncing her tits? WAAAHHHH KYOANI IS RIP!!!I want to feel bad for whoever originally conceived Myriad Fuck-ups Phantom World. I think the concept of this series is pretty great: some virus breaks out and causes the brain to function differently, therefore causing supernatural beings, known as ""Phantoms"", to be seen by people. Children birthed and...breastfed afterwards would then develop superpowers so that Phantoms can be fought against.I want to like the concept, but since Phantoms appear all the time and can have major effects, it makes me wonder what the fuck anyone did before all these super-powered kids showed up to get rid of Phantoms. Like, they say Phantoms have always been around, only no-one could see them before, but when they’re able to send people to other dimensions or turn everyone within a wide radius into a fucking cat, it’s a miracle that society could even develop with these buggers around. Then you have the superpowers which make little-to-no sense. Everyone birthed and breastfed after this virus just ends up with superpowers for fighting Phantoms. ...except instead of everyone having really basic and similar powers or something, characters can have very unique and specific powers, like controlling a teddy bear, fondling your own titties, or going “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH”.But, whatever. Ignoring the questions regarding the concept, I still kinda like it. To make it better, the show incorporates pre-existing themes of psychology as well; most episodes will start off with the main character explaining a theory that will be demonstrated in the episode. With this, I want to believe the original author was throwing out some legitimate ideas for a story and all, but some editor/publisher came in and said ""NAH"" to a bunch of it, and made it more ""accessible"" by adding in dumb fanservice, annoying ""cutesy"" characters, and by removing any sort of plot. Now it’s a true light novel! But that\'s just what I optimistically believe. I don\'t actually know how this gallery of dicks came into being.But, despite having some interesting ideas, they are executed in the most boring, overused, generic, and uninteresting way possible. Instead of having a remotely interesting plot with an actual villain or drama, we get a series of episodes that each introduce some new Phantom, which the boring protagonist and his near-equally boring friends must dispose of somehow as part of their duty in their boring school. There is no plot whatsoever. Something weird will happen, and then someone will ask “Is this the work of a Phantom?!” like a complete fucking idiot (this happens literally every episode what the hell do they think it is), they struggle to get rid of the Phantom until they get rid of the Phantom, and then they go home and repeat the process the next day. That’s the “story.” Hooray.Musaigen seems to be action-based for the most part, but fights are actually very short and forgettable despite the great production values. The only things I actually remember are the laughable things, such as Haruhiko’s somehow endearing summons (Cthulu best girl) and the chants that characters, for some reason, HAVE to use in order to use their abilities. Thank god, because this show couldn’t rightfully call itself a comedy without them. (shirabeshirabeshirabeshirabeAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH)Instead of fighting, most situations are cleared through problem solvin………erm, scratch that. No, in order to make most Phantoms go or be sealed away peacefully, the characters just go along with whatever their conundrum is or fix their life problems themselves, whether it’s by participating in a really really bad play or by slapping red paint on your ass. This is what true, quality action is all about, kids. And no, I’m not specifically saying that the fanservice of this show is stupid. It’s just the events causing the writers to make excuses to have fanservice that are stupid.While each episode tries to add more to the characters, these efforts are pretty silly and forgettable, and anything we learn about the characters has no actual value to the “narrative”. For example, Reina has some over-protective parents who don’t want her fighting Phantoms for no reason at all (no, we don’t actually meet her parents, but we should be grateful because this is the only character with any sort of backstory), but that conflict is resolved in an episode or two. And what do we get out of it? Nothing. Nothing changes at all. The series pretends to develop its characters, but at best they made Minase less of a cunt. That’s all I got out of thirteen episodes.“But episodes 11-13 were so great and emotional!” --that annoying voice in my head that spouts out potential arguments. They were great and emotional in the same way that Oreo changing the color of their cremes each season is great and emotional. Congrats to Nabsico for changing something and putting a little heart into it, but at the end of the day I’m still getting a goddamn sandwich cookie. And that cookie is more valuable to me than this entire anime.I should regroup before I lose everyone here. My point is that a good episode of Myriad Colors is still Myriad Colors. It’s not interesting, it’s often annoying, and the characters are lame. I’m afraid that it’s a little too late to make me invested in the characters that you’ve already taken the opportunity to establish.So, who is this phenomenal cast of weridos? There’s Haruhiko, your traditional high school kid who doesn’t live with his parents because reasons and has no personality at all. Mai is your typical hot-headed female lead who does most of the fighting. Mai’s Breasts support Mai a lot and help her fight. Reina, the only character with a backstory and a superior design, should actually be the fanservice character. Everyone likes a girl that swallows. MinAHHHHHHHse speaks for herself. Probably listens to shit music tho. There’s also Ruru. … … … … … … I’d really rather not talk about this character.Before I go on, has anyone seen this child? She’s like five years old with lavender hair and carries a teddy bear around. Please, anyone, come claim her soon because her voice is giving me cancer, and she has no reason to be in this show.The soundtrack of this show is flat. Nothing about it stands out in any way. The OP and ED are generally the main catches of an anime, but they’re passable at best. The voice acting isn’t particularly bad, but Rurururiruiuriuriururiuaiuruiairuri and Kurumi have incredibly annoying voices. It doesn’t help that this shithead Tinker Ruru needs to insert her opinion into literally everything that happens on the fucking screen. Can you tell that I’m annoyed? I hate this character so much. If there’s any saving grace, it’s that Reina has the smoothest, sexiest womanly voice ever, and the noise she makes when using her power is hot. (the jokes literally write themselves with this girl)To save the best for last, the art is incredible. Nothing less should be expected from Kyoto Animation, even in their bad shows. The character designs are gorgeous, but Mai wears some really weird outfit consisting of a yellow vest over a black long-sleeved shirt. It doesn’t look good, and it breaks consistency, since she goes to a school and everyone but her wears the same uniform. I thought they just gave her that outfit so that Mai’s Breasts could get more screentime, but then she ditches the vest and wears the normal uniform and Mai’s Breasts are still perfectly visible then. Yeah, I dunno. The other thing is that the series starts off with an amazing sequence where Haruhiko is barely awake, and the world looks like a giant Tetris level for a bit because that’s how brains work now. It’s beautiful and had me incredibly stoked for what lied ahead, but there aren’t any more great sequences like that for some reason.However, even if I wanted a little more, there still wasn’t a dull moment in the visuals for me. The Phantoms have a mystical, cartoony vibe to them, and the show certainly lives up the name “Myriad Colors Phantom World” by being really colorful with its attacks and environments. It’s hard to deny that the Gumdrop Kingdom or whatever the fuck that stupid teddy bear world was was ugly, despite its vomit-inducing sillyness. I hate kids.If there’s anything else to say, it’s that Myriad Colors Phantom World wasn’t a disaster, exactly… it wasn’t “so bad that it’s good”, and won’t be considered as such… if anything, the show is just an embarrassment for the legendary Kyoto Animation. Like many series, it has potential, but just doesn’t have the writing or the heart to back it up. Even the things that it actually tries to accomplish are half-hearted.I wouldn’t even watch it just for the visuals. Just go watch another KyoAni show, really.Story - 2/10Art - 8/10Sound - 3/10Characters - 2/10Enjoyment - 2/10Fanservice - pmmereinahentai/10Overall - 2/10Favorite character - ReinaFavorite episode - 12Recommendation level - Very low breastfed afterwards would then develop superpowers so that Phantoms can be fought against.I want to like the concept, but since Phantoms appear all the time and can have major effects, it makes me wonder what the fuck anyone did before all these super-powered kids showed up to get rid of Phantoms.

After so much talk online following episode one’s airing, I grew curious, and decided to watch the first few episodes. It helped that I recognized Kyoto animation’s gorgeous artwork, and kept in mind my love for the Free! series, also done by Kyoani. I was hooked after episode one! Can I also just say that I love the school uniforms?The characters are probably 50% of why I enjoyed this series so much. I resonate so much with Haruhiko as a person, and his little freak outs...are unreasonably hilarious to me! Ruru is just a sassy little chatterbox, but she brings so much energy into the room, and not to mention, she\'s irrisitably adorable! You might not appreciate Reina and Mai that much until a bit later in the series, but they grow on you as well. I will say, however that all of the characters, including Haruhiko (who is supposed to be highly intelligent), can be ditzy at times.The character development didn\'t seem to be the creators\' main focus of the show, they just sort of sprinkled it here and there, but they did it just enough for me to become emotionally involved. Especially towards the end, Haruhiko really starts ""coming into his own"", as they say, and I was glad they arranged that, but it seems like they just sort of threw it in.I was also fascinated by the complexity of phantoms, and enjoyed seeing each different kind of phantom.This series includes a few moments of ecchi, but it was by no means overdone in my opinion, and it was more comical than sexy.There is also a subtle sense of harem elements in some episodes, but I enjoyed that it was all kept considerably low-key, and nobody ends up on a real date or even considering an official relationship. It really maintained the series’ light-heartedness.Kyoani has yet again produced one of my favorites! are unreasonably hilarious to me! Ruru is just a sassy little chatterbox, but she brings so much energy into the room, and not to mention, she\'s irrisitably adorable! You might not appreciate Reina and Mai that much until a bit later in the series, but they grow on you as well. I will say, however that all of the characters, including Haruhiko (who is supposed to be highly intelligent), can be ditzy at times.The character development didn\'t seem to be the creators\' main focus of the show, they just sort of sprinkled it here and there, but they did it just enough for me to become emotionally involved. Especially towards the end, Haruhiko really starts ""coming into his own"", as they say, and I was glad they arranged that, but it seems like they just sort of threw it in.I was also fascinated by the complexity of phantoms, and enjoyed seeing each different kind of phantom.This series includes a few moments of ecchi, but it was by no means overdone in my opinion, and it was more comical than sexy.There is also a subtle sense of harem elements in some episodes, but I enjoyed that it was all kept considerably low-key, and nobody ends up on a real date or even considering an official relationship. It really maintained the series’ light-heartedness.Kyoani has yet again produced one of my favorites!', ""Phantom World was a huge disappointment and in my eyes, the worst anime that Kyoto Ani has put out during its entire run featuring boring characters, no sense of direction or plot with its narrative and huge bouncing tits that give me PTSD of the time in which I watched the Eiken OVA.For starters, it feels like none of the characters were made to be precisely that: characters. It feels as if their entire personality and appearance was made, with the sole purpose of being as marketable as possible to the otaku audience since none of the characters are unique in terms of design nor...personality.Mai is the one with the big tits and she is also a potential 'love interest' for our main male protagonist. That's it. Reina is the girl who likes to swallow things whole (rather like Kirby). That's it. Koito is the reserved, cool one. That's it. Kurumi is the loli character. Guess what? That's it. Finally, we have our main character, Haruhiko, the bland self-insert who finds himself surrounded by a bunch of women, likes books and has a vast amount of knowledge to deal with any situation. Literally, every situation. It feels as if Haruhiko's only role in this show is to provide exposition and facts to the other characters in order to conveniently seize a victory against the phantom they are fighting. As a result of this, there is no tension or intrigue in any of these phantom encounters (with the exception of the last) since Haruhiko always has some kind of knowledge hidden away in order to conveniently defeat the enemy.While on the topic of exposition, there are many episodes which start off with Haruhiko talking to the audience about what the plot of the episode is going to be while telling us every idea and theme that will be related to the proceeding episode. This was not only a boring way to start off an episode as we had to sit through dull exposition but it also makes the proceeding content pointless. If we already know the plot of an episode and what themes and messages they're going to use in said episode BEFORE even watching the show, why should we care? Don't you think it would be more interesting if the audience can interpret stuff ourselves instead of having a character spell out all the plot for us as if we're damn idiots and can't think for ourselves.The plot is very straightforward opting for a phantom of the week structure, which would be fine if I found any of these encounters to be interesting in the slightest. Most of the phantoms they come across are unique in design but overall don't really do much or pose much a threat and instead seem to be designed with the sole purpose of revealing as much female skin as possible. Such examples include an ape-type phantom, in which they try to seduce him by painting Mai's ass red, or a phantom that changes everyone into a cat or a phantom that places censor bars over the outfits of people to make it seem as if they're wearing nothing at all. It's clearly trying to appeal to every fetish and demographics to try and rake in more viewers and make a few more extra expensive blu-ray sales.It could be argued that this is all for fun and that the show is trying to be a tongue in check ecchi comedy of some sorts which I could understand if it were not for the fact that everything is so boring and just too stupid for me to even consider this notion. Most situations and story arcs were not created with the purpose of developing characters but instead were made just to appeal to as large as a group as possible. Most of the introductory episodes for the characters at least attempt to develop the characters in some way and try to give the character more depth but there is not nearly enough time devoted to each one to feel as if they have changed at all. The only time a hint of intrigue makes itself apparent in the show is near the end, which actually does a decent job at developing Haruhiko's character while also developing the relationship between the two nicely. Unfortunately, by this point, it was too little too late and the show doesn't allow enough time for all too much development past its surface level.While the characters and the narrative both suck, the music and the animation are the only two salvageable things out of this entire production. The music kicks ass from the opening credits to the ending and does do a good job at invoking a sense of excitement during the more action-heavy scenes. The animation is very consistent and flows very well from shot to shot with great composition and visual flow combining that with flashy colours and good fight choreography makes for a great visual experience. While the characters are speaking you can also see subtle changes in their facial expressions mid-conversation which shows the talent from both a directing standpoint and a technical standpoint too. The anime, from a technical standpoint, looks great which is why it pains me to see such great animation wasted on a mediocre cast and narrative. In my eyes, this is one of the worst anime Kyoto Ani has made and I wouldn't recommend it, even if you're looking for an ecchi show as there are better ones out there.

(Spoilers)Story: 5/10Musaigen no Phantom World has that generic concept that teenagers doing some magic and going to school bla bla... But in noragami style! Let me explain, teenagers that have some superpowers are hunting imaginary things called phantoms. Some of them dangerous creatures, some of them limbo dancing telephone poles, some of them pervert UFOs... Interesting, right? But actually nothing happened. It's an episodic anime so most of the people hates it (and the fanservice) but I don't care if it's episodic or not. I liked some episodic animes before (OPM, Joukamachi no Dandelion...), so for me the important parts are characters...and enjoyment. I even liked the plots of the episodes, 11th and 12th episodes were really good. Some drama, some character developments, some serious and ''2 episodic'' plot and BAM! I thought finally my hopes came true, it made me say ''Wow, that anime is getting some good points.'' BUT then, the final episode happened. I was so hopefull for this episode, I waited like serious plottwist, but what I got was action, forced fanservice and an actually no sense plot. That Ruru-Haruhiko thing was stupid and they actually kissed? Sorry but this is forced and bad fanservice. If they made a great final, I would even give 7/10 for story. But the thing I loved is that Haruhiko gives some information about something at every episode's begining and it's the plot of the episode.Art: 10/10KyoAni is gorgeous again. KyoAni has my favourite style of character designs and that animations are awesome, even Reina's swallowing power.Sound: 9/10At first I didn't like the OP song but now it's so catchy.Characters: 8/10The characters are of course loveable, even they're a little cliche. Kyo Ani usually focuses on the characters and they did it again. There is at least one episode that focuses on one character and that character's development. I loved Mai, Reina and Ruru's development but I can't say it for Koito. And sorry Reina, Mai is still the best girl.Enjoyment: 8/10This anime is entertaining. I don't know if you're enjoying this series but I am definetly enjoying. Some people say it has too much fanservice but I think it's not. Uhm, maybe some episodes tho... But generally there wasn't over fanservice, and it wasn't harem either. I wanted MaixHaruhiko but it didn't happen. Maybe more romance could make this anime better. We know Kyo Ani is how good at comedy, romance and drama. And yeah the anime was generally full of comedy but every episode's ending has a little drama. Especially last episodes made the drama good.Overall: 7/10Well, I actually liked this anime but again it could be a lot better. Especially the story... and enjoyment.

Mai Kawakami is the reluctant fanservice girl of the series and LA gets why some people really like her, however LA still preferred Reina over Mai, as for Mai\'s development, LA saw that Mai got the best development out of the ""supposed harem"". The loner Koito Minase voiced by \'\'Maaya Uchida\'\' later on, the bear themed Kurumi Kumakura voiced by \'\'Misaki Kuno\'\' does get their own character development episodes but again like Reina falls under the harem and ""joining the cast"", finally we have Ruru voiced by \'\'Azusa Tadokoro\'\', the mascot of this anime series and is a Phantom who ""helps"" and LA says helps as loosely as possible the group, she\'s really just tags along than anything else until her one episode focused entirely on her. LA has been going to the basics of the characters for this review merely because the bulk of the anime is ABOUT the character interactions with each other under the ""themed"" or ""character-driven"" episode.Oddly enough when LA said that this anime would have the cliched tired trope of ""supernatural battle harem"", it seems as if that\'s more of a ""place setting"" than the core focus of the anime, the core focus is developing the cast through themed episodes as well as building the world and lore of Phantoms and dealing with in wacky and hilarious ways.In terms of animation done by Kyoto Animation, well LA won\'t lie, their visual flair and character designs are eye candy to see and with the ""wacky"" Phantom battles are sometimes a visual spectacle, even if it is a ""supernatural battle harem"", Kyoto Ani doesn\'t slack, and that\'s one of the finer points of Musaigen no Phantom World.The ending comes in as a 2 episode arc and although the build up is rather predictable, it really starts getting good by the finale episode where that loose plotline way early from anime finally gets brought up as well as a small plot twist that actually made the finale well worth the wait to watch.Musaigen no Phantom World may fall under the ""supernatural battle harem"" cliches however due to it\'s focused episodic format where they develop both the main cast but the world and lore of where Phantoms and humans interact with each other it\'s more of a slice of life battle harem with both huge expositionary moments from Haruhiko and some of it\'s anime genre tropes flipped for better or worse...but mainly for the better. well-rounded and defined characters and yes it\'s even from the filler themed episodes they get development through metaphors of the themes at hand.LA\'s favourite character is being Haruhiko\'s first recruit being Reina Izumi voiced by \'\'Saori Hayami\'\' as her development and dynamic in the cast helped it get lively (unfortunately once she ""enters and finishes her episode development she just becomes another love interest for Haruhiko) and come on Saori Hayami is voicing her, on speaking of Haruhiko, our bland male protagonist is nothing but a spouting expostionary character which can get annoying, he does get some character development episodes to his name and although not as powerful as Mai, Reina, Koito or Kurumi, subverts one of this anime genre tropes of ""being too OP for his own good"", he\'s still a dense main male protagonist though.

For starters, it could be classified as a slice-of-life harem, which is my favorite kind of series. Whilst I know that most harems often depict more sexual interactions between the male protagonist and the female deuteragonists, I would say that this more passive approach to harem is (a) more applicable to a younger audience though who still search for the thrills harem offers and (b) easier to apply to a story with a feel-good theme, such as this one.The structure of the plot and its writing is something I must compliment. The ground concept of high school...students combatting dangerous mystical creatures is something that has been used in anime before – the most notable interpretation of this would, for me, be Darling in the FranXX – and I do believe it is rather lame. However, what makes up for this rather bland foundation is the amazing characters that you get to encounter. Characters who essentially start as empty shells get, throughout the entire season, filled with more and more depth as you get to know them better; that is something I love about this series – the fact that you start developing bonds, one-sided yes, with the characters as you get to know them. Take Reina for example in episode 4: you learn that her dream is to have a caring and kind family. Then look at Reina throughout the rest of the season, with that in mind; her family starts listening to and caring about her more. Another example, one that made me shed a tear, would be Haruhiko in episode 11. I am not going to spoil that episode, if anyone reads this, as I believe it to be the truly golden episode of the entire series and that everyone should watch it without spoilers.I know that this anime has gotten a large amount of criticism for its bland and boring nature, but I disagree. Bonafide weebs reading this review might realize what an inexperienced anime watcher I am, and I do not deny that. Though I have not watched any animes that make this concept that bland yet. I do understand that people might look down on this anime if the concept is overused within the genre, though the characters and the stories revolving around them are very touching and deserve credit, in my opinion. students combatting dangerous mystical creatures is something that has been used in anime before – the most notable interpretation of this would, for me, be Darling in the FranXX – and I do believe it is rather lame.

It evolved over millions of years into something capable of not only surviving despite having no physical advantage over our predators but also into something capable of deciphering the numerous secrets of the universe.When an anime tries to tackle something as complex as the human psyche you would think it’s an anime with a serious tone and serious characters. Well, not necessarily, today I am taking a look at the Winter 2016 anime which revolves around the human brain: Musaigen no Phantom World or Myriad Colours Phantom World in English.Plot and charactersThe...plot of Musaigen no Phantom World revolves around a group of students living in a world in which all sorts of monsters and fairy tale characters run wild. The world being in this state is the result of  an accident at a research facility which modified the brain of every human around the world.The main characters of the show, as I’ve mentioned are a group of students who are all members of the Neural Error Corrections Club; a club in which all the members have superpowers which they use to deal with evil monsters or Phantoms as the show calls them.Our male lead is the smart but clueless and at times useless Ichijo Haruhiko. He has the power  to seal away all the evil Phantoms and along with his teammate Kawakami Mai, who utilizes elemental powers, forms the weakest group in the club. There’s not a lot to say about Haruhiko’s personality he is honestly pretty empy personality wise. The more notable things are his ability to create a harem and his issues concerning his parents which become important towards the end of the series. Other than that he is just there so that the audience can project on to him. He is never directly involved in fights, most of the time being relegated to just sucking up the enemies into his book or summoning other Phantoms to fight for him.I’ve mentioned her earlier but our main female lead is Kawakami Mai. She is also the poster girl for this anime. Mai is an athletic tomboy who has been friends with Haruhiko for a while before the series begins. Now, you’d think that because she is the poster girl for the series she would get a lot of backstory and screentime.  Nope, she is instead given the task of providing as much fanservice as possible with some sexy moves for when she uses an ability and even a scene where Haruhiko paints her butt. Once again, her character also fall short because of the lack of development.Oh, and there’s also that frankly annoying Ruru who is Haruhiko’s childhood friend Phantom and the shows main source of terrible comic relief. She is a special Phantom who doesn’t want to harm humans and is actually really friendly. She is sort of like Na’Vi, tries to be helpful but ends up being more of a nuisance. She suddenly becomes really important at the end of the show which comes out of the blue considering that she’s basically done nothing up until that point except for messing things up a lot.We also have some characters who join the main cast after a “quest” has been performed for them. These characters are: the cheerful and shy Izumi Reina, the quiet and mysterious Minase Koito, and the “only exists because we need a loli” Kumamakura Kurumi. All of which suffer from the same problems as our original dynamic duo. With them getting 1 or 2 episodes of character development before being assigned a role and an archetype and then being pushed to the side.The anime is episodic in nature with only the last 2 episodes being connected by a common plot thread. Almost everything is reset to the status-quo at the end of each episode which makes one episode in particular totally pointless and skipable, coincidentaly this episode is also the hot springs episode of the series.Let’s talk a bit about the ecchi aspect of the series. I generally find that there is nothing wrong with having some fanservice in a show as long as it doesn’t sacrifice plot just to show me some boobs. This show however takes it’s already non-existing plot and puts some ecchi in it; some very painful ecchi scenes which give me flashbacks to Heavy Object. It’s like they are afraid to put the ecchi in so they half-ass it and somehow make it more in-your-face than it would normally be and also painful to watch at times.The episodic nature of the series combined with the characters being uninteresting and unchanging for the most part is what ruins what could have been a good show. But alas, it is as my history teacher used to say “History is what has happened, not what could have happened.”Sound and AnimationThis is really where the series shines.  Kyoto Animation is the studio behind the animation for this work. I don’t think I exaggerate when I say that this is one of the most beautiful shows ever created. The screen is filled with vibrant colours and the animations are fantastic. Almost feels like this anime had a movie budget for each and every episode. The opening animation, especially is one of the best looking openings I have seen in recent memory. I could go on praising the animation of this series for quite a while so I’m just going to stop myself there.Now, concerning the sound design of the anime I can’t really praise it that much. Sure, both the opening and ending songs are fun to listen to and there is nothing wrong with the tracks that play during the anime. There’s also nothing praiseworthy, nothing that sticks out and no song that I want to listen to even after the anime is over.Final verdictWasted potential is what I would call Phantom world. It brings an interesting concept and good looking animation but messes up in the story department. There’s some enjoyment to be had with this show particularly if you like vibrant colours and/or softcore ecchi scenes. At the end of the day, I wish they would have focused more on the plot of the series rather than the art and fanservice. Sadly, because of the poor decisions of its creators I’m giving this show a failing grade. At first I really hoped this show would pull itself together and give us something good. I wanted it to be good. But by the time episode 8 rolled around (the hot springs episode) it was obvious that the show wouldn’t be saveable anymore. And so, my final score for this anime is a 4/10. plot of Musaigen no Phantom World revolves around a group of students living in a world in which all sorts of monsters and fairy tale characters run wild. The world being in this state is the result of  an accident at a research facility which modified the brain of every human around the world.The main characters of the show, as I’ve mentioned are a group of students who are all members of the Neural Error Corrections Club; a club in which all the members have superpowers which they use to deal with evil monsters or Phantoms as the show calls them.Our male lead is the smart but clueless and at times useless Ichijo Haruhiko. He has the power  to seal away all the evil Phantoms and along with his teammate Kawakami Mai, who utilizes elemental powers, forms the weakest group in the club. There’s not a lot to say about Haruhiko’s personality he is honestly pretty empy personality wise. The more notable things are his ability to create a harem and his issues concerning his parents which become important towards the end of the series. Other than that he is just there so that the audience can project on to him. He is never directly involved in fights, most of the time being relegated to just sucking up the enemies into his book or summoning other Phantoms to fight for him.I’ve mentioned her earlier but our main female lead is Kawakami Mai. She is also the poster girl for this anime. Mai is an athletic tomboy who has been friends with Haruhiko for a while before the series begins. Now, you’d think that because she is the poster girl for the series she would get a lot of backstory and screentime.  Nope, she is instead given the task of providing as much fanservice as possible with some sexy moves for when she uses an ability and even a scene where Haruhiko paints her butt. Once again, her character also fall short because of the lack of development.Oh, and there’s also that frankly annoying Ruru who is Haruhiko’s childhood friend Phantom and the shows main source of terrible comic relief. She is a special Phantom who doesn’t want to harm humans and is actually really friendly. She is sort of like Na’Vi, tries to be helpful but ends up being more of a nuisance. She suddenly becomes really important at the end of the show which comes out of the blue considering that she’s basically done nothing up until that point except for messing things up a lot.We also have some characters who join the main cast after a “quest” has been performed for them. These characters are: the cheerful and shy Izumi Reina, the quiet and mysterious Minase Koito, and the “only exists because we need a loli” Kumamakura Kurumi. All of which suffer from the same problems as our original dynamic duo. With them getting 1 or 2 episodes of character development before being assigned a role and an archetype and then being pushed to the side.The anime is episodic in nature with only the last 2 episodes being connected by a common plot thread. Almost everything is reset to the status-quo at the end of each episode which makes one episode in particular totally pointless and skipable, coincidentaly this episode is also the hot springs episode of the series.Let’s talk a bit about the ecchi aspect of the series. I generally find that there is nothing wrong with having some fanservice in a show as long as it doesn’t sacrifice plot just to show me some boobs. This show however takes it’s already non-existing plot and puts some ecchi in it; some very painful ecchi scenes which give me flashbacks to Heavy Object.

Which is a shame, because it wasn't that bad at all.Musaigen is about a kid (Haruhiko) who knows a lot of useless info but is pretty weak physically, along with his side kicks (who are all female). They all have special powers and are able to see figments of human imagination, which can affect physical objects and living things after an accident with a company that was researching them. These special powers vary in power, and...while he doesn't have a particularly powerful power it's above average, and they go around 'sealing' these 'Phantoms' before they become a big menace.This is pretty much the entire series. They are part of a school club that rewards them for taking care of middle level to easy phantoms, and they get to earn some pocket money while helping out the police (who take care of the stronger phantoms). Each episode usualy deals with one phantom somehow messing with either the characters, or someone else who they help as part of their 'job'. Which isn't very bad at all, since it does this pretty well. There are episodes centered around each character, there's a decent amount of character development (for 13 episodes) and you grow to like most of the characters.Given that there is one male main and 4 female main characters (5 if you count their weird mini fairy sidekick) there's a fair amount of fanservice. Which is usually ok, it's not too excessive, but sometimes can get annoying. An example would be the first episode, which was part of why everyone everywhere decided it was utter shit, and was sort of unfortunate for the series.Being episodic, it still had an 'overarching story' during these, where they mention a few things that happened in past episodes and was hinted to be part of a wider plot. This culminates in the final episodes, provding sort of a story end for the series as a whole, and at least concludes it.The art was very, very good. The designs were pretty decent, but what shines the most was the art for the special powers, which looked great. Explosions, energy waves, heck, even energy swrods were handled very well. Sound was pretty decent as well.The main thing pulling the series down is simply its attempt at a final story and attempts at character building. The ending was sort of cliché and honestly not very well done, and for a cast of 6 characters, there simply weren't enough episodes to flesh them all out, leading to all of them getting some development. Other than that the anime wasn't very bad at all; some parts were mediocre, some good, but overall it was a very decent series.Musaigen wasn't a very bad series at all, just had a lot of tropes and clichés used before thrown in that seemed repetitive to the viewer who watches this sort of anime by the dozen. Ignoring the high hopes people apparently pin to KyoAni, this show wasn't by any means a masterpiece, but was still a fun watch. while he doesn't have a particularly powerful power it's above average, and they go around 'sealing' these 'Phantoms' before they become a big menace.This is pretty much the entire series.

But every now and again, they hit a rut: they make an anime that\'s so bad, bland, and/or boring, that they try and cover up that anime\'s mediocre fanservice, unmemorable soundtrack, bad characters, worse character development with a pseudo-interesting take on its genre, beautiful art, and flashy effects. Notice the keyword ""try."" If you\'re smart and...alert, you can catch KyoAni red-handed. We\'ve seen it with Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, we\'ve seen it with Free! Iwatobi Swim Club; we\'ve also seen it with spinoffs of rather successful/respectable KyoAni works, such as Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu, K-On!, and Hyouka.Musaigen no Phantom World is no different. Once starting off as a very good manga, its anime adaptation behaved as Pupa did, in the sense that it failed to meet the standards of its manga predecessor.Story: 5/10Musaigen no Phantom World is basically just another show that Kyoto Animation slips up on, and tried to cover up with some fat anime tiddies and lolis. While the story that Musaigen concocted sounded great in theory - humans being able to see and interact with supernatual entities known as Phantoms due to a research facility bombing spreading a virus that gives humans this ability - the execution was rather lacking. There have been other anime out there where people can interact with otherworldly beings... but they do the job better... Like Mushishi. Hell, I think even InuYasha did it better: that show\'s cast at least had to JUMP through a bunch of flaming hoops to get to their goal.I think Musaigen\'s story started to tank when KyoAni defaulted to the boring high school setting, and not coming up with an original, or a not-so-overused setting. It was even exacerbation by giving a select few characters in the show super powers, in a sense. In hindsight... it wasn\'t exactly the best idea. It wasn\'t even a good idea. They\'re not just abilities, but they\'re... ""special"" abilities. Because having a teddy bear grow to ten times its size to fight for you, and rubbing your jugs to try and use the ""element of fire from your heart"" is definitely what I call ""special.""Art: 8/10I gotta give it to Kyoto Animation: they know to make even some of their worst works look really, REALLY good. I feel bad to constantly roast them like this, since Musaigen\'s art has been proven to be very well done. The effects are very nice, too, and everything in the show feels really vibrant. I haven\'t experienced good visual quality like it since Hyouka or Hibike! Euphonium.Their art and visual effects might have been their saving grace if everything else was better. Unfortunately, that is not the case.Sound: 6/10Musaigen has fairly decent sound as well as their art. The sound effects of fight scenes between the characters and the Phantoms, the battle roars/cries of the Phantoms during these fights, the small little lilts of noise of each character\'s abilities; all of them are relatively decent. Sadly, Musaigen\'s SOUNDTRACK proves to be an issue: the OP and EP are both rather unmemorable and grating to the ears. The music during the fight scenes are heavily forgotten about as well, because of the visual effects that mesmerise us and distract us overall. Argh, damn you, beautiful graphics!Characters: 2/10Here we go, folks. We\'re at my least favourite part... or favourite. It is long, after all, so I guess it depends on whether or not you think I enjoy ranting about dreadful characters in Musaigen no Phantom World. Characters make up everything for the anime, from how we perceive them to how they develop from beginning to end. But Musaigen\'s characters are, for lack of a better term... trash.Haruhiko Ichijou is our main male protagonist, in a cast that is overrun with attractive females (and a loli.) That alone should already be ringing a loud angry alarm in your head to a nice, roaring 10 exawatts. He\'s basically the nerdy kid that gets ragged on by his peers for bearing too much ""useless"" information. While he has the ability to banish and summon Phantoms by quickly drawing them in his sketchbook, the first half of his special power is pretty much made null and void by Izumi Reina, who we will be getting to shortly. Thus, Haruhiko has become what we label a ""cuck"" after the first few episodes. He does undergo mild improvement, but nothing whatsoever that appears to get rid of that NTR  nature that shows he\'ll still get dumpster\'d by his friends.Haruhiko\'s annoying Phantom companion, Ruru, is basically a huge-chested Navi that\'s just blitzed on the strongest strain of amphetamines. She\'s cute to look at, but will cause the aneurysm in your head to swell more and more by the minute. I honestly thought she would be more levelheaded by the end, but unfortunately, that ain\'t the case.Kawakami Mai is the large-breasted female MC. Is that alarm from earlier getting louder in your head? Well, we\'re not even halfway done yet, so buckle up even further. She\'s an unoriginal character, quite frankly: large jugs, awesome feats of strength, seemingly perfect and adored by her peers: she\'s basically Medaka from Medaka Box, but blonde. Her ability lets her rub her body parts, namely her rack and her hips, to summon an element from their respective spots to fight Phantoms with... it\'s like a sensual version of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Booooring, next.Izumi Reina, another female MC, is basically the ""ojou-sama"" of the show, with her soft-spoken demeanor, proper manners, strict parents, and her urge of saying ""How dare you!"" every time Haruhiko gets too close to her goodies (because those are the apparent perks of being a male in a harem-like anime), resulting in her cucking - I mean, decking him. Her ability allows her to banish Phantoms by devouring them, and this not only cucks Haruhiko even more, but of course this has to interfere with her personal life: she has an unrealistic appetite, and can eat anyone under the table, but she never has enough money. She\'s not a boring character by any means, but that doesn\'t mean she\'s not generic in terms of her personality and traits.Minase Koito is yet another female MC in this ragtag harem of misfits. I can somewhat empathise with her: listening to music and being alone is what I do on a daily basis. However, she\'s basically just the generic ""lone wolf"" character who underwent ostracisation because she\'s more of a rebel/thug for her peers to handle. Her ability lets her use singing to combat Phantoms She\'s... okay, in the sense that she is cute, independent and can be kind of a badass at times, but her inability to warm up to others in reasonable time puts her behind greatly.Kumamakura Kurumi is the shy lolita supporting character. I... I have to roast her. I can\'t NOT do it. First of all, this character is ten years old, and she still brings her teddy bear, Albrecht, to school. In one episode, she underwent PTSD harder than a war veteran at the peak of his \'Nam flashbacks because she *lost her bear* only to have the apparent psychedelic trip she\'s obviously on go into full swing when the teddy bear started talking to her in a magical land filled with giant mushrooms, because of, you guessed it, those darn Phantoms meddling in peoples\' business! Second of all, her hair makes me pop a blood vessel in my eye harder than the filthy lolicons can pop a stiffy to hentai of her. She legitimately looks as though she woke up and called downstairs, ""Hey, mom! Can I look like a praying mantis today?"" It\'s even worse because her character was cute, to the point where I\'m sickened by it all, and her development as a character is only slight, with her shy demeanor being a less crippling obstacle for her by a minute amount.As you can tell, I have a deep-rooted loathing/disappointment for some of these characters. What is even more hilarious is that KyoAni tries to that thing, that really annoying thing where they make the harem aspect more harem-y by poking fun at the bonds between Haruhiko and the girls, like ""when are they gonna go out/get married?""Enjoyment: 4/10Despite me ragging on Musaigen for its awful cast, I guess it\'s...fun? I mean, I guess that\'s all it is, like Chuunibyou was. The humour that Musaigen brought to the table was more or less hit or miss with a lot of the audience. It wasn\'t gut-busting when you did get it, either: it was just a little chuckle, or slightly more air escaping your nostrils. It was more or less cute girls doing cute things with a guy being thrown into awkward and risque situations for comedic relief. As a grown man who has undergone tons of cute girls doing cute things with Yuru Yuri, School-Live!, Kiniro Mosaic, Love Lab, and more, to be turned off from watching something with that many incorporations of moe-trash in it defeats me, really. Still, it is what I classify as fun, using the word ""fun"" as loosely as possible.Overall: 5/10 ((5+8+6+2+4)/5 = 5)It\'s average, at best. The sound is okay and the art is amazing. However, the music was rather lacklustre, the story could have been executed in a much better way, and the characters absolutely sucked. It\'s enjoyable only when you\'re making fun of it, honestly. KyoAni came up to bat, and while they did try to provide a very good show, it just became something that was namby-pamby, wishy-washy, and relatively bland like unflavoured tofu. All I can say is that at least they tried. But it wasn\'t their best, not by a long shot. alert, you can catch KyoAni red-handed. We\'ve seen it with Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, we\'ve seen it with Free! Iwatobi Swim Club; we\'ve also seen it with spinoffs of rather successful/respectable KyoAni works, such as Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu, K-On!, and Hyouka.Musaigen no Phantom World is no different.

Hell, I think even InuYasha did it better: that show\'s cast at least had to JUMP through a bunch of flaming hoops to get to their goal.I think Musaigen\'s story started to tank when KyoAni defaulted to the boring high school setting, and not coming up with an original, or a not-so-overused setting. It was even exacerbation by giving a select few characters in the show super powers, in a sense. In hindsight... it wasn\'t exactly the best idea. It wasn\'t even a good idea. They\'re not just abilities, but they\'re... ""special"" abilities. Because having a teddy bear grow to ten times its size to fight for you, and rubbing your jugs to try and use the ""element of fire from your heart"" is definitely what I call ""special.""Art: 8/10I gotta give it to Kyoto Animation: they know to make even some of their worst works look really, REALLY good. I feel bad to constantly roast them like this, since Musaigen\'s art has been proven to be very well done. The effects are very nice, too, and everything in the show feels really vibrant. I haven\'t experienced good visual quality like it since Hyouka or Hibike! Euphonium.Their art and visual effects might have been their saving grace if everything else was better. Unfortunately, that is not the case.Sound: 6/10Musaigen has fairly decent sound as well as their art. The sound effects of fight scenes between the characters and the Phantoms, the battle roars/cries of the Phantoms during these fights, the small little lilts of noise of each character\'s abilities; all of them are relatively decent. Sadly, Musaigen\'s SOUNDTRACK proves to be an issue: the OP and EP are both rather unmemorable and grating to the ears. The music during the fight scenes are heavily forgotten about as well, because of the visual effects that mesmerise us and distract us overall. Argh, damn you, beautiful graphics!Characters: 2/10Here we go, folks. We\'re at my least favourite part... or favourite. It is long, after all, so I guess it depends on whether or not you think I enjoy ranting about dreadful characters in Musaigen no Phantom World. Characters make up everything for the anime, from how we perceive them to how they develop from beginning to end. But Musaigen\'s characters are, for lack of a better term... trash.Haruhiko Ichijou is our main male protagonist, in a cast that is overrun with attractive females (and a loli.) That alone should already be ringing a loud angry alarm in your head to a nice, roaring 10 exawatts. He\'s basically the nerdy kid that gets ragged on by his peers for bearing too much ""useless"" information. While he has the ability to banish and summon Phantoms by quickly drawing them in his sketchbook, the first half of his special power is pretty much made null and void by Izumi Reina, who we will be getting to shortly. Thus, Haruhiko has become what we label a ""cuck"" after the first few episodes. He does undergo mild improvement, but nothing whatsoever that appears to get rid of that NTR  nature that shows he\'ll still get dumpster\'d by his friends.Haruhiko\'s annoying Phantom companion, Ruru, is basically a huge-chested Navi that\'s just blitzed on the strongest strain of amphetamines. She\'s cute to look at, but will cause the aneurysm in your head to swell more and more by the minute. I honestly thought she would be more levelheaded by the end, but unfortunately, that ain\'t the case.Kawakami Mai is the large-breasted female MC. Is that alarm from earlier getting louder in your head? Well, we\'re not even halfway done yet, so buckle up even further. She\'s an unoriginal character, quite frankly: large jugs, awesome feats of strength, seemingly perfect and adored by her peers: she\'s basically Medaka from Medaka Box, but blonde. Her ability lets her rub her body parts, namely her rack and her hips, to summon an element from their respective spots to fight Phantoms with... it\'s like a sensual version of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Booooring, next.Izumi Reina, another female MC, is basically the ""ojou-sama"" of the show, with her soft-spoken demeanor, proper manners, strict parents, and her urge of saying ""How dare you!"" every time Haruhiko gets too close to her goodies (because those are the apparent perks of being a male in a harem-like anime), resulting in her cucking - I mean, decking him. Her ability allows her to banish Phantoms by devouring them, and this not only cucks Haruhiko even more, but of course this has to interfere with her personal life: she has an unrealistic appetite, and can eat anyone under the table, but she never has enough money. She\'s not a boring character by any means, but that doesn\'t mean she\'s not generic in terms of her personality and traits.Minase Koito is yet another female MC in this ragtag harem of misfits. I can somewhat empathise with her: listening to music and being alone is what I do on a daily basis. However, she\'s basically just the generic ""lone wolf"" character who underwent ostracisation because she\'s more of a rebel/thug for her peers to handle. Her ability lets her use singing to combat Phantoms She\'s... okay, in the sense that she is cute, independent and can be kind of a badass at times, but her inability to warm up to others in reasonable time puts her behind greatly.Kumamakura Kurumi is the shy lolita supporting character. I... I have to roast her. I can\'t NOT do it. First of all, this character is ten years old, and she still brings her teddy bear, Albrecht, to school. In one episode, she underwent PTSD harder than a war veteran at the peak of his \'Nam flashbacks because she *lost her bear* only to have the apparent psychedelic trip she\'s obviously on go into full swing when the teddy bear started talking to her in a magical land filled with giant mushrooms, because of, you guessed it, those darn Phantoms meddling in peoples\' business! Second of all, her hair makes me pop a blood vessel in my eye harder than the filthy lolicons can pop a stiffy to hentai of her. She legitimately looks as though she woke up and called downstairs, ""Hey, mom! Can I look like a praying mantis today?"" It\'s even worse because her character was cute, to the point where I\'m sickened by it all, and her development as a character is only slight, with her shy demeanor being a less crippling obstacle for her by a minute amount.As you can tell, I have a deep-rooted loathing/disappointment for some of these characters. What is even more hilarious is that KyoAni tries to that thing, that really annoying thing where they make the harem aspect more harem-y by poking fun at the bonds between Haruhiko and the girls, like ""when are they gonna go out/get married?""Enjoyment: 4/10Despite me ragging on Musaigen for its awful cast, I guess it\'s...fun? I mean, I guess that\'s all it is, like Chuunibyou was. The humour that Musaigen brought to the table was more or less hit or miss with a lot of the audience. It wasn\'t gut-busting when you did get it, either: it was just a little chuckle, or slightly more air escaping your nostrils. It was more or less cute girls doing cute things with a guy being thrown into awkward and risque situations for comedic relief. As a grown man who has undergone tons of cute girls doing cute things with Yuru Yuri, School-Live!, Kiniro Mosaic, Love Lab, and more, to be turned off from watching something with that many incorporations of moe-trash in it defeats me, really. Still, it is what I classify as fun, using the word ""fun"" as loosely as possible.Overall: 5/10 ((5+8+6+2+4)/5 = 5)It\'s average, at best. The sound is okay and the art is amazing. However, the music was rather lacklustre, the story could have been executed in a much better way, and the characters absolutely sucked. It\'s enjoyable only when you\'re making fun of it, honestly. KyoAni came up to bat, and while they did try to provide a very good show, it just became something that was namby-pamby, wishy-washy, and relatively bland like unflavoured tofu. All I can say is that at least they tried. But it wasn\'t their best, not by a long shot.', 'You know, if this was done by another studio, I would have dropped this show in an instant. Since this was made by Kyoto Animation and I admit, I\'m a big KyoAni fag.....I mean fan, I decided to watch all 13 episodes. After 13 weeks of watching this show, I\'d like to send a personal note to the studio and it\'s going to say something like this:""What in God\'s name happened to you KyoAni?!!""[Story]: (2/10)""You can\'t believe everything you see, or can\'t see, for that matter.""Phantoms, beings that blur the line between illusion and reality, wander around right under the noses of unsuspecting humans....Their origins are mysterious and few can see them. That is, until a research facility bombing spreads a virus that gave ""birth"" to what we now know as ""Phantoms"". Humans with special powers are given the task of sealing the trouble-making Phantoms.Honestly, when I first read the synopsis, I thought KyoAni would finally produce a dark and serious anime. But alas, Phantom World teaches me to never hope for a serious and dark story from Kyoto Animation. I just gotta accept the fact that the last dark and serious story that I\'ll ever get from that studio is ""The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya"" which remains to be their best work the studio has ever done.Welp, time to review the story.....Wait a minute? Reviewing Phantom World\'s story? What story? The synopsis led me to believe that Phantom world will at least have an exciting story but this show doesn\'t even have a single ounce of story. Phantom World is basically an episodic show. Each episode, a Phantom stirs trouble and Haruhiro and the girls (or one of the girls alone Haruhiro) will take down the Phantom and save the day. That\'s what literally happened in Ep. 1 - 11. The first half of the series are just a bunch of character introductions. We get to see their personalities, their abilities and what you should expect from these characters. In the second half, it\'s pretty much what I said above. Phantom causes trouble and the characters take down the Phantoms.From Ep. 12-13, we finally get a mini story arc that was actually serious and has an actual antagonist explaining why he/she is doing whatever the hell he/she is doing to the city and it got something to do with the synopsis\' first paragraph. The short story arc was actually pretty good. It had an actual story, even though the story was short and the characters were suddenly serious and not annoying, Hell, even Ruru wasn\'t annoying. Too bad this wasn\'t enough to save the show.There is an explanation as to why the majority of the series was like a slice-of-life and Ep 12 suddenly introduced a serious story. Appearantly, it isn\'t until Volume 2 where the story turns dark and serious and majority of the show is adapted from Volume 1 which explains the slice-of-life aspect of the series. If this was a 2 cour series then Phantom World would turn out a lot better.Ranting aside, I did enjoy the show. How did I enjoy this show you ask? Simple, I switched my perspective when I realized that Phantom World will not have a story arc and will instead, be a random episodic show. Since I also watch a lot of slice of life shows, I looked at this show from a SoL viewpoint and I ended up enjoying the show much more than I expected. The comedy aspect is there and the characters are surprisingly enjoyable to watch. This show was basically a time-killer for me. A show where I can turn my brain off and relax.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (10/10)As usual, Kyoto Animation produces one of the best animation in the industry. Great art, Great character designs, the lighting is amazing, the background is well-drawn, and the animation is very smooth and consistent. Just think of Hibike Euphonium except the character\'s faces aren\'t blushing all the time.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (10/10)The soundtrack was simply amazing!! Kyoto Animation did a shitty job on Phantom World\'s ""non-existent"" storyline but on the other hand, they did an outstanding job on the show\'s Battle scene\'s OST.  Especially that battle theme that plays when the characters are about to do their special moves. I wish I could post a video where the battle theme is playing because explaining it won\'t do justice to the show\'s soundtrack. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme song is ""Naked Dive"" by SCREEN mode and the ED theme song is ""Junshin Always"" by Azusa Tadokoro. Ever since I heard the OP theme song, I\'ve been listening to it non-spot because it\'s catchy as hell and there was that one scene in the OP Animation where the loli was dancing while holding her teddy bear in the cutest way possible. I\'m not a lolicon but I have to admit, the loli dancing caught my.........heart. I also love the ED theme song because it\'s catchy and the singer\'s voice is beautiful.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (6.5/10)Haha, man..KyoAni managed to put every cliched and cute characters that you could ever think of in a single show. There\'s a generic male protagonist, a big-boobed senpai, a flat chested girl, a girl who has trouble socializing, a fu**king loli, an annoying fairy and a friendly/helpful teacher. The only logical reason why you and I watched this show in the first place (and somehow enjoyed it) is the characters. All the girls are cute, they all have a set of unique and cliched personalities that we have all seen before a million times but for whatever reason, we just keep coming back because we enjoy seeing these personalities (if they\'re done right) and the characters are hilarious when they\'re all together. Now, my thoughts on the main characters.First up, we have ""Mai Kawakami"" or what I\'d like to call her ""Mayonnaise-sama"". I wouldn\'t be surprised if we get a mouse pad with a picture of Mai and her boobs used as a wrist support to satisfy all those horny Japanese males. Like her breasts are big as hell so you\'ll be seeing them bouncing all the time throughout the show even if you try to avoid looking. If you want to learn ""Boob Physics 101"", do watch the ""Limbo scene"" at the first episode because I\'m sure you\'ll enjoy it. Her appearance aside, she\'s a complete tsundere and she does get a bit of character development at the late latter half of the show. Also, to no surprise, she gains feelings for the protagonist, though she didn\'t gain feelings for him randomly. A cute big-boobed tsundere = 100% ""pure"" waifu material.Next up, we have ""Reina Izumi"". A flat-chested innocent girl who eats a lot of food but for whatever reason, she just doesn\'t gain any weight. Her ability is to literally suck up the Phantoms and that explains why she eats an abundance amount of food. Reina-chan is actually my most favourite character in the series simply because she\'s a flat-chested innocent girl who eats a lot of food.Then there\'s ""Koito Minase"" or what I\'d like to call her ""Headphone-chan"". Headphone-chan is basically one of those emo girls who brushes off other people and prefers to not socialize. Honestly, she\'s the most boring character in the series and if you prefer anti-social girl types then you found her.Then there\'s ""Kurumi"", a loli that serves no goddamn purpose in the show whatsoever. I mean, why does she, an elementary schooler, hang around with a bunch of high school students? What purpose does she serve within the group or the show? Honestly, I feel like her only purpose in the show is to satisfy the pedophiles and to back up what I just said, Kurumi is an anime-original character and she does not exist in the LN\'s.........Yep.....Well, that and to show us that she ain\'t a ""useless"" kid. She has that ""Albrecht(o)"" bear that fights alongside her and also to make her even more cuter. Nah, I lied..she\'s a useless kid.Lastly, there\'s the protagonist Haruhiko and that fairy girl that hangs around him all the time ""Ruru"". Haruhiko is like the weakest protagonist I\'ve ever seen. The only time that he\'s ever strong is if he has that booklet or that final fight scene at the end of the series. Did I also tell you that he\'s also a generic protagonist? Oh right, I already did.. Ruru, on the other hand, is a likable character for me. Some, if not most, people might find her annoying but not me. I find her hilarious and there was that one episode in the late 2nd half that made her somewhat of a better character.In the first half, each episode was dedicated to Haruhiko and at least one of the female characters. For example, Haruhiko and Mai and the next episode, it\'s Haruhiko and Reina and etc. This basically gave the show a chance to give them a bit of character development. It\'s not much though. It\'s just basics like you learn why Koito is an anti-social or why Reina is acting the way she is. The 2nd half also developed Haruhiko and Mai\'s character but again, not that much.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (7.8/10)Even though the story was pretty much non-existent, I still enjoyed the show. Phantom World was more of a ""turn your brain off"" kind of anime for me and also a time killer. I just didn\'t take it seriously and at the end, I wasn\'t as mad at the show as I was expecting to be.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]""Myriad Colors Phantom World"" may have been an enjoyable anime to me but I\'m disappointed to say that this is now Kyoto Animation\'s worst anime ever. The story was basically non-existent and the only aspect this show has its going is it\'s characters and the animation/soundtracks. Though, the characters will vary because not everyone will enjoy the characters like I did. If you look at this show from a slice-of-life point of view then you might enjoy this series. However, if you\'re expecting a serious story similar to the synopsis then it\'s better if you skip this show.[OVERALL]: (6.8/10)Pros:+Enjoyable series when you look at it from a slice-of-life point of view+Outstanding Animation+Amazing Soundtrack + Great OP and ED theme songs+All of the character may be cliched as hell but they\'re still enjoyable to watchCons:-Non-Existent Storyline-A lot of Fanservice scenes and that Limbo Scene-Too Much Mai Boobs-Kurumi serves no purpose in the show other than to satisfy the pedophiles-A bit of character development but there\'s not a lot Their origins are mysterious and few can see them.

And after sitting through the whole thing, the only feeling I have regarding the overall reaction is confusion. Seriously guys, this show isn\'t that bad. It\'s not all that good, but almost none of the complaints I\'ve heard tossed in its direction are really valid. I mean what smug self-awareness? What excessive fanservice? What exactly is supposed to be awful about this show that you couldn\'t also...say about Konosuba and Dagashi Kashi? Is it the fact that until the little kid showed up, there wasn\'t enough moe to tide you guys?Okay, I\'m pretty sure it was the first two or so episodes that pretty much dug the show\'s grave because they did have bad meta humor and stupid sexualization jokes - although the reaction to them was so overblown I couldn\'t be bothered to look at the stupid nicknames people gave. If the initial (very low) scores for Classroom Crisis, Punch Line, and Concrete Revolutio have shown anything, it\'s that anime fans are very unforgiving of poor first impressions, along with the fact that they are very forgiving when you make a good first impression even when the rest of the show is shit...unless your name is Coppelion I mean. And ""KyoAni light novel adaptation"" has sort of become a curse word in fandom these days, so no one was really willing to give the show a chance from the very start besides naive diehards and...there\'s no ""and"" after that. Of course, it would have helped if the start of your show was actually indicative of the rest of said show because it feels like the first two episodes and the remaining eleven were made by completely different writing teams. Maybe there was some muppets-like change in staff during pre-production but they didn\'t have enough time to rewrite the premiere or something.Phantom World is KyoAni\'s second attempt at writing a Rumiko Takahashi-like gag anime based on a light novel in that it takes place in a seemingly normal school setting that just so happens to house the supernatural after some scientific nonsense involving the human senses that I\'m pretty sure our main lead, Haruhiko Ichijou, pulled out of his ass happened more than a decade ago. For the most part, each episode follows a certain formula. At the beginning of every episode, Haruhiko will give an annoying speech about Japanese culture/high philosophy and how it relates to the episodic scenario at hand whilst his flying phantom tag-along, Ruru, does some ""hilarious"" side commentary on the side. After that, a phantom shows up to cause trouble for Haruhiko and his female (and only female, unless you count the giant teddy bear) friends. A mixture of character humor and feels occur, usually ending in the phantom\'s defeat. And depending on the episode, the final few minutes will either depict our characters feeling happy about themselves or getting screwed by a last-minute twist that will be ignored come next week.Now I said Phantom World reminds me of Urusei Yatsura, but to be more precise, it reminds me of that show\'s more serious side rather than its comedic side. Only a handful of the episodes go for straight-up gag plots, whilst the majority of them resemble episodes like when Lum travelled different dimensions to find the real Ataru or when Ataru\'s mother has a weird psychedelic ""Mamoru Oshii-style"" dream after a mall accident. Basically, they\'re self-contained character episodes that try to make you feel for the cast whilst keeping its light-hearted tone the entire way through so that you can laugh at the absurdity of our main character being trapped in a world of talking teddy bears whilst feeling sad when said teddy bear gets wounded in battle and the little kid character gathers her courage in the form of a magical girl uniform in order to fight off a giant bear mecha. And considering this is a KyoAni anime, the animation is good for the most part, with the studio even splurging a bit on the atmospheric set pieces here. From the aforementioned teddy bear world to the giant cat who looks like he came from Howl\'s Moving Castle to that weird dream world of bunnies where toilets are apparently considered portals to another dimension in Japanese folklore, I guess KyoAni learned from Chuunibyou that you don\'t have to take yourself too seriously to convey feels.What I like about Phantom World\'s humor over, say, Osomatsu-san\'s or Active Raid\'s is that there\'s almost no self-awareness at all in either the direction or the characters - again, a stark contrast to the show\'s initial episodes which was nothing but bad self-aware meta humor. Seriously, I have no idea why those first two episodes even exist (besides introducing the characters I mean) if the rest if the show wasn\'t going to follow their formula. But even when the show aims for a more gag-related plot during its later installments, it always puts on a straight face whilst delivering the jokes, allowing for some actual fucking irony to show up and make things funny. It also helps that without Amagi\'s lackluster overarching narrative burdening things and the comedic timing being as quick and energetic as Cats Don\'t Dance\'s (no gags that get drawn out far past the point where the humor is lost. It\'s a miracle!), Phantom World is able to execute its mixture of humor and character drama fairly evenly without either side dominating the other.Where the show falters, besides its crappy start I mean, is that the characters are stereotypes. It\'ll take too long to explain why, but besides the comedic situations that they\'re put into, there\'s not really much to them, which I think is the main reason why I never found this show as funny or engaging as Urusei Yatsura even at its best. The cast of Yatsura may not be the most sophisticated bunch, but there character traits are inherently ironic by nature (ex. Lum is a sweet-tempered naive girl who\'ll nevertheless put her man in place with electric shocks), whereas Mai is just a tsundere girl with big boobs who\'s good at fighting and has a low opinion of her only male friend. And if you don\'t like the humor, then you\'re not going to appreciate the character drama either, because it never grows beyond the quality expected of a Disney Afternoon show and certainly doesn\'t compare to more current ""comedic cartoons"" like Steven Universe or Gravity Falls. There\'s a reason a good chunk of this show\'s watchers prefer episodes where Haruhiko is turned into a kid whilst not being so kind to the episode when Ruru is given a human body, is all I\'m saying.It also doesn\'t help that the show falls under that stupid ""let\'s get serious for the final act"" syndrome most light novel/gag anime go through. Without spoiling anything, the final two episodes introduce a new monster of the week in order to prey on Haruhiko\'s mother issues, but unlike when Ranma did in the 90s, it\'s incredibly rushed, takes itself too seriously compared to Phantom World\'s usual ""serious"" tone, and what little gags do show up in those episodes are nothing more than cheap stuff that acknowledges its light novel roots without actually doing anything with them, which wasn\'t funny when Konosuba did it either. So basically, you\'ve got a show where the first two episodes and the last two episodes are pure crap, whilst the remaining nine...well they\'re not exactly gold, but they never dip below bronze level and I\'d say the amount of silver amongst them combined with the lack of real continuity keeps the show afloat enough to the point where I didn\'t leave disappointed.As far as LN adaptations/KyoAni stuff goes, Phantom World is a functional gag anime you can tolerate whilst waiting for the Euphonium sequel to blow your mind. It\'s nothing you should go back and give another try now that the season is winding down if you\'re one of the many who dropped it early on, but being ranked lower than fucking Undefeated Bahamut Chronicles whilst airing is just irrational no matter how you look at it guys. Seriously, how on earth did it score lower than that mess? But anyways, as long as you don\'t take the show\'s drama too seriously and start at Episode 3 since it\'s not really the kind of show where you have to see every episode, you\'ll probably have a fun time - as well as more proof that you should never hang out in anime communities if you value your free time. say about Konosuba and Dagashi Kashi? Is it the fact that until the little kid showed up, there wasn\'t enough moe to tide you guys?Okay, I\'m pretty sure it was the first two or so episodes that pretty much dug the show\'s grave because they did have bad meta humor and stupid sexualization jokes - although the reaction to them was so overblown I couldn\'t be bothered to look at the stupid nicknames people gave. If the initial (very low) scores for Classroom Crisis, Punch Line, and Concrete Revolutio have shown anything, it\'s that anime fans are very unforgiving of poor first impressions, along with the fact that they are very forgiving when you make a good first impression even when the rest of the show is shit...unless your name is Coppelion I mean. And ""KyoAni light novel adaptation"" has sort of become a curse word in fandom these days, so no one was really willing to give the show a chance from the very start besides naive diehards and...there\'s no ""and"" after that. Of course, it would have helped if the start of your show was actually indicative of the rest of said show because it feels like the first two episodes and the remaining eleven were made by completely different writing teams. Maybe there was some muppets-like change in staff during pre-production but they didn\'t have enough time to rewrite the premiere or something.Phantom World is KyoAni\'s second attempt at writing a Rumiko Takahashi-like gag anime based on a light novel in that it takes place in a seemingly normal school setting that just so happens to house the supernatural after some scientific nonsense involving the human senses that I\'m pretty sure our main lead, Haruhiko Ichijou, pulled out of his ass happened more than a decade ago. For the most part, each episode follows a certain formula. At the beginning of every episode, Haruhiko will give an annoying speech about Japanese culture/high philosophy and how it relates to the episodic scenario at hand whilst his flying phantom tag-along, Ruru, does some ""hilarious"" side commentary on the side. After that, a phantom shows up to cause trouble for Haruhiko and his female (and only female, unless you count the giant teddy bear) friends. A mixture of character humor and feels occur, usually ending in the phantom\'s defeat. And depending on the episode, the final few minutes will either depict our characters feeling happy about themselves or getting screwed by a last-minute twist that will be ignored come next week.Now I said Phantom World reminds me of Urusei Yatsura, but to be more precise, it reminds me of that show\'s more serious side rather than its comedic side. Only a handful of the episodes go for straight-up gag plots, whilst the majority of them resemble episodes like when Lum travelled different dimensions to find the real Ataru or when Ataru\'s mother has a weird psychedelic ""Mamoru Oshii-style"" dream after a mall accident. Basically, they\'re self-contained character episodes that try to make you feel for the cast whilst keeping its light-hearted tone the entire way through so that you can laugh at the absurdity of our main character being trapped in a world of talking teddy bears whilst feeling sad when said teddy bear gets wounded in battle and the little kid character gathers her courage in the form of a magical girl uniform in order to fight off a giant bear mecha. And considering this is a KyoAni anime, the animation is good for the most part, with the studio even splurging a bit on the atmospheric set pieces here. From the aforementioned teddy bear world to the giant cat who looks like he came from Howl\'s Moving Castle to that weird dream world of bunnies where toilets are apparently considered portals to another dimension in Japanese folklore, I guess KyoAni learned from Chuunibyou that you don\'t have to take yourself too seriously to convey feels.What I like about Phantom World\'s humor over, say, Osomatsu-san\'s or Active Raid\'s is that there\'s almost no self-awareness at all in either the direction or the characters - again, a stark contrast to the show\'s initial episodes which was nothing but bad self-aware meta humor. Seriously, I have no idea why those first two episodes even exist (besides introducing the characters I mean) if the rest if the show wasn\'t going to follow their formula. But even when the show aims for a more gag-related plot during its later installments, it always puts on a straight face whilst delivering the jokes, allowing for some actual fucking irony to show up and make things funny. It also helps that without Amagi\'s lackluster overarching narrative burdening things and the comedic timing being as quick and energetic as Cats Don\'t Dance\'s (no gags that get drawn out far past the point where the humor is lost. It\'s a miracle!), Phantom World is able to execute its mixture of humor and character drama fairly evenly without either side dominating the other.Where the show falters, besides its crappy start I mean, is that the characters are stereotypes.

The show harbors a copious amount of overused tropes and cheeky moments of fanservice. While the fanservice often tries and succeeds in being fresh and original (like boob limbo), the tropes are only made somewhat less trope-y by a blunt act of self-awareness, an example being Haruhiko spouting exposition and Ruru acknowledging that he’s going on and on about something the characters should already know, therefore solving the problem of boring exposition by pointing out that it’s...boring exposition, rather than just changing it to be more engaging.The way Myriad Colors Phantom World introduces its characters is fairly simple, giving each girl an episode where they deal with some sort of Phantom that inadvertently reveals an inner struggle that is resolved happily and lightly referenced from here on out with no actual significance in the long haul. In the end all you really need to know about these characters are their quirks and powers. Other than that, they will be used in whatever way any future situations see fit.After the group is fully formed the show becomes a Phantom of the Week wacky sitcom. This gives it an opportunity to explore a variety of themes without being confined by a cohesive narrative. This is what Phantom World excels at, as it doesn’t seem to know what it wants or where it’s going with the overarching plot. Episodes range from charming to bombastically funny to genuinely heartwarming. This all keeps to an episode structure that Phantom World can’t seem to stray away from, where every episode needs to end with an action-y climax caused by some sort of Phantom, no matter how out of place it may be.The show goes on like this until the last two episodes, because cliffhangers are absolutely essential to creating a worthwhile finale (sarcasm). This is where the show finally falls off the tightrope it has been treading on since the very beginning, the fine line between derivative and self-aware derivative. Without spoilers, Phantom World ends in an incredibly generic, final fight way, and it’s very disappointing considering the much more enjoyable approach the show had been taking three episodes ago.As for the characters, they’re all fairly likable with the exception of Haruhiko, our main male protagonist who is a bland, nice guy know it all that until the very end only serves as an exposition device that nobody likes. Minase is established as a group member pretty poorly, as the show acknowledges later on by Mai saying “You know, I hadn’t even noticed that you’d joined our team.” That being said, she’s a cool loner type character that is exceptionally skilled in the field of Phantom hunting, all while being socially awkward! Then there’s Izumi, who eats a lot and is cute. Oh, and Kurumi who is also cute and has a teddy bear. Finally, there’s Mai, who is a spunky athletic student with big boobs.The Things It Does WellMyriad Colors Phantom World knows how generic it is and openly admits it rather than trying to subvert it, which sometimes results in moments of genuine originality and humor. And despite its generic plot, the show always remains visually engaging, with excellent action sequences and stunning scenery, the clipping was done in a way that never let a still frame sit for too long. At its best, Myriad Colors Phantom World is a legitimately funny sitcom with a mostly likeable cast in a world with very little rules to abide by, creating an endless amount of possible wacky misadventures.The Things It Doesn’t Do WellWhile Phantom World does try to give attention to every trope it uses, some just come through as utterly generic and uninteresting, like in the final episode. The show doesn’t seem to know where it’s going and emotional plot points feel incredibly phoned in. It even toys with the idea of a harem, but just like many of its other tropes, the show fails to fully commit, leaving nothing but a few laughs and a feeling of wasted time. At its worst, Myriad Colors Phantom World is a generic magical action show that pretends to not be generic by showing it’s aware of how generic it is and doing it anyway.(Note: Review is also posted on my blog, this is not plagiarized) boring exposition, rather than just changing it to be more engaging.The way Myriad Colors Phantom World introduces its characters is fairly simple, giving each girl an episode where they deal with some sort of Phantom that inadvertently reveals an inner struggle that is resolved happily and lightly referenced from here on out with no actual significance in the long haul.

This show contains:FanserviceHigh School settingSlapstick violence as “humor”Accidental perversionViolent, big boobed female main characterFanserviceSpecial power only the MC has for… reasonsSide character to create comedic relief...Side character to fill the viewer in on what is going onSide character to create fanserviceA loliOnly 1 male characterLight Novel adaptationYou have been warned.Musaigen no Phantom World is your typical high school, battle harem type of show that’s slowly taking over the industry. Shows like these are easy to spot, since all the female characters are in the foreground of the “poster” and the only male character in the background.Story 6/10After an incident that happened over a decade ago (which is never brought up again) some stuff happened in the human brain and they can see these phantoms… Yeah, that’s really as far as the exposition goes.The show takes place in a world where phantoms exist and are causing all kinds of mild annoyances. Not phantoms from another dimension that’s planning to destroy the world, or some spiritual thingy majiggers planning to take over the world, but phantoms that take creep shots of girls, phantoms who block people from crossing a bridge and the occasional phantom brute that goes around and destroys lampposts.The story follows a group of teenagers in high school, who are in the phantom hunting club. Their job/duty is to investigate and take care of reported incidents involving these phantoms. The reason that they even bother signing up for this and sometimes risk their lives when dealing with the phantoms is that they’re being paid by the school for doing so. Not in money, but in different assets like rice or other edible substances.It’s a “phantom of the week” type of show so far. Each problem/phantom have been dealt with within a single episode and it looks like it isn’t going to change.Art 8/10The art is the only thing that I can complement in this show. Kyoto Animation is the studio behind the show and if you know who they are, you know what you can expect. If you don’t know who they are, you can expect great animation and a perfectly designed color palette for this show. The scenery is really good, the fights are fluid and the animation and overall animation quality of the show is great.Sound 6/10There’s nothing bad about it the music, but here’s also nothing noteworthy to write about. The music is electronic’ish sounding and fast paced. The sound effects when fighting are on point and timed okay, but that’s all there really is to say about it.The opening desperately tries to squeeze as much fanservice in as possible. Boob jiggles, up skirts, cosplays, under boobs and even fucking pixelated naked shots of each girl in the show! I mean, what the fuck are they thinking?!And the ending… The male MC isn’t even in there. The ending is just another way to show of the girls.Characters 4/10Our (only) male main character (whose name isn’t really that important) is introduced by the flying blob of fanservice, forcefully opening his eyelid and reminding him that he’s running late. He is submissive to any and all violence thrown at him from his “friends” and is weak, if it weren’t for his one power. Well… Realistically speaking he’s still pretty weak, even with his “power.” His power is that if he draws the phantom they’re fighting in a book, the book will then absorb the phantom and the danger will be gone. Except his power is completely redundant, since they have “Reina Izumi” in the phantom hunting club.His sole reason for being in the show, is because they need something YOU can project yourself onto. He’s just there so you can think “I wish that was me getting thrown out of the window for seeing a girl in a towel.”Our first female main character “Mai Kawakami” (you might want to google her name not too far into the future ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) is everything the male main character isn’t. First and foremost, she is a girl. Secondly, she has big breasts. Thirdly, she knows martial arts and can fight, which makes her boobs jiggle (Can you see where I’m going with this?) Her special ability is to power herself up with different elements (fire, water, electricity). She does that by fondling herself...Other than that, she likes to physically torment the main male character for the sake of “comedy”. She doesn’t have any romantic interest in the MC, so her violent actions towards the MC can’t be excused as a “it’s not like I like you or anything” dropkick or a “d-don’t get the wrong idea” punch in the face.Our second female main character “Reina Izumi” (AKA Kirby) is the nonviolent and the “oh so innocent Ojou-sama” part of the trio. Her special ability is to suck up/eat phantoms in an extravagant and Kirby way. She is the main victim of “accidental perversion.”She is the character that I dislike the least. She has an actual reason for joining the phantom hunting club. Since she’s living on her own and most of her money goes towards rent (let me remind you that she is a teenager) she can get food by dealing with the phantoms.The third main character is introduced 3 episodes in. Her name is Koito Minase. The show plays her off as the ""cool kid"" archetype. She wears headphones, her hands are almost always in her pockets and has an overly long “chant” she has to say before activating her destructive and monotone voice, which she calls her “power.” She also has a deep, dark and mysterious past, as the archetype typically has.Lastly, there’s the flying blob of fanservice Ruru. She is a phantom who sided with the MC for reasons that we don’t know. She doesn’t do anything action wise and adds nothing to the story besides fanservice, comedic relief and exposition.Enjoyment 5/10There’s this particular scene that I enjoyed a bit, before the tropes and clichés began to molest it. Picture this:MC tries to convince Reina to join their club. Reina walks away from MC, but trips on the stairs.Our HERO! Our SAVIOUR! Our MC rushes down the stairs and is ready to shield her face from the concrete when he realizes that he’s about to grab her boob. Our white knight makes a meta and 4th wall breaking statement before stopping the cliché by grabbing his own hand and pulling it away, resulting in a faceplant.The flying blob of fanservice then breaks physics, lifts Reina over the MC and literally gives the MC a face full of ass. He manages to say that he did not see her panties (which were in fact blue striped, as shown in his eyes), before getting his ass kicked by Reina.It’s like they’re trying to be funny, only for it to turn out to be as generic as the ten thousand other shows that already did this.I really want to enjoy the show, but it’s really fucking hard to do, when everything about it screams HIGH SCHOOL BATTLE HAREM FANSERVICE!!!Overall 5/10The soundtrack is okay, the show is very well animated and has the KyoAni look to it, but that is not nearly enough to save this show.A good chef can’t make good food with shit ingredients. It’s the same with KyoAni. They can’t make a thoughtful and interesting show, if the source material is just another batch of copy paste shit that’s clogging up the industry, like this morning’s oatmeal that I forgot to take out of the sink.*Reposted because it got removed.* Side character to fill the viewer in on what is going onSide character to create fanserviceA loliOnly 1 male characterLight Novel adaptationYou have been warned.Musaigen no Phantom World is your typical high school, battle harem type of show that’s slowly taking over the industry.

Its premise had the potential to make this something memorable, and to have an actual plot. Sadly, it decided to throw this away in favour of episodic and unconnected episodes, cardboard characters, general harem clichés and fanservice.An unexplained event sometime before the anime starts resulted in people seeing aberrant creatures, known as ""Phantoms"". These phantoms range from harmless inanimate objects which have manifested themselves into personalities, to dangerous creatures capable of murdering dozens of people.Given the potential danger these phantoms can pose, you would think that there would be a special...force set up designed to banish these phantoms as soon as they appear - after all, having scores of people murdered by rampaging giant monsters is not exactly something desirable.Instead, the story follows a group of high school students (it\'s always high school students..) who are training their powers in order to combat the phantoms. From right here you can see something doesn\'t add up - why would the defeat and capture of dangerous mythical creatures be left to the hands of emotional, untrained teenagers and kids? This particular side is never addressed. It\'s just seen as the norm for non-adults to take care of everything, whilst the teachers and other grown-ups just stand by at the sidelines, doing nothing but watching events unfold.There\'s no real plot to speak of. Each episode starts up with Haruhiko breaking the 4th wall, telling the viewer what the episode is going to focus on and giving some trivia pertinent to the events about to unfold. It is entirely episodic, too. Each episode focuses on a different character - one episode about Mai, one episode about Reina, one episode about Koito; so on and so forth. There isn\'t any progression.The characters themselves don\'t really have any defining personalities. Haruhiko is just the regular MC. He occasionally helps out. He\'s a nice guy, lending aid to people whilst being beaten up and slapped by the members of his harem when the tired old tropes and clichés appear, such as him tripping into someone\'s panties.Mai is one of the two primary focuses of the fanservice; she has to rub her tits and other parts of her body whilst chanting in order to activate her powers.Ruru is a Phantom who exists purely for fanservice. She does nothing else. For instance, in one scene Mai and Haruhiko are talking. Rather than focus on the talk, the camera zooms in on Ruru and we simply watch her doing leg exercises, whilst the conversation carries on in the background.Koito, Kurumi and Reina play the role of the kuudere, the loli and the shy one, respectively.All of the characters get an equal amount of screentime, and contribute an equal amount to the events that unfold. Each are given an episode in the spotlight which focuses on their problems and their past.The art and animation is the absolute high point for the series. Say whatever you will about the rest of this anime; the art cannot be faulted. Simply put, it is gorgeous. Even without the fanservice, it is nothing short of pure eye candy. The art is crisp, and the colours vivid. It makes it a pleasure to watch, even when one finds themselves uninterested in what\'s actually happening. The animation is top-notch, too. This is especially apparent where the phantoms are concerned. The effects used on them - such as the particles emanating from some of them, and the way they flicker as they move around - look awesome. You can tell a lot of effort has been put into it - nothing less expected of KyoAni.It is a shame, then, that it is only the art and animation that has had a lot of effort put into it. Each episode consists merely of tropes, clichés and all the regular things associated with fantasy highschool harem anime. If you\'re a fan of this particular genre, then you will probably enjoy Musaigen no Phantom World. It brings everything we\'ve seen before, but with the art and animation cranked into overdrive. I will mention that the fanservice is reduced in the quantity in the later episodes. It is not nearly as prevalent as it was at the beginning.But if you\'re tired of the same old, then avoid this. There\'s nothing new about this. There\'s no particular reason to prioritise watching this over any other highschool harem.I gave this a 4/10 overall. There was no real reason for me to feel invested or interested. If not for the amazing art I would have rated this lower. It isn\'t bad; it is merely uninspired.

Unfortunately it isnt due to the fact the plot isn't existent until episode 12 the 2nd to last episode of the season. Its mainly a comedy with fanservice and humor, so a typical harem, nothing special right?The main problem with this is that there were so many expectations for this anime due to the synopsis sounded pretty neat. If it actually got rid off most of episodes 3-9 and made ones with actual plot this would have lived up to these expectations.Having said that i did find it an enjoyable watch and watched the eps as they...came out not really complaining about it. It was a relaxing anime meant to be fun not edge of your seat binge watch stuff.Pros :- relaxing and gives a good laugh- Mai senpai- Plot picks up later in show- Fanservice- All the girls are enjoyable- Another shipping warCons:- No real plot till late in the show- Characters are cut and paste (might not be seen as bad)- Another shipping war- does not meet expectations in terms of storyStory : 5 - In terms of story i feel this is why a lot of people were let down by this anime. The synopsis sounds good and you expect a plot driven anime. However no plot really happens till episode 11 where the you actually might start to care about the MC and hint of plot actually happens. So story is a 5 simply because it did not deliver much story at all until very late but when it did instantly wanted more.Sound: 6 - like most recently of KyoAni the animation is good but nothing different from other works really.Art: 6 - same explanation as sound.Character: 7 - In terms of characters, for the first half you are only watching it for the girls as the MC has no character development. Most of the characters are cut and paste really. Only 4 characters out of around 10 you only really care about and have any kind of development at all. However the characters are enjoyable and the girls really carry the show till later in the show.Enjoyment: 8 - As many flaws and typical harem characteristics it has i really did enjoy it. The character interactions are funny and the story when it finally picks up bumps this enjoyment rating up.Overall: 7 - Due to the high expectations MnPW fails due to it being completely different to what was expected. However if you just want to relax and have a good laugh this is decent. If you want plot brave through to episode 11 or look somewhere else. came out not really complaining about it.

(like why is everything pixelated in the first episode? It didn\'t happen again...so what\'s the point showing this?)The characters are likeable, but don\'t progress really... Ruru-chan, the tiny Djini thinggets some development though.Art and Sound are pretty good. That\'s KyoAni for you. What I expected.The Enjoyment was there! I kinda wanted to know more about the world and wanted the characters to develop....but it didn\'t happen. MC just explained...the world a bit with some scientific stuff....seemed interesting at first but there was no point actually.But the characters are fun to watch anyway. Though, they happen to be a bit lifeless. KyoAni could bring up some good stuff with it though. (with MCs mum for example. There were the standard ""childhood in the past"" episodes....buuuut, yeah....that\'s it. They just were there. They should have sold the idea for it to Shaft. Pretty sure they would have made something good with it.All in all it seemed like the creators had many ideasand wanted to buld in as much as they could. They only had 13 episodes though and missed priorities that way.That\'s how it felt for me.But was fun while it lasted.p.s.THERE\'S WAIFUS FOR EVERY TASTE!!!I liked Minase Koite the best <3 the world a bit with some scientific stuff....seemed interesting at first but there was no point actually.But the characters are fun to watch anyway.

No. This anime one of the most bland anime i have ever seen, its not bad but there\'s nothing special at all with this anime.The story itself is all over the place, i cannot found any main plot that drive the anime along. It just filled with a tiny plot every episodes that didn\'t really effect other episodes. The worse thing is, they tease a mystery with a device that the main characters found in one of...the episodes, but in the end that devices still didn\'t really make an impact at all in any of the plot.Every episodes feels like a bullet points in a presentation. Every characters get their own ""character development"" episodes, a lot of anime do this too but the character usually keep developing even after they get their ""character development"" episodes. The ""character development"" episodes its just a way to introduce the personality of the characters to the audience. But in this anime, after they get the ""character development"" episodes, its like the anime forgot about their personality and they just change them just to fit the situation that the creator wants them to be in. For example, there\'s a character that is really reclusive suddenly trying to be seductive. It all just feel really unnatural and strange to me.The action scene is decent, nothing to write home about and not that bad either. A lot of fights ended really quick and not epic at all. The main characters will get defeated once, after that with some luck and a really powerful combo they defeated the enemy, rinse and repeat. Even the ending battle use this formula. In the end, nearly all the fight scene feels a little dull to be watched.The comedy is hit and miss, even though mostly miss. There\'s only a few comedy scene that makes me smile, not laugh. Smile. The rest its just a dull and cringe worthy moment for me. There\'s also some ecchi scene for the first 3 or 4 episodes, after that the anime just go to a totally different direction all together and abandon all the ecchi scene.The art is decent, the character design and the monster design is good enough and feels like it was made by a AAA production studio. The background music is either really bland or non existent at all, since i honestly  can\'t remember which scene that have background music. The only truly great thing that i can say the voices for Kurumi Kumamakura is really cute.In the end, Musaigen no Phantom World is a bland anime that didn\'t really know the direction that they want to go, so they decided to go everywhere and try everything that they can. If they didn\'t know the direction to go, how can the audience know how to follow it ? Is it worth your time ? No. There\'s a lot greater anime with similar plot that is better than this anime. the episodes, but in the end that devices still didn\'t really make an impact at all in any of the plot.Every episodes feels like a bullet points in a presentation.

If you want to know what it is all about then thats what the synopsis is for). The main character\'s name is Ichigo Haruhiko and he owns a harem, although the show denies any connection to the harem genre.The first thing noticeable about this show is the graphics. Lately, most animes I watch have the same generic graphics. None of them have particularly good or bad graphics, just generic. This show is different. In the title of the show (Myriad Colors...Phantom World) it already suggests that the show has good graphics because of the word myriad. Google the word if you don\'t already know  the meaning. (Assuming you\'ve Googled it) Good. Now that you know the definition you should know the show has a lot of color. The art is amazing (to summarize in less than one whole paragraph). This has become a lesson in English Language Arts, so i\'m just gonna move on.The sounds in this show are great. The opening is one of the most notable things about this show. Naked Dive is an amazing opening. It fits perfectly with the show\'s opening animation, although I can\'t say the same about the ending. I don\'t enjoy the ending that much. I think i\'ve only listened to it once or twice. Anyway, on to the next segment.The character development of this show is great. Unlike in other animes, there is light shone on the character\'s past. They don\'t randomly appear out of nowhere and announce, ""hey guys, i\'m a new character. Pay attention to me""  unlike other anime\'s main characters. They get their own episodes where their personality and past is revealed. Even answers about their past is revealed in the final episodes. The only people without their own episodes are irrelevant characters (like Ichigo\'s friend, who appears in every fourth-or-so episode lol) which is quite obvious. Even Ruru (Ichigo\'s phantom that follows him every where [similar to Ash and Pikachu\'s relationship]) gets her own episode.For the enjoyment of this show, I think you can tell by all the praise i\'ve given it. This is a really great, enjoyable show. I recommend you watch it soon. If you have nothing to watch and you want to see something with amazing graphics than this is the show for you.

Trying to follow it is like trying to herd cats! It goes all over the place, doesn\'t give the viewer any clear indication of why things are happening, and after the 7th episode I\'m still completely lost.The Art is...mediocre at best. There\'s a couple of good sequences but for the most part it\'s ""okay"". It is also it\'s only redeeming quality.Sound. So bad that you\'ll want to mute it during the first episode. The music is just as questionable as the story. It will get on your nerves and not let go. Just when you thought the torture was over it starts up again and leaves you wondering ""Why did they use this type of music during this scene?"". It\'s horrendous!Character. No. No. No. So Cliche and horrible. Tinkerbell meets Lolli meets Nisekoi meets... add whatever else you can think of here. It\'s all JAMMED into the first episode too!Enjoyment...

The actual story is pretty simple, following our main cast and their jobs involving the Phantoms.  Most episode were kind of like the ""monster of the week"" type of feel, with a couple cases where there were two-parters. These episodes also gave us the background on the characters, which is normal, but it also wasn\'t too forced. There is also some very useful information told in regards...to the human psyche, which is supposed to be one of the main themes of the series.The characters were fun to watch, with good chemistry and enough screen time to make them worth caring about. For the most part, we focus on the main cast (secondary characters don\'t play any significance to the story). There was one character who, after the first episode, I thought I was not going to like because of their personality. However, after seeing an episode focusing on them, and learning more about them (as well as remembering their voice actor, to whom I\'m a fan), they began to grow on me a bit.There\'s not much I can about the animation, as Kyoto Animation (or KyoAni, for short) does yet another fantastic job.

All of this happens because some giant umbrella corps-wanna be fucked shit up. That\'s it.No really, that\'s it. That\'s all you need to know. It starts off with a fan service shit that\'s over-the-top disgusting, ends up with a punch to your balls/vagina \'cause ""we need a serious plot LOL"" which only lasted 1 and a half episode. Sad ending? PFFT it\'s not sad all, it\'s so mediocre and bland that I actually punched...my screen \'cause I was so annoyed.If there\'s a season 2 of this, I\'ll just watch it while I\'m screaming in agony.And I thought Koukaku no Pandora was bad... my screen \'cause I was so annoyed.If there\'s a season 2 of this, I\'ll just watch it while I\'m screaming in agony.And I thought Koukaku no Pandora was bad...', ""When a studio as great as Kyoani has to resort to fan-service in the first episode in order to hook the viewer, you know that this show is going downhill pretty quickly.This show begins like countless other LN adaptations, with some info-dumping expository dialogue (“it’s common knowledge, but I’ll tell you anyway!” quips the main character) telling us that there has been some major “incident” that has fundamentally changed the inner workings of the human brain, and now everyone can see possibly real, possibly imaginary “Phantoms” which provide much of the story complications throughout. I like the idea that there might be strange entities all...around us that we simply cannot perceive, but this premise already becomes problematic when we see that the Phantoms are capable of physically damaging and interacting with objects in the real world, which makes you wonder why no one has noticed them already even without the ability to see them. This premise raises more questions than it can answers, and you shouldn’t expect any more elucidation on the backstory as it is suddenly brushed under the rug (cause the backstory really doesn’t matter, right?) and we are hurriedly introduced to our main cast. We have Haruhiko, who is slightly better than your run-of-the-mill LN protagonist but that’s not really saying much. He is much more tolerable than your standard LN protagonist as he spends very little time perving on girls and getting flustered, but instead we get to listen to him constantly drop useless titbits of knowledge throughout the series in a weak attempt to sell him as a ‘smart’ character. What could have been a totally tolerable character is spoiled by this obnoxious little detail which keeps cropping up in every single episode. An example of this is when the characters are searching for Phantom nicknamed “Enigma”. Haruhiko being Haruhiko, he chips in suddenly and explains the etymology of the word ‘enigma’ and also points out that it was also the name of a cipher machine developed in the Second World War. The real question here is, “who gives a fuck?” None of this information is relevant to anything that happens in the episode and and none of the other characters asked him for this information. Expect this to happen literally dozens of times throughout the series. Not only this, but the entire intro of every episode consists of Haruhiko posing as a sensei for 2 or 3 minutes which is also supposed to convince us that he is an intelligent character (and to also blatantly explain the theme of the episode to the brain-dead target audience, but that’s another matter). Here’s a tip for LN writers: if you want to sell a supposedly intelligent character, have them do things that are actually intelligent! Since the plot of most of the episodes usually contains a hint of mystery, the author have could have easily sold him as a smart character by having him deduce the answer to the mystery before everybody else. But instead the author takes the easy way out and we are left with a perfect example of how a “smart” shouldn’t be written.The other characters introduced are merely additions to Haruhiko’s inevitable harem (cause who isn’t turned on by a living trivia machine?) We have Mai Kawakami, whose literal first presence on the screen is a shot of her jiggling tits. Yeah, don’t expect much depth out of this character. We also get Reina Izumi; whose only character traits are that she is soft-spoken and polite, she eats a lot and she likes the main character. Her character gets briefly interesting when it is discovered that she has some family issues going on, but this is only addressed for one episode and there is no real conclusion as to how she sorted all of that out.The biggest wasted potential is the character of Ruru, the comedic relief of the show. Though I do admit that her antics occasionally brought a smile to my face, it’s painfully obvious that she could have been so much more than comedic relief. Ruru is a friendly Phantom, but the problem is that she is too much like the other characters, i.e, she is too human. This character could have been used effectively to provide a non-human entity’s perspective of all the odd-going-ons in this show, which would have highlighted the fundamental differences between a Phantom and a human. But…no. Ruru acts and reacts almost exactly like any another human despite being non-human in the first place, which feels lazy and uninspired. I didn’t hate this character but the waste of potential is palpable. Also, at certain points in the series when the characters are pondering the true nature of Phantoms, I can’t help but wonder why Ruru can’t offer some input on this matter. I mean, she herself is a Phantom, one capable of speech even, so shouldn’t she be able to elucidate on a few of these questions?These generic cast members are all super-power wielders and they hence join a Phantom hunting club. The general plot (if you can call it that) is your standard, episodic monster-of-the-week formula with a sudden overarching plot crammed into the end. The monster-of-the-week episodes are consistently disappointing and poorly handled. The episodes usually begin with some idle comedic banter between the main cast in their clubroom, before they start noticing some odd-going-ons happening here and there; anything from students turning into cats to the main character turning to a child. As the audience, we immediately know that a Phantom must be responsible for whatever the calamity is (what else could it be?), but it certainly takes a long time for the cast of supposed experienced Phantom hunter to make the logical connection. It can be quite frustrating watching the cast bumble around for so long before they reach the obvious conclusion. After dicking about generously, the cast finally tracks down the Phantom responsible and we generally treated to highly lacklustre fights. The fights might seem somewhat impressive at first glance given the amount of quick movement, flashy attacks and motion blur used, but looking closely I found them to be gravely lacking in fight choreography and their general composition and framing. In the end they are just very colourful clusterfucks, and I feel like the animation wizards at KyoAni could have done much better on this front. These confrontations also usually come way too suddenly for us to get emotionally invested in the fight at all, and occasionally the Phantom designs are so silly-looking that it makes the battle harder to take seriously. Given that these battles often serve as the pay-off to usually boring and obvious mysteries, I feel like they should been done a lot better. One another thing I noticed is that the show seems uncertain whether or not it wants to audience to sympathize with the Phantoms. Occasionally, the mischief-making Phantoms are forgiven by the main characters and other times they are treated to an ass-kicking. It’s all very inconsistent so it’s hard for us to get a consistent message out of this show.Perhaps reflecting Haruhiko’s pseudo-intellectual air, a few episodes in this series attempt to explore some genuine scientific concepts, such as Schrodinger’s Cat and collective consciousness. Unfortunately, these are always completely butchered by the show and they provide no food-for-thought of any kind; acting almost like Haruhiko’s irreverent fact-dropping. These scientific concepts are there simply for the sake of being there, and I doubt it really gets anyone’s brain juices flowing. These weak scientific connections annoyed me more than they should have.There are only a few episodes that actually felt almost worthwhile, the only problem being is that the events of those episodes are basically forgotten as the series continues. I will be summarizing the events of some episodes so beware of spoilers. [spoilers begin] One example of an episode that was almost worthwhile was the episode where Kurumi (the show’s token loli) gets sucked into a surreal world of her own imagining. Whereas I had some issues with the episode’s aesthetics, it felt worthwhile (for a short time at least) because it felt like Kurumi’s character had developed somewhat. She learns to fend for herself and she seemingly gives up her childish emotional attachment to her teddy bear, Albrecht. This episode felt satisfying because it felt as if a previously useless character had matured significantly. The only problem is that this DOESN’T LAST AT ALL, which in the grand scheme of things makes this episode absolutely POINTLESS. In the next few episodes, Kurumi goes back to being dead weight AND she still retains the childish habits that she seemingly shed in the previous episode! Why in the hell would you write an episode that develops a character only to reverse it immediately afterwards? Another similar, less frustrating, episode is the one where Reina gets sucked into an idyllic, pastel-coloured world where she has everything that she lacks in the real world. As mentioned before, she has troublesome family life, and naturally this idyllic world is attractive to her. This episode has a good message about avoiding escapism and facing your real world problems. However, we never get to see how Reina ends up fixing her family issues; instead, we just hear a quip from her in the final episode about how her family life is now suddenly going well. This subplot was the most (actually, the only) interesting thing about Reina’s character and I would have loved to see some more development. But in the end, we don’t get to see how it’s resolved and exactly what her family issues actually were in the first place, which is a real let-down in the end. [spoilers end]We do get a two-episode long story arc right towards the end of the series, which ends up being quite a bit better than the previous episode. It’s still nothing great, but at least it develops some characters further and reveals some backstory. At this point the show’s quality bumps up to at least a 5/10 but this arc isn’t enough to change my general feelings about the show. It's still full of stupidities and an has an uneven tone throughout.KyoAni clearly knows that the source material they are working with is no good, so they attempt to breathe some life into it with their usual visual and aesthetic magic. I’d say it’s above average for the most part. The animation quality is consistent all the way throughout, and I find the character designs very pleasing (minus some of the Phantom designs). KyoAni experiments with a myriad of different colour schemes (sorry) and the end result is quite eye-popping. It certainly gives off the feeling that something significant has been changed about this world. Some episodes give off very different vibes than the others, with KyoAni even hiring out-of-house talent to give more variety to the visuals; a very rare move for this studio. Some episodes like the pastel-world are especially impressive, and thus I would have liked to have seen some more experimentation with the whole art style rather than just the colour scheme. The general shot composition is pretty great with each episode providing several standout shots, but typical of a KyoAni show directed by Tatsuya Ishihara, the sense of pacing with regards to the cuts is definitely problematic. Many times, the editing is far too rapid for us to truly soak in the details of each shot, which defeats the purpose of putting so much thought and detail into some of these shots. Another issue I had with the aesthetic of the show is the constant use of pixelation as a visual motif. This is heavily present in the OP and many of the Phantoms flicker like a dodgy computer screen when they take damage. Hard as I try, I fail to see the connection between the pixels and the Phantoms. It would have made sense if the show took place in cyberspace and they were fighting the virtualized manifestations of computer viruses or something, but the pixel motif really doesn’t work here at all. It comes across as a superfluous detail with little thought put into it, which makes the aesthetic of the show feel somewhat haphazard.If I haven’t made it clear already, this show has quite a lot of fan-service. I won’t harp on about this too much like some fanatical Evangelist, as there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the existence of fan-service, but it is very, very, very, disappointing to see a studio such as KyoAni using much a method to make us like the characters more. KyoAni has proven time and time again that they are capable of creating very engaging female characters without the need for jiggling breasts or panty-shots. I have seen some people try to justify the fan-service as “we are seeing the world from Haruhiko’s eyes, so wherever he looks is where the camera looks!”, which is seriously one of the stupidest excuses I have ever heard. KyoAni was lazy this time around and opted for the cheapest method of keeping the viewers engaged. KyoAni’s usual flair for bringing their characters to life with little details is honestly drowned out by the booty screaming in your face. I want some character in my moeblobs, goddamnit.So there you have it. An aimless, poorly-written mess built on clichés and repetitive formulas, providing no incentive to keep watching or even care about the resolution of whatever episode you happen to be watching. You may still enjoy it simply for the visuals and simplistic comedy, but even then, I doubt even the most die-hard KyoAni fans probably won’t have it high on their list. This show is an enormous waste of talent and I sincerely hope that KyoAni never makes anything like this ever again. around us that we simply cannot perceive, but this premise already becomes problematic when we see that the Phantoms are capable of physically damaging and interacting with objects in the real world, which makes you wonder why no one has noticed them already even without the ability to see them. This premise raises more questions than it can answers, and you shouldn’t expect any more elucidation on the backstory as it is suddenly brushed under the rug (cause the backstory really doesn’t matter, right?) and we are hurriedly introduced to our main cast. We have Haruhiko, who is slightly better than your run-of-the-mill LN protagonist but that’s not really saying much. He is much more tolerable than your standard LN protagonist as he spends very little time perving on girls and getting flustered, but instead we get to listen to him constantly drop useless titbits of knowledge throughout the series in a weak attempt to sell him as a ‘smart’ character. What could have been a totally tolerable character is spoiled by this obnoxious little detail which keeps cropping up in every single episode. An example of this is when the characters are searching for Phantom nicknamed “Enigma”. Haruhiko being Haruhiko, he chips in suddenly and explains the etymology of the word ‘enigma’ and also points out that it was also the name of a cipher machine developed in the Second World War. The real question here is, “who gives a fuck?” None of this information is relevant to anything that happens in the episode and and none of the other characters asked him for this information. Expect this to happen literally dozens of times throughout the series. Not only this, but the entire intro of every episode consists of Haruhiko posing as a sensei for 2 or 3 minutes which is also supposed to convince us that he is an intelligent character (and to also blatantly explain the theme of the episode to the brain-dead target audience, but that’s another matter). Here’s a tip for LN writers: if you want to sell a supposedly intelligent character, have them do things that are actually intelligent! Since the plot of most of the episodes usually contains a hint of mystery, the author have could have easily sold him as a smart character by having him deduce the answer to the mystery before everybody else. But instead the author takes the easy way out and we are left with a perfect example of how a “smart” shouldn’t be written.The other characters introduced are merely additions to Haruhiko’s inevitable harem (cause who isn’t turned on by a living trivia machine?) We have Mai Kawakami, whose literal first presence on the screen is a shot of her jiggling tits. Yeah, don’t expect much depth out of this character. We also get Reina Izumi; whose only character traits are that she is soft-spoken and polite, she eats a lot and she likes the main character. Her character gets briefly interesting when it is discovered that she has some family issues going on, but this is only addressed for one episode and there is no real conclusion as to how she sorted all of that out.The biggest wasted potential is the character of Ruru, the comedic relief of the show. Though I do admit that her antics occasionally brought a smile to my face, it’s painfully obvious that she could have been so much more than comedic relief. Ruru is a friendly Phantom, but the problem is that she is too much like the other characters, i.e, she is too human. This character could have been used effectively to provide a non-human entity’s perspective of all the odd-going-ons in this show, which would have highlighted the fundamental differences between a Phantom and a human. But…no. Ruru acts and reacts almost exactly like any another human despite being non-human in the first place, which feels lazy and uninspired. I didn’t hate this character but the waste of potential is palpable. Also, at certain points in the series when the characters are pondering the true nature of Phantoms, I can’t help but wonder why Ruru can’t offer some input on this matter. I mean, she herself is a Phantom, one capable of speech even, so shouldn’t she be able to elucidate on a few of these questions?These generic cast members are all super-power wielders and they hence join a Phantom hunting club. The general plot (if you can call it that) is your standard, episodic monster-of-the-week formula with a sudden overarching plot crammed into the end. The monster-of-the-week episodes are consistently disappointing and poorly handled. The episodes usually begin with some idle comedic banter between the main cast in their clubroom, before they start noticing some odd-going-ons happening here and there; anything from students turning into cats to the main character turning to a child.

Like episodes 10 and 11.The characters, the world, the concept, the art and the animation are all pluses. The story has its ups and downs, and fan-service was used in a way that actually took away from some parts of the show.

Imagine what an all-time Green lantern fan felt after watching the movie, or DC fans after watching Batman v Superman and Suicide squad. That's exactly what I felt. First, I saw the opening and was introduced the characters while I watched on&on. It was okay for about episode 3(Don't remember what the ep was about because it's been about half a year since I've seen it)Then, as I watched it through episode 13, I got bored and very confused.The story flow is confusing, and the background story of the...characters(An episode about the past of Izumi would have been nice) and their so-called 'phantoms' is poor. The story of each episode isn't that bad, but the connection between the episodes is very awkward. These drawbacks can be checked in ep13.

The characters aren't horrible, but they're not that appealing either.overall: remarkable artwork&songs, and not bad characters wasted on a cheap story that lacks background &  flowKyoto animation should have made K-On season 3 with the budget used on this one. characters(An episode about the past of Izumi would have been nice) and their so-called 'phantoms' is poor.

I say this so because whenever KyoAni releases an anime, the entire anime realm and fans know about it, in the same way as car enthusiasts immediately know what these Lambroghinis are: the Miura, Islero, Diablo, Murcielago, Gallardo, Aventador and Huracan. Yes, we know what these cars are—named after famous bulls.Recently however, KyoAni seemed to have become ""Audi"", what\'s with the Amagi Brilliant Park? It falls short on the KyoAni material but it still passes the KyoAni-ness with flying colors, Hibike Euphonium does struggle...and became underrated but it is better, but this time--it\'s worse.I watched 12 out of 13 episodes of this Musaigen no Phantom World. And since the FMP Fumoffu, to InuYasha movies, to Air and Kanon, I\'ve watched and grew with KyoAni. Then comes Haruhi Suzumiya, Clannad, and Lucky Star; and the renowned awesomeness that defined the studio: K-On, Hyouka, Chuunibyou, KNK and Tamako Market even. Then what happened recently?Watching 12 out of 13 episodes... I have never dropped a KyoAni anime---until now.STORY = 2I\'m gonna say it straightaway: Phantom World is REDUNDANT to Kyoukai no Kanata. No, it isn\'t similar as other anime fans would say. The difference with ""redundant"" to ""similar"" is that ""redundancy"" is just unnecessary, it\'s not needed; while similar is like...uh, the BMW is similar to Mercedes-Benz, that kinda. Both cars are alike in ways but both are still needed in this world.So why is KyoAni making this? If KyoAni wanted to stick with youkai stuffs, make a KNK season 2 instead. Or, they can throw the Musaigen script to other anime studios like JC Staff.The pace of the story is un-KyoAni-ish to be honest. All it has is fanservice, fanservice, filler, fanservice + filler, initial story, fanservice again, boring ep, character+plot emphasized, last ep, then the end. Yes, in this pace. I could honestly label this as JC Staff material, for this is what JC Staff is good at. Or Collaboration Works (excuse me on this one).ART = 10This is KyoAni after all.SOUND = 7Seiyuus here are Sumire Uesaka, Maaya Uchida, Misaki Kuno, Hiro Shimono, and yes, Saori Hayami. I love these seiyuus as much as they voiced other great anime characters since. There\'s just one problem: none of them can save Musaigen no Phantom World from the disappointment.CHARACTER = 5Characterization is fair, or a bit mediocre. If you\'ve watched something like Date-A Live or Infinite Stratos, characters feel and are in that characterization-level, in which you can utterly say that they\'re likable enough.Then again, another problem persists, and that is: none of these shows I\'ve sampled are from KyoAni. If I were to grade this using the KyoAni-checklist, Musaigen is just mediocre at best, and this is me sugarcoating things already.ENJOYMENT = 1Fanboys and those who like borderline-ecchi fanservices will thoroughly enjoy this. They can fap to it even.As for me, long ago I had been loving KyoAni with their memorable shows and lovable characters. I have respected KyoAni for what the reputation it built themselves so far. Moeshit or not, KyoAni\'s selling point is that, and that\'s what makes them great. KyoAni is as metaphorically memorable as Lamborghini: it has the quality, the presence, the reputation, the recognition, the awesomeness of the lot.Not with the Musaigen Phantom World though.OVERALL = 4Putting a 4 on this is generous enough.And let me put it this way, in a Lamborghini-ish analogy: imagine Lamborghini with their V10 Huracans/Gallardos, and V12 Aventadors/Murcielagos/Diablos. Now imagine the brand embarking on making sedans, 4-cylinder engine sedans at that. You\'re surely gonna exclaim ""hold on! Why a sedan all of a sudden?!"" And then Lamborghini will tell you simply how good the car is and how luxurious it is and how engineering-gamechanging it is, but won\'t tell you how unreasonable they turned out to be. On its own it may just be a good car---a good sedan. But a Lamborghini sedan? Thinking of the Lamborghini marque in a taxi or company car---no, just no. This might be cool on a Hyundai or Audi venture--yes, but for Lamborghini---NO.Musaigen no Phantom World just gives this effect.Yes, animation is superior,yes, action scenes are really fun to look at,and yes, character design is pretty,but all these are the things you already expect from KyoAni. It all started in FMP Fumoffu, to K-On, to KNK, so we all know what caliber and potency to expect.Looking at its inner drama, the characterization and their struggles, and the plot were just bland and it doesn\'t live up to the KyoAni marque, it fell short from the KyoAni caliber, it just doesn\'t feel like KyoAni, it lacked the KyoAni moe/moeshit elements, and it just doesn\'t have that KyoAni flair and passion.So what\'s left? Just disappointment. This is why Musaigen no Phantom World is historically my first ever KyoAni anime I DROPPED from my list.VERDICT: yes all is said and done and it\'s a good-enough anime, IF AND ONLY IF it was ""NOT"" made by KyoAni. and became underrated but it is better, but this time--it\'s worse.I watched 12 out of 13 episodes of this Musaigen no Phantom World.

The difference with ""redundant"" to ""similar"" is that ""redundancy"" is just unnecessary, it\'s not needed; while similar is like...uh, the BMW is similar to Mercedes-Benz, that kinda. Both cars are alike in ways but both are still needed in this world.So why is KyoAni making this? If KyoAni wanted to stick with youkai stuffs, make a KNK season 2 instead. Or, they can throw the Musaigen script to other anime studios like JC Staff.The pace of the story is un-KyoAni-ish to be honest. All it has is fanservice, fanservice, filler, fanservice + filler, initial story, fanservice again, boring ep, character+plot emphasized, last ep, then the end. Yes, in this pace. I could honestly label this as JC Staff material, for this is what JC Staff is good at. Or Collaboration Works (excuse me on this one).ART = 10This is KyoAni after all.SOUND = 7Seiyuus here are Sumire Uesaka, Maaya Uchida, Misaki Kuno, Hiro Shimono, and yes, Saori Hayami. I love these seiyuus as much as they voiced other great anime characters since. There\'s just one problem: none of them can save Musaigen no Phantom World from the disappointment.CHARACTER = 5Characterization is fair, or a bit mediocre. If you\'ve watched something like Date-A Live or Infinite Stratos, characters feel and are in that characterization-level, in which you can utterly say that they\'re likable enough.Then again, another problem persists, and that is: none of these shows I\'ve sampled are from KyoAni. If I were to grade this using the KyoAni-checklist, Musaigen is just mediocre at best, and this is me sugarcoating things already.ENJOYMENT = 1Fanboys and those who like borderline-ecchi fanservices will thoroughly enjoy this. They can fap to it even.As for me, long ago I had been loving KyoAni with their memorable shows and lovable characters. I have respected KyoAni for what the reputation it built themselves so far. Moeshit or not, KyoAni\'s selling point is that, and that\'s what makes them great. KyoAni is as metaphorically memorable as Lamborghini: it has the quality, the presence, the reputation, the recognition, the awesomeness of the lot.Not with the Musaigen Phantom World though.OVERALL = 4Putting a 4 on this is generous enough.And let me put it this way, in a Lamborghini-ish analogy: imagine Lamborghini with their V10 Huracans/Gallardos, and V12 Aventadors/Murcielagos/Diablos. Now imagine the brand embarking on making sedans, 4-cylinder engine sedans at that. You\'re surely gonna exclaim ""hold on! Why a sedan all of a sudden?!"" And then Lamborghini will tell you simply how good the car is and how luxurious it is and how engineering-gamechanging it is, but won\'t tell you how unreasonable they turned out to be. On its own it may just be a good car---a good sedan. But a Lamborghini sedan? Thinking of the Lamborghini marque in a taxi or company car---no, just no. This might be cool on a Hyundai or Audi venture--yes, but for Lamborghini---NO.Musaigen no Phantom World just gives this effect.Yes, animation is superior,yes, action scenes are really fun to look at,and yes, character design is pretty,but all these are the things you already expect from KyoAni. It all started in FMP Fumoffu, to K-On, to KNK, so we all know what caliber and potency to expect.Looking at its inner drama, the characterization and their struggles, and the plot were just bland and it doesn\'t live up to the KyoAni marque, it fell short from the KyoAni caliber, it just doesn\'t feel like KyoAni, it lacked the KyoAni moe/moeshit elements, and it just doesn\'t have that KyoAni flair and passion.So what\'s left? Just disappointment. This is why Musaigen no Phantom World is historically my first ever KyoAni anime I DROPPED from my list.VERDICT: yes all is said and done and it\'s a good-enough anime, IF AND ONLY IF it was ""NOT"" made by KyoAni.', ""Musaigen No Phantom World is an interesting anime created by the famous or infamous Kyoto Animation studio. Fans of Kyoani will know that their works are graphically consistent and fluid when it comes to animation. It's no different for Phantom World. Mundane tasks such as ripping off a bandaid are animated. The characters all feel very alive in their hands, there's no doubt about that.Also, by god is the action eye-candy! There isn't as much of it here as in Kyoukai No Kanata, but there's quite a lot.If you came to this show from their more recent works like Hibike Euphonium and Hyouka you might...have different expectations of this show.This show is first and foremost trying to be fun.The anime has some pretty light fanservice in it. It's not as bad as Haruhi, or the Full Metal Panic series though. In fact, in terms of fanservice, it feels like an older show they've made. Unlike, Euphonium and Hyouka with direct mass appeal, I wouldn't recommend watching this show with non-anime fans or prudish people. I'd consider the fanservice light, but I don't think people who've only seen Hyouka or Euphonium would.Now that, that's out of the way let's get to the meat of things.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Characters:=====================This might come off as surprising but Phantom World barely has any supporting characters. Almost all of the characters feel like main characters!What makes this interesting is that these characters play off of each other so well, it takes a while to notice. They're great. Each character has their own quirks and no one fades into the background unnoticed. They all stand distinguished on their own, and each brings something important to the other's lives.Finding out why the characters act the way they do is something to look forward to as well. I was never bored of them.The Story:=====================Each episode has a central theme that ties into the whole episode and resonates in real life. You might actually learn something new from the show.The story however does drag it's characters along for the ride at times. If the plot needs to develop a certain way the characters might act outside of expectations. This doesn't happen often, however; and the character's personalities stay consistent throughout.It is a fun show though. The color palette is one of the brightest, most saturated I've seen from them in recent memory. The comedy has gotten to me to. I've definitely laughed at the antics of the characters more than once. The world is interesting. It's mysterious and really makes me beg them to take itself more seriously just so I can understand it better, but I didn't want that to ruin the other aspects of the show I enjoyed.All in All...Musaigen No Phantom World is one of the FIRST shows I watch every week on release. I always want to know what happens next, and I think that's because I care about the characters in the show, find their world interesting, and love it's overall tone. If you want an anime to relax with, I'd recommend it.

Spoilers ahead!)My brother, while he was growing up, had an imaginary friend: Ghost Friend. Not so imaginative.I never had one myself, but my brother always made sure Ghost Friend was around. Playing outside, eating at the dinner table, and sitting around the house. They were inseparable.At some point, though, my brother no longer had Ghost Friend with him. I am not saying he stopped believing because that is not what happened. What happened was that Ghost Friend took a “permanent vacation” elsewhere. Nobody knows where. He just went away to live his own life (which is...weird wording for the supernatural).Musaigen no Phantom World (Phantom World for short) does not have Ghost Friend, but it does have a myriad of ghostly creatures. They come together to create quite the toss-up of an anime.STORYPhantom World may seem to imply that the tales it tells are scary. Phantoms are, after all, usually spooky in nature.Phantom World does have pinches of scariness, but, for the most part, the anime looks to provide a pleasant time.To this end, the narrative is largely comprised of slice-of-life material. One episode follows the group helping out the drama club on its quest for stage stardom. Another episode has the girls trekking through a haunted mansion to find the source of their catlike curse. Another still has them dealing with a UFO that annoys the women of a college dorm.However, the anime is not always a happy experience. Indeed, many parts of the show have a melancholic undertone. Episode eleven has the best example. Mai must babysit Haruhiko. It’s not the Phantom or the peculiar situation or even the letter that make the episode. It’s the elongated scene at night, where Mai comforts Haruhiko through empathy, that demonstrates Phantom World’s capability to create heartfelt moments through saddened scenarios.But what about the Phantoms themselves? For the most part, they are some combination of goofy and dangerous. At times, seemingly little more than one-off plot points. But they harbor a theme that is found not just here in the narrative but also in the art and in the characters: isolation.Many (not all) of the Phantoms manifest from feelings of neglect. The electric poles in the beginning danced for themselves because nobody else did. The bunny mother and bunny father wanted a daughter of their own. The giant, pink monkey in the sauna at school had his wife leave him.A common thread exists between these “nonexistent” manifestations. But what ties them all together is their representation. The anime does not go into deep detail, but it is believed that Phantoms are hallucinations, born from one’s own imagination.That is, they’re man-made creations.Phantoms are thoughts plucked from people’s brains. Thoughts born from darker depths. A lot of power is stored in the idea that these Phantoms, who are seemingly unreal, highlight these very real, very human, feelings.The most impressive aspect, though, is how the cast deals with these Phantoms. Yes, they punch them up or eat them whole from time to time. But to get to that point, they usually do so through non-combative means. Those poles are defeated with dance. The bunnies are beat with persuasion. The monkey is sated with accompaniment.A grander theme on isolation and togetherness exists beneath the chaffTo put it differently, the Phantoms lose to togetherness. Camaraderie. Understanding. Love. From the drama club to the gargantuan cat to even the final boss, what ultimately saves the day is not a kick to the face but a kind gesture towards another.Defeating the Phantoms is more than just getting rid of them or helping them out, though. It also has the implication that isolation is not a permanent state. That it is possible to find comfort, safety, or happiness with others no matter how dire the situation.This dichotomy even hearkens back to the narrative’s structural dichotomy of slice-of-life and melancholy. Those happy times are made when others are around and vice versa.And so Phantom World’s main message forms: togetherness supersedes loneliness.This somewhat intricate parallelism is not readily seen because it is unfortunately hidden behind many a problem in the other areas of the narrative.Trouble begins on that structural level. Since almost none of the different episodes play off each other, it makes each outcome feel inconsequential. Worse still, the anime tries to include an overarching plotline, but it’s so minimal in its impact that it fails to be meaningful to the scenes at large.Attempts at romance and action take damage, too. Romantically, the girls rarely show signs of affection. As for the action, the abilities lack importance since some almost never seem to work (Koito’s scream), are used for niche purposes (Reina’s swallow), or do not even stem from the characters themselves (Haruhiko and Kurumi let their summons do the fighting).Even Phantom World’s ecchi material has problems. Mainly in that it does not feel appropriate to the tale at hand. Reina seductively sucking on a finger or Mai having her butt painted are certainly alluring. But, for an anime that focuses on Phantoms and isolation, having Mai inadvertently grope herself while powering up serves very little purpose.Altogether, the narrative does have a deeper side to it. But in order to reach this depth, a lot of shoddiness has to be waded through first.ANIMATIONPhantom World carries its main theme into its art. But it’s best experienced rather than explained (but it is worth pointing out anyway): isolation. As the characters move about the world they are in, they seem separate from it. Be it at school or in the city, hardly any other students or people cross their paths. It comes off as isolated and unnatural – much like the Phantoms themselves.At a more general level, the anime does well. While the fights do not last long, the animation remains high. Mai jumps, punches, and kicks as the elements surround her. Haruhiko’s summons bark and entangle. And Reina gobbles up their foes with a spaghetti spectacle. Downtime sees the same level of quality with deft eye, hair, and facial movements that make the characters feel alive. Similar attention to detail can be seen with the Phantoms.Art likewise sees elevated attention. Backgrounds are realistic in their portrayal and detailed in their presentation. Lighting paints the field of view. And the myriad colors (easy wordplay intended) used throughout make the anime pop.Mai’s design highlights the strength of the overall artThough the best part of the art comes from the character designs. They have a lot of detail: individual strands of air, crinkled clothing, and so on. Color symbolism also exists: Mai has yellow for happiness, Koito has red for anger, and so on. Standard connections, but they add another layer to the designs nonetheless.Looking at their designs more closely, they continue to stand tall. Mai’s side ponytail, large bust, and purple eyes (with both public and private beauty spots) skyrocket her attractiveness. Reina’s long, black hair and thin frame bolster her cuteness. And Koito’s short red hair, alongside her tie and large headphones, make her into the tomboy of the team.(Truthfully, Kurumi’s frontal hairdo is a bit silly.)Ruru gets a special shout-out. Not for her red-genie clothes or her teal hair that ends in a giant ball. Instead, her shout-out is for constantly changing forms throughout the season. From an old man with hemorrhoids to donning a bear costume, her outfit switches made it apparent just how focused on fun she truly was.CHARACTERSWhile the art is arguably the strongest aspect of Phantom World, the cast does have strength of their own. Strength seen through the parallels and themes on an individual and group basis. But, even more so than with the story, it is difficult to find.Starting individually, Mai receives the most attention from the anime. Using hand-to-hand combat, Mai takes the fights to the Phantoms directly. She channels different parts of her body to infuse her fists with the elements – fire, water, and so on – in order to amplify her damage output.What the audience learns is that her combative attitude existed even when she was a child (much to her astonishment). She later empathizes with Haruhiko when she hears that he (similar to her) did not have a mother in his life, becoming just that for him.Moving on, Reina, a kind girl, has the ability to eat Phantoms. By doing so, she defeats the apparitions, making her a valuable asset to the team.For her, at-home troubles make life difficult as a set of strict parents hound her. More so than ever since her older sister (their eldest daughter) left the household. Her wanting a loving home nets her in a precarious situation where she must choose between the ideal and the real. Luckily, she chooses the latter when she realizes (thanks to Haruhiko) that she means a lot to those that love her. Namely, her parents, her sister, and her closest friends.Next comes Koito. She is lauded as one of the more powerful ability users. She controls her voice to emit tuned waves that damage and seal harmful Phantoms.However, her strength was also her weakness. The people around her – from her fellow students to her teachers to even her parents – were afraid of the power she held. To the point that she “shut herself off” as Phantom World puts it. In other words, she’s lonely. Her loneliness explained her do-it-herself mentality as well as her tendency to act icy towards others.Kurumi, on the other hand, is an elementary school student whose cuteness defines her. That, and her toy-bear-turned-behemoth named Albrecht who fights for her when she calls upon him.Her episode showcases this strangeness to an elevated degree when she and Haruhiko are brought into a fantastical land within her own mind. The reason for her attachment to Albrecht and for her apparent escapism stems from a lack of self-esteem. Because she’s a kid, because she feels as though she’s useless, she does not have confidence in herself. Hence, she saves them from the dreamscape through recompense for Albrecht, giving her the wherewithal to believe in her own capabilities.Ruru also gets an episode all to herself. The energetic Phantom that follows Haruhiko around finds herself wishing to be human – a wish she gets granted. But as she discovers, she’s a wanted member of the group exactly as she is. Small or otherwise.As for Haruhiko, he is a bookworm. Besides having knowledge of many different topics, he draws, using his pictures to both create and seal Phantoms. Later on, his abilities get the group into massive trouble with Enigma, the rogue and experimented-on enemy.Much of his character revolves around the separation of his parents. More specifically, the lack of a mother in his life. He connects with Mai when she acts as his mother. He persuades Reina away from joining the Phantoms when he empathizes with her situation. And the arrival of his “mother” makes him happier than he’s ever been.The characters are weak individually but support one anotherLooking at the cast in this individual fashion, they come off as rather weak. Phantom World did what it could – setting aside one episode per character – but it doesn’t feel like enough. Hardly anything comes of the developments the characters receive, and most of the time the developments are hardly investigated any further following their specific episode.At the minimum, each cast member’s ability has both contrasting and parallel qualities to them.Mai fights with fists, matching her in-your-face personality yet not matching her loving tenderness.Reina devours Phantoms similar to how she consumes food and dissimilar to her respectful nature.Koito sings forth power as she listens to her music and as she remains not very vocal.Kurumi’s giant bear guardian accentuates her tininess and highlights her massive courage.Ruru being a Phantom goes along with her eccentric self and goes against her inclusion among her human friends.And Haruhiko draws, drawing on his vast knowledge of facts to create creatures of fiction.On a group basis, Haruhiko and crew find more strength than they do individually. Initially, the major theme threading them together appears to be that of family. After all, parents play a part in nearly every character’s backstory.Family, however, is not quite the focus. It’s more broad than that. Instead, it’s about supporting or helping each other when others (e.g., family) won’t. Mai, Reina, Koito, Kurumi, Ruru, and Haruhiko are a tight team not just because they complement one another well but also because they support one another when people in their lives won’t. Mai and Haruhiko go without mothers, Reina goes without a sister, Koito goes without anybody, Kurumi mostly has her stuffed animal, and Ruru only has Haruhiko.In other words, they are a family for each other, connecting back to that theme on togetherness.Sadly, they do not reach that level. For while they do support one another, they rarely interact with one another. Reina throws Haruhiko sometimes. Mai and Koito butt heads every so often. But, for the most part, they do not do much with, for, or between themselves. It makes their group dynamic feel weak. As though they are not so much a group of friends, let alone a family, but merely a club that just-so-happened to come together due to peculiar circumstances.It also would have been nice if their teacher would have had a slightly bigger role to play. But that is a small gripe compared to the larger inadequacies of the characters.SOUNDThe opening track is quite peppy, using a fast beat, techno sound-effects, and both regular singing and rapping. The beginning and ending, when the instruments do more work than in the middle, are the stronger portions. It’s technically a happy song, and it fits the show well, but it’s not one worth listening to outside of the anime.The ending track takes the happy route as well, but it cranks it up even more so. While the rock band supports the song nicely with drums and guitar, the vocalist comes out on top. Her control and different pacing throughout the piece make the song better than it should be. The multiple-singers near the end helps, too. Again, like the OP, the song is fitting but not necessarily a worthwhile one.Ms. Tadokoro as Ruru gives the “fake” character lots of life and energyWhile the rest of the original soundtrack does not have many stand-out pieces, many are well-composed, forming tunes inspired by fast battles, circus romps, and cultural originations. “Fan Tom World He Youkoso” (besides having a funny translation) makes the mood mysterious. “Sowasowa…” sounds both serious and not. And “Soredemo Ashitahe” is bittersweet throughout. A nice OST, ending up stronger than its OP and ED counterparts.Phantom World’s voice acting performances are of a similar quality. The entire main cast did well, but a couple of them more so than the rest. Most notable are Misaki Kuno as Kurumi (who produced an undeniably cute voice) and Azusa Tadokoro as Ruru (whose energy and teasing could be heard at all times).ENJOYMENTThis one is a little all over the place for me in terms of entertainment.On the low end, I don’t much care for many of the cast members. Reina is innocent and I like her Haruhiko-tossing gag, but she lacks impact and intrigue. Koito is cool, but half the time she barely contributed to the festivities. Kurumi is cute, but Albrecht overshadows her (figuratively and literally).Haruhiko is a small step up if only because he gave many factoids that I have never heard before. I wish he was a bit more competent, and I was not moved by his reunion with his mother. But he still had more presence than the others.At the high end, Mai and Ruru are very fun. Mai’s attractiveness and ecchi moments are a plus, but I like seeing her as the kindhearted, mature person that she can be. Ruru is big ball of excitement and hilarity that (almost) always made the situations as lighthearted and comedic as possible.Not a whole lot of funny characters or scenes are had, but they are thereThinking back to the episodes’ events themselves, again, a lot of hit-or-miss is had. Reina’s episode with the bunnies and Koito’s with the Phantom from her past (but not really) missed. Mai’s episode with little Haruhiko hit. The rest fall somewhere in-between.To be fair, the comedy and cuteness were at least more consistent. Some scenes, like Mai bouncing her breasts beneath a limbo pole or the group defeating a Phantom because it couldn’t turn around, were funny due to their silliness. And the different reaction faces were cute in their depictions. But both aspects were not enough to make the entire experience a grand one.Musaigen no Phantom World encounters a mishmash in terms of execution. Art and animation find strength as does the show’s deeper theme on isolation. But the problems with the narrative, the lackluster cast, and the unengaging content hamper much of what it tries to do. This one will not be bringing Ghost Friend back from his vacation any time soon.SUMMARYStory: Fine, a theme on togetherness and loneliness is hidden behind weak narrative elementsAnimation: Great, nice animation, art, and character designs alongside thematic isolationCharacters: Bad, despite keeping with the theme of togetherness, the characters on both an individual and a group basis are just too weakSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, nice OST, and nice VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, a mixture of fun and boring characters with a mixture of fun and boring eventsFinal Score: 5/10 weird wording for the supernatural).Musaigen no Phantom World (Phantom World for short) does not have Ghost Friend, but it does have a myriad of ghostly creatures.

Luckily, she chooses the latter when she realizes (thanks to Haruhiko) that she means a lot to those that love her. Namely, her parents, her sister, and her closest friends.Next comes Koito. She is lauded as one of the more powerful ability users. She controls her voice to emit tuned waves that damage and seal harmful Phantoms.However, her strength was also her weakness. The people around her – from her fellow students to her teachers to even her parents – were afraid of the power she held. To the point that she “shut herself off” as Phantom World puts it. In other words, she’s lonely. Her loneliness explained her do-it-herself mentality as well as her tendency to act icy towards others.Kurumi, on the other hand, is an elementary school student whose cuteness defines her. That, and her toy-bear-turned-behemoth named Albrecht who fights for her when she calls upon him.Her episode showcases this strangeness to an elevated degree when she and Haruhiko are brought into a fantastical land within her own mind. The reason for her attachment to Albrecht and for her apparent escapism stems from a lack of self-esteem. Because she’s a kid, because she feels as though she’s useless, she does not have confidence in herself. Hence, she saves them from the dreamscape through recompense for Albrecht, giving her the wherewithal to believe in her own capabilities.Ruru also gets an episode all to herself. The energetic Phantom that follows Haruhiko around finds herself wishing to be human – a wish she gets granted. But as she discovers, she’s a wanted member of the group exactly as she is. Small or otherwise.As for Haruhiko, he is a bookworm. Besides having knowledge of many different topics, he draws, using his pictures to both create and seal Phantoms. Later on, his abilities get the group into massive trouble with Enigma, the rogue and experimented-on enemy.Much of his character revolves around the separation of his parents. More specifically, the lack of a mother in his life. He connects with Mai when she acts as his mother. He persuades Reina away from joining the Phantoms when he empathizes with her situation. And the arrival of his “mother” makes him happier than he’s ever been.The characters are weak individually but support one anotherLooking at the cast in this individual fashion, they come off as rather weak. Phantom World did what it could – setting aside one episode per character – but it doesn’t feel like enough. Hardly anything comes of the developments the characters receive, and most of the time the developments are hardly investigated any further following their specific episode.At the minimum, each cast member’s ability has both contrasting and parallel qualities to them.Mai fights with fists, matching her in-your-face personality yet not matching her loving tenderness.Reina devours Phantoms similar to how she consumes food and dissimilar to her respectful nature.Koito sings forth power as she listens to her music and as she remains not very vocal.Kurumi’s giant bear guardian accentuates her tininess and highlights her massive courage.Ruru being a Phantom goes along with her eccentric self and goes against her inclusion among her human friends.And Haruhiko draws, drawing on his vast knowledge of facts to create creatures of fiction.On a group basis, Haruhiko and crew find more strength than they do individually. Initially, the major theme threading them together appears to be that of family. After all, parents play a part in nearly every character’s backstory.Family, however, is not quite the focus. It’s more broad than that. Instead, it’s about supporting or helping each other when others (e.g., family) won’t. Mai, Reina, Koito, Kurumi, Ruru, and Haruhiko are a tight team not just because they complement one another well but also because they support one another when people in their lives won’t. Mai and Haruhiko go without mothers, Reina goes without a sister, Koito goes without anybody, Kurumi mostly has her stuffed animal, and Ruru only has Haruhiko.In other words, they are a family for each other, connecting back to that theme on togetherness.Sadly, they do not reach that level. For while they do support one another, they rarely interact with one another. Reina throws Haruhiko sometimes. Mai and Koito butt heads every so often. But, for the most part, they do not do much with, for, or between themselves. It makes their group dynamic feel weak. As though they are not so much a group of friends, let alone a family, but merely a club that just-so-happened to come together due to peculiar circumstances.It also would have been nice if their teacher would have had a slightly bigger role to play. But that is a small gripe compared to the larger inadequacies of the characters.SOUNDThe opening track is quite peppy, using a fast beat, techno sound-effects, and both regular singing and rapping. The beginning and ending, when the instruments do more work than in the middle, are the stronger portions. It’s technically a happy song, and it fits the show well, but it’s not one worth listening to outside of the anime.The ending track takes the happy route as well, but it cranks it up even more so. While the rock band supports the song nicely with drums and guitar, the vocalist comes out on top. Her control and different pacing throughout the piece make the song better than it should be. The multiple-singers near the end helps, too. Again, like the OP, the song is fitting but not necessarily a worthwhile one.Ms. Tadokoro as Ruru gives the “fake” character lots of life and energyWhile the rest of the original soundtrack does not have many stand-out pieces, many are well-composed, forming tunes inspired by fast battles, circus romps, and cultural originations. “Fan Tom World He Youkoso” (besides having a funny translation) makes the mood mysterious. “Sowasowa…” sounds both serious and not. And “Soredemo Ashitahe” is bittersweet throughout. A nice OST, ending up stronger than its OP and ED counterparts.Phantom World’s voice acting performances are of a similar quality. The entire main cast did well, but a couple of them more so than the rest. Most notable are Misaki Kuno as Kurumi (who produced an undeniably cute voice) and Azusa Tadokoro as Ruru (whose energy and teasing could be heard at all times).ENJOYMENTThis one is a little all over the place for me in terms of entertainment.On the low end, I don’t much care for many of the cast members. Reina is innocent and I like her Haruhiko-tossing gag, but she lacks impact and intrigue. Koito is cool, but half the time she barely contributed to the festivities. Kurumi is cute, but Albrecht overshadows her (figuratively and literally).Haruhiko is a small step up if only because he gave many factoids that I have never heard before. I wish he was a bit more competent, and I was not moved by his reunion with his mother. But he still had more presence than the others.At the high end, Mai and Ruru are very fun. Mai’s attractiveness and ecchi moments are a plus, but I like seeing her as the kindhearted, mature person that she can be. Ruru is big ball of excitement and hilarity that (almost) always made the situations as lighthearted and comedic as possible.Not a whole lot of funny characters or scenes are had, but they are thereThinking back to the episodes’ events themselves, again, a lot of hit-or-miss is had. Reina’s episode with the bunnies and Koito’s with the Phantom from her past (but not really) missed. Mai’s episode with little Haruhiko hit. The rest fall somewhere in-between.To be fair, the comedy and cuteness were at least more consistent. Some scenes, like Mai bouncing her breasts beneath a limbo pole or the group defeating a Phantom because it couldn’t turn around, were funny due to their silliness. And the different reaction faces were cute in their depictions. But both aspects were not enough to make the entire experience a grand one.Musaigen no Phantom World encounters a mishmash in terms of execution. Art and animation find strength as does the show’s deeper theme on isolation. But the problems with the narrative, the lackluster cast, and the unengaging content hamper much of what it tries to do. This one will not be bringing Ghost Friend back from his vacation any time soon.SUMMARYStory: Fine, a theme on togetherness and loneliness is hidden behind weak narrative elementsAnimation: Great, nice animation, art, and character designs alongside thematic isolationCharacters: Bad, despite keeping with the theme of togetherness, the characters on both an individual and a group basis are just too weakSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, nice OST, and nice VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, a mixture of fun and boring characters with a mixture of fun and boring eventsFinal Score: 5/10', 'Kyoto Animation or KyoAni has been defined in the last decade for basically only producing moe-related shows.  Haruhi, Hibike Euphonium, K-on, Beyond the Boundary, Hyouka Lucky Star, all of these shows have aspects to them that define what it is to be moe, including a cute girl artstyle, and most importantly, cute girls that make up most of the cast.  And so, for Winter 2016, KyoAni produced a fantasy anime by the name of Musaigen no Phantom World, or Phantom World for short (at least for me) filled with girls, nice art, and phantoms.Story:  After a viral outbreak several years back, many...members of the world\'s population has had their brain chemistry changed in such a way where they can identify and interact with members of the spectral plane, better known as phantoms.  It is here where we follow the story of Haruhiko and his group of Phantom hunters spend their daily lives around these new spectral creatures with special powers that they can use to interact with phantoms to aid their community from noisy phantom threats.  IN HIGH SCHOOL!  (Because nothing is complete without the high school setting.)Phantom World is more or less focused on each member of the main characters.  Haruhiko and his fellow friends (which are all girls, might I add) are the main focus of this series, as practically every episode has some form of character focus where we look into one person\'s character since Phantoms ""are influenced by people"".  Either that, or we\'re dealing with some random Phantom case, where we devote the whole show to solving a Phantom problem, which more than likely, we focus on both of them in the same episode.  As a story, Phantom World isn\'t really interesting.  It\'s a standard setup of an episodic plot featuring character development that really isn\'t all that deep considering each case more or less takes up a whole episode, and the episode after that talk and/or shows other things.Another thing that the show really drives in on are the Phantoms.  The show has a very hard time on explaining the major focus on the series, mostly due to the fact that the Phantoms are those ""We don\'t know as of yet what they are"" sort of deals.  As such, the explanation isn\'t really all too crazy and is largely incomplete due to that, especially since every Phantom it seems works differently than the last, making it so that many of the facts that you learn aren\'t easily relatable towards another Phantom.  They also have this other part of the anime involving the company that started the viral outbreak, and that by itself is also largely left to rot just like the incomplete explanation for Phantoms.In short, the story of Phantom World really isn\'t all that great.  It has a nice idea and does have some character development to go along with its episodic storyline, but there really isn\'t anything noteworthy about the series since it doesn\'t really go deeper into anything else that\'s going on.  Especially since the series intentionally leaves details out, meaning that there really isn\'t much to say aside from pointing out that that is what we get as a story.  (On the plus side, every episode pretty much gives you a free lecture on psychology and certain psychological experiments, so that\'s pretty neat, I guess.)Overview:+  Interesting base story and concept+  Character development-   Story is largely missing and/or intentionally missing details-   Episodic storyline (Phantom of the Week) sort of thingCharacters:  The characters in Phantom World is split up into roughly two sets.  The main characters, and the plot based side cast.Haruhiko is our main male protagonist and essentially our only male character that\'s even remotely worth talk about.  Haruhiko is a guy who likes to read and possesses a lot of what would be referred to as \'useless knowledge\', as every bit of information that comes out of him usually doesn\'t pertain to the situation and/or the other characters don\'t really care much for it.  Haruhiko is quite a bland character.  There really isn\'t much to say about him because his character is more or less shoved to the end of the series, and focuses more on his backstory to become the character he is more so than really resolving any sort of problems that he has.  All in all, Haruhiko is a character that, like the rest of the show, has and shows potential, but doesn\'t really follow through on it.Then there\'re the rest of the main cast, featuring Mai, the senpai that we see from the start of the series, Reina, the bottomless pit of an Oujo-sama, Kurumi, the token Loli, Koito, that one cold girl who turns out to be relatively cute, and Ruru whose name is so long and confusing that I will give a medal to anyone who can pronounce the whole things.  More or less, these girls are the brunt of the series alongside the general phantom occurrences, as each of them get at least one episode dedicated to their character and the events of their life and/or personal struggles.  They\'re nice, but they\'re not too deep or deep enough to really create much of a rippling effect, so as a result, the character development is rather limited.The rest of the characters are just plot devices.  There\'s some explanation to go along with the majority of them, but for the most part, there\'s just nothing really all that interesting about them.Overview:+  Character development-   Largely uninteresting cast-   Side cast is relatively unimportantArt:  Made by KyoAni, Phantom World boasts a very pretty looking artstyle that just gleams with color and brightness.  Everything has this nice gloss to it and the animation is rather fluid, as expected of KyoAni.  The characters and the general artstyle definitely come off as moe, as the girls are drawn with these relatively big eyes and cute looking exteriors that make it so that they\'re your more traditional moe character, even though they really aren\'t.There isn\'t much fanservice to talk about since, beyond the first episode, we barely get if any fanservice that persists throughout the whole show, which is nice.Overview:+  Great quality art+  Some fanservice, but not too much+/- Moe Artstyle (Some people hate this but hey, if you\'re watching a KyoAni show, this is what you get)Sound:  The OP for Phantom World is a very techno and sort of disco-like OP that is quite honestly, addicting to listen to.  It has this energetic and unique beat that sets it apart from your normal cutesy anime opening.  The whole song is done electronically and was actually quite a nice surprise.The ED on the other hand is...basically a cutesy anime song.  It has the girls bounce along to its happy go lucky beat and it\'s just...not really worth mentioning.Overview:+  Unique and memorable opening-   Ending song is...averagePersonal Enjoyment:  Phantom World was a series that I was quite honestly scared about.  Its setup reminded me of other fantasy related anime and that really stuck a thorn at my side cause I didn\'t want to go through another ""World Break"" incident.  (Freaking ""I remember"" bullshit pisses me off so much I broke a pen.)  But, you know, while I don\'t hold any innate malice for this show...I\'m a bit disappointed.  From what I\'ve heard, Phantom World\'s story apparently gets much darker and much more serious to the point that I WANT a second season.  Cause this shit...this shit ends too happy.Did I like this anime?I don\'t particularly like this anime per say, more so as I just sort of watched it for the sake of watching it.  Personally, I found Reina to be an absolutely adorable character, but that\'s just me.  Apart from that, nothing really stuck out as a quality that I personally loved.What didn\'t I like about this anime?Again, nothing in particular comes to mind.  Sure I could rant about how they didn\'t tell the whole story of everything, but that\'s mostly due to the way the LNs are written.Would I recommend this anime?Personally, unless this show is confirmed for a second season, I wouldn\'t recommend watching this.  It\'s a bit weird to be saying that but, given what I know about the story or Phantom World, watching this would more or less be pointless fluff if it didn\'t get any sort of sequel to it.  But of course, if you want to see something pretty that\'s KyoAni without much meaning to it, then go right on ahead. members of the world\'s population has had their brain chemistry changed in such a way where they can identify and interact with members of the spectral plane, better known as phantoms.

The reason the show was able to score higher in the end, for me, is because the last few episodes seem to have finally developed an interesting plot.

There were still moments I liked, but I definitely preferred the ending episodes.Thus my overall feeling for this anime was that it was decent.

You could be watching better shows but it isn\'t offensively bad.Story is like not even there, just ""Monster of The Week"" type of deal. Then  the last 2 episodes it realizes it needs to do something so it crams something in with the climax only being alluded to early on by a literal plot device.But ""Monster of The Week"" isn\'t a bad formula as long as the characters are enjoyable to watch.

The chemistry between Myriad\'s characters is just lacking.Overall, this anime is just wasted potential, wasted money. But it is not offensively bad.

They\'re just ""Eh"". Except for 1 character, Ruru who is god damn ANNOYING - She is like an alternative to acid for my eyes and ears. I didn\'t really care for any of them and they want us to care for them but it\'s all just poorly executed and developed. Whatever hi jinx they got up to was just watchable.Art is what kept me going on to finish the anime. It\'s eye candy, nice to see.Music is just... I\'m struggling to even remember a song from this series and I just finished this series 6 hours ago as of what I\'m writing right now.I figured out what makes this anime really come off as weak and that is with its characters.

Wurf.The first couple episodes of this anime were honestly pretty great. They were entertaining introductions to all the characters and I was pretty invested in what would come for the rest of the season. Unfortunately, what I was given, were disappointing episodic events where the main character just gets a one-on-one adventure with each of the girls. It was incredibly disappointing sitting through half the anime where nothing important happened. Past the introductions to the characters, you're really better off just skipping to episode twelve and watching the last two episodes, because that's where all the interesting stuff happens.The...characters were pretty good. I liked the main character, which is often hard for me to say when it comes to harems, but he wasn't bad. Mai was okay, Koito had her moments, Usagiloli was adorable, and Reina was super cute. But beyond the outward appearance of the character, there wasn't really anything deeper to any of them. You saw them once, knew what they were about, and that's all you get for the entirety of the series.Honestly, the best thing about the show was the art. It really does look pretty great, but you can easily expect that from KyoAni. It was smooth, colorful, and just overall appealing.Would not recommend. Nice to look at and it has cat balls, but that's actually it. characters were pretty good. I liked the main character, which is often hard for me to say when it comes to harems, but he wasn't bad.

It really felt like it was some sort of elaborate trick.The story starts off somewhat interesting. We find ourselves in a modern Japan inhabited by fantasy like creatures called phantoms. A virus escaped a research facility and caused a shift in human brain function which allowed everyone to be aware of these phantoms. Some of these people develop special abilities and some of those people use their abilities to fight the bad phantoms. This show follows a group of high schoolers in...a club designed around fighting phantoms.The first episode is a great hook into the show. They showcase a few special abilities, some fun and interesting characters and even some comedy and fan service. However the following episodes are lackluster and downright boring. It was almost a chore getting through the majority of the episodes. It wasn't until the last three episodes that anything actually interesting happens. The last three episodes were refreshing, however it wasn't enough to wash away the rest of the show's poor taste. Even with their increased performance, the last three episodes had many parts that should have been explained, and without explanation just cause frustration.The art was very pretty and the animation nicely done. The music and voice acting both very nice as well.The characters were somewhat typical. Our male mc Ichijou, Haruhiko is relatively lame power wise. He has seemingly strong powers but they seem to fail in someway's until the end. He is of course at the center of a crowd of cute girls, and isn't unlikable as he plays the punching bag straight man. Then we have Kawakami, Mai who is the brawling tsundere-ish character. She has a really good moment later in the show and really made me like her a lot more than the other characters. She is the center of most of the fan service, as her powers to control elements require her to touch her body and cause her boobs to jiggle around. Then we have Izumi, Reina who is our sheltered rich girl character who has some family issues. Her power is to eat phantoms. She seems to get shelved after her little character arc and doesn't stick out much.Then we have our few more prominent side characters. Minase, Koito who is anti social, and is frustrating to deal with until her arc is finished. She has the power to tune her voice and bind phantoms and burn them. Then Kumamakura, Kurumi who is an elementary school girl who joins the team after she helps them on one of their jobs. She has the power to use her teddy bear and send it out to fight enemies. Finally we have Ruru, who plays the silly over the top stupid character. She is a phantom that follows around Ichijou.Overall I didn't enjoy this anime. I was bored for several hours at a time watching this. I waited for it to get better or to at least try to hook me in again with something like the first episode but it never happened. When it finally did happen it felt rushed, and left us with some really prominent questions. The characters even though detailed and all with their own backstory felt lame. Ichijou and Mai being the two most fleshed out and interesting IMO. The show felt like is lacked imagination. This is really weird to me because the concept, although maybe not unique is very interesting and not seen often. It feels like the writers of the first episode got sick and only got better towards the end of the show.TLDR: Don't be fooled by the first episode. Boring and shallow for most of the show. ending was interesting but felt rushed. Art was great but that's about all that's praiseworthy.

On one hand they have produced some genuinely outstanding works, even in more recent years. I mean, Nichijou is arguably my favourite anime and even their less impressive works such as Amagi Brilliant Park were still far from bad. So, keeping this in mind, what did I think of Phantom World?At the best of times Phantom World can\'t really be described as anything more than just \'good\'. It\'s not incredible, it\'s not clever and it doesn\'t particularly offer anything unique. The story certainly doesn\'t...stand out, in fact I\'d call it the show\'s biggest weakness. At one moment Phantom World wants to be a character driven show, the next it goes for a kind of \'Monster of the week\' format and then toward the end it tries to be some kind of plot driven thriller. The structure is a complete mess. Had this been a genuinely plot heavy show I\'d be lumping a 3/4 score on it because the narrative is hopeless. It doesn\'t know what it wants to be nor does it do anything that it tries particularly well. At least, not from a narrative point of view. It\'s not that the story itself is necessarily bad but rather how it\'s presented is a mess. They pick up some kind of remote thing and then it isn\'t mentioned again till near the end. I honestly forgot it existed and it turned out to be a genuine plot point. I guess the best way to describe this show\'s narrative is \'Sword Art Online-esc\'. There was potential but it certainly didn\'t fulfil it.Of course those looking at this review may be wondering ""If the plots so bad why did you give it a 7 still?"". The answer is very simple, this isn\'t a plot driven show. Looking over the last 3 episodes (which are actually decent attempts at narrative structure, albeit too late), the majority of the show takes on a heavy focus on comedy and characters. We get a surprising amount of back story with over half the series\' episodes looking at events relating to the characters themselves. This is good and bad. On one hand it does offer some interesting concepts (the Kurumi episode had some very nice ideas in for example) but it does struggle due to one simple problem. The characters just aren\'t that good.The protagonist is effectively just a source for the original LN writer to project random trivia onto, Mai bored me most of the time, Reina is literally just a less cute Kirby and Kurumi, whilst very cute, fails to actually serve a real purpose. The characters that stood out for me were Koito, but she got so little screen time it hardly mattered that I liked her, and Albrecht, who\'s a teddy bear. Seriously though, Albrect is the man, the hero everyone should aspire to be.Not looking too good now is it? Well there are genuine positives to be taken from this show. First of all it looks gorgeous. Of course this is to be expected from any Kyoto Animation production but even so this one stands out for me in terms of their recent productions. Of course the animation is stellar too so nothing to complain about from an artistic point of view. The only reason I\'ve given it a 8 rather than a 9/10 for art is because I\'d have liked to have seen a bit more colour used personally. If I really had to stretch my criticism I’d argue that this show isn’t as aesthetically unique as some of Kyoto’s other productions. With something like Lucky Star or Haruhi Suzumiya I can instantly recognise it as that specific art style. Phantom World on the other hand kind of just looks like any old modern anime. It lacks that certain flair.Hope you like your urban music and variants of electronic pop. Fortunately I do and so I could get on with the soundtrack with relative ease. There’s nothing I’ll be downloading for personal use but as I watched the show I got into some of the music enough to justify its placement. The opening seems to be hit or miss with the community but I myself enjoyed it greatly. Not quite up there with K-ON! or Nichijou but certainly outdoing the likes of Free and Clannad on this front. It\'s quirky, shows off the characters and gives you an idea of the sort of show it is. Can\'t ask much more from it really.I feel I\'ve come across as somewhat negative in this review but in truth that\'s me being my usual harsh self. Phantom Word is a simple yet fun show if consumed in such a way where you expect very little. I feel a lot of people went into this show expecting another After Story or another Chunni. It isn\'t of that standard at all but I\'d say it\'s certainly a competent comedy. I wouldn\'t place this at the top of my \'Plan to Watch\' list but I also wouldn\'t just dismiss it. If you\'re the sort of person that can tolerate a somewhat funny show with nice art and a good soundtrack but not much else, you\'ll probably enjoy Phantom World enough to justify your time. stand out, in fact I\'d call it the show\'s biggest weakness.

Overall, I enjoyed this anime as a whole, and everything I don't complain about I was quite happy with.As for complaints:1) I like the idea of a worldwide event that leads to the existence of the paranormal (kinda like Area D). However, I'm not a fan that they are the global subconscious made corporeal. I probably would have...introduced some plot fixing fairy dust into the mix or just elaborated on what that event was if I had to keep that point.2) Introduction of characters is a little slipshod and unorganized. The development of relationships between even more so.3) The magic system is... hectic, but luckily only focuses on a select group of characters.4) One or two characters are almost entirely two dimensional (in the story-writing sense), but still lovable.Definite compliments:1) I love the animation style and I will likely lose anime fan credibility for it. I'm kind of a sucker for jump cuts (in anime, not cinema), and any shot that makes you question whether or not the story, the narrator, or even your own thoughts on the situation are trustworthy.2) Despite being hectic, the magic system is certainly varied, as are the powers of the antagonist, and the methods of dealing with said antagonists. Original ideas were definitely indulged.3) Character arcs are very different and occur at different times. It gives you the time to get to know each character, how they can assist the other characters, but you don't need that first character maturation to understand.Final comments:Good anime, but not one I can sit down and watch multiple episodes in one setting. That's about the best I can do without spoilers. introduced some plot fixing fairy dust into the mix or just elaborated on what that event was if I had to keep that point.2) Introduction of characters is a little slipshod and unorganized.

It does a lot of things wrong, that’s for sure, but they also do things that make it watchable and actually enjoyable at times. It's very cliché, uninteresting and random to the point of annoying at times. However, its concept and world-building is nice and it is very creative. For most of the time, it goes nowhere and It’s pretty lame, but near the end, it felt like the anime found its track again. However, that doesn’t excuse the fact that more than half of this anime being nothing more than average, and this...series overall is a disappointed.~{Story}~Musaigen no Phantom World takes place in a world where artificial creatures called phantom are found around in the world due to some virus spreading. People who have supernatural powers help in sealing these phantoms for the peace of the world. The story revolves around a group of high school students that work together to seal these phantoms. First of all, the premise is actually pretty interesting. It isn’t anything unique, but it can work. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver. As an episodic anime, not much of its stories are interesting. The first two thirds of this anime felt very pointless and unnecessary. There were too many gimmicks and not enough substance, which is a shame considering its premise. The series adapted the first volume of the light novels. Normally, when an anime rushes its content compared to its original source, it is considered a flaw. However, with Musaigen no Phantom World, it would have benefited so much more if they skipped some of those lame stories they adapted and moved on to the second volume. The reason why I say this is because the second volume is where the real story starts and it starts taking a really twisted and dark tone. It feels like a completely different series and it’s a shame we don’t get to see that. At least the writing in the last third was pretty good.Story: 4/10~{Presentation}~Musaigen no Phantom World excels in world-building. The world they present, one with phantoms lurking around in the world is really cool and pretty well done. The atmosphere did feel nice. However, everything else about the presentation is lacking. The first and major problem is its structure and its use. Musaigen no Phantom World has an episodic structure. There’s nothing wrong with that as there has been may episodic anime that have excelled very well. The problem is that unlike those other episodic anime, where those tiny stories weaved together to make one larger story, Musaigen no Phantom World feels like a mess. Most of these stories aren’t even remotely interesting and in the end, most of them felt pretty pointless, which is a shame since the anime ended right before it was about to get to the good stuff. If Musaigen no Phantom World did its dark twist in this series, the anime could have been compared to the likes of Madoka Magica in terms of tone, and Steins;Gate in terms of content. But with them sticking to just the first volume Musaigen no Phantom World looks nothing more than your average, cliché fantasy school anime with unnecessarily fanservice.Presentation: 3/10~{Character}~A part of me really like these characters, but a part of me also hates them too. The characters in Musaigen no Phantom World couldn’t be more cardboard cutouts than they already. The main character, Haruhiko, is nothing but a generic high school teenager who falls behind in his skills, meanwhile his much superior team members outshine him in every way. It is interesting hearing his remarks in the beginning of each episode, but they are pretty pointless. At least we know he’s smart. Then you have Mai, who’s body gets more focus that her face. She’s basically the cliché outgoing character who’s just there to add to the fanservice. Then you have Reina, who is that cliché, quiet, but nice female who’s just there to be waifu material. Then you have Koito, that cliché kuudere because some people get turned on by coldheartedness. Also, there’s a loli too because we can’t forget a loli! Oh yeah, there’s this phantom girl that looks like a fairy that’s annoying as hell. Even though I’ve been negative about these characters for a while, let me get to the good part. Most of these characters get their own centric episode to develop them as characters. The one that stood out the most was Haruhiko’s as it actually leaves an impact and can relate to real world problems. In that same episode, Mai gets some good development too (though the same can’t be said about her own centric episode). Ruru’s was also pretty good too. Reina’s and Kurumi’s were pretty lacking though, mainly because their episodes were way too over-the-top, unfocused and too gimmicky.Character: 4/10~{Art}~,Musaigen no Phantom World’s art is fantastic, which is to be expected since KyoAni has a good track record with their production values. The art is really pretty and really well detailed. The colors are really vibrant and eye catching. The backgrounds are very well detailed too. The character designs aren’t anything too special as they are stuff you’ve seen before, but it’s still very neat. Everything looks good and there’s no hiccups in the art. Its art style is also pretty nice too. The color palette only uses vibrant colors and they really add an effect. The phantom designs have this cartoonish look and it’s a nice addition. But even with its cartoony feel, it still doesn’t lack detail. Musaigen no Phantom World proves to be stellar technically.Art: 8/10~{Animation}~The animations in Musaigen no Phantom World is top-notch which again was expected because KyoAni always delivers in these categories. The animations are very fluid and very crisp. The character motions are top notch too. During the action scenes, the fluidity is fantastic and the camera view always works. The amount of work put into the animation is very noticeable. Small little details such as the animations of clothes if pressure is given (for example, when Mai is rubbing herself (because god knows why that’s relevant)). However, the most useless things also get too much effort put into. All those breast physics are very distracting and ruin the more realistic feel to the animation, especially since they got a lot of realism going in the animations (such as the clothes physics). Nevertheless, this is where Musaigen no Phantom World shines.Animation: 7/10~{Voice Acting}~The voice acting in Musaigen no Phantom World is decent, but with such a good cast, more could have been done. Shimono Hiro isn’t anything special as Haruhiko, mainly because his script doesn’t ask for much. Unfortunately, he doesn’t add anything more, he just does what he needs to do. Still, his talent makes him look good. Uesaka Sumire is pretty good as Mai as she the does the senpai character properly. Again, nothing too special, but it gets the job done. Hayami Saori’s a fantastic seiyuu and she has a wide range, but she doesn’t do anything too special with Reina, and at times, he voice for Reina ends up feeling irritating as it feels so cliché. I don’t know what to say about Uchida Maaya, because her character, Koito, barely talk. But from what I’ve heard, she did good. Also Kurumi and Ruru’s seiyuu do a fine job too. In the end, the voice acting works, but none of the seiyuu do more than asked.Voice Acting: 5/10~{Music}~The music in Musaigen no Phantom World is pretty good. The OP, “Naked Dive”, is really catchy and fun. Although it’s the first 20 seconds that I really love (it’s too catchy). The rest of the OP is okay, but the vocals aren’t too fascinating. The ED, “Junshin Always”, is alright. It’s not too catchy or memorable, but the vocals are pretty good in that ED. The background music used in Musaigen no Phantom World is great though. There are wide variety in the music. The best ones are those techno beat-ish music they use during the action scenes. They work so well and they make the scenes more fun. The background music is one of the better things about this anime.Music: 5/10~{Enjoyment}~It’s hard to say whether or not I enjoyed Musaigen no Phantom World. Roughly 1/3rd of the anime is actually good in terms of plot (no not “plot”, but actual plot), which is pretty much the last couple of episodes. The rest 2/3rd of the anime is content that is more miss than hit. However, the world-building and the animations make this anime much more enjoyable. But the characters were too cliché to be likeable. Stupid characters doing stupid things isn’t very enjoyable at all. And the fact that this ticks every box in the list of anime clichés makes this even less enjoyable. If the second volume was adapted however, oh boy would things be different!Enjoyment: 3/10In the end, Musaigen no Phantom World isn’t really something worth your time. It tries to make you enjoy it by using its gimmicks and fantastic animations, but when you only have style, but not enough substance, it’s definitely visible. The characters are just a bunch of overused clichés. At least a couple of the characters got proper development. Most of the episodic stories are uninteresting, but it seems like the anime found its way at the end. But unfortunately it spent too much time on volume 1 of the light novel that we couldn’t get to see the much superior volume 2. Overall, Musaigen no Phantom World is only recommended for those KyoAni fans that love their production values, or those who don’t mind a gimmick-filled anime.+ Interesting premise with very good world-building+ Great art with vibrant colors complimented by fantastically fluid animations+ Last third of the anime is much more focused and enjoyable- Most of the anime is unorganized and doesn’t go anywhere- Characters are very cliché-driven and unoriginal and some lack development- Didn’t cover the second volume and the major plot twist, making the series look even more pointlessOverall: 4.8/10 series overall is a disappointed.~{Story}~Musaigen no Phantom World takes place in a world where artificial creatures called phantom are found around in the world due to some virus spreading.

There’s nothing wrong with that as there has been may episodic anime that have excelled very well. The problem is that unlike those other episodic anime, where those tiny stories weaved together to make one larger story, Musaigen no Phantom World feels like a mess. Most of these stories aren’t even remotely interesting and in the end, most of them felt pretty pointless, which is a shame since the anime ended right before it was about to get to the good stuff. If Musaigen no Phantom World did its dark twist in this series, the anime could have been compared to the likes of Madoka Magica in terms of tone, and Steins;Gate in terms of content. But with them sticking to just the first volume Musaigen no Phantom World looks nothing more than your average, cliché fantasy school anime with unnecessarily fanservice.Presentation: 3/10~{Character}~A part of me really like these characters, but a part of me also hates them too. The characters in Musaigen no Phantom World couldn’t be more cardboard cutouts than they already. The main character, Haruhiko, is nothing but a generic high school teenager who falls behind in his skills, meanwhile his much superior team members outshine him in every way. It is interesting hearing his remarks in the beginning of each episode, but they are pretty pointless. At least we know he’s smart. Then you have Mai, who’s body gets more focus that her face. She’s basically the cliché outgoing character who’s just there to add to the fanservice. Then you have Reina, who is that cliché, quiet, but nice female who’s just there to be waifu material. Then you have Koito, that cliché kuudere because some people get turned on by coldheartedness. Also, there’s a loli too because we can’t forget a loli! Oh yeah, there’s this phantom girl that looks like a fairy that’s annoying as hell. Even though I’ve been negative about these characters for a while, let me get to the good part. Most of these characters get their own centric episode to develop them as characters. The one that stood out the most was Haruhiko’s as it actually leaves an impact and can relate to real world problems. In that same episode, Mai gets some good development too (though the same can’t be said about her own centric episode). Ruru’s was also pretty good too. Reina’s and Kurumi’s were pretty lacking though, mainly because their episodes were way too over-the-top, unfocused and too gimmicky.Character: 4/10~{Art}~,Musaigen no Phantom World’s art is fantastic, which is to be expected since KyoAni has a good track record with their production values. The art is really pretty and really well detailed. The colors are really vibrant and eye catching. The backgrounds are very well detailed too. The character designs aren’t anything too special as they are stuff you’ve seen before, but it’s still very neat. Everything looks good and there’s no hiccups in the art. Its art style is also pretty nice too. The color palette only uses vibrant colors and they really add an effect. The phantom designs have this cartoonish look and it’s a nice addition. But even with its cartoony feel, it still doesn’t lack detail. Musaigen no Phantom World proves to be stellar technically.Art: 8/10~{Animation}~The animations in Musaigen no Phantom World is top-notch which again was expected because KyoAni always delivers in these categories. The animations are very fluid and very crisp. The character motions are top notch too. During the action scenes, the fluidity is fantastic and the camera view always works. The amount of work put into the animation is very noticeable. Small little details such as the animations of clothes if pressure is given (for example, when Mai is rubbing herself (because god knows why that’s relevant)). However, the most useless things also get too much effort put into. All those breast physics are very distracting and ruin the more realistic feel to the animation, especially since they got a lot of realism going in the animations (such as the clothes physics). Nevertheless, this is where Musaigen no Phantom World shines.Animation: 7/10~{Voice Acting}~The voice acting in Musaigen no Phantom World is decent, but with such a good cast, more could have been done. Shimono Hiro isn’t anything special as Haruhiko, mainly because his script doesn’t ask for much. Unfortunately, he doesn’t add anything more, he just does what he needs to do. Still, his talent makes him look good. Uesaka Sumire is pretty good as Mai as she the does the senpai character properly. Again, nothing too special, but it gets the job done. Hayami Saori’s a fantastic seiyuu and she has a wide range, but she doesn’t do anything too special with Reina, and at times, he voice for Reina ends up feeling irritating as it feels so cliché. I don’t know what to say about Uchida Maaya, because her character, Koito, barely talk. But from what I’ve heard, she did good. Also Kurumi and Ruru’s seiyuu do a fine job too. In the end, the voice acting works, but none of the seiyuu do more than asked.Voice Acting: 5/10~{Music}~The music in Musaigen no Phantom World is pretty good. The OP, “Naked Dive”, is really catchy and fun. Although it’s the first 20 seconds that I really love (it’s too catchy). The rest of the OP is okay, but the vocals aren’t too fascinating. The ED, “Junshin Always”, is alright. It’s not too catchy or memorable, but the vocals are pretty good in that ED. The background music used in Musaigen no Phantom World is great though. There are wide variety in the music. The best ones are those techno beat-ish music they use during the action scenes. They work so well and they make the scenes more fun. The background music is one of the better things about this anime.Music: 5/10~{Enjoyment}~It’s hard to say whether or not I enjoyed Musaigen no Phantom World. Roughly 1/3rd of the anime is actually good in terms of plot (no not “plot”, but actual plot), which is pretty much the last couple of episodes. The rest 2/3rd of the anime is content that is more miss than hit. However, the world-building and the animations make this anime much more enjoyable. But the characters were too cliché to be likeable. Stupid characters doing stupid things isn’t very enjoyable at all. And the fact that this ticks every box in the list of anime clichés makes this even less enjoyable. If the second volume was adapted however, oh boy would things be different!Enjoyment: 3/10In the end, Musaigen no Phantom World isn’t really something worth your time. It tries to make you enjoy it by using its gimmicks and fantastic animations, but when you only have style, but not enough substance, it’s definitely visible. The characters are just a bunch of overused clichés. At least a couple of the characters got proper development. Most of the episodic stories are uninteresting, but it seems like the anime found its way at the end. But unfortunately it spent too much time on volume 1 of the light novel that we couldn’t get to see the much superior volume 2. Overall, Musaigen no Phantom World is only recommended for those KyoAni fans that love their production values, or those who don’t mind a gimmick-filled anime.+ Interesting premise with very good world-building+ Great art with vibrant colors complimented by fantastically fluid animations+ Last third of the anime is much more focused and enjoyable- Most of the anime is unorganized and doesn’t go anywhere- Characters are very cliché-driven and unoriginal and some lack development- Didn’t cover the second volume and the major plot twist, making the series look even more pointlessOverall: 4.8/10"", 'In 2009 a game called Resident Evil 5 was released by Capcom. RE5 was, for the most part, a great game but was ultimately panned by a large portion of the fan base. The game would go on to receive criticism not due to the fact that it was a poor game but because it wasn\'t as good as its predecessor ""Resident Evil 4"" and could never live up to the hype and momentum of its ""big brother"".Myriad Colors Phantom World is experiencing a similar ""big brother"" effect. Having been produced by Kyoto Animation, the excellent animation studio responsible for very well respected series such...as Clannad, K-On, Kyoukai no Kanata and Free, Phantom World comes out of the gate with an unrealistically high bar to meet.The truth of the matter is that Phantom World is a fine anime series. The characters aren\'t anything you haven\'t seen before but are all lovable and I can confidently say I will remember most of them several months down the road. The plot and story come off as a little dry and recycled from years of ""industry standard meta"" material but the uniqueness of the main characters power helps add a little bit of fresh air into the dank plot.The story chugs along at an even pace that may range from ""watchable"" to ""enjoyable"" with the last two episodes being the clear highlights of the entire 13 episode span with a villain that is as refreshing as she is ""ara ara"".The animation is outstanding, to put it bluntly, meeting the already ""above and beyond"" standards set by Kyoto. The sound track is another, often over-looked gem. The near constant stream of excellent music helps bring the scenes to life and is nothing but a compliment to the animators at Kyoto.All in all Myriad Colors Phantom World may not be remembered as the defining anime released under the Kyoto name but it is certainly a fine accomplishment. And that is okay. It is alright for us to enjoy something, even if it isn\'t ""as good"" as we would have liked. as Clannad, K-On, Kyoukai no Kanata and Free, Phantom World comes out of the gate with an unrealistically high bar to meet.The truth of the matter is that Phantom World is a fine anime series.

Like mad irritated. The light novel has a concept already interesting enough to draw from as source material. But an adaptation does not HAVE to be the source, and that\'s ok. MnPW could have had an interesting premise without taking any dark turns. It could have had strong characters, an interesting plot line, and comedic elements that let\'s the viewers know that a show can be strong without...having to take itself TOO seriously. Fun is allowed every now and then, right? However, MnPW has none of these elements.Warning , this review contains a hint of extremely vague spoilers! (There\'s nothing that could really ruin an experience, but just to be safe.)When it comes to the plot, all I can sum it up in three words: extremely lazy writing. It\'s possible Kyoani doesn\'t know what foreshadowing is, and if that\'s the case, someone ought to tell them to use it more than two times in all 13 episodes. There is little to no continuity until the last 2 episodes and all that MnPW relies on is a little ""communication device"", which Haruhiko picks up ""by chance"". The plot presented in ep 12 and 13 could be called interesting, except for it is lazily tied up in the span of 15-20 minutes. Such an present box ending could be acceptable if the arc didn\'t last all but TWO EPISODES. AT THE END. It\'s obvious Kyoani wasn\'t gunning for the ""twist ending"" from the LN, so they have no excuse to try and conceal all plot points in an effort to bring shock value. Even stories that try and do this usually use foreshadowing, but are good enough at it that by the big reveal, you find yourself almost annoyed at how you couldn\'t see the big twist ending coming.Two, when it comes to characters, all i can say is WASTED POTENTIAL, and I mean WASTED. At the start of this anime, the most developed character was Reina, but towards the end, Reina takes a backseat to Mai, who is the strongest character by far. Of course, Mai takes a backseat to Haruhiko in ep 13, since he suddenly becomes extremely useful to the team and levels up by 500%. Haruhiko said it best. ""Humans can grow"". lmao. The weakest character with potential in this anime is definitely Koito, who the writers could have done so much more with. I actually really liked Mai so all I can say in conclusion is that all I feel is a mix of ""wow what a let down"" and ""what a waste of my time- but what did i expect"".Three, finally, the comedic aspect. The ""comedic"" aspect dominates 11 ep, and then takes a back seat to the ""plot"". Now, don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not some overly edgy individual who can\'t enjoy comedy because it\'s not sophisticated enough for my ""intellectual"" tastes. There are many examples of comedies who do not need to be governed by the rigid lines of continuity. I think if the comedy was strong in this show, it would have made it much more tolerable. However, there was nothing extremely funny about MnPW. Out of the 11 comedy focused episodes, I only found three to be enjoyable: The episode where Reina gets a temporary fake family, the cat episode, and the episode where Mai becomes a stand in mom. I even had trouble trying to recall some of these, that\'s how unmemorable these 2 were, (with the exception of Mom Mai. I would have watched an anime all about her being a parent alone.)When even the comedy is weak, there is really nothing to this show that saves it. Nothing for it to fall back on. What irritates me the most about this, outside of the lazy writing, is that I wanted to like this show. The premise was actually interesting. I actually found myself attached to Mai, who acted out of the ""tsundere childhood friend"" trope. Yet I received nothing in return but lazy writing, boring comedy, weak characters, and a few tastes sprinkled in of what this show could really be. This was weak as hell. having to take itself TOO seriously. Fun is allowed every now and then, right?

This was weak as hell.', 'Remember those crazy scenes in Chuunibyou where we get to see battles through the eyes of characters infected by the popular disease? Well, Kyoani decided to take that to the next level, and Phantom World is the result. Basically, a mysterious virus infects everyone and now everyone can see ""phantoms"", illusions that blur the distinction between reality and imagination- dancing light poles playing limbo, giant teddy bears, and crazy chimeras included. Here we find a team of phantom fighters, including our protagonist, that is tasked with reigning in misbehaving phantoms.When this show was first announced, I was intrigued at the thought-provoking poster. While the show...does provide some light snacks for the intellectually inclined, I wouldn\'t watch the show purely based on that. As a Kyoani piece, it focuses much more on cute characters and funny interactions than any real political intrigue or deep mysteries. While the characters weren\'t as engaging as those in Chuunibyou were, the show still has a good mixture of action and comedy, and has some nice touching scenes as well. While not a complete grand slam, Phantom World is nonetheless a pretty fun show that is easy to watch.Animation:Kyoani typically prefers bright colors and relatively saturated colors; that trend continues here in Phantom World. The work benefits from superb detailing, great effects work, and cute character design. The creativity that went into this world is quite impressive; from the warm comfort of a rabbit family (no not Zootopia) to the threatening presence of Cthulhu the show really goes above and beyond to bring you interesting locations and characters. On top of all that, there are just tiny details that made this show stand out; be it the occasional flickering of Phantoms (as if they are errors), hand-drawn appearance of rabbit world, or the look on the Yakiniku store owner\'s face as Reina orders even more all you can eat meat. The character designs are well done as well; all of the main heroines are distinct in appearance and behavior. Expressions are definitely above average and occasionally used for comical purposes, such as when kuudere Minase is forced to attract a phantom or when Mai is about to be licked by a giant monkey. Oh, and you can\'t forget about the super-cute dog Phantom; I\'m sure Kyoani has a plushy of him by now.There is a fair amount of action in the show as the group battles various phantoms. The fights are pretty varied as well, as their approach changes based on the particular phantom. Mai is a melee specialist so luckily this show is not just magic spamming. Things don\'t get too serious though so don\'t expect any significant blood or gore. Surprisingly enough, there is a fair amount of ecchi in this show. Whether this is a sign that Kyoani has admitted that moe alone isn\'t enough to please the market is beyond the subject of this review. You can expect a fair amount of bouncy from Mai, as well as um... self massages in order to activate her powers. Besides that, there are a few accidental infringement cases, used for Reina to enact violent retribution.Sound:The show starts with an electronic-infused, fast-paced OP. I\'m not a huge fan of the singer or the melody but it does fit the slightly chaotic nature of the show. The ED is a light rock piece sung by the VA for Ruru, nothing too special but it\'s not a bad melody. The BGM is above average though particularly excellent in specific episodes; for example, it greatly reinforces the mood and atmosphere in episode four. Overall, it has a more playful feel than your average BGM.The VA cast is relatively experienced with veterans Saori Hayami, Sumire Uesaka, and Maaya Uchida voicing major roles. Misaki Kuno also does a great job giving Kurumi a very light, soft voice. Azusa Tadokoro gives Ruru a particularly energetic albeit annoying voice. Overall, it\'s a very well rounded cast and befitting of a Kyoani work.Story:So in this world where phantoms coexist along humans, there are occasionally misbehaving Phantoms that need to be ""sealed"". Heard of that one before? It\'s sort of like cute versions of the antagonists in Noragami or Shana being taken care of by a group of high school students with abilities like those in Charlotte.Phantom World comes across as mostly episodic, with each episode containing one or two antagonists that the growing cast works together to defeat. Despite not having a strong central plot pulling things along, the execution of the story is well done with character exposition closely intertwined with the actual Phantoms encountered in each episode. Certain arcs are definitely better than others, with the rabbit-household that I keep mentioning being one of the more memorable ones. Some of the arcs are a bit too atypical for me, and some of the arcs attempt to be too scientific for their own good (Schrodinger\'s cat for instance) but all in all it was still enjoyable. There\'s a bit of rising tension in the last few episodes that culminates in a light climax that reminds me a bit too much of Akikan (jeez that\'s eight years ago already).There are still a lot of unanswered questions about the overall setting and how the world got into a state where high school students are necessary to deal with the Phantoms, but nothing annoying enough to detract from the easily digestible nature of the show.Character:Critically speaking, the characters here aren\'t as much of a pull as I\'d come to expect from Kyoani shows (such as Chuunibyou or Amagi Brilliant Park). The characters still have fairly well developed personalities and the Kyoani moe touch (especially Reina and Kurumi) but just aren\'t as relatable as those in the aforementioned other shows. While each character does have a decent exposition and do develop and grow together as a group, there aren\'t any particularly deep strings connecting them together; and for that I felt there was a fair amount of lost potential.Value:Phantom World pulls the viewer in with a good mix of comedy, an interesting setting, and great execution. There are definitely some fun and memorable portions of the show. Although the character relationships weren\'t as deep as I had hoped, the show overall was an enjoyable, light watch.

Potential that only really showed in 4 episodes (three of which were the last ones). It didn't really have an overarching storyline, aside from some development and findings needed for the last 2 episodes. Instead, it was for the most part and episodic show, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It could work. The problem was, there was no way I could take those episodes seriously, with exception of those 4 episodes I mentioned. I...felt like they wanted me, the viewer, to, but failed to do so. If the show was as good as it was in the last 3 episodes, it would've been much much better.Art and animatio: 9/10Of course, since this was a KyoAni production, the expections for it to be at least good looking were definitely high, and those expectations were definitely met. The art and animation was gorgeous even in moments it they didn't need to be.Sound: 6/10I don't really have anything to say about the soundtrack. It didn't realy stand out to me, but it didn't bother me either, so I suppose that was good. Though one thing that did bother me was the opening song. Not because it was necessarily bad, but because of the intro. The speeding up wasn't gradual and that really bothered me for some reason.Characters: 7/10The characters might've been a bit cliched and didn't have all that much development (with exceptions here and there), but I happened to like them and started caring for most of them anyway. Shoot me.Enjoyment: 8/10Despite the mediocre story, I enjoyed this show very much, which, for me, is all I care about really. If I enjoy an anime despite all its flaws, it's a good show in my book. It was a show that I could just sit back and relax to while basking in the glorious art and animation.Overall, I give the show a 7,5/10 (not an 8, but you know, MAL doesn't allow decimals), which I suppose is quite high, but considering enjoyment is what I find most important, that was to be expected. I do feel like people are giving it more shit than it deserves. Maybe people might've had incredibly high expectations of the show because it was made by KyoAni? Which I don't think is really fair. Yeah, KyoAni has so many amazing shows that this anime can't even wish to touch in its current state, but it's not that bad (I think).Would I recommend this anime? It depends on what person I'm talking to and what kind of anime they want. If they want a well thought-out anime with very intricate plot details then... no, I wouldn't. If they want a show they could watch just to relax to, then yes, absolutely. It's an easy watch, especially with the amazing animation. felt like they wanted me, the viewer, to, but failed to do so.

I do feel like people are giving it more shit than it deserves. Maybe people might've had incredibly high expectations of the show because it was made by KyoAni? Which I don't think is really fair. Yeah, KyoAni has so many amazing shows that this anime can't even wish to touch in its current state, but it's not that bad (I think).Would I recommend this anime? It depends on what person I'm talking to and what kind of anime they want. If they want a well thought-out anime with very intricate plot details then... no, I wouldn't. If they want a show they could watch just to relax to, then yes, absolutely. It's an easy watch, especially with the amazing animation."", 'Personally, I did not hate this anime at all when I actually finished it.The story is... well... There is definitely a lot of ""plot"", but not plot. I never expected KyoAni to do an ecchi anime, so it was very surprising. Of course, the art is just wonderful, however I do think it could have been a little better, for I think Kyoukai no Kanata did a better job with art.The OST was also quite good; the opening is very catchy, and fits the anime well. Battle scenes have some epic music that makes scenes more memorable....I rated characters 7/10 mainly due to the MC. Haruhiko is a very interesting character. Every episode, we have Haruhiko giving us a short lecture, giving an idea of what the episode will focus on. I also liked his special abilities, for his abilities fit his personality well. (or maybe his personality fits his abilities well?) Also, his 1st-grade self was very refreshing, as well as Kurumi\'s personality. I personally detest anime where characters act way stupider than their age, especially in elementary school (e.g they can\'t talk properly, they don\'t know how to do anything without an adult supervising them, even though in real life they would be perfectly capable of much more.) Kurumi is brave and responsible, which instantly made her one of my favorite characters. Even though she carries Albercht around, there is an aura of maturity coming from her. And Haruhiko... His 1st grade self is barely different than his high school self as a geeky, walking wikipedia nerd. I am not necessarily a loli fan, but a lot of slice of life anime seldom have young characters who actually act their age. I really respect this aspect of the anime.For me, the first 10 episodes were just slice of life with a touch of fantasy. Then you get to the last three... and wow, it gets  real. It honestly made me cry when the MC had the official reunion with his mother. I think this was an anime where the intro was disappointing but had a very compelling ending. If there was a second season, I would definitely watch it (but based on the spoilers I\'ve seen around the internet, the second season would be dimensions different than the first...)

That\'s a pretty pathetic reason to choose this show over all the other ones airing this season, but nonetheless that is why I chose to watch it.Story:The plot of this show is basically about monsters called phantoms that the main characters defeat. Each main character has an ability to use in combat to defeat them; so basically this is nothing special whatsoever. I suppose you could call this a harem anime, though aside from the occasional subtle nod to romance, this show has nothing to do with it. Only having...13 episodes to start and and end a story means that it should be high quality and not waste time on trivialities, which admittedly the shows feels very episodic and very little overarching plot except for the last 2 or 3 episodes. The show being episodic doesn\'t make it bad in any way, nor does the plot being thin take away from the show\'s enjoyment, but I can see why the opinion for this show would be very mixed. I found myself not being interested in the plot at all, but that didn\'t stop me from looking forward to each episode. I\'ll explain further down below.Art:The colors are all very vibrant and pop even in the most ordinary of scenes and the animation during the combat scenes is very well done. There\'s not really much else to say about the show\'s art than it\'s very colorful and is a big part of why I found the show so enjoyable.Sound:The opening and ending themes are quite catchy, so I never skipped them; unlike many other shows which I happily skip, but that is just personal opinion and not something that can really be objective. All of the voice actors suited their characters and Kurumi\'s voice actor was downright infectious to the point where I would wait with anticipation until she said another line, which may be a first for me. Rating the voice actors along with the sound is a bit of a grey area, so rating it a 6 just symbolizes me having no issues with background music and such.Character:Each character gets one of their own episodes to give you an idea of their story. The opinion of how that was done is likely subjective as either you will enjoy a dedicated episode per character or feel they should have alternated focus throughout the whole series instead. I would\'ve preferred the latter because of the episodic nature of this series, the individual episodes didn\'t really contribute to a grand feel of the show - it was pretty much forgotten by the next episode, so it almost felt pointless. The character design is very well done in my opinion, as each character stands apart from the others and albeit typical in a harem, the audience is bound to feel ""loyal"" to one character above the others, which I thought was enjoyable because this show doesn\'t really have a romance aspect. The show being so short doesn\'t give enough time to really find out much about the characters, but they are still enjoyable.Enjoyment:I have a tough time explaining why I thought this show was enjoyable. The episodic nature is both a pro and a con because it invokes a brand new story each week and also a ""what is the point of this?"" feeling, but the show just has such a charm to me. As dumb as it sounds, it really is just enjoyable because it\'s enjoyable, however any criticism it draws from lack of story and lack of character development is completely valid.Overall:I would completely recommend this show if you want to watch something that\'s fun and at times cute, serious, and nonsensical. If you don\'t like the idea of a continuity-loose show, then you might not want to give it a try. 13 episodes to start and and end a story means that it should be high quality and not waste time on trivialities, which admittedly the shows feels very episodic and very little overarching plot except for the last 2 or 3 episodes.

Each episode is a standalone, with no overarching or subplots.Musaigen no Phantom takes place after a virus alters the human brain allow mankind to see spirits and phantoms. The characters go around sealing phantoms that cause trouble. The anime attempts to justify the current world through science and personally i found it to be a fair blend of both.Story:what storyCharacter:characters are mainly static, as they dont develop a lot. However this doesnt not mean they are bad characters.  Static characters work well with the standalone method. Episodes sometimes...focus on a particular character allowing for developments they need. for example in one episode Kumamakura, Kurumi develops to become braver and casts aside her anxiety.Also im glad MC is not all powerful.Sound:nothing caught my attention. I had no urge to sit through the opening or ending.   and nothing that was really bad.Art:i found the art to be very colorful and eyecatching.Enjoyment:to my surprise i had a really good time with this anime. i enjoyed the science such as Schrödinger's cat, and how we perceive and store memory.Harem:there is none, at first it may look like a harem as he is surrounded by females but none of the females try to make a move on him and the MC isnt really attracted of any of the females. its quite refreshing to see a MC surrounded by girls with no romantic element.Overall:this anime isnt for all people however, im glad that i went and watched this anime without being affected by peoples opinions and reviews.

However with the passing of each episode, it was becoming clear that there was no focus on making a thorough plot with ultimate goals and villains. Rather it's just a slice of life on students with super powers fighting phantoms to get thru school. it's one of those series that baits watchers into watching, but honestly in my opinion it's not worth wasting time.Fighting sequences are really nice along with the art, but that's it. Nothing else. There's no balance.

Yes, it is cliche, and yes, KyoAni has sold their soul to the devil, but we need to stop looking at this show for its cliches and producers, and look at it for what it is, a charming, funny, engaging and an overall very solid anime.Story: 6There isnt much of a story, but the way the show is set up, it doesn't need a story. Each episode is its own arc, making each episode feel very fresh and new. The episodes never get stale, and are...very varied. No two episodes feel the same.

By the way, I have watched this anime twice or thrice now, so I for one can say I do enjoy this anime. It gives me easygoing and cute vibes (which I will admit it's thanks to the animation too). However, I do not believe it is an anime to turn our heads 180° away from.Honestly, I'm unsure why this anime is...so lowly rated but to me this is actually quite pleasant.To summarise what this anime is about, a club called the 'Phantom-hunting club' consists of members who have special abilities and hunts down/seals phantoms who are causing mayhem. Following the daily life of Haruhiko Ichijo and the rest of the gang, we get to explore the works of phantoms and also how their own special abilities can influence their lives.I'd say it's quite a simple anime, not overly complicated at all so I would recommend it as an off-day anime for its placid vibes especially if you don't have anything to watch then please, by all means, give this a go!I'm obviously a little upset with the overall rating for this anime as I truly don't believe it deserves such an underrated rating. The anime is great for passing time and the characters for example, are quite loveable too. I also would like to add that the concept is quite unique which is nice as it gives me a sense of different pacing so what is there to hate?So! Overall, I will recommend it with a kind reminder that although it is not a masterpiece, it still deserves a whole lot more than just hate based on much controversy.Thanks for reading and I hope that this review helped in deciding whether to watch it or not! so lowly rated but to me this is actually quite pleasant.To summarise what this anime is about, a club called the 'Phantom-hunting club' consists of members who have special abilities and hunts down/seals phantoms who are causing mayhem.

The phantoms of the title feel much like yokai, with everything from limbo-dancing telephone poles to hot spring dwelling monkeys, and of course some cute girls. Its monster-of-the-week format works well, with each episode presenting the club with a distinctly different challenge. There's plenty of humour, which usually lands well, and enough jiggle to make Gainax blush (the aforementioned limbo-dancing scene has to be seen to be believed).There's a decent climax in the final couple of episodes, but don't expect much in the way of answers...to a lot of the series' mysteries. That's not much of a negative though, since the show's main strength is its inventive individual episodes.

GATES OF HELL!""Before I start, I wanna ask something,HOW CAN SO MANY PEOPLE DISLIKED THIS SHOW?!?! SERIOUSLY![STORY (7)]Well the pacing was pretty fast indeed. Some arc weren\'t well written, indeed. Neither the build up nor the resolution. But come on.. This show also got some good episodes! Some story had not so well plot, but some of them also had so well-written plot. There were some rushed story-telling, but the build up for the main event in the end was quite well. And yes, there were some classical type of anime ""harem"" jokes, some pervert jokes. But there were some pretty good moments...as well. And I get the disappointment because the story is so different from the novel. Considering this kind of thing is often happen whenever an anime adapting a novel or manga, so we also need to keep in mind, sometimes an anime is its own thing, to judge it, we need to keep in mind that it is its own thing and we are not allowed to expect too much cause like I said before, this thing often happens in anime. We don\'t even have main villain here. We don\'t get too much of the exploration of phantom its self. But the story and character was very well written. The story and plot was pretty neat. The story wasn\'t the best, but reading other reviews give this show 3, 5, 4, 6, just doesn\'t make sense at all. I don\'t think most of the watchers knows much about ""story-telling"", the importance of character exploration, the importance of slow pacing sometime, I don\'t think they\'re the one who cares about ""how the story goes"", I think they\'re just anime watchers who cares about excitement type of shounen anime.[ART (8)]What can I say? KyoAni always delivered some amazing visualization. The character design is always the best. The visualization of their power were awesome and I loved it.[SOUND (8)]The op is absolutely one of my favorite. The sound mixing was pretty good, the voice actors/actress did an amazing job to deliver the character. And the sound effects, I loved it. This show also has some unique scoring (music soundtrack) which I liked it.[CHARACTER (7)]Some character development was like ""too fast""? And yes, they lack of character development here, this show just established some character the way it has to. So maybe yes, the character was pretty monotone. But the characterization, the way they act, the way they feel, was good. The exploration of each of their background story in terms of character arc building was good.

If there weren\'t those two issues with the anime it could have been a great anime...The sequel ova was great and I also enjoyed the picture drama.', ""This show left such a good impression on me that it spoiled me. I was spoiled by KyoAni's awesome art, animation, and sound. Their ability to create storylines is also highlighted--they took it from an action-focused light novel to an enjoyable slice of life mixed with great action scenes. The story doesn't hand-feed the viewer all the answers and sometimes takes a bit of thinking, but it's always the right amount of thinking. As a result, I was rarely left confused or bored.The characters felt deep and the anime did a fabulous job showing their motivations and personalities.

I don't understand they know how to rate the anime maybe is their preference or they simply give low score. Actually, for me score 1 o 3 is very bad in everything like plot super bad, sound and characters are epic fail or annoying character and you can't bear to look at it. Decent anime with decent plot feel like okay and average art style consider as score of 4-6 like meh - okay bear to accept.

Some episodes are interesting while some feel downright pointless or out of place with each episode having a core ""theme"" that it follows.  Said themes, however, are often forced and have little to nothing to do with the episodes they are presented in at the start of the show (I\'m looking at you Schrodinger\'s cat episode).The art is wonderfully done, plain and simple.  The characters and phantoms are colorful and very well...animated.  Normally only see this type of animation in movies.The characters...are pretty generic and stereotypical.  No one you haven\'t seen before, and the only surprising bit about any of them was none of them seemed to fit the tsundere theme for once.  On rare occasion someone will act in a manner that a human being would act, but most of the time each character\'s behavior is molded to fit whatever the current episode theme is.Nothing seems to make sense in this show. The characters go out and fight phantoms as though they were going on a picnic while several encounters have shown that failing a hunt could VERY easily result in death or worse.  Their sensei, for her part, doesn\'t seem to mind this either and not only sends her students on deadly missions but she doesn\'t even pay them for doing so! No, buying someone some rice or a BBQ dinner for risking their life several times a day does not count.  Characters get stronger or weaker at the drop of a hat for no reason.

MCPW honed in on psychological lessons as the premise for it’s questionably supernatural setting. From the get go, the interesting openings where our mc is sharing a lesson in human psychology grabbed me. Each lesson is unique and sets the tone for the episode in a way that illustrates the opening principle. I’d never seen anything done...like this before in the medium, which is why it hurt that much more to watch Kyoto Animation plunge into just about all of the most stereotypical anime tropes out there.The two main characters we start off with, Mai & Haruhiko, seem interesting enough, they have good chemistry and aesthetically pleasing character design. Over the course of the 13 episodes I hoped to watch them develop as characters, draw unique things out of each other, get a clear idea as to how they see the world...you know… KyoAni stuff. But what followed was a relationship that got increasingly shallow, characters that never really developed or revealed any depth, uncomfortably overexecuted fan service, and a new potential romantic rival every episode… you know… *not* KyoAni stuff.The fantastic colouring, interesting powers and well thought out phantoms really made me want to like this show.Had this been from any other studio it wouldn’t have stung as bad, but since we’ve come to identify Kyoto Animation as the well established standard bearer for what makes quality anime, seeing this attached to their name was a little much to handle.At its worst MCPW is a massive wasted opportunity, at best it’s a visually pleasing distraction.FFO: When Supernatural Battles Became Common Place, Amagi Brilliant Park like this before in the medium, which is why it hurt that much more to watch Kyoto Animation plunge into just about all of the most stereotypical anime tropes out there.The two main characters we start off with, Mai & Haruhiko, seem interesting enough, they have good chemistry and aesthetically pleasing character design.

Nope.Also, the anime was pretty different from the light novels right? Character wise and stuff. Also the whole episodic nature could have been good (like Saiki K. or Natsume Yuujinchou or something) but I mostly found it boring. I was like ""??"" and also ""zzzz"" haha.Should I cry about wasting 5 hours of my life on this? Nah I\'ve watched worse anime.I think it had an interesting idea, but the execution could have been better....Also I better stick this into my anime review.__Okay, so as mentioned, here\'s the anime review. Let\'s go with my standard MAL format.The idea was very interesting, I just think it could have been executed better?Story: 3/10As mentioned, it has episodic stories, except for the last two which are a slightly longer story. Each episode seemed to focus on one particular character or event or phantom or major battle or whatever. So, episodic. I thought they were all pretty boring. The last story (Episodes 12/13) was the most interesting one... and it\'s quite different from the light novel, which is sad. Boo. I think it could have been better?Art: 5/10Nothing really stands out. There are lots of short skirts, bouncy boobs, the usual. Pretty average, especially for this magic school fighting monsters guy-with-lots-of-girls thing. Yep. 5/10 it is.Sound: 6/10I thought it was pretty average. Actually. But the reason I watched this show was because of SCREEN mode\'s opening song, which I remember failing at on tons of Anime Opening Quizzes. Yeah, I hoped maybe I could remember it if I watched the anime. Also because I spend too much time watching weird cliché anime that wastes 5 hours of my life. But yes, voice acting was cool, I can\'t remember a single OST, etc. would normally be a 5/10, however I give it a +1 for SCREEN mode.Character: 4/10Well, first I guess the characters are slightly different when compared to the light novel ones, but that\'s not really factored into the score. They were all pretty average in my opinion. The only slightly unique thing was a main character who reads books and spouts random trivia. And an elementary schooler in the group of high school kids with their club and stuff. How\'d she get in?? Anyway... yeah, 4/10. It was average. But more average than I thought could be possible.Enjoyment: 3/10I liked the last two episodes, though I was hoping it\'d follow the light novel more. I got so tired of clicking the ""next"" button for just about every single episode before it though. I was really hoping for that light novel following, which is actually the reason I continued... but no luck. At least it was more interesting than ""Makura no Danshi"" or whatever. There wasn\'t even voice actor bias for me to pay attention slash look forward to.Overall: 2.1/10Wait, I gave it a 5 for ""average"" before, but I guess it was worse. How tragic. Either way, it was 100% something I would have expected. Nice ideas. I might try reading more of the light novels if I have time. Musaigen no Phantom World could have been better.

Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryOf of those kyoani series where story ain\'t really a thing. The in a nutshell story is basically main cast does club activities that consists of ridding monsters. Every start of the episode there is a little fun mono/dialogue about certain thing or event, phenomenon. And then we get episode, where some sort entity does something bad or unpleasant and thus the club activity starts. Comedic anime, with nice touch of fanservice. Anyhow, story I something I call here simply a ""device"" to have any sorts of...story. Mainly it\'s episodic enjoyment. Some drama, some action, some comedy.  In another words story ain\'t anything bad nor good. It simply is there.✦ArtKyoani.. what else i can say, great animation, bright and fun. Fanservice that isn\'t the usual pantyshots, awkward positions and so on. This fanservice was more of a clothing sensualism/sexiness. So yeah, nothing to complain regarding the art.✦SoundI think for the most part it was good, but didn\'t really impress me much.✦CharacterNot sure what to mention.

I've seen Pokemon and DBZ and such that were featured on Television when I was a child, but I've never seen anything else anime had to offer. I decided one day to watch anime cause it seemed pretty nice, and Musaigen was the first one to catch my eye when scrolling through what to find. Watching it, I was honestly entranced.The animation was beautiful, and everything was so new to me. Looking back at...the anime, it wasn't that great, but when I began to watch it, EVERYTHING was so different and great to me. Characters, powers, and the story was unique to me, and it was very interesting. I ended up catching up all the way to the 12th episode at the time, and it felt like YEARS for the last episode to be released, and I was filled with joy when it was finally released.Although the Musaigen wasn't that great, this is the anime that got me into anime as a whole. I'm grateful for this.What I Liked:- The art was very clear and smooth.- I enjoyed how Haruhiko began each episode explaining something that involved the episode.- Loved every episode, it had me drawn to it each time.- The characters are very loveable.- The powers are really nice, they feel similar to other anime yet unique.- Phantom hunting seems fun. the anime, it wasn't that great, but when I began to watch it, EVERYTHING was so different and great to me.

From what I understand, this series is based on a novel series, but like KyoAni do with a lot of series, they are only loosely following the novels, wherein most of the plot of the series is original and ultimately the entire series only adapts the first volume. So from that point of view there are good aspects, and there are issues. Starting off with...something I liked, I did like the protagonist's personality, in that he's a complete nerd and actually acts like one, which is shockingly rare as far as I can tell. I did have issues with how useless he seemed to be in general, but he came through a lot despite that so it was mostly fine. The other main characters were also all decent enough in terms of personalities and ability sets. The issue was that there wasn't much to them beyond that however. They each get like one episode where there's development focused pretty much entirely around them, and that's it. The relationship development was even stranger, where the relationships between the various characters are only loosely alluded to and ultimately it didn't feel like things really progressed at all. This felt like a plot that was trying to take the standard KyoAni route of being focused on slice of life, moe, and such with a series of only semi-connected episodes with\xa0 a focus on being amusing over having a solid overarching plot like you would expect of a series like this. However, it didn't have the character and relationship development to back that up. And hence, to a pretty large degree it felt somewhat forgettable. Now that's not to say that each episode is bad per say, in that there's a solid variety of episodes and each episode is amusing on its own with solid self contained stories and good comedy, but it doesn't feel like it holistically adds up to more than the sum of it's parts, and considering the type of story it is that's somewhat disappointing.However, there is another major redeeming feature in this anime, in that it's a really solid KyoAni show. Rather, I think it might be one of the best in terms of animation. The art and animation is super solid as always, and the phantom themes allow them a tremendous amount of flexibility to animate a bunch of very different interesting things including using a variety of styles, which they used quite well. I feel this may well be worth it just to watch for the art/animation. The production values beyond that were solid as well, with a solid soundtrack and good OP/EDs. something I liked, I did like the protagonist's personality, in that he's a complete nerd and actually acts like one, which is shockingly rare as far as I can tell.

For one, it's a fantasy, not Slice of Life. They didn't have to waste 9 or so episodes on fillers. Character developments were okay, but other than that, it was just a series of OVAs. Also, They just had to make it a harem anime. From past shows (specifically R-15), I knew that...mixing moe and harem is never a good idea. But apparently, the creators didn't understand that. Fanservice was okay, but Harem was going too far.The characters were basically generic harem characters. The only memorable character was Mai and Ruru. The others were just the result of lazy writing.If there's one thing I liked about this anime, it's the BGM. It truly encompassed the magical sci-fi setting of the series. It mixed perfectly with the animation, but it's expected of KyoAni.Did I enjoy it? A little. I'd recommend this to anyone patient enough to watch cute fillers. Once you watch this, you'll see what it's like to be in the phantom world. mixing moe and harem is never a good idea. But apparently, the creators didn't understand that.

It\'s remind me Angle Beats, Little Busters, and many anime with school-life genre. So it\'s feeling so ""Meh, I had seen this many times""Art: KyoAni is KyoAni, they still careful in thisSound: Naked Dive (OP) -> 10/10; best OP in the season...Junshin Always (ED) -> 10/10; it\'s lovableBGM -> 1/10; it\'s not aspiring at allVA -> 7/10; Decent but Kurumi and Haruhiko VA doesn\'t fitCharacters: At least I like Mai and Reina, but most of characters are too cardboard cutout.

It has gorgeous, fluid animation, fun characters (who evolve beyond their stereotypes), great music and the last two episodes are better than most higher rated shows that just peter out with no definite conclusion.If you have started watching and feel you're about to drop the show, just jump to Episodes 12 & 13.  It may inspire you to watch them all from the beginning.The show has a rather unique concept.  It's not a monster or ghost show.  The idea is that after an industrial accident, the line between...fantasy and reality have blurred - allowing the psychological manifistations of humans - in the form of Phantoms - to come alive.  It could be people, animals, inanimate objects as well as fairy tales, legends and myths.  The accident gave some humans the ability to capture and seal away rogue Phantoms and so the story focuses on a group of school kids who work together to keep their world safe from chaos.It's a wonderful concept because we don't just have bizarre aliens/monsters/creatures popping up each episode that just need to be defeated wtih made up spells.  Many times, the team has to figure out the origin of the phantom which means they have to delve within themselves to work out their own traumas and issues in order to seal the phantoms away.  That allows each encounter to reveal something new about the characters.Finally, Ruru is pretty adorable. fantasy and reality have blurred - allowing the psychological manifistations of humans - in the form of Phantoms - to come alive.

The way they show the story is really bad. I don’t mean that its confusing or something, its just really normal(too normal to be honest) they just don’t give any good plot twists in the animes i have watched until now at least and in this particular anime...they showed the story so poorly. What i mean is most of the episodes just felt like ovas rather that episodes. You can literally watch the first episode then randomly pick any episode(from ep 2 to 10) and you will understand 90 percent of the story of the episode you just watched. Just the last 2 or 3 episodes were good and connected but others were totally unconnected. If i had to say something to the studio to improve it i would say that the episodes individually felt nice but if i have to judge all the episodes then you need to connect them like show something we have already seen in previous episodes, give references to the previous episodes or give some cliffhangers.Okay so enough about the studio if i have to judge the anime it was really good but it could have been much better. I will definitely recommend this because i had fun watching it(if you watched “Date a Live” Series then you would enjoy it a little more i guess). they showed the story so poorly.

Musaigen no Phantom World felt like it was going in the right direction but the path got distracted by Mai's boing boings half way through. The anime has quite a lot of fanservice which is nice and funny at times seeing the characters get flustered. This is countered by the fact the poor MC has it rough ... to tackle a single ufo my man Haruhiko gets thrown out the window three separate times despite just opening the door for his required presence...He doesn't even mean ill, it might just be personal preference though...as I prefer my ecchi to have wholesome outcomes. The team's abilities get very stale and in all honestly Haruhiko is the only one putting in an effort to improve which bears fruit (he picks up a second skill later!) This however pales in comparison to the massive power spike he gets at the end for a reason kept in the dark so long for the audience. I would love to see interactions with other teams seeing as there is an entire school (and the mc is on great terms with one of the guys) but the anime is pretty set on just the squad and their plights. Overall I would treat this as pretty much an ecchi and if you are into that with a dash of supernatural this might just be for you! The graphics and sounds are decent but everything else seems on the low end of mediocre. as I prefer my ecchi to have wholesome outcomes.

Just the surrounding area?) with the ability to see things that were previously non-perceivable with the human eye, Phantoms. These phantoms live in a realm between reality and myth and cause (mostly) havoc for those around them. The leak also granted certain people with special abilities in order to...combat/seal these phantoms back to whence they came, and we follow a school club who specializes in doing just that exactly.Musiagen no Phantom World really had nothing going for it other than the animation, but for Kyoto Animation, it is to be expected to have this level of art behind their series\'. It\'s just all so typical and played out at this point. The characters are typical tropes of \'Underwhelming/Pretty Useless MC who is the only relevant guy to the story\', \'Tsundere girl who ends up becoming friends with the main group and slowly opens up\', \'Fan-service Senpai girl who has strong powers but is mostly used for ecchi scenes and moronic comedic relief\'.Honestly, the best character in the show is the little 4th grader, Kurumi, because she actually has a character arc that makes it feel worth it to care about her, a power that is both cute and powerful, and actually acts her age throughout the entire series.Aside from the characters, the main story really just, doesn\'t exist too heavily aside from following this one team around as they defeat Phantoms. A lot of the episodes are pretty poorly organized and it just feels like they threw paint at a storyboard and ran with it.

While it\'s inoffensive, and actually a pretty good adaptation considering that they only had half of a volume of source material, I just wonder, ""Why did this have to be made?""And more importantly, ""Why did KyoAni have to take this? Wouldn\'t this have been better left to A-1 or something?""Musaigen isn\'t...funny enough to be a comedy, isn\'t deep enough to be a supernatural thriller, and isn\'t even fanservice-y enough to be a good ecchi.

And I\'m a big fan of the character designs too, especially how KyoAni took special care to give them each varying heights and body shapes.Overall though, I\'m giving this a 6 for being a 4-5 show with (+1) KyoAni art.

Rayearth,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1954/Rayearth,"[""This OVA was created as a stand alone adventure, so if you're looking for a manga based movie then forget it. The only things that are the same are names of people and locations. The biggest difference in this movie is character relations. People who are friends or would become friends in the manga and TV series are enimies all the way through the movie. I personally like the movie because it gives a fresh perspective on a proven title, but don't go watching this movie expecting certain people to be the same as in the manga and TV series or you'll dissapoint yourself. "", ""Japan has an affection and an affinity for making movies and TV shows about giant things battling each other. The kaiju genre of film is one of Japan's most well known exports with Godzilla being a recognisable icon no matter where in the world you are. And not just kaiju films, but also things like Gundam or Power Rangers feature giant robots that fight to protect a city (which they usually end up trashing).The Rayearth OVA is that kind of anime. It's basically what would happen if you took Power Rangers made the rangers cute anime girls and added a whole bunch random fantasy elements...to it. It's an odd mix to say the least.The best part of this OVA is definitely its presentation. The anime looks great with its character and monster designs and overall aesthetic. It knows how to use colour, portraying the world as bleak and dark yet maintaining splashes of colour for the characters you're supposed to follow so they pop out. There drawings are detailed and nowhere in the animation does it feel like they slacked with all of the explosions, buildings collapsing and monsters firing giant laser beams looking impressive.There are faults here too however. The backgrounds are rather indistinct, the entire anime takes place in Tokyo, but most of the time you can't really tell where everything is happening. This could be attributed to the OVAs overall dark colour palette and to the fact that most of the city gets reduced to indistinct piles of rubble anyway.Speaking of piles of rubble, let's talk story. Rayearth is about three girls Hikaru, Umi and Fuu who get chosen by deities to be the protectors of our world the eponymous Rayearth. When the world gets attacked by the forces of a parallel world called Cephiro it's up to these three girls to pass their deity's test and become giant mech/monster hybrids and destroy the city... I-I mean save the world.There's a few problems with how Rayearth executes this premise, and I will preface my listing my grievances with the saying that I have not seen the TV show or read the manga so I went into this blind.Firstly, there's no sense of weight to the plot. Events happen in the show and their strung along in a nice sequence, but it feels like most of the scenes are standalone. There's no impact and at times it feels like things are happening just because. This, I feel, can be mainly attributed to how none of the characters in the show get any development. There is some attempted arc for the three girls but it comes off as forced and artificial, it's less of an arc and more of a straight line. One moment they're unsure, scared and in despair and the next BOOM they're a giant fire-breathing lion vanquishing their enemy with ease!Secondly, the show is just plain confusing. The total running time of the three episodes is somewhere around 120 minutes yet for most of that time I had no clue why things were happening as they were on screen. Sure, the anime tries to explain itself somehow, but in all of its attempts it just somehow becomes more confusing. The motivation of the main antagonist is foggy at best, and to top it all of it ends on a very weird note and quite abruptly at that. It feels like they had a story written for a much longer series, but had to cut a lot out to fit three episodes. Remember however, that this is a completely original story written specifically for these OVAs that has nothing to do with the TV show or manga so how and why is all of this so confusing?And the confusion doesn't end there either. There's more! Besides having a plot that's reminiscent of a maze with no exit it also can't get it's main theme straight. An important and often mentioned point in the show is the friendship between the three main girls yet for most of the show the girls get separated and only towards the end do we see some semblance of teamwork from them. The rest of the time we only get periodic reminders on how they're best friends and how important that is. Not feeling that butchering a story about friendship is enough, on the Cephiro side of things they try to shoehorn in a forbidden love story wrapped in a tale about nature. Basically, the fairy queen that governs nature and a high priest love each other, but that's a no-no so the world becomes barren. What's the message they're trying to send here? Don't fuck with nature? I don't get it.Rayearth the OVA is a somewhat pretty looking and utterly confusing OVA that was probably made for people who've already seen the TV show and have some sort of connection and pre-existing knowledge about the world and characters.

It\'s horrendous. The art is terrible, they ""sexed up"" the teenage girls and stripped them nude in one scene, the plotline makes as little sense as I\'ve ever witnessed in any film or series ever, and all the character interactions are unnecessarily different and confusing.Whereas the Utena movie, while a very weird and surreal retelling of the original series, actually added something to the experience by being at least coherent, and having an ending that in an interesting way enhanced and explained the original ending...This does the opposite. It\'s...a complete bastardization of the original, wonderfully done series, no doubt as a cash grab with zero attention to care for the characters or the world they inhabit.I want my couple hours and money back for having ever wasted my time on this. a complete bastardization of the original, wonderfully done series, no doubt as a cash grab with zero attention to care for the characters or the world they inhabit.I want my couple hours and money back for having ever wasted my time on this.', 'There are some parts of this OVA that are serviceable, and other parts that are just really terrible.  The art is nice (and more modern than the original series) and the sound is solid.  The first of the three episodes is actually pretty good as a start.  If you don\'t know much about the original series or are open to a new take, the premise (at least the beginning) is pretty interesting.The show is definitely more grim and dark, in my opinion the result of it being made in a post-Evangelion world.  It has the hallmarks of a lot...of late 90s/early 00s shows (which...admittedly was a lot of my early exposure to anime, so I may be biased) where everything is super edgy and some of the writing is still questionable.  It does feel different from the decidedly 80s/early 90s original series, which is more sparsely written but earnest and bright.  Still, if you\'re willing to look at a darker alternate take, in some ways this reminds me of the Escaflowne movie, which I actually really liked.However.It becomes pretty clear by mid-way through episode 2 that there\'s not a very clear direction.  The storyline seems to completely unravel and all attempts to round it out at the end of episode 3 feel hasty and illogical.  The show goes to great lengths to not explain anything until the very end, at which point a bunch of seemingly random plot points are just tossed at the wall to see what sticks.  The original\'s writing isn\'t amazing (particularly season 2), but at least there\'s a consistent storyline and a few characters have arcs, whereas in RayEarth none of that really happens.Some of this is because the character development is pretty bad.  Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu have similar personalities to the original, where the development also tends to be somewhat thin, but here their characters don\'t really get any progress, other than shouting some slogans toward the end.  The Cephirans are somehow even less fleshed out than the original, and almost none of their actions really fit together in a logical way.  Eagle, who was the best character of the previous show, is made into a generic (and badly developed) villain.  Overall, no one seems to have strong motivations, and the show struggles to tie the main existing motivations (the main girls\' desire to be/stay friends) with any of the fantasy elements or their views on their powers.If I had to pick a representation of how this show felt to me, it would be ""wut"".  I spent the latter two episodes confused, and every story choice past episode one just felt more and more random.  They try to establish a slight magic system, but it falls apart quickly and fails to explain a lot of other things that happen later.  I\'m not sure why the girls were naked in the suits either - this seemingly had to do with common tropes in mecha anime at the time?  Either way, there were definitely a couple uncomfortable and confusing scenes with the girls in weirdly porn-like poses.  The final ending doesn\'t even really round things out - stuff just happens suddenly with no explanation.--That being said, I\'m willing to not rate it as complete trash, as the visuals and audio weren\'t bad for the time period, and I did have fun watching it with my wife in that ""bad movie night"" sort of way to round out our MKR experience.

Pretty much the only things I don\'t have are action figures (because they creep me out in general) and maybe a few miscellaneous items such as the alarm clock, stickers,...etc. It\'s pretty much a mania borderlining obsession (and a little embarrassing in all honesty).So, with all that said, I absolutely adore Sengoku BASARA but I was completely disappointed by the third season.*Note: this review may include spoilersStory (4/10):BASARA has never been a historically accurate series and it\'s obvious to people who didn\'t even know it was supposed to be historical fiction in the first place, however, in my opinion I feel that it was this inaccuracy that gave BASARA its charm. I\'ve had a lot of fun with this series watching it and then Googling everything to see how much is true and I\'ve learned a lot of interesting facts about Japan\'s Sengoku period.Season one was by FAR the best in the series, but slowly but surely I found that it was starting to lose its charm as they continued making seasons. The story started losing quality until it got to season three, which was definitely one of the poorest written storyline I\'ve seen, which is really saying something considering how much anime I haven\'t liked but have forced myself to watch.During season three, I felt like I was watching a really badly written fanfiction and I just couldn\'t get into this plot. There was a lot of, not quite ""fan service"", but a lot of fluff that didn\'t make sense in the overall story and it was just BAD. It really pains me to say this, but I was not impressed by season three (obviously). It just seemed to have lost the novelty that it started out with.It basically said, ""none of season 1 or 2 or even the movie happened, so this is the new story"" and then retold the whole series in a completely different, unappealing way. I mean, for God\'s sake, there were ZOMBIES in the finale. WHERE did that even come from? It made really no sense in any way. (Although I will admit, I do have a slight interest in zombies and kind of briefly wondered what it would be like to see the BASARA cast fighting them.... But you didn\'t hear that from me.)I get that it was trying to follow game 3\'s storyline, but it just wasn\'t executed well. I think if they really wanted to use the third game\' story, they should have picked it up from the end of season 2 again and fixed BASARA\'s Last Party into a more coherent series.Art (6/10):I\'m not quite sure why BASARA switched from Production I.G (animation company that produced all the seasons up \'til now) to Telecome Animation Studio, but it shouldn\'t have. While T.A.S uses really nice, vivid colors unlike I.G studios, the style is just too different and a lot of times I felt that the proportions looked really awkward or not realistic.With the different style too, even though it was the same characters, after seeing the same style for two seasons and a movie this season looked like a fan drew the whole thing in an attempt to look like the original.Sound (9/10):I will say the sound was as nice as ever. BASARA does make a point of getting all the ""big seiyuu"" and they\'re all really good at what they do (duh). I was really glad that none of the voices changed, especially from game to anime (I mean the Japanese cast). All the voices from the game got their respective roles in the anime, so that was really good.The soundtrack this time round was aslo really different in style, but it kind of worked out anyway. Hiroyuki Sawano is an amazing composer and I\'m disappointed I didn\'t get to hear his music this time round, but Masahiro Tokuda is not one to be under-estimated either and has a very cool, unique style that seemed to fit.Character (5/10):I felt that all the characters seemed too OOC (out of character) and none of it felt ""right"". I am glad that this season included some of the characters from the third BASARA game (brand new characters at the time) but on the other hand, I think that with all the new characters, they kind of took away from the ""original"" cast like Masamune, Yukimura, etc.In addition to this, there is one brief moment when Masamune and Yukimura are talking alone, and it felt kind of like they were on a date and I was watching a shounen-ai or something. I mean, BASARA has always had a ""man-crush"" kind of theme like, ""respect thy rival"" and all that, but this was just too much and WAY overdone.Enjoyment (5/10):None of the characters made sense and it was kind of hard to like them, and this is coming from someone who has played all the games and seen the anime at least 3 times. I just couldn\'t get into this season, and I pretty much consider it the ""ba****d"" season of the show because I refuse to accept it.I think the overall reason that I disliked this season was because it was so different from everything that already came out. I\'m kind of orthodox that way; I hate change and I hate things that change drastically - which is how I would describe season three in the nicest way possible.Overall: (6/10)Overall, even despite my BASARA mania, I REALLY couldn\'t get into this season and I honestly don\'t recommend it. If you don\'t want your image of the BASARA cast shattered into a million tiny pieces or if you liked the original story and cast the way they were, AVOID THIS SEASON AT ALL COSTS.Go back to season one, is my suggestion. etc. It\'s pretty much a mania borderlining obsession (and a little embarrassing in all honesty).So, with all that said, I absolutely adore Sengoku BASARA but I was completely disappointed by the third season.*Note: this review may include spoilersStory (4/10):BASARA has never been a historically accurate series and it\'s obvious to people who didn\'t even know it was supposed to be historical fiction in the first place, however, in my opinion I feel that it was this inaccuracy that gave BASARA its charm.

As for this day I like to read and know more about him.In first...anime Sengoku Basara I enjoyed watching parts that was related to Masamune-sama.Going back to Sengoku Basara: Judge End that anime as from my point it was sometimes "" ridiculous "" .In middle of anime repeatedly had uncomfortable feeling watching it.Don\'t know how I can describe it more but for me there was like "" something is missing "".In previous Sengoku Basara that anime was awesome like warped in some strange but interesting magic that made me sucked in.Watched all 12 episodes because I\'m a person who like to watch to the end , story was genuine , they fixed a little bit art especially Sanada Yukimura was made more handsome.Did not like a opening at first but in middle started to actually be fond of it , as for ending it was pure disaster listen it , was annoying and made my ears bleed after hearing squeaking voice of female musician "" I\'m gonna hate word Polaris for rest of my live "".I\'m completely a Seiyū freak and it was pleasurable to hearing so many popular and my favorite voice acting. anime Sengoku Basara I enjoyed watching parts that was related to Masamune-sama.Going back to Sengoku Basara: Judge End that anime as from my point it was sometimes "" ridiculous "" .In middle of anime repeatedly had uncomfortable feeling watching it.Don\'t know how I can describe it more but for me there was like "" something is missing "".In previous Sengoku Basara that anime was awesome like warped in some strange but interesting magic that made me sucked in.Watched all 12 episodes because I\'m a person who like to watch to the end , story was genuine , they fixed a little bit art especially Sanada Yukimura was made more handsome.Did not like a opening at first but in middle started to actually be fond of it , as for ending it was pure disaster listen it , was annoying and made my ears bleed after hearing squeaking voice of female musician "" I\'m gonna hate word Polaris for rest of my live "".I\'m completely a Seiyū freak and it was pleasurable to hearing so many popular and my favorite voice acting.', ""Sengoku Basara Judge EndThis is an alternate setting of the 3rd Arc in the Sengoku Basara Video Series the Sekigahara hype train and an alternate setting of the The Last Party that Production I.G did a while back.Story (7/10) GoodNow as an anime adaptation of the hack n slash video game Sengoku Basara 3, would personally say that this anime does a great job staying as accurate to the story source material as purpose in comparison to The Last Party. (Yes I will be comparing it to Last Party a lot in the review)Characters (8/10) Very Good...Judge End definitely cares about the characters in this series more than The Last Party did. Obviously one could say well one is a movie and the next is a 12 episode series. True but the Last Party (just like Sengoku Basara Season 1 and 2) care mostly on Masamune Date. And although I enjoyed The Last Party more because I am a Masamune Date fan boy I do respect Judge End for nerfing Masamune quite a lot in the adaptation because according to the video game The Last Party asrays a shit ton from how things go.Art (8/10) Very GoodThe Art in this adaptation I would say is (at it's best it would be a 10) actually looks better than anything Production I.G has done in their versions BUT this version is definitely not consistent with it's art style one minute it'll look amazing and the next it'll look average or even worse than Production I.G's version (at it's worst I would say it's like a 4 or a 5). (Not saying Production I.G's version was bad I'm just saying this one was better but P.I.G was indeed more consistent)Sound (10/10) OutstandingThere's nothing really wrong with the sound in anything Sengoku Basara related is outstanding so there's that. Especially the opening music to my earsEnjoyment (6/10)Everything up to episode 9 was average the enjoyment up to the point was obviously all setup for the Battle at Sekigahara the fact that they have a count down the the days until that battle happens is reason enough to believe anything up to episode 9 was just setup. And by the time we get to the battle I personally feel the hype wasn't really worth it. Yeah it stayed true to the video's story but I felt way more hype watching Production I.G's version than I was this one.Overall (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.8/10) Good+Sengoku Basara Judge End I feel it better than Season 1 of Sengoku Basara by P.I.G but I don't think it's better than Season 2 or The Last Party (AS AN ANIME). As an adaptation I felt it was the best staying true but as an anime (especially for someone who doesn't really character or know the characters before watching Judge End) can feel lack luster.

NO MAJOR SPOILER ATTACHED!It certainly feels ages when I last saw the last release of Sengoku Basara. I\'ve been a fan of this genre; historical figures, historical story and of course, the addition of shounen elements resulting into one blast-filled, blood-pumping sword-clashing title. Frankly in my opinion, this has got to be the best Sengoku Basara arc in which they focused on a single historic event. The fateful Sekigahara battle. However, a watcher ought to spit out the reality factor and focus on enjoying the fiction content, unless you want to waste your enthusiasm and will end up giving a premature...judgment.First is the story. To those who have seen, the Last Party version. Don\'t be too attached to negative perspective. While the 90 minute version failed to reach the ""impressive"" boundary, the alternate version offers more enjoyable watch with various additions of plot background, more vital characters, wise threading of events and more fluid writing. I\'m obliged to give a passable 7 for I\'ve been given a good run of watch-time.The next was the art and sound. Like in any other Sengoku Basara titles, the animation content was always superb. Good character design upgrade, better animation effect, it\'s an undoubted high quality even for the 2014 standard. That goes the same for the soundtrack, the usual amount of quality was retained, letting me enjoy the bgms and the song themes as well. Art is 10 and the Sound goes 8.Characters, oh! They\'re fabulous! Most especially, Ishida Mitsunari. From the get go to the final act, he\'s awesome. From my perspective, he implanted himself as the main character of the title. Sanada Yukimura and Date Masamune served like chaperones as they played second fiddle the entire running time. On the other hand, Tokugawa Ieyasu, who will all know emerged victorious on the real event, played the sacrificial lamb to build a country with views to each other\'s need. He was the standard good guy who ends up being made the lousiest hence, in short, the most boring main character. The other characters fulfilled their roles in a satisfying fashion, nothing can be said like a minus except for Oda Nobunaga\'s early exit. Aside from the omission of a major bad-ass villain, the other character aspects were pretty much acceptable. The dirty politics is really something that moves a country onwards, hard fact proven. Clash of ideals resulting wars is a sacred thing way back in the past, however, at least they plunged themselves forward in believing what they are fighting was the right and just thing. Characters deserves a 9, for solid dialogues and wonderful voice acting of the seiyus.Enjoyment? Heck, Judge End is one hell of a ride. I\'d no other choice but to felt compelled to give an 8 for it. Aside from the re-used tactics, recycled revenge drama, reduced battle effects, I saw myself getting drawn every episodes meaning to say, it\'s a good show worth seeing.But the most important point is still yet to be discussed...Why the prejudice? It\'s painful to see a show getting undeserving scores from the watchers who did not bother appreciating what Jude End has to offer. I imagined that some of those mention had at least locked their eyes on a show which contained ecchi vitals and graded them higher because of the inclusion of stripe panties and bare stark naked melons. Good grief.Concluding, Judge End has what it takes to stay worth the time every episode. I can genuinely recommend this to watchers who wants an interesting show. Give it a try, folks.

I will try to not make spoilers, sorry if you find any (I think it won\'t have any major spoiler at all).Story (10/10):Seing it\'s predecessors and compared to them, it is 10, this rate is comparing to the original\'s work (the game), it is the most close in similarity to the game, in the predecessors\' I saw disturbing things, the focus on the two main characters was kind of irritating, the others couldn\'t shine at...all, in the second season they almost putted Yukimura as a SECONDARY CHARACTER!, yes the very first episode gives that impression, and the last one ... I like Masamune, but we\'re talking about ""japan\'s number one warrior!"" which is considered to be Yukimura, his fight against Mori was like, not enjoyable to see at all, Hideyoshi never entered in battle with the Takeda army, that was so sad, I saw Yukimura almost dissapearing on the show, the worst thing was the movie, obviously Yukimura is not important here (too damm obvious), Masamune never could win against Hideyoshi alone, even being my favorite, he outshine others too much (mabushi sugiru).Art (10/10):For a Capcom thing, very rare to see something good on Capcom animation, that is why is 10, very loyal to the original art, in the predecessors the characters were too damm slim, like a CLAMP character.Sound (10/10):Sengoku Basara never dissapointed me in that one, I know this Loathing in Las Vegas\' guys, they\'re good too.Character (10/10):They are much more developed than in it\'s predecessors\', and they\'re loyal to the originals\'.Enjoyment (10/10):The show seems to run too quick, the only thing it was missing was ""Nobunaga\'s supossed to be ressurected thing"", it seems they couldn\'t think in a better way to show this, but I saw so many action, fights, and good history, that is just a small point that can be ignored seing the overall. You can find it quite enjoyable, even runnig quicly you won\'t feel lost, it is really similar to the game\'s history with some very very very... minor changes.Overall (9/10):It lost one point just because I saw a ""heart"" in Tenkai in a scene in the final, and the ""Nobunaga\'s ressurection thing"", I am just being mean here, I wished to give a 10, but I have to be sincere.Sorry if I mispeled anything wrong here, I am from Brazil, I don\'t practice english so much. And this typing thing actually lead us to make mistakes. all, in the second season they almost putted Yukimura as a SECONDARY CHARACTER!, yes the very first episode gives that impression, and the last one ...

And this typing thing actually lead us to make mistakes.', 'So, you want to have more fun with Basara? Meh, not that time. JE is completely different - I fell in love with it for just being so different! Oh, wait...Basically JE is about how Tokugawa Ieyasu and Ishida Mitsunari make their armies and get new frien---allies, so they can clash in The Last Part---, I mean: battle! And I say it: it\'s REALLY about that, with no ""friends-no-jutsu"" - it\'s a pretty diplomatic story.Oh, and you have to know something important: this Basara isn\'t a lovely comedy. In JE there\'s no:a) absurd thingies (besides Tadakatsu - Tadakatsu is a personification of absurdity),b) abnormal fighting...(hu-huh, really, no Jumping Jack Breakers! But still beware of Tadakatsu),c) architecture ruining.In lieu of that you\'ll get plenty of:a) crying Mitsunari,b) talking about alliances (a lot!),c) more crying Mitsunari,d) demonic Oichi.Wait. I\'ll explain it properly.1. that plot!Game based, totally. I\'ve never seen so many elements put into one adaptation. So. Many. I love this game, so I\'m happy.The main point: there\'s no ""let\'s beat the big bad wolf!"". No Oda? No Oda. No big bad Toyotomi aka. The New Oda. There\'s only the clash between Mitsunari and Ieyasu who both are pretty equal. If there\'s no better-than-you opponent, is it still cool? A little. Personally I prefer such plot - how many times can I watch the same beating the bad guy? In JE no one is really bad, so...Though, for people who like good-evil conflicts it\'ll be boring as hell, and for fans of Oda - 0/10.2. those characters!I truly love Basara guys. Maybe they\'re just my type, so please ignore my ""kyaaa!"" screams.Masamune got a kick in the balls and lost half of his normal coolness. He\'s running around, biting everyone and he told Ieyasu to ""get lost"". How nice. It\'s pretty hard to gulp this picture of him, but since I love torturing characters and exceeding limits, I found him more interesting than in both previous animes and the original game.Yukimura is now so smaaart! You\'d never guess! And you probably won\'t like him, if you prefer old good stupid Sanada. As for me, he has become more interesting with his simple mind spiced with some windom.Mitsunari is hysterically melancholic. If you like him in the worst state of his depression, you\'ll love this anime. If you have already enough of that soap-opera, forget. He\'s pretty scary when he cries blood.Ieyasu, poor Ieyasu... He\'s not the Sun of Japan now. His dark side was activated, but without very intensive glare it\'s not visible why.Outside this Great Four Heroes we have ALMOST all known characters (no poor Mogami, sob) - every one has their small show and cute moments. I love~...3. that graphics! that music!I\'m one of those people who actually can completely ignore technical things, get blind and deaf - as long as plot is fine and it doesn\'t look like my drawings in age of 5, it\'s okay.Less frames - less smooth animation. A little more like in older American cartoons. But I like it anyway.Less stupid faces. Really. You can pause whenever you want and characters won\'t have cross-eyes - I.G. did it and I have a superpower ""catching bad frames in anime"". But the design is another thing!

(hu-huh, really, no Jumping Jack Breakers! But still beware of Tadakatsu),c) architecture ruining.In lieu of that you\'ll get plenty of:a) crying Mitsunari,b) talking about alliances (a lot!),c) more crying Mitsunari,d) demonic Oichi.Wait. I\'ll explain it properly.1. that plot!Game based, totally. I\'ve never seen so many elements put into one adaptation. So. Many. I love this game, so I\'m happy.The main point: there\'s no ""let\'s beat the big bad wolf!"". No Oda? No Oda. No big bad Toyotomi aka. The New Oda. There\'s only the clash between Mitsunari and Ieyasu who both are pretty equal. If there\'s no better-than-you opponent, is it still cool? A little. Personally I prefer such plot - how many times can I watch the same beating the bad guy? In JE no one is really bad, so...Though, for people who like good-evil conflicts it\'ll be boring as hell, and for fans of Oda - 0/10.2. those characters!I truly love Basara guys. Maybe they\'re just my type, so please ignore my ""kyaaa!"" screams.Masamune got a kick in the balls and lost half of his normal coolness. He\'s running around, biting everyone and he told Ieyasu to ""get lost"". How nice. It\'s pretty hard to gulp this picture of him, but since I love torturing characters and exceeding limits, I found him more interesting than in both previous animes and the original game.Yukimura is now so smaaart! You\'d never guess! And you probably won\'t like him, if you prefer old good stupid Sanada. As for me, he has become more interesting with his simple mind spiced with some windom.Mitsunari is hysterically melancholic. If you like him in the worst state of his depression, you\'ll love this anime. If you have already enough of that soap-opera, forget. He\'s pretty scary when he cries blood.Ieyasu, poor Ieyasu... He\'s not the Sun of Japan now. His dark side was activated, but without very intensive glare it\'s not visible why.Outside this Great Four Heroes we have ALMOST all known characters (no poor Mogami, sob) - every one has their small show and cute moments. I love~...3. that graphics! that music!I\'m one of those people who actually can completely ignore technical things, get blind and deaf - as long as plot is fine and it doesn\'t look like my drawings in age of 5, it\'s okay.Less frames - less smooth animation. A little more like in older American cartoons. But I like it anyway.Less stupid faces. Really. You can pause whenever you want and characters won\'t have cross-eyes - I.G. did it and I have a superpower ""catching bad frames in anime"". But the design is another thing! Yukimura, use your tweezers! Ieyasu has a really awesome nose. So square. I like how their faces vary.Though, someone probably thought that Basara guys are too gay, so their shoulders got sooo wide! That makes me angry every time I see it!As for music: opening is Jmetal with crazy vocal (and it\'s in EngRish! Can you hear that?) what I found amusing, ending - Ishikawa Chiaki. Cute.

Shisha no Teikoku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28625/Shisha_no_Teikoku,"['Yesterday I just watched The Empire of Corpses movie and what I got is just disappointment. Let me elaborate my statement with my review.Story - 3/10The story is about how Watson (Holmes\'s partner) discover a way of saving humanity from being zombie. The whole movie is just about his journey of his research and medication. The story itself is quite poor, as the movie itself literally is nothing but a medium to deliver deep messages to the audience. There is no story at all, aside from Watson going to save humanity with dumb and absurd way.Premise - 6/10The premise itself is sort of interesting, with...everyone was zombiefied and become \'Frankensteins\'. Government zombiefied their citizens and corpses that are re-purposed with a false soul in order to use them as laborers, are used to improve industrial development. No doubt, the premise is pretty cool and there were symbolism behind it. The whole movie was actually symbolizing those laborers that have lost their soul to the system, which makes them no longer humane anymore. In order to regain the one\'s soul, humanity needs love. More or less, it\'s sort of like Guilty Crown, however at the same time, it\'s same as Guilty Crown failed in delivering the messages. The story and messages were all over the places without any coherence at all. In order words, this movie failed, even though it looks cool by its cover.Character - 1/10There is no character at all in this movie. All of them are plot devices in order to move on the plot and deliver deep messages. All of them are pretentious. There are no characteristic at all for the characters in the movie. It completely failed in character\'s aspect! I like Alexei, Nikolai & Friday though, but all of them are the same too. Plot devices!Art - 9/10Wit Studio, the studio that produced Attack on Titans and in Spring 2016 they are going to make a high budget production with cool animation, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. If you have seen the trailer, or watched Attack on Titans before, you must have known the quality of animation the studio could deliver. It\'s all superb and fantastic throughout the whole movie. It\'s the only selling point for this bad movie. The animation, no doubt is eye-catching. The textures in background, the control in colours are well-produced. Every second every frame of the movie is so beautiful. Seriously, Wit Studio really did well in the visual part for this movie.Music - 7/10Not that bad, not that good either. All the tracks fit the movie well, but there is no memorable soundtracks from the movie. EGOIST\'s theme song is fine too.Enjoyment - 4/10The whole movie is like a boring roller coaster. It gave me so much anticipation on the movie, however it just left a huge disappointment to me. Nothing in the movie aside from the animation impressed me. I won\'t recommend anyone to watch this movie, even though it might be some ""2deep4u"" stuff, however the movie failed to handle the messages coherently. It really disappointed to me. Seriously, don\'t watch this movie, unless you wanna experience the great animations. Moreover, it\'s 2-hour long.I really hyped this movie very much along with the other two Project ITOH (Genocidal Organ & Harmony). I hope the other two won\'t be this bad, seriously please.

It\'s kinda wasted to spend that much of budget on this bad story.', ""This review is my very biased opinion. I am a huge sucker for redjuice and EGOiST and it will be apparent in the review.Let's start with the good point(s).Art: 10The art and animation is amazing. Redjuice has provided the movie with some great character design followed by incredible backgrounds, animation of scenes and effects.Story: 3The story is hugely inspired by Frankenstein. This might be due to me not being able to understand the story, however it mostly seemed like a mediocre fanfiction which includes major characters from many classic western novels such as Frankenstein, Sherlock Holmes books and more. This might be due...to the fact that this is a movie adaptation from a novel. With knowledge of all the characters (I only knew about 30% beforehand) this might be an interesting approach.The movie has a lot of plot holes, pretty much nothing is explained or showed (unless this is caused by my lack of understanding) and the story pretty much uses the most cliché plot twists to a point where it's not even surprising at all. In the same way action scenes seemed hollow and seemed to follow some kind of cliché setup taken directly from the worse end of Hollywood action movies.The events defy common logic and the choices made by the characters makes no sense but this is something you'll see in many old novels (in my very biased opinion).Sound: 9Soundtracks wasn't used a lot (unless I failed to notice) which in my opinion was a nice decision which made the movie feel closer to the time of the events (19th century).I was quite impressed by the sounds the zombies made and the sound effects in general were nice.The 2 ending themes, Door by EGOiST and another one was quite nice and fit the movie really well, but they were the only clear instance of music or soundtrack (I might be very bad at noticing soundtracks).Characters: 5Even if the art of the characters are 10/10 the characters themselves are quite mediocre. The characters don't seem to resemble the source material (how they are in their respective books) and seem to fit a stereotype quite well. Without spoiling too much, the sidekick Barnaby (I'm pretty sure it's Barnaby) is basically random sidekick nr. 1.Enjoyment: 8This was quite enjoyable to watch as the art (backgrounds, characters & animation quality) was so good that I could fap to it. The story was interesting, as it used tonnes of references and had some really great ideas, but it wasn't good enough to keep me hooked. Questions I wanted answered during the movie was usually like: How are they going to explain this? The answer was it wouldn't be explained. The characters, while not being unique, they weren't terrible either so just mediocre.Overall: 7 (I allowed myself to vote 8 on it for bias)Quite similar to Guilty Crown by having superior art and bad story.Also had other Guilty Crown feels and elements (Guilty Crown haters shouldn't watch this imo :>)Might not be the movie you remember as the best but it is definitely enjoyable as you watch it. to the fact that this is a movie adaptation from a novel.

The whole plot revolves around the possibility of reanimating corpses infusing them with their ""souls"". These corpses prove to be very useful after time and they\'re used for different works.  Watson is hired to retrieve some notes that would help to recover the souls of the corpses, but there are some conflicting opinions. Some people think this process is awful, and some others want to take advantage of it. Watson will find himself in the middle of this situation and will have to take a decision that will affect everyone.This story is a re-reading of Frankenstein...and the moral conflict it arises from the use of corpses. There are some changes, like the technology used, but the similiraties are there.Art: 10/10The art is stunning. The characters are absolutely beautiful and very different from each other. The details in the backgrounds are simply amazing. Visually, this movie is a masterpiece.Sound: 7/10The music is nice and it fits with the situation of the movie but there\'s not any remarkable song.Character: 8/10Okay, this may be my favourite part of the movie. All the characters are based in literary figures. If you\'ve read the works it\'s funny to see some similarities between the characters with the original sources, like how Watson is actually studying medicine, for example. For me this was a very nice touch, but I admit that if you don\'t know the works this little details are going to pass unnoticed. Either way they\'re not necessary to understand the main plot but it is a nice touch either way.Enjoyment: 8/10I think this movie is pretty enjoyable. It can be confusing at times but it is interesting enough.Overall: 9/10The animation is amazing, the characters varied and the story is interesting enough to keep you entertained. The only problem can be the fact that the plot is not that original but a re-reading of Frankestein and that it can get complicated at some parts. and the moral conflict it arises from the use of corpses.

Seriously, a movie about zombies who become part of society and are used in our daily lives in a...Steampunk London with famous characters from various novels? Fuck Yeah but as always the sad part is, the movie promises you lots of things but has trouble to keep them. The story looks simple at first sight but it’s actually way more complex that you think. The first half of the movie is pretty good but it falls apart in the second half, the ending will leave you with lots of questions that will never be answered nothing is explained multiples brains had to work together on this movie to understand it well i guess that’s something.Characters- 8/10The characters are almost all from various novels/books or are real people that I believe lived in London during that century. But that doesn’t really matter actually. Aside from little references that made me smile like “ooh look it's Frederick Burnaby” the characters being named after famous people has no influence on the story whatsoever.You have the Main Character Dr. Watson (sidekick to Holmes) Hadaly Lilith (from the book The Future Eve) and many others so are they well developed? I’d say meh  i guess without reading those books you can't know how much alike they really are or different they are, the character designs are great.Sound- 7/10Really nothing big to say here, the OST had nothing memorable but it was good enough to set good moods for action or drama.Art- 10/10Now this was the best thing from the movie, the Art is amazing, Wit studio has done a great job once again the movie is eye candy for anyone from snowy cold landscapes to the noisy, full of corpses city of London, corpses exploding and fighting scenes everything was detailed, well draw and animated.Overall/Enjoyment- 8/10Should you watch it? well if the movie sounded cool you should check it out, I know I’m kind on this one, but the Art saved this show, I also liked the characters and the story of this movie i belive there is more to it than what i understood or what you can understand watching it only once it’s obvious that it could have been better handled and executed with maybe more explanations on the incentives of the characters and the story as a hole. Anyway it's a good movie and i don't think you lose anything from watching it :) Steampunk London with famous characters from various novels?

Anyway it's a good movie and i don't think you lose anything from watching it :)"", 'You know, despite all the advantages they have in terms of budget and brevity, it\'s a shame anime films get so little attention within the community and even more of a shame that they\'re generally not very good. And it\'s not like they\'re rare or anything, as I\'ve been reviewing quite a lot of them as of late. With the exception of Kizumonogatari and arguably the new Ghost in the Shell, they\'re not even franchise films made solely to milk the life out of a product that\'s already on life support. They just don\'t really take advantage of the fact that they\'re supposed to be...self-contained stories, often coming off like someone just crammed an entire series worth of material into the thing before realizing they only have two hours to tell their tale and proceeded to edit like they were taking lessons from the guy who was responsible for Green Lantern\'s final cut. But for all my complaints regarding the weird pacing in Anthem of the Heart and The Boy and the Beast, I must now extend an apology to them. Because I recently saw Empire of Corpses, and I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that the pacing in that movie was so bad it literally physically assaults you.Empire of Corpses is one of three adaptations of the novels written by Project Itoh that noitamina announced sometime last year, and before people get on my case regarding the dude, no I\'ve never even heard of him prior to now let alone read his stuff, and yes I know he\'s dead. In fact, Empire of Corpses is actually based on a novel of his that he never completed before kicking the bucket, and boy does it show. Because the way this movie played out, it felt like I was watching a live-action outline that clearly didn\'t go through any revising before being pushed into Studio Wit\'s hands. Now as I\'ve said before, I respect Wit for their desire to challenge themselves and I can see the appeal of wanting to complete the work of a great author on your own (assuming that was the intention). But that doesn\'t change the fact that when they fuck up, they really fuck up.I don\'t think you even call what happens in Empire of Corpses a story. More like a bunch of explosions that might as well have a giant sign attached to them saying ""are you entertained, motherfucker? I sure hope you are, because we overstocked on explosives and need to clear out the warehouse before the end of the week"". The movie is centered on John H. Watson, a young scientist who experiments with corpse reanimation in a European setting where dead people are reanimated into ""Frankensteins"" in order to function as expendable labor. Having turned his recently deceased friend, Friday, into a Frankenstein, Watson is recruited as a government agent in order to help out with his own research and what follows is a series of what I can only describe as trying to cram an entire series\' worth of material into a two-hour film, so the plot shifts rapidly from trying to make me sympathize with John to making me want to punch his eyeballs out of his skull.My big problem with the movie is that it doesn\'t really tell you what\'s going on and why I\'m supposed to care. I don\'t know who John is besides the fact that he\'s obsessed with his work and getting Friday to become capable of speech again, and I don\'t know who Friday is because the film just assumes that since John cares about him, so should I. There\'s a scene in the middle of the movie where John is supposed to destroy an artifact called the ""Notes of Valour"" that\'s supposed to contain secrets regarding the Frankensteins that the bad guys want to utilize, but because he\'s more determined to get Friday back to a human-like state, he nearly gets his non-Frankenstein buddies killed and loses the notes in the process. This might have been understandable if we had seen anything of Friday when he was alive, but John doesn\'t even give a sentence regarding what his buddy was like back then. He just wastes people\'s sacrifices all for his own selfish gains, and without a good understanding of where he\'s coming from, it makes him incredibly unlikeable.Don\'t even bother looking at the other characters for support, because they\'re nothing but plot devices to either die or get close to dying so that John can experience a character arc without good grounding. Friday constantly turns on the characters due to his zombie state, so he\'d be kinda hard to sympathize with even if Empire bothered to tell me who the fuck he is. The only other really noticeable character I can think of at the moment is the one female character in the movie, Hadaly Lillith, and that\'s only because of a secret regarding her true nature that I won\'t spoil and how she barbecues a bunch of zombies with a flamethrower. There is one guy who in the dub has a really bad German accent, but he gets arbitrarily killed off about thirty minutes in so don\'t expect his voice to make you laugh all through the movie\'s overly long two-hour length. Nobody but our dear old Watson really has an arc in this film, and to this day, I still don\'t know what the fuck the main villain\'s plan was beyond creating a bride out of humanity\'s souls. Why? Um...he couldn\'t move on?I guess the big selling point of the film is the whole ""Frankenstein as sacrificial"" labor premise given that they\'re dead and thus you don\'t have to feel guilty about overworking them or whatnot, and that\'s pretty cool because that\'s one of the few things zombies haven\'t been used for yet in fiction\'s constant attempt to exploit them to no end. But Empire keeps turning them into an excuse for action set pieces and very rarely do said setpieces have to do with how the public uses them as war fighting machines. Now this is Wit, so the action is decent for the most part, but prettily-executed junk food spectacle is still junk food, and junk food is never going to be fun to watch under any circumstances - especially not when video games alone have pretty much exploited every way for a zombie to become a threat by now. Without a narrative, or even a good personal reason for John to be involved in it, they quickly become the equivalent of the well-produced yet boring musical numbers from Blues Brothers 2000. And despite being incredibly simplistic, the narrative also somehow managers to be overcomplicated at the same time. It even ends with an incredibly grim scene of John trying to turn himself into a Frankenstein after the happy times achieved with his comrades. Why? I don\'t know, but I wish he had done it before the thirty minute mark so I wouldn\'t have to hear him talk with that bad accent anymore.So let\'s recap this film, shall we?Story: A fucking mess.Characterization: A fucking mess.Visuals: As expected of the studio, if once again it\'s trying to be Attack on Titan.Entertainment Value: Almost none. The film is not funny apart from some unintentionally bad dubbing choices and it doesn\'t make me think at all. Without either of those elements to invite me in, the only thing I left the theater with as soon as the Egoist song played was a stone-cold expression and an hour-long train ride home in the middle of the night. self-contained stories, often coming off like someone just crammed an entire series worth of material into the thing before realizing they only have two hours to tell their tale and proceeded to edit like they were taking lessons from the guy who was responsible for Green Lantern\'s final cut.

He just wastes people\'s sacrifices all for his own selfish gains, and without a good understanding of where he\'s coming from, it makes him incredibly unlikeable.Don\'t even bother looking at the other characters for support, because they\'re nothing but plot devices to either die or get close to dying so that John can experience a character arc without good grounding. Friday constantly turns on the characters due to his zombie state, so he\'d be kinda hard to sympathize with even if Empire bothered to tell me who the fuck he is. The only other really noticeable character I can think of at the moment is the one female character in the movie, Hadaly Lillith, and that\'s only because of a secret regarding her true nature that I won\'t spoil and how she barbecues a bunch of zombies with a flamethrower. There is one guy who in the dub has a really bad German accent, but he gets arbitrarily killed off about thirty minutes in so don\'t expect his voice to make you laugh all through the movie\'s overly long two-hour length. Nobody but our dear old Watson really has an arc in this film, and to this day, I still don\'t know what the fuck the main villain\'s plan was beyond creating a bride out of humanity\'s souls. Why? Um...he couldn\'t move on?I guess the big selling point of the film is the whole ""Frankenstein as sacrificial"" labor premise given that they\'re dead and thus you don\'t have to feel guilty about overworking them or whatnot, and that\'s pretty cool because that\'s one of the few things zombies haven\'t been used for yet in fiction\'s constant attempt to exploit them to no end. But Empire keeps turning them into an excuse for action set pieces and very rarely do said setpieces have to do with how the public uses them as war fighting machines. Now this is Wit, so the action is decent for the most part, but prettily-executed junk food spectacle is still junk food, and junk food is never going to be fun to watch under any circumstances - especially not when video games alone have pretty much exploited every way for a zombie to become a threat by now. Without a narrative, or even a good personal reason for John to be involved in it, they quickly become the equivalent of the well-produced yet boring musical numbers from Blues Brothers 2000. And despite being incredibly simplistic, the narrative also somehow managers to be overcomplicated at the same time. It even ends with an incredibly grim scene of John trying to turn himself into a Frankenstein after the happy times achieved with his comrades. Why? I don\'t know, but I wish he had done it before the thirty minute mark so I wouldn\'t have to hear him talk with that bad accent anymore.So let\'s recap this film, shall we?Story: A fucking mess.Characterization: A fucking mess.Visuals: As expected of the studio, if once again it\'s trying to be Attack on Titan.Entertainment Value: Almost none. The film is not funny apart from some unintentionally bad dubbing choices and it doesn\'t make me think at all. Without either of those elements to invite me in, the only thing I left the theater with as soon as the Egoist song played was a stone-cold expression and an hour-long train ride home in the middle of the night.', 'It\'s so sad to see how people misunderstood this masterpiece because well known names were used separately to whom they belong to.

It's very consistent in terms of the drawn sections of the anime the quality never really dropped in terms of that style. The problem is that there is multiple instances of CG used in the film which detracts a fair good amount from it's visuals. I still managed to appreciate it but clash of styles if very clear.Sound Design.A day from watching the event I can't remember any of the music that were used but there are definitely moments in the film that music definitely elevated scenes well and there are times when the director/editor...knew when not to use music.StoryThe story has a rather simple premise but the story doesn't rush its premise and shows you in depth what it's going to be about but still manages to not answer everything. The story goes to many different locations during the film moving from place to place to the point where it arguably could have stayed in locations for longer but none of the locations felt like they spent too long there. It's a film that has a few twists and turns and some of them can be on the obvious side if you've watched many Sci Fi classics.SettingSet in the latter half of the 1800s (1870s area) it does for the most part establish that well. It isn't like our version of that so there are several differences. I feel that some of the buildings shouldn't be as futuristic for the time that they are set in.CharactersThe characters are all to an extent archetypes of characters you already know. The Main character feels like your average main character that is rather smart (thought he doesn't show much of that during the film) though his name in popular culture would say otherwise. The film does focus more on story progression but the character do evolve slightly with the way that they are thinking.EnjoymentI enjoyed this film thoroughly but I did find a 5 minute section near the ending to be not as  entertaining as I would have liked. There is a constant struggle with the main character and his friend that does feel rather repetitive and by the 3rd time it happens I had a good indication what was roughly going to happen laterMiscUnfortunately I feel that the synopsis and character list slightly spoil/ruin the movie if and so I would recommend not reading that but I'm pretty that's going to convince most of you to read it. I watched this at the MCM Loves Anime event where everyone aside from me (aside from two girls who came back during the end) left during the credits of the film.They missed the epilogue that happened at the end of the credits which is important to see as it's important to know actually know what happens so remember to watch the credits or at least the last minute of it.OverallTo conclude it's a good film that I would recommend people to go watch. It has some repetitive moments but unfortunately the last 20 minutes seems to get a lot of people that watch it confused. If you don't pay too much attention to films then I can see why you could easily get confused as some things don't get explained twice though most things do. knew when not to use music.StoryThe story has a rather simple premise but the story doesn't rush its premise and shows you in depth what it's going to be about but still manages to not answer everything.

Set in an alternate Victorian era England where technology used to reanimate corpses has allowed for England's quick technological advance, corpse engineer John Watson illegally reanimates the corpse of his close friend and former partner, Friday. To avoid punishment for his crimes, Watson is given the mission of retrieving the journal of the famous Victor Frankenstein, whose records have information on potential advances in reanimation of corpses that could allow them to gain free will and the possible restoration of their original soul.Empire of...Corpses offers off a great balance of adventure and philosophical dilemmas in its focus on Watson's search for Frankenstein's journal. I'll dabble into the adventure aspect first as that will be more straightforward to discuss over the philosophical elements. Watson's search for the journal with his allies lead him to trek to Russia and Japan in search of its whereabouts. This provides some solid world building to exploring how these countries each make use of the reanimation technology and provide more exploration of what the contents of Frankenstein's journal would mean for the reanimation process. Some shocking plot twists come about with the revelations from the journal, as the series introduces a couple villains who have their own ulterior motives for using the journal's knowledge. One of them will be very familiar to those who have read Mary Shelly's novel and their motives play into the movie's philosophical themes very nicely. The other antagonist plays into more conventional territory with his motives where while a unique twist to standard “take over the world” motives of villainy, still comes off as cliched and less intriguing compared to the other notable villain of Empire of Corpses.The philosophical element that comes into play is regarding the corpses as sentient forms of life. Within the alternate world portrayed in Empire of Corpses, the corpses that serve humanity are regarded as little more than tools, much in the same vain that alternate futures portrayed in sci-fi anime would usually involve human treatment of robots. This is a moral dilemma faced by Watson throughout much of the film as he desires Frankenstein's journal to uncover a means to restore Friday's soul back to his body, yet comes to realize the flaws of such research when he discovers the ethical lines that are crossed when trying to produce a corpse having free will. The dilemma is further complicated by the emergence of one of the movie's villains who faces his own personal tragedy from the society established in the movie and seeks to correct it by any means, even if it risks the fall of humanity to do so. This sparks an interesting debate similar to what is portrayed within Mary Shelly's classic novel if one could consider our villain and the revived corpses to be humans or monsters. The movie ending wraps up this dilemma in an ambiguous matter intentionally to allow viewers to come to their own conclusions over how to justify the treatment of corpses and what defines a living being as man or monster.Visually, Empire of Corpses is an impressive-looking film that depicts steampunk-like settings with how life within the alternate reality of the movie gets depicted. Settings are drawn to be faithfully accurate to the time period in which the series is portrayed while mixed with steampunk elements that include the use of steam-powered technology and automatons that are major components to the world of the movie. The historical accuracy is also passed along to the type of dress that British and Japanese characters have around the time period, with a minor issue being Hadaly's style of dress clashing badly with public decency trends of the time with her cleavage being on prominent display. Animation is consistently fluid throughout the film from the movement of vehicles to the unnatural and disturbing slow walking of the reanimated corpses as they assist their masters and attack intruders or enemy threats.As a fair warning, this film is quite bloody and disturbing at many points with the integration of reanimated corpses into society and some nasty methods of death that take place as more of the plot regarding Frankenstein's diary gets unveiled, thus I would avoid showing this off to younger or more sensitive viewers. But if you have the stomach to handle this film's macabre themes and plot, Empire of Corpses offers an engaging adventure that dabbles into themes from Mary Shelly's Frankenstein in its own unique way and offers some surprising developments that Watson and his comrades encounter throughout their search for Frankenstein's diary.

So I was periodically looking up and that was how I watched entire thing for the first time. It seemed quite interesting. The art was decent and whatever was happening on the screen seemed very intriguing. But then recently I've decided to watch the whole thing properly. And God knows that was a mistake.While the premise of the world it is set in sounds interesting -...the writers did absolutely 0 with it. It seems as if the story and characters where written by a complete and utter amateur (probably drunk most of the time), who wanted something 'meaningful and philosophical' but ended with bat**it insane in the end. It does raise some questions, or, rather, throws them in the air and has them crash into absolutely painful to listen to dialogues, that leave you understanding less and less the longer the thing goes on.Characters - God Almighty, such badly written characters with completely and utterly nonsensical motivations is almost a wonder to behold. Only they weren't intended to be that, which is sad.And it throws in an android in for a good measure. Someone probably went like 'sure, we haven't achieved anything with the zombie concept, but lets add androids in as well, it will be fine'.In essence - if this premise was handed over to half competent people - this would have probably been a much better story.

Even the faces of the zombies were well animated.The world and setting was particularly interesting; Victorian-era steampunk London? Love it.-The BadThis show reminded me the most of Ghost in the Shell with its long expositions and ruminations on the nature of the soul, the seat of human consciousness, and self-awareness. Sadly, the story is nowhere near the quality of GiTS and is largely pretentious, incomprehensible and exasperating....-Stupid StoryThe central, critical flaw of this story is that the motivations of the characters were completely illogical and unbelievable. Whereas the setting may change, human beings and their motivations remain the same. In the present case, what we are stuck with are cardboard, paper thin characters who act in illogical ways to advance the story.In the original Frankenstein, Victor is driven by the death of his mother to experiment into the giving of life to the dead. In this story however, the characters have no such driving passion; it is never explained why all the scientists are so captivated by the idea that they willingly sacrifice their own lives, and more damningly, what purpose will their deaths serve. In all, I am given the distinct impression that the director/storywriter threw in as many of these meaningless grand gestures as possible in the mistaken belief that this will somehow add pathos to the story. It does not; instead the viewer is left scratching his/her head at the apparent stupidity of the people in that world.-ConclusionWatch this only if you have time to kill and are willing to enjoy the animation without giving thought to the story.

It does not; instead the viewer is left scratching his/her head at the apparent stupidity of the people in that world.-ConclusionWatch this only if you have time to kill and are willing to enjoy the animation without giving thought to the story. If you are the type who demands stories that make sense, give this a pass.', ""The premise to this is so good even the animaton and voice acting is superb yet this film fell flat on its face. Ive never seen so much potential in something that could've had so much depth wasted. The film has an inability to focus.It tries to do too much in a small time frame with too many characters and story lines that are either unnecessary or somewhat intresting but never explained and leaves you standing there like what was the point. The best thing about this film was Friday's and Watsons relationship that's what made the first 15 minutes of this movie good...and grabs your attention.The relationship was complicated. Friday is the corspe of Watsons deceased friend. And Watson has been trying to return Fridays soul and or find out if it still exist. You'd think that would be a good enough plot to focus on but nope not for these writers. They completely abandon the depth that they founded in the first 15 minutes of the movie for ridiculous bullshit.Friday and Watson somehow gets involved in Foreign affairs, ended up fighting Zombie terrorist o yeah read right ZOMBIE TERRORIST. Then at the end they battle the Frankenstein monster. I just couldnt believe something that could've been a masterpiece was wasted in such a horrible way it was like a completely different person with no writting skill whatsoever took over after the first 15 minutes it really is a crying shame. and grabs your attention.The relationship was complicated.

Yet I first got bothered by  the first proper dialog, in which the plot was presented in a manner which was unclear to me.Throughout the whole movie the conversations built around the progress of the plot...would be the most frustrating factor for me, since too often I was not quite sure in which direction the story was heading or what the incentive of the antagonists were.I find it a great shame that such a rich and promising story line fell short of its worth in its anime adaption. Yet I must commend the atmospheric value this film had with its melancholy and macabre feel and its harrowing setting which I thoroughly enjoyed.The art of this anime was its strongest point in my opinion, the animation is impeccable and the art design utterly beautiful. I especially loved the mechanical details and would consider this movie a treat to people who enjoy eye-candy as much as I do.The soundtrack to this film was pleasant and fitting yet nothing stood out to me as remarkable.My critique on the Characters range from both sides of the spectrum. On the one hand I liked the many different character designs that were created, used and invented upon. On the other hand I often thought the characters to be one dimensional and distant.At times it seemed as if the protagonist, John H. Watson, was somewhat detached even though it was evident that he was not supposed to be a cold character.Yet in other scenes he would show a great amount of emotion. It's a pity that his personality is this inconsistent since the emotional experience plays a big role in the enjoyment of this film due to the morals and philosophy of the story.I would have liked him to be more feeling throughout all of his scenes due to the inner impact they left.The degree to which Shisha no Teikoku entertains is based heavily upon whether you as an observer enjoy the genre or not and how much you value emotionally stimulating visuals and story lines.I myself adore Victorian Steampunk settings as much as I like to feel touched and mournful during a movie and am therefore quite biased towards this film.All in all even though I had a lot to criticize about this film I still enjoyed it very much and would definitely consider re watching it for its stunning visuals and the emotional turmoil it sent me through. would be the most frustrating factor for me, since too often I was not quite sure in which direction the story was heading or what the incentive of the antagonists were.I find it a great shame that such a rich and promising story line fell short of its worth in its anime adaption.

First off, if you\'re thinking of giving it a whirl, do yourself a favor and avoid the DUB like it\'s last year\'s expired milk. The accents they attempted? Yikes. Felt like they were juggling too many balls, dropped a few, and decided to keep juggling.As for the plot, imagine Swiss cheese. You got it: holey. I mean, there are moments when you think it\'s onto something profound, and then BAM! It throws you a curveball that has you thinking, ""Wait, what?"" It\'s like the movie itself is on...a wild goose chase trying to figure out what it wants to be.All in all, it\'s not the worst way to kill a couple of hours, but if you\'re setting your expectations sky-high, maybe lower that bar a smidge. Or a lot. I was hyped, maybe too much, and well... let\'s just say I\'ve seen better. If you\'ve got popcorn and a blank evening, give it a shot – just keep those expectations chill. a wild goose chase trying to figure out what it wants to be.All in all, it\'s not the worst way to kill a couple of hours, but if you\'re setting your expectations sky-high, maybe lower that bar a smidge.

My choice of scores are pretty much the same as the people who rated this a low overall score. Also, this is my second time watching this after a year because everything that happened in the first viewing went over my head.There is a deep philosophical discussion that...can be made of one of the themes: what makes us human? Or in other words, what makes a soul? They explicitly say that if anything has language, it has a consious ( I disagree but that isn\'t my point in this paragraph). I just hate how producers think that if they put some deep philosophical aspect, they can be lazy with the rest of the movie, show, book, etc in terms of story. I felt like all the main characters were just a form of media to speak upon the author\'s view on this theme. The whole time is just characters saying what they believe in and then some action happens. Its as if the transition from book to movie was physically stuck in the process and the characters are half-book and there just to read out loud. I personally am not too critical on things like movies and books anymore because it makes the enjoyment go down but this movie just made me sigh at times and forced me to criticize it negatively. To sum this up: I hate it when shows are trying to be profound but awkwardly force deep concepts without trying to make their story any good.You know the story sucks when you boil it down without trying to boil it down when trying to remember what happened. Good stories and bad stories can all be boiled down and all be the same. This is defines an archetype. What separates a good movie and a bad one is the creativity that can make a story seem unique and memorable. In this movie, all I can remember that happened was: a guy reanimated his friend to find out what a soul is, he got found out so he had to go on a mission to prevent punishment, his mission is to find notes that can help his research, action happens, he finds the notes, characters babble about half-assed philosophy, villain (both) wants to use the notes to kill all of humanity for some dumbass reason, main characters stop them, they babble some more, no real conclusion. You really have to pay attention to every word they say to understand what\'s going on because it seems like the producer does not know how to properly tell a story without making the characters explicitly say what\'s going on at each part. A good story has to have good and creative transitions to the next scene. This does not have that.The reason why I even came across this movie was because of Egoist, a band I like that composed the ending song. In my opinion, the best part of the movie was the ending credits (LOL). I haven\'t read the book but I feel as if this movie missed a lot of key parts that made this story enjoyable because people seem to enjoy the book series. I read Harmony, one of Project Itoh\'s other stories, and probably enjoyed the movie more than I should have. Now that I am thinking more about that movie, I think that Harmony suffered the same exact problems as this movie in the sense of contrived conversations of philosophy and generic story line. Both movies only seemed good in the trailer because of the art and hint of the deep societal themes. These movies are, in my opinion, ""Oscar Bait"".

Knowing that this anime is having an EGOIST song as their ending, I quickly clicked for this anime movie. This is an anime produced by WIT Studio, Empire of Corpses or Shisha no TeikokuWhile the premise of this anime is very unique and the progression is pretty good, I found the ending is a bit disappointing. The ending is not as grand as what I have thought in the beginning of the movie and left me with a feeling of ""What? Why?"" just because it...is a little bit rushed in their way to the major villain\'s reveal. Most maybe caused by the travels that supposed to feel a little bit longer in that time feels too much fast like they were travelling with planes which was not invented back then. It was not immersive. I think the best way to fix this is to make the travels a bit longer and that\'s why the first half is better than the last half.Which that leads us to the character building of this anime. I think almost all of the character is not fully built and I think it as a major flaw caused by how the story flows. I felt like Friday and Watson\'s background was not explored enough to make us attached to them even they are the main characters of this anime. It is a bit saddening since I really wanted to know more about Friday and Watson\'s relationship before Friday\'s supposed death.The soundtrack is pretty epic for their action sequences but I think the most impressive is the ending by EGOIST which has this vibe of mystery and made the anime ended with more mystery lurking around it.Overall, I think this anime have so much things to be patched with. Since the world build has been done so well, this anime have a great potential but ultimately wasted it in the last half of the anime.

You still should give it a try, though.', 'We’ve all heard the story of Victor Frankenstein and his creation, which often gets mistaken for him. Some versions tell of his monster dancing to Puttin’ on the Ritz, some versions tell of his monster battling an ancient order of gargoyles, and some versions tell of his monster’s daughter attending high school with other Halloween Bratz rejects. But what no version of this classic story has ever told you is that the old doctor was only the first person to successfully reanimate a corpse. His creation could move on it’s own, it could speak, it could make decisions for itself, it could promote strawberry cereal......But aside from the doctor, nobody could replicate this feat. By the 1800s, technological necromancy was so popular that the soulless, silent husks of the departed had been relegated to the roles of menial workers, performing simple tasks for their fleshy masters, just like at the end of Shaun of the Dead. It was seen as impossible to imbue a reanimated corpse(they’re VERY specific about avoiding the zed word) with a soul, thus the Doctor and his creation became the stuff of legends.Much like Nikola Tesla, Dr. Frankenstein never released his revolutionary methods to the public, and he and his creation have unfortunately disappeared into time. While it’s entirely possible that the old doctor is living it up in Storybrook and getting freaky with Snow White, and that his monster, labelled by history as “The One” is off somewhere battling other monsters on the side of a bunch of obnoxious children, history has marched on, with all soul reanimation research becoming illegal in Great Britain. Cut to relatively present times, where a young Dr. John Watson has undertaken the not-so-elementary task of figuring out the old Doctor’s work. With a freshly reanimated corpse working as his close assistant, he picks up a bunch of... People... Who join his journey because of... Reasons... As they all push forward on an Unexpected journey to find Doctor Frankenstein’s notes and bring a real soul into the body of his deceased... Friend? I think? And in orer to get it, he’ll brave any number of savage, flesh eating totally-not-zombie hordes, even as they spontaneously combust in his face. But sooner rather than later, he’ll have to ask himself... Who are the true monsters?I’ve said before that Production IG is one of the most solid you’ll find, as they tend to produce some of the best looking anime of their time(and a few bombs, but it’s still a really impressive ratio). Empire of Corpses unfortunately wasn’t made by Production IG, at least not on paper. It was produced by Wit Studio, which is a smaller studio founded by producers from IG, so it’s basically the Touchstone to IG’s Disney. This smaller studio was actually founded very recently, as it’s first known work was released in 2013, and that was of course the original Attack on Titan. Despite it’s overblown reputation, Titan wasn’t the best looking anime, as used a handful of budget saving tricks to maximize it’s visual quality, but they were all somewhat noticeable and distracting, and the thick outlines didn’t help either. Empire of corpses is a decent improvement over this method, because while there wasn’t a huge increase in budget between the two shows, Empire ia a lot better at hiding it’s flaws and shortcuts.One thing I noticed about this film in terms of quality control is how a good chunk of the budget was spent on actions scenes, most of which take place in bright daylight, and they paved the way for this by spending a lot of the film’s run time in the dark, using heavy shadows and CG fog effects to hide what would have looked a lot cheaper upon closer and more well-lit inspection. Over-all, the animation looks solid enough to be above complaint. People move as much as they need to, and they never really freeze in the background. The animation is pretty good, but the artwork is nothing short of exquisite. The character designs are a little on the generic side, and that goes for both the living AND the undead, but they’re still polished and consistently on-model enough. The lighting and shading are meticulously realistic, the coloring in the darker and more intense scenes is satisfyingly eerie, and the backgrounds are beautifully designed and atmospheric, and trust me, there are a ton of backgrounds in this movie.There’s a lot of travel between different countries in this film, including what I believe were many different setting across America, England, India, Russia and Japan, and the level of detail is mind numbing all across the board. Far off shots reveal entire towns, lit by fire and the earliest gasps of technology against the night sky, and the chaos of thousands of people dealing with the onslaught of their once docile reanimated servants is captured beautifully in all it’s carnage. The intricacies get even more elaborate as we explore a number of indoor locations, such as a Japanese chemical company and the Tower of London, where 2D and 3D animation are flawlessly combined to show off technological environments that are guaranteed to ignite the fancies of any steampunk fan who happens to be watching. There’s also simpler settings, like the cozy interior of the USS Richmond, any number of towns the cast has to pass through, and several real life geographical locations. All in all, this film did a hell of a job in the visual department.The English dub is also quite commendable, with the adaptive script from John Burgmeier of course being respectful to the source material, although whether or not that’s a good thing is up to you. The dialogue for this movie is overloaded with exposition and long winded explanations, and while that kind of thing is hard to make up for through adaptation, the actors still manage to rise above the material they’ve been given. Jason Leibricht is the voice you’ll hear the most, and while the chunks of dialogue he gets can occasionally be tiresome, he doesn’t sound like he’s just reading it from a cue card, either. It sounds like he’s in character, talking to us in his natural voice, and while that doesn’t entirely make up for the material, it’s easily the best anybody could have done with it. This is especially impressive from him because, in the Japanese, the narrator and John Watson were played by different people, but he takes all of it on himself. And thankfully, when the explanations are set aside, he does a fantastic job emoting in his more story-driven scenes.But speaking of emoting, you really have to give it up for Todd Haberkorn, who plays the mostly mute character Friday, and in order to perform his wordless grunts and attempted vocalizations, he had to call upon a level of voice control that I haven’t heard out of anybody other than Brittany Karbowski, who I’d previously dubbed as the queen of in-character suffering. He brings the necessary elements of pain and tragedy to the character, and even when he does get to speak, he winds up doing so on two different occasions, using two equally perfect accents... British and Russian. J Michael Tatum is a joy to listen to with his gruff, charming cockney accent, sounding like a guy you just wanna go get a beer with. Mike McFarland and Micah Solusod don’t get a lot of screen time, but they still put forth admirable Russian accents, and Morgan Garrett plays the British femme fatale Hadalay like she was born to be a mysterious Bond girl. Greg Dulcie sounds convincing as former president Ulysses S Grant, and R Bruce Elliot plays a cool yet incredibly intimidating take on Frankenstein’s classic monster. Solid English dub all around, can’t recommend it enough.Now, when I hear the name Empire of Corpses, and then someone tells me that it’s a story loosely connected to the Frankenstein mythos, the first image that ops into my head is a bit more of a metaphorical take on that title than we actually get. I picture in my head that moment from Berserk when Griffith is just realizing how many people have died for him to get as far as he has, how many more he’ll have to kill to get there, and just how many deaths will have been wasted if he turns back and gives up. The idea of pairing that image with a follower of Dr. Frankenstein in a world where reanimated corpses are a societal norm opens up a slew of tantalizing possibilities, quite a few of which had me eager to sit down and see if all of this movie’s poor reviews were really indicative of it’s potential. I didn’t get quite what I was expecting from it, but that also doesn’t mean there wasn’t some potential in what I DID get. Instead of a dark character study on an insane genius losing his grip on reality, we get a mostly sane-minded scientist getting scooped up on a Hobbit-style journey alongside other individuals with their own relationships to reanimation science and their opinions on how to use it.Is that a bad scenario? No, not at all. The exploration of an idea through the different perspectives of a number of unique, diverse characters can often result in some really enjoyable think pieces, especially if there’s action and in-fighting to challenge them and a dark mystery going on below the surface to increase the stakes of the story. So why is it that out of four entire attempts to watch this film all the way through, I wound up falling asleep every single time? Sometimes multiple times? Well, two of the movie’s huge problems are evident right at the beginning. Not even ten minutes into the film, we’ve already been given two mutually exclusive expository monologues from the main character, one being about his work and the other being about the world the story is taking place in, how Dr. Frankenstein’s work has affected the world as it is, and especially the way it’s affected the warfare of the times. Exposition in a movie can be tiresome at the best of times, with the obligatory Star Wars text scroll being on the high end, but this just keeps going on and on.And the other problem may not be as prevalent, but it’s far more damaging to the story... We see Watson reanimate Friday, his new corpse servant, but we’re not given any ideas as to who Friday was, what relationship he had to Watson, OR why we’re supposed to care about him being given a soul. We find out around the hour mark that he’s Watson’s former partner and he volunteered to be resurrected upon his death, but at no point are we given any reason to want him to become whole again, which makes all of the trouble they go through to achieve this end feel kind of meaningless. We’re given plenty of reasons to want Ed Elric to get his brother’s soul back, because we knew Alphonse as a child, and we were all given ample time and reason to fall in love with him. On the contrary, you take a movie like Logan, where Professor X is elderly and suffering from dementia, turning his mind into a deadly weapon of mass destruction, and every tragedy that Wolverine’s caring for him causes... Including the slaughter of an entire family that he insisted on visiting... Just winds up feeling like the consequences of pursuing a really bad idea, even though it’s not presented as such.It’s hard to not feel that way when John Watson’s dedication to bringing life back to Friday winds up causing untold death and destruction, including a scene where Friday literally loses control and murders a random young woman in the street, and you don’t know enough about their previous relationship to address extremely potent questions like whether or not this quest was worth pursuing in the first place, and whether or not just letting the poor zombie die and ending said quest in it’s tracks would be for the better. I might have been able to get behind his resurrection and Watson’s steadfast resolve if the two of them were best friends, going all the way back to childhood with a dependence on one another. Hell, if they were previously lovers, that would make it even more compelling. But if we as the audience aren’t given a reason to care, why the hell should we WANT to see Friday resurrected with all of this destruction lying in his wake? All of the bad things that happen in the film are unequivocally Watson’s fault, so we’d better be getting a satisfying resolution out of it.But all of that isn’t the reason I kept falling asleep. See, this movie’s overall story just isn’t engaging. At all. I know I said that the people in charge of animating and dubbing were on the top of their game, but between the writer and the director, somebody made a bunch of embarrassingly amateurish mistakes, and I’m not just talking about forgetting to mark large passages of time, like a year long time skip towards the middle of the film... although that did happen. The structure is sloppy from beginning to end, to the point that I honestly wasn’t surprised that it was based on a novel, because I normally only see execution this bad when people are trying to cram entire books into a 2 hour format. I haven’t read the original novel, nor do I intend to, but the movie feels like someone set out to hit all the important plot points of the story, and in doing so, found they had to sacrifice everything that wasn’t necessary to the outline. This would explain why the pacing was so bad, with the story jumping from scene to scene at a breakneck speed, with little attempt to ease the viewer through each major scene conversion.It also probably explains why there is literally... Yes, I mean literally... No character development throughout the entire film. Oh, you learn things about the characters you didn’t know before, and you get to see them react to different events, but you never see anybody develop. I don’t mind if one or two characters are the same at the end as they were in the beginning, especially when there’s an in-universe explanation like in Steins;Gate, but everybody? They relegate months worth of traveling together and getting to know each other and learning about each other into a brief montage, then they expect you to care when two characters suddenly get killed off. Oh no, the guy who looks like that and had that voice got killed both by and alongside the guy who just showed up a couple of minutes ago to dump exposition on us, how will we ever replace them? Oh, I know, we’ll replace them with a brand new random character who’ll stick with us a little while and then ALSO disappear from the film completely!There’s groundwork for a decent message about the importance of equality, as the reanimated corpses are being used as slaves and servants for the more fortunate, and I figured this was intentional from the fact that the main cast was British and a lot of the corpses were Indian, but several events and revelations in the third act that I don’t want to get into kind of squashed that potential for depth into the dirt. Oh, but speaking of the third act, here’s something interesting about the movie’s climax... It’s a rip-off of two separate anime combined into one... Fullmetal Alchemist, and Evangelion! Oh yeah, it starts out as a rip-off of the big Philosopher’s Stone reveal, and it swerves headfirst right into a rip-off of the human Instrumentality project! That’s what all of this was leading to! That’s what all of this emotionally bankrupt action and dialogue that was at least seventy-five percent full of exposition was leading to. Also, and I hate to bring this up so late in the review, but if the walking dead in this universe are created through science, why does their bite create more of them? Consistency, people.Empire of corpses is available from Funimation. While the original novel is not available stateside... Or at least, I can’t find it... His other novels, including Harmony, Genocidal Organ and a novelization of Meta Gear solid: Guns oif the Patriots, are available from Viz Media, are. The movie versions of Harmony and Genocidal Organ are also available on DVD from Funimation.Okay, I know I went off on this movie for being badly written and devoid of any emotional resonance, but honestly, I still kind of recommend checking it out. It’s not every day you get to see zombies that have been turned into suicidal biological bombs, there’s quite a few interesting ideas on display, and when the director really wanted to buckle down and get you invested in a scene, it can at least be entertaining, if only in those few scenes. It’s also worth watching for the outstanding visual quality and the top notch English dub, but don’t misunderstand me, this movie just isn’t very good, and it’s attempts to weave a connected history through Thomas Edison, Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Frankenstein, President Grant and even the Bond films feels more like a poorly planned experiment than an expanded universe. It’s hard for me to fully get behind a movie that I can’t for the life of me stay awake through, but it does have some merits. You may need an energy drink to get through it, but personally, I don’t regret seeing it. I give Empire of corpses a 4/10. But aside from the doctor, nobody could replicate this feat.

While it’s entirely possible that the old doctor is living it up in Storybrook and getting freaky with Snow White, and that his monster, labelled by history as “The One” is off somewhere battling other monsters on the side of a bunch of obnoxious children, history has marched on, with all soul reanimation research becoming illegal in Great Britain. Cut to relatively present times, where a young Dr. John Watson has undertaken the not-so-elementary task of figuring out the old Doctor’s work. With a freshly reanimated corpse working as his close assistant, he picks up a bunch of... People... Who join his journey because of... Reasons... As they all push forward on an Unexpected journey to find Doctor Frankenstein’s notes and bring a real soul into the body of his deceased... Friend? I think? And in orer to get it, he’ll brave any number of savage, flesh eating totally-not-zombie hordes, even as they spontaneously combust in his face. But sooner rather than later, he’ll have to ask himself... Who are the true monsters?I’ve said before that Production IG is one of the most solid you’ll find, as they tend to produce some of the best looking anime of their time(and a few bombs, but it’s still a really impressive ratio). Empire of Corpses unfortunately wasn’t made by Production IG, at least not on paper. It was produced by Wit Studio, which is a smaller studio founded by producers from IG, so it’s basically the Touchstone to IG’s Disney. This smaller studio was actually founded very recently, as it’s first known work was released in 2013, and that was of course the original Attack on Titan. Despite it’s overblown reputation, Titan wasn’t the best looking anime, as used a handful of budget saving tricks to maximize it’s visual quality, but they were all somewhat noticeable and distracting, and the thick outlines didn’t help either. Empire of corpses is a decent improvement over this method, because while there wasn’t a huge increase in budget between the two shows, Empire ia a lot better at hiding it’s flaws and shortcuts.One thing I noticed about this film in terms of quality control is how a good chunk of the budget was spent on actions scenes, most of which take place in bright daylight, and they paved the way for this by spending a lot of the film’s run time in the dark, using heavy shadows and CG fog effects to hide what would have looked a lot cheaper upon closer and more well-lit inspection. Over-all, the animation looks solid enough to be above complaint. People move as much as they need to, and they never really freeze in the background. The animation is pretty good, but the artwork is nothing short of exquisite. The character designs are a little on the generic side, and that goes for both the living AND the undead, but they’re still polished and consistently on-model enough. The lighting and shading are meticulously realistic, the coloring in the darker and more intense scenes is satisfyingly eerie, and the backgrounds are beautifully designed and atmospheric, and trust me, there are a ton of backgrounds in this movie.There’s a lot of travel between different countries in this film, including what I believe were many different setting across America, England, India, Russia and Japan, and the level of detail is mind numbing all across the board. Far off shots reveal entire towns, lit by fire and the earliest gasps of technology against the night sky, and the chaos of thousands of people dealing with the onslaught of their once docile reanimated servants is captured beautifully in all it’s carnage. The intricacies get even more elaborate as we explore a number of indoor locations, such as a Japanese chemical company and the Tower of London, where 2D and 3D animation are flawlessly combined to show off technological environments that are guaranteed to ignite the fancies of any steampunk fan who happens to be watching. There’s also simpler settings, like the cozy interior of the USS Richmond, any number of towns the cast has to pass through, and several real life geographical locations. All in all, this film did a hell of a job in the visual department.The English dub is also quite commendable, with the adaptive script from John Burgmeier of course being respectful to the source material, although whether or not that’s a good thing is up to you. The dialogue for this movie is overloaded with exposition and long winded explanations, and while that kind of thing is hard to make up for through adaptation, the actors still manage to rise above the material they’ve been given. Jason Leibricht is the voice you’ll hear the most, and while the chunks of dialogue he gets can occasionally be tiresome, he doesn’t sound like he’s just reading it from a cue card, either. It sounds like he’s in character, talking to us in his natural voice, and while that doesn’t entirely make up for the material, it’s easily the best anybody could have done with it. This is especially impressive from him because, in the Japanese, the narrator and John Watson were played by different people, but he takes all of it on himself. And thankfully, when the explanations are set aside, he does a fantastic job emoting in his more story-driven scenes.But speaking of emoting, you really have to give it up for Todd Haberkorn, who plays the mostly mute character Friday, and in order to perform his wordless grunts and attempted vocalizations, he had to call upon a level of voice control that I haven’t heard out of anybody other than Brittany Karbowski, who I’d previously dubbed as the queen of in-character suffering. He brings the necessary elements of pain and tragedy to the character, and even when he does get to speak, he winds up doing so on two different occasions, using two equally perfect accents... British and Russian. J Michael Tatum is a joy to listen to with his gruff, charming cockney accent, sounding like a guy you just wanna go get a beer with. Mike McFarland and Micah Solusod don’t get a lot of screen time, but they still put forth admirable Russian accents, and Morgan Garrett plays the British femme fatale Hadalay like she was born to be a mysterious Bond girl. Greg Dulcie sounds convincing as former president Ulysses S Grant, and R Bruce Elliot plays a cool yet incredibly intimidating take on Frankenstein’s classic monster. Solid English dub all around, can’t recommend it enough.Now, when I hear the name Empire of Corpses, and then someone tells me that it’s a story loosely connected to the Frankenstein mythos, the first image that ops into my head is a bit more of a metaphorical take on that title than we actually get. I picture in my head that moment from Berserk when Griffith is just realizing how many people have died for him to get as far as he has, how many more he’ll have to kill to get there, and just how many deaths will have been wasted if he turns back and gives up. The idea of pairing that image with a follower of Dr. Frankenstein in a world where reanimated corpses are a societal norm opens up a slew of tantalizing possibilities, quite a few of which had me eager to sit down and see if all of this movie’s poor reviews were really indicative of it’s potential. I didn’t get quite what I was expecting from it, but that also doesn’t mean there wasn’t some potential in what I DID get. Instead of a dark character study on an insane genius losing his grip on reality, we get a mostly sane-minded scientist getting scooped up on a Hobbit-style journey alongside other individuals with their own relationships to reanimation science and their opinions on how to use it.Is that a bad scenario? No, not at all. The exploration of an idea through the different perspectives of a number of unique, diverse characters can often result in some really enjoyable think pieces, especially if there’s action and in-fighting to challenge them and a dark mystery going on below the surface to increase the stakes of the story. So why is it that out of four entire attempts to watch this film all the way through, I wound up falling asleep every single time? Sometimes multiple times? Well, two of the movie’s huge problems are evident right at the beginning. Not even ten minutes into the film, we’ve already been given two mutually exclusive expository monologues from the main character, one being about his work and the other being about the world the story is taking place in, how Dr. Frankenstein’s work has affected the world as it is, and especially the way it’s affected the warfare of the times. Exposition in a movie can be tiresome at the best of times, with the obligatory Star Wars text scroll being on the high end, but this just keeps going on and on.And the other problem may not be as prevalent, but it’s far more damaging to the story... We see Watson reanimate Friday, his new corpse servant, but we’re not given any ideas as to who Friday was, what relationship he had to Watson, OR why we’re supposed to care about him being given a soul. We find out around the hour mark that he’s Watson’s former partner and he volunteered to be resurrected upon his death, but at no point are we given any reason to want him to become whole again, which makes all of the trouble they go through to achieve this end feel kind of meaningless. We’re given plenty of reasons to want Ed Elric to get his brother’s soul back, because we knew Alphonse as a child, and we were all given ample time and reason to fall in love with him. On the contrary, you take a movie like Logan, where Professor X is elderly and suffering from dementia, turning his mind into a deadly weapon of mass destruction, and every tragedy that Wolverine’s caring for him causes... Including the slaughter of an entire family that he insisted on visiting... Just winds up feeling like the consequences of pursuing a really bad idea, even though it’s not presented as such.It’s hard to not feel that way when John Watson’s dedication to bringing life back to Friday winds up causing untold death and destruction, including a scene where Friday literally loses control and murders a random young woman in the street, and you don’t know enough about their previous relationship to address extremely potent questions like whether or not this quest was worth pursuing in the first place, and whether or not just letting the poor zombie die and ending said quest in it’s tracks would be for the better. I might have been able to get behind his resurrection and Watson’s steadfast resolve if the two of them were best friends, going all the way back to childhood with a dependence on one another. Hell, if they were previously lovers, that would make it even more compelling. But if we as the audience aren’t given a reason to care, why the hell should we WANT to see Friday resurrected with all of this destruction lying in his wake? All of the bad things that happen in the film are unequivocally Watson’s fault, so we’d better be getting a satisfying resolution out of it.But all of that isn’t the reason I kept falling asleep. See, this movie’s overall story just isn’t engaging. At all. I know I said that the people in charge of animating and dubbing were on the top of their game, but between the writer and the director, somebody made a bunch of embarrassingly amateurish mistakes, and I’m not just talking about forgetting to mark large passages of time, like a year long time skip towards the middle of the film... although that did happen. The structure is sloppy from beginning to end, to the point that I honestly wasn’t surprised that it was based on a novel, because I normally only see execution this bad when people are trying to cram entire books into a 2 hour format. I haven’t read the original novel, nor do I intend to, but the movie feels like someone set out to hit all the important plot points of the story, and in doing so, found they had to sacrifice everything that wasn’t necessary to the outline. This would explain why the pacing was so bad, with the story jumping from scene to scene at a breakneck speed, with little attempt to ease the viewer through each major scene conversion.It also probably explains why there is literally... Yes, I mean literally... No character development throughout the entire film. Oh, you learn things about the characters you didn’t know before, and you get to see them react to different events, but you never see anybody develop. I don’t mind if one or two characters are the same at the end as they were in the beginning, especially when there’s an in-universe explanation like in Steins;Gate, but everybody? They relegate months worth of traveling together and getting to know each other and learning about each other into a brief montage, then they expect you to care when two characters suddenly get killed off. Oh no, the guy who looks like that and had that voice got killed both by and alongside the guy who just showed up a couple of minutes ago to dump exposition on us, how will we ever replace them? Oh, I know, we’ll replace them with a brand new random character who’ll stick with us a little while and then ALSO disappear from the film completely!There’s groundwork for a decent message about the importance of equality, as the reanimated corpses are being used as slaves and servants for the more fortunate, and I figured this was intentional from the fact that the main cast was British and a lot of the corpses were Indian, but several events and revelations in the third act that I don’t want to get into kind of squashed that potential for depth into the dirt. Oh, but speaking of the third act, here’s something interesting about the movie’s climax... It’s a rip-off of two separate anime combined into one... Fullmetal Alchemist, and Evangelion! Oh yeah, it starts out as a rip-off of the big Philosopher’s Stone reveal, and it swerves headfirst right into a rip-off of the human Instrumentality project! That’s what all of this was leading to! That’s what all of this emotionally bankrupt action and dialogue that was at least seventy-five percent full of exposition was leading to. Also, and I hate to bring this up so late in the review, but if the walking dead in this universe are created through science, why does their bite create more of them? Consistency, people.Empire of corpses is available from Funimation. While the original novel is not available stateside... Or at least, I can’t find it... His other novels, including Harmony, Genocidal Organ and a novelization of Meta Gear solid: Guns oif the Patriots, are available from Viz Media, are. The movie versions of Harmony and Genocidal Organ are also available on DVD from Funimation.Okay, I know I went off on this movie for being badly written and devoid of any emotional resonance, but honestly, I still kind of recommend checking it out. It’s not every day you get to see zombies that have been turned into suicidal biological bombs, there’s quite a few interesting ideas on display, and when the director really wanted to buckle down and get you invested in a scene, it can at least be entertaining, if only in those few scenes. It’s also worth watching for the outstanding visual quality and the top notch English dub, but don’t misunderstand me, this movie just isn’t very good, and it’s attempts to weave a connected history through Thomas Edison, Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Frankenstein, President Grant and even the Bond films feels more like a poorly planned experiment than an expanded universe. It’s hard for me to fully get behind a movie that I can’t for the life of me stay awake through, but it does have some merits. You may need an energy drink to get through it, but personally, I don’t regret seeing it. I give Empire of corpses a 4/10.', 'The first half was great. Original, good story, decent characters. Then it started to fall apart. This screams ""We read history, but don\'t know the culture!"" It\'s just plain idiotic in many places. Second half: Some of the animation is just terrible - it looks like they switched writers and animators midway. Example - noses look like boulders. Hadaly Lilith\'s chest profile when she\'s at the helm looks like a 12 year old was the artist - literally sticking a foot out from the front and resembling Hot-Wheel ramps. So idiotic it was distracting, and not in a good way. It soon becomes ""Forrest Gumpish""...- let\'s see how many famous names and people we can stick in this crumbling mess.Why the change from almost believable technology to friggin all out magic?

I first came across the movie as ""The Empire of Corpses"" and I dare say that my brain burns from trying to understand from scene to scene. Probably thinking that it is just me that does not understand, but man, I give the show a nine overall. Watching it more, I changed it to a ten.Alrighty! So starting off with the story:RATE: 8The story seen as a whole is great but then watching from beginning to end is a brain exercise....Perhaps it is a challenge of intellect. In the beginning, a brief idea is told to the fourth wall about the empire of corpses. I would presume because, by giving a brief intro, the info gave light to what exactly am I supposed to hope of what happens and happened. The story starts off with keying in on the main character (Watson) bringing back his valuable research to light called Friday. It is hinted later on about why Friday is valuable and what exactly is the point of the story of Dr. Watson! Sci-Fi is huge in this very aspect because of the journey that Dr. Watson was \'fated\' to have since the very beginning of his research and experiments. The journey is built off of Frankenstein\'s story and I believe was inputted into finding the theories of life through The Empire of Corpses (corpses and souls). Basically, the story is filled with one man\'s theory and his journey to set things straight (a journey of truth). Flashbacks in the story jumps around a lot and takes its time so that might be a reason why some parts of the story were hard to keep up with. At times, ""what the hell is going on?!"" because it is like watching one of those very old video tape shows that go on without sounds but only sound effects.ArtRATE: 9The Empire of Corpses deserves a nine in art because it is a beautiful animation and why I have sufficed in re-watching more than ten times. Movements and scenes are vivid to me. The colors that are used is monochromatic at most and produces a strong stench of reality. Why do I say strong stench? Well, the show has blood, definitely. And if you ever get that feeling that you see or smell something in the air that so much is happening. Aha, more likely a feeling but the touch of reality is what gets me going. Not really slice-of-life but the art touches a lot with of how the scenes are to be interpreted. Even in the background, there are many things going on. All what more else I can say about the art is that it is terror, emphasis, and hope. That is what I saw throughout watching.SoundRATE: 8Sounds went well with the story because I felt it was befitting due to the sadness and terrors of death and adventure.CharacterRATE: 7The characters were a surprise and seem to have no point yet, its an anime, so it has to be somewhere. But between that somewhere, the characters seems to be poorly brought up because of lack in understanding what goes on quick enough in the story. The design of the characters seem fairly well though too, I would say Friday is my favorite because he is a key point of understanding the show. Rewatching makes me feel for Friday because the movie is truly beautiful (if you are philosophical enough to understand). The characters themselves hold a lot of questions.EnjoymentRATE: 6Eh. It was only finely fair. This is because of trying to understand so much, it kind of killed the enjoyment and yet it is great to rewatch and decipher what the empire of corpses is trying to say. The Empire of Corpses seemed slow at first but the interesting characters were able to bring in heat of war and scientific research. I liked that. And yet, just a 6.OverallRATE: 10Personally, now, the movie seems outstanding because watching the show open minded, it provides a lot of opportunities to really think and admire of what is going on and how the connections between characters unfold. Also, watch the ending credits! It has more good info that some people tend to skip. Every piece of the show is valuable towards understanding it. Perhaps it is a challenge of intellect.

But nah, not all expectations come true and it is reaLly disappointing. I don\'t know if I\'m just stupid not to understand what this movie is trying to say. Watching this movie, I can\'t count the number of times I hope that all the questions will be answered in the end. All the disturbing,...confusing statements will be explained, but it left me hanging. Well, there is the fact that the story tackles an economy where the main source of manpower is zombies.

Now the protagonists of the story go to an adventure, finding a way on how the soul of a human go back to its body after dying. It\'s cool, the idea is kind of unique and at the same time, exciting. How the creator used different famous names on this movie is also something. However, the whole scenarios of the movie, in my opinion, will fail the expectation of the audience. It will left them speechless of how confusing it is.Characters: 6/10I\'m really feeling bad rating an anime low. I love anime but maybe, maybe there\'s really stories that won\'t fit my taste. Characters supposed this grow, to justify their actions, to learn, even if a litte. The main character of this movie is cool. A doctor of the dead, someone who know how to bring dead people back to life.But how he focused on a one dead person, who\'s relationship with him is unknown and never been explained, is unsatisfying. If I were to decide, maybe he\'s a gay lover of the main character. The other girl did have a purpose all along the movie, additional point on that. Lastly, the one guy who tagged and help him on his journey did not really have an explanation on his actions. Why was he helping him? What does he wanted? What was his goal? It was never explained and will never be.Sound and Animation: 10/10In line with sound and animation, it\'s perfect. It\'s clean and great. The voices of the characters are strong, steady and will full grasp of the characters they\'re portraying. The animation is one of the best.

Dr. Watson, who the film confirms is the same Watson as from the Sherlock Holmes novels via a post-credit scene that takes place four years after the film, turns his best friend into a zombie called Friday based on the technology created by Victor Frankenstein.

The execution, however, was extremely lackluster.Objective Review:Usually, any story is driven by either the characters, story, or some underlying theme that seems to work (for example, comedy). All these driving factors tend to work hand-in-hand, the best stories incorporating multiple and sticking with one main driver.Shisha no Teikoku is definitely story-driven. What brings it down is the unsatisfactory character thought processes and disappointing lack of personality depth. It also suffers from not being able to convey its main themes to the audience on a personal level. The movie brings so much potential to character development,...themes, and consequently the story, but fails to deliver due to spreading itself thin over time and prioritizing action-packed scenes over quality.The movie also suffers a case of ""pulling science out of my @$$"", and ""magic, motherf****"". Sure, the technology is EXTREMELY fictional, but it should have its limits. When the story was stalled somewhat and was slightly getting stale, it (and subsequently the producers ) decide to spice things up by adding elements which felt  out of place given its setting.I wouldn\'t recommend this to anyone personally. It leaves too many questions and loose ends unanswered and fails to engage the audience emotionally and intellectually. themes, and consequently the story, but fails to deliver due to spreading itself thin over time and prioritizing action-packed scenes over quality.The movie also suffers a case of ""pulling science out of my @$$"", and ""magic, motherf****"".

It leaves too many questions and loose ends unanswered and fails to engage the audience emotionally and intellectually.', ""I don't normally write reviews, but I wanted to throw in a positive one for this anime. Seems like it's pretty heavily underrated here and I'm not sure why. The story is a basic one: MC seeks to bring his boyfriend back from the dead and goes on a road trip with companions in pursuit of his goal. He gets caught up in the political and philosophical struggle of other groups attempting to obtain the 'bring-people-back-from-the-dead' technology for themselves. Pretty standard stuff; not sure why people are tripping up on it. Except for the ending, which I'll mention below.General:The-- I'll call it a movie;...I think it was originally released as an OVA, but it fits the movie format better-- was way above my expectations. I watched it because I thought it might be bland fujo-bait with light BL elements, and while the light BL elements are there, it is absolutely not bland. I was blown away by the art direction, animation, choreography of the fight scenes, world-building, and sheer scope of the story. The fact that its set in the 1800s is gravy to fans of literature from the era. It's gorgeous to watch. There's animation in every scene, fluid and beautiful. The score is standard but it fits the material, and there's even a pipe organ moment that will get you pumped, which caught me by complete surprise.Nitpicks:-The name-dropping when it comes to real life and fictional characters from that era is silly, but I didn't find it that distracting. There have been plenty of books, comics, even tabletop games that throw those characters into a shared continuity, and usually it's done worse.-Eyebrows guy's character design was distractingly ridiculous.-The zombie screetching got annoying.BL:I mentioned the BL elements are what drew my initial attention. They're so toned down it's hard to recommend this on that basis, however. It is established that the MC has an intense connection with the young man he's trying to bring back. The characters don't mince words about it. However, there's no typical BL blushy-ness or awkward cutesy moments. There's also a beautiful and intriguing female lead who comes into play a bit later in the story. If BL isn't your thing, you'll still enjoy this for its quality, and if you need a sexy woman to look at, you won't be disappointed. If you are a BL fan, you'll want more flashbacks to cement their relationship and give you the hit of m/m romance you're looking for.Ending:The major issue is that the ending, though dramatic and very cool, is convoluted and confusing. Its imagery overtakes its logic. Mileage may vary on this, and it's why I rated it a nine instead of a ten. I think that's where people are getting lost. However, for me, if one hour and fifty minutes of something has me captivated, and the ending doesn't completely shit the bed, which this one didn't, I can walk away happy. Sometimes, especially in a visual medium, a story ends up making sense emotionally even though it doesn't make sense logically. That's what you have here. If that's poison to you, stay far away, but if you don't mind it, this is an incredible piece of art.

Just taking the sort of character you'd find in sherlock Holmes novels and shoving them into a steampunk Frankenstein type world. A world that doesn't have...too much going for it besides zombie helpers, and philosophical questions about the nature of lifeWatching this was like a sober trip on weak Mary Jane. It's having it's effect but I'm still underwhelmed. too much going for it besides zombie helpers, and philosophical questions about the nature of lifeWatching this was like a sober trip on weak Mary Jane. It's having it's effect but I'm still underwhelmed."", 'TLDR Version: Great animation with a very interesting first half but stale final act (with things just happening for no reason) makes this movie at a, ""yeah watch it if you have time.""First, the animation in this movie is very good. 3D models almost blend in the scene. The effects and movements are smooth. Nothing is wrong with this movie animation and sound wise. The story is what really matters. The movie has 3 acts. Act 1 takes up nearly half, while act 2 takes around 20 minutes and act 3 takes 1 hour. Acts 1 and 2 are the best parts of the movies...and you can enjoy the story in these parts without being confused all that much (at least I was.) Act 3 is the main problem. If I can show a graph on how confused and how many questions it\'ll be from 0 to 100. Things just seem to happen for the sake of happening. Heroes and allies suddenly turn evil. Magical items and ideas are pulled out of nowhere. Things that should kill our character apparently don\'t?(CENSORED SPOILERS) Example: Character A fights character B. A and B form crystals on their body. We see the crystals making A bleed. A blows up a propane can in a closed room and we see the flames burning his outline. Some time later A shows up all well and good not even breaking a sweat. The same example can be said about another character in Act 2 who literally gets an entire blade though his stomach! And pull it out! Blood is EVERWHERE! Nope dead. It seems like this movie really did not want its characters to die, which is very weird because at the end of act 1 a character we got to know very well gets killed. It was almost like the writers got cold feet and decided to throw on plot armor on all characters. I went from, ""No! Not him too! I like him so much! I wonder how the others will react?"" To, ""he\'ll be back.""Should you watch this anime? Yes but this anime isn’t perfect. and you can enjoy the story in these parts without being confused all that much (at least I was.)

Animation is solid though. No idea why they chose the typical direction of saving the world when there were almost limitless routes the movie could of gone into.Some of the character designs peeked my interest other times they looked incredibly typical just like the direction of the movie.The 4 minute opener was the only redeeming quality. ', ""I don't know how people can be praising the film and in the same sentence say it took them ten watches to fully grasp it. The plot is disconnected, it fails to establish and hold to the rules of its own world, and it throws in whatever elements or powers are convenient to progress the characters' motivations.I loved the animation, and the soundtrack was good, but overall this failed to be engaging on the first watch and after another, I find more plot issues and things that pull me out of the story than keep me invested.I was so upset seeing people laud this...film and say they felt the characters were deep. Each one had a single underdeveloped motivation if that, none of them had nuance, and they all simply wasted any potential for growth to produce the ultimately jarring and nonsensical happy ending.It's great to throw on a second monitor as background noise, a masterpiece it is definitely not. film and say they felt the characters were deep.
