Shining Star,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39918/Shining_Star,"[""Shining Star initially caught my interest because of its affiliation with SM Entertainment - one of the top entertainment companies in South Korea, known mostly for producing technology, actors & music. While the show wasn't terrible, it certainly didn't live up to my expectations. This will be my first review, in which I will give a completely spoiler-free rundown of what to expect from Shining Star's story along with my personal opinions on everything else.Story: 5/10The story, especially in the first season is extremely standard - an ordinary girl with big dreams wants to become an idol but must overcome many hardships to do so....She meets friends, rivals & love interests along the way while attending a prestigious idol academy. Sounds familiar, right? The only unique part of the story that isn't completely ripped out of existing, much better anime such as Aikatsu, PriPara or Pretty Rhythm comes in the form of its K-Pop influence. Shining Star shows us bits & pieces of Korean idol culture, as opposed to the usual Japanese idol culture. That being said, they're still pretty similar & there is a lot.. I mean a LOT of repetition throughout the series.Art: 3/10The art is composed entirely of 3D models, which I don't really have a problem with. My problem lies in how badly they are executed & how choppy everything is, outside of the performances. It's easier to forgive low FPS when it's a 2D animation, especially considering how underpaid & overworked most animators are, but I digress. I really like the character designs & the stage costumes can be downright gorgeous with how detailed they are, but the facial expressions often times look really awkward & unsuitable to the emotion which is supposed to be portrayed.Sound: 10/10I might be biased but given the territory of idol anime, this is up there with the best of them soundtrack wise. It's a mix of SM's biggest hits & also a good few deep cuts from artists such as BoA, Red Velvet, Girls' Generation, f(x), EXO, S.E.S., H.O.T. & so on. Some of the songs are re-recorded by the seiyuus, who also deliver fantastic original songs! At the time of writing this (2/16/2021) there are still no credits featured on MAL, but some of the talents behind the singing voices include Park Jungyeon, Koeun, NingNing (æspa) & Nakamura Hina.Characters: 7.5/10They might not be the most original, but surprisingly they interesting & likeable enough to drive me to complete this otherwise plodding, mediocre show. The cast is primarily female, which is good because they're much stronger than the male characters that there are. There's idols, trainees & staff, all of whom are prominent to the story. Not many characters are listed on MAL as of writing this, but there's a wide enough variety of personalities & styles that it's likely everyone will find at least one character they like.Overall & Enjoyment: 5/10If you can get past the pedestrian story & lacking animation, there really is something to love about Shining Star. Even if you can ignore the flaws mentioned before there is a big problem in that it overstays its welcome, not providing enough substance or new content to merit 52 episodes - unless you REALLY want to watch an authentic K-Pop anime. While I certainly enjoyed parts of it, I wouldn't recommend it. I'd suggest just checking out the music videos, especially for the original songs, which are all available in HD on YouTube.

Maybe this is to educate others on how real life idols work behind the scenes.Story: 7/10I\'m not really invested or interested in the story. It\'s basically tells the audience on how long and difficult the idols constantly train themselves. Rigorous dance practice & vocal exercises. Their restrictive diet, and skincare routine. To maintain their ""flawless"" a.k.a ""fictional/fantasy"" look.Art:  7/10The art style is in 2D, but the graphics and model is...in 3D.  The animation is pretty consistent.Sound: 10/10I love how they used old kpop songs in the series. Such as, girls generation and f(x)I love some of the voice actors! such as noah\'s voice actor.Character: 7/10Standard character design based on real life people, stylized into fictional/fantasy characters.Enjoyment: 7/10It was fun to watch at the beginning, but I got bored watching halfway.

Starship Troopers: Invasion,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14629/Starship_Troopers__Invasion,"['""Welcome back the good old classic Starship Troopers""For anyone who isn\'t familiar with the name ""Starship Troopers"" should really do a wikipedia search. The first Starship Troopers movie was a really well made blockbuster sci fiction movie. It catapulted the franchise, as well as actor Casper Van Dien into fame, as the famous ""Johnny Rico"".After 2 horrible low budget sequels (Starship Troopers 2 & 3), I am sure almost everyone had extremely low, or zero expectations, when they heard another Starship Troopers movie was being made.Original Star Actor, now turned Producer, Casper Van Dien did say in an earlier interview that he wanted ""Starship Troopers""...to return to its first movie\'s roots. I\'ll say it jolly well did.....""Hoo Haa!!""Story (9/10)Carmen\'s ship got taken over by Carl Jenkins, Carl goes missing in space with it. Carmen finds it back and boards it with a new group of mobile infantry to investigate, simple sci fi opening.The story is small in scale compared to the original first movie. And I can tell it got some inspiration from a certain game called ""Dead Space"". But what REALLY makes this work was because producer Casper Van Dien, and the scriptwriters, brought back many of the nuances that made the original first movie a classic. The script and execution are great examples of sci-fi action/survivor horror done right.Art (9/10)For an 3D animated movie the quality and detail of the artwork is really high. The guns, new mobile infantry armor, backdrops and characters are well designed with high attention to detail. Japanese Animation\'s high standards really shines through here.Sound (9/10)Great sound and music really contributes to this action/survivor horror sci fi movie. Silence is used greatly as a tension builder. Then adrenaline pumping hollywood music is used when the troopers and bugs start fighting and dying by the second.Character (9/10)All the new characters are great add-ons to this movie. Each of them have unique personalities. Some time was spent on the character development of the cast members, but not so much that the movie feels dragged out. This all helps the audience to root for the survival of every member of the crew when all the horrific fighting and dying starts.Enjoyment & Overall (9/10)I absolutely enjoyed this animated movie. It really retained all the elements that made the first starship troopers movie so great. Great characters, glorious hollywood shooting action, quick character deaths that shock the viewers, and the tension of never knowing whats going to happen next.They also made sure to include scenes of self sacrificing troopers, trying to buy their allies precious seconds to run away or complete the mission. These scenes of honorable self sacrifice are iconic of the first ""Starship Troopers"" movie.This animated movie is a great fusion of east and west. Hollywood blockbuster\'s great storytelling, along with Japanese Animation\'s great dedication to graphics and art.In summary if you have watched, and liked, the first ""Starship Troopers"" movie, you HAVE to watch this animated movie. Forget about the abysmal starship troopers 2 and 3 movies. This animated movie is the TRUE sequel to ""Starship Troopers"" to return to its first movie\'s roots.

This animated movie is the TRUE sequel to ""Starship Troopers""', ""Boobies, two horny soldiers fucking like rabbits, despite being complete strangers, then blood is spilled everywhere. The movie tries so hard to keep the audience engaged that you can't help but notice how weak the story is by the end. But who cares about that when there are boobies to focus on, am I right?This movie is a prime example of mindless action. You don't need to pay attention because the focus is solely on action and cheap shocking scenes. If you're familiar with American horror movies, you'll recognise all the cliches that this movie shamelessly borrows from. It's like a teenager's fever dream, complete...with nudity and sex.The story is as bland as a piece of bread without butter. It revolves around a failed experiment with some big-ass insects that nobody knows where they came from. The soldiers must rescue passengers on a ship, fight the bugs, and eventually everyone kills each other until the end. Yawn.The characters are as generic. We have a horny man who's blinded by love, a blonde seductress who's only there for fan service, the virgin comic relief who complains about being virgin, a shy coward nice guy, a scientist asshole. Oh, and of course, the serious badass white hero you see in every American horror-action b-film. The only passable character is Tia Durer (or Trig), because she actually shows emotions and has goals that were story relevant making her stand out from the rest of the characters. The movie could have been so much better if she were the main character.I appreciate the art design, but I can`t say the same for the disgusting green blood, and the soundtracks, including the catchy credit song, were so forgettable that it`s like a distant memory.Overall, don't expect a riveting story or well-developed characters from this movie. However, if you're in the mood for some mindless action and sex, then this movie is worth a watch. You could treat it as a guilty pleasure at best. with nudity and sex.The story is as bland as a piece of bread without butter.

As such, it does a decent job at giving fans a fun, visually appealing action ride. Alone, this movie belongs well at the bottom of the B-movie list.THE STORY follows a group of troopers who get caught up in a mystery involving a missing starship, a secret experiment, and of course, bugs. The plot is very basic and serves to lay down...a framework for the action to make sense. While I did not watch this film for the story, I will say that because the basic outline is so solid, I was actually disappointed by its failure to develop. There is a very interesting premise that I believe could have been explored deeper, but woefully it was not. Instead, the movie opts for cheap, no-brainer cliche storytelling and even worse dialogue to drag itself forward. I believe that if they had spent the money on the writing instead of the truly pointless nude scenes, this would have had a decent story. At least the pacing keeps you interested. Fans of the original 1997 movie will get the most from this film as there are several nods to the source film.THE ART is purely computer generated. While it's certainly not on the caliber of Pixar or Dreamworks it is certainly better than what I usually come out of Japan. In particular, the starship, space craft, and set designs are truly epic, and the effects are very well done. The characters all look too similar to each other (except for the females) and their animations are rather stiff. Still, the art is overall very good.THE SOUND is a lot better than I expected. The version I saw was in English (I believe that is the original language of the film), and the voice acting was pretty good. The only shame is that the actual dialogue is pretty dumb, cliche, and hammy. The sound effects are good, and the music is definitely nostalgic as the theme from the 1997 film is definitely audible.THE CHARACTERS are shallow and bland. There are really too many to be introduced and thoroughly explored in the span of the film, but it does not excuse the fact that whatever semblance of personality they have was merely written in to have some truly awful dialogue. It is a shame really because at face value, some of the characters seem interesting enough to get to know deeper, but there is no character development. Also, their fates will make the audience feel the authors are cheating.I ENJOYED the film. It is a brainless action movie with guns, spaceships, and aliens. The film distills all the fan service you would want from a sci-fi flick into a fairly slick production. The film is certainly watchable, but don't expect much more than a cheap, but satisfying, action thrill. That said, I really think this would have worked better as a miniseries. I suppose I just feel bad that this could have been something more, something better, and a decent addition to the franchise. a framework for the action to make sense.

I\'ve been a fan of Starship Troopers since I first saw the film Starship Troopers back when it came out in November of 1997 a few weeks before the very disappointing Alien Resurrection. It wasn\'t a great film, but it was fun and entertaining with Denise Richards and two of my favorite actors in Michael Ironside and Neil Patrick Harris. Michael Ironside I think is a little known actor, but you might recognize him from his voice acting as...he was the voice of Darkside in the Superman and Justice League cartoon series along with his work as Sam Fisher in the Splinter Cell series. Then there is the one and only Neil Patrick Harris who I\'ve followed since I watched him in Doogie Howser. He really is special multi-talented actor who enjoys what he does. Heck was the best thing in the Harold and Kumar films, and the only reason to watch How I Met Your Mother. Though I enjoyed the movie I hadn\'t read Robert A. Heinlein novel the film was based off of. After the film I picked up the novel and loved it. Starship Troopers had little in common with Heinlein\'s novel besides a few things like the main character Rico. Seven years later Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation a film that should never have been made was released to DVD. The plot wasn\'t terrible, but the acting and effects were just god awful. After the crap fest that was Starship Troopers 2 Bold Films and Stage 6 thought it was a good idea to make Starship Troopers 3: Marauder. The film worked out well bring back Casper Van Dien and bringing in the hot Jolene Blalock along with a decent script, good acting, and above average effects, but even with that it was still just an average film, so I was surprised to hear there was another film coming out especially that I heard very little about it, but when I saw it at Red Box I decided to give it a try, and I was very pleasantly surprised.As I said earlier in my review Starship Troopers: Invasion is a surprisingly really good film. The story follows the starship Alesia and their group of marines as they arrive at The Federation asteroid base Fort Casey, which has been overrun by bugs. It seems like a simple job for Lieutenant Tony Daugherty and his men, but things get complicated when Carl Jenkins the Minister of Paranormal Warfare commandeers the John A. Warden from his longtime Friend Carmen Ibanez and disappears. The Alesia her marines, Carmen and the prisoner Major Henry Varro chase after him on orders from General Johnny Rico. The story follows the universe of the films as it is a continuation. I won\'t give anymore way except to say the story is great, but better than the three previous films. The only real flaw with the film was the characters. That is a problem with films with a ton of characters like war films. For example The Thin Red Line it\'s a really good film, but is really hurt by the overabundance of characters. There are a lot of characters in Starship Troopers: Invasion to many for having real character growth. Many don\'t live long enough for you to care. Still there are some that stand out like Trig the women sniper of the team, and a private nicknamed Holyman. Obviously he is a religious man, and he was a good character. Of course the returning characters were good as well including Rico, Carmen and Carl. I wish studio that made the film had gotten Casper, Denise and especially Neil to do the voices of the characters. Still the voice actors did a good job voicing the characters, and it was interesting to see how the characters have grown and changed. The only character I didn\'t really like was Major Henry Varro nicknamed ""Hero"". The writers tried to make you care about him, but it didn\'t work he just felt like a useless character.Of course with this movie being a computer animated film I have to talk about the animation along with the action. Now I\'m no expert in graphics or animation, so I only go by what I think is good, and in my opinion the computer animation was great. The film was really detailed, and you could see the expressions and emotion along with the pain and sadness in the characters faces. The detail of the ships and bases was really well done as well. Then there was the action, which there was of course a lot of, and it was brilliantly done with the bugs, explosions, fire fights and bloodshed. It is riveting and even if the characters aren\'t the best in the world the action will keep you glued to the film.Starship Troopers: Invasion overall is a great film, with great animation and action along with a really good story, good voice acting and decent characters. It is definitely the best Starship Troopers film I highly recommend everyone see especially if you\'re a fan of the films and book, but is it the best adaption of Robert A. Heinlein\'s classic novel no. That honor goes to Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles the excellent 1999 animated series that ran for 36 episodes. Sadly it got canceled before it could come to a conclusion. It uses the characters from the films, but takes a different route that works really well along with the animation which was great. The series goes in depth into the character\'s lives as well as brings some characters from the novel as well as introducing new ones. I highly recommend both this film and the animated series if you\'re a fan of the novel and films or you\'re a Sci-fi fan in general.I am going to see the new Sci-fi film Branded this weekend. It looks really interesting and I\'m a big fan of Max von Sydow. I have been since I saw Needful Things and then the HBO Citizen X, which is a great film and one of the best made for TV films ever. Branded will be the first film I\'ve wanted to see in the theater since the Bourne film four weeks ago.

I will have a review up sometime Saturday or earlier.', ""At first glance it's perhaps a bit weird that the Starship Troopers film franchise, which after the 1997 original had seen two direct-to-dvd entries in 2004 and 2008, would get a CGI anime sequel produced in Japan. But judging by the fact a 6 part OVA already aired before Paul Verhoeven even got to Heinlein's book, Japan has always enjoyed the universe to a certain degree, or at least producers see a potential market.Because of this obvious drastic change in production, Invasion feels quite different from it's precursors. But is it any good?The truth is that Starship Troopers: Invasion is just a well-animated and straightforward...action story. It starts guns blazing and ends the same way, with a whole lot of dead bugs and troopers in the middle. There's no serious politics or satire to be found here, the plot unfolds pretty straightforwardly, and the action is consistently good though not amazing. The CGI is impressive, close to flawless whenever it concerns the combat, and without the skill on display here the movie would likely have been a lot harder to watch.Most of the cast is solid, given just enough character to make the viewer care a little bit about their death or survival, and the overly macho atmosphere is the closest Invasion comes to the live-action movies outside of the bugs' design. The one weak spot is Henry 'Hero' Varro, who is set up to be the hero of the story but ultimately plays second fiddle to the live-action's main trio and the newly introduced troopers.What also works in the favor of Invasion is it's simple but effective story structure. The action is never far off, the characters never get too much focus to the point it's boring, and the second half is mainly one giant unfolding battle. If anything it lasts a little too long with not enough turns to go through near the end, but since there's plenty of violence shown it's not too much of a bother.Ultimately Starship Troopers: Invasion is neither terrible or particularly good. It has nothing to say but entertains decently, it's forgettable but not so much that it feels like a wasted watch, and kept a franchise alive that most everyone probably considered dead. For someone who likes some brainless military entertainment it's worth the time for the CGI alone, for everyone else probably not. action story.

Obviously it\'s based on the same book that the famous \'97 film was based off of. Let\'s see how they handled it. I\'ve not seen anything by Sola so I couldn\'t even make a prediction in that regard.Story:We open with a group of soldiers boarding a station that\'s been overrun by the bugs on a rescue mission. They have to find a second batch of soldiers that\'s trapped on board. They succeed only to have the larger, more powerful ship they brought with them get commandeered by a high ranking official. Shortly after...they get orders to find that ship as its gone silent.The film is a bit sloppy. There are multiple situations where characters have information that they have no way of knowing seemingly because they found the DVD and watched the part they missed. There\'s also a character who dies for seemingly no reason. One moment he\'s on his feet dealing with some bugs, then he gets checked on and he\'s just dead with no sign of any injury. What, did he just then realise the situation was kind of dangerous and have a heart attack?The pacing is really well done. It has its intense moments and gives itself ample time to wind down so that you can process everything. The film also does a pretty good job of creating investment with the mystery of what exactly the official was up to and the knowledge that named, major characters can be killed at any time. I also do think there are some really good ideas in this film with the main antagonist and the specific scenario the characters find themselves dealing with. They just don\'t get developed all that well.Characters:The characters are definitely a problem. Invasion uses that common Hollywood action trope where they introduce a huge cast of characters and don\'t even try to make most of them interesting since they\'re basically there as fodder for the antagonists and the issue that always comes up in works with this trope is that they\'ll try to have some emotional death scenes but you can\'t really give a shit as a part of the audience because the character in question was about as complex and compelling as a cardboard cut-out. Some of the major characters do have small hints that they could be more than archetypes but the film never does anything with those traits that could add some complexity.Art:The CG isn\'t bad. The sci-fi elements look pretty interesting and I appreciate the fact that some of the soldiers have flair that sets their armour apart from the nearly identical armour of their companions. Sure, it gives the armour more personality than the character wearing it but the idea is good. The film also does a solid job of having action that\'s a bit chaotic, especially when things are going to hell, but not overly so. You can still easily discern everything that\'s happening.Sound:The acting is passable. While they got some truly talented actors like Hirano Aya and Kuroda Takaya, they have the serious disadvantage of characters who have next to nothing to them. Takahashi Tetsuya\'s compositions are pretty solid.Ho-yay:What little romance we see is hetero-normative.Areas of Improvement:1. The film really would have been better off with fewer characters and more time spent developing them. Maybe it wouldn\'t have allowed for as many death scenes but we would have gotten higher quality death scenes.2. The script needed an editor who would actually pay attention and ask basic questions like ""why does this happen? or ""how does this character know this?""3. While I really like the idea behind the main antagonist, they really needed to spend more time showcasing them and their abilities.Final Thoughts:Starship Troopers: Invasion is okay, not good but okay. I think the factor that ultimately holds it back is that Sola was content to make a dumb action film with under-developed characters and sloppy writing but some cool ideas and solid action sequences. I\'m giving it a 6/10. Maybe if you just want some action and don\'t care much about the writing you\'ll enjoy it.

I think some of these clips are apparently visual novel exclusive, but they are not necessary scenes.  Everything here was kind of just randomly thrown together like a slide show.It's possible that you can easily enjoy this like I did, but don't expect much.  A 5/10 is reasonable here.  If you're a shuffle fan, give this a shot and just have some quick fun.  If you're not a fan of shuffle, you probably wouldn't be looking at this anyway....I have said all I can say.

Although the anime scenes can be seen as directly recycled but the animation is not in this case.Now here we go with me giving you my honest opinion about the 'story' footage shown in the Shuffle! Prologue. To be quite frank, the short 8 minute OVA actually do have a deeper meaning than it looks and feels to a person who has played the original visual novel. This is because the scenes and footage seen may be what the typical viewer grasp as what is seen in the anime...but truth to be told the OVA is more of an actual retelling not of the anime but of the visual novels point of view. As a fan of the visual novel, I can tell straight of the bat that the dialogue, the speech and the actions done by the character is very thoroughly backed up by the descriptions said and done in the visual novel. To me everything in this Prologue, is nothing exciting for anyone but rather give a more impactful feeling of those who had played the visual novel a year prior to the anime adaptation.The art for the era of the anime it is released in is considered to be really well animated already and not to mention the animation for the prologue has a more fluent flow to it than to the anime counterpart (in my opinion). Though there is one significance that I must mention is that the animations and static animated pictures at the credit scene of this anime is scenes that would mostly not be shown in the anime at all because those scenes were the animated versions of the scenes from the visual novels and also static animated pictures of each of the heroines are redrawings of the artwork/scenes from the visual novel. I have to hand it to the reanimation of the visual novel scenes, as it brings back much nostalgic feelings as though we are reliving those visual novels memory once more.Though I really can't say much for the soundtrack or sounds of the Prologue simply because there's really nothing to shout out, very standard and very normal. Though one thing that stood out and something the visual novel audience would recognise is the ending song by YURIA. It was nice addition for them to use back the same song as the visual novel and played exactly with the visual novel scenes, thus creating back the visual novel vibe. It was a brilliant idea to play back the visual novel opening theme.I can't help to stress it enough that this whole Prologue was meant to be a promotional teaser for it's animated adaptation. Thus this Prologue itself was meant to attract back the attention from the visual novel audience as well, to get hyped in the anime adaptation. So once again my score is just something I'd give out of my own personal opinions and you can't really ever compare this to the anime series because this is just a teaser targeting a certain set of audience. As a teaser I think this does an excellent job thus my given score to it.Thank you all for taking your time to read this review, this Shuffle Prologue, really did hit my noggins' with the nostalgic feel and yes I do recommend talking a look at the anime adaptation as well! but truth to be told the OVA is more of an actual retelling not of the anime but of the visual novels point of view.

Sasami-san@Ganbaranai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14515/Sasami-sanGanbaranai,"[""Initially my wtf is going on radar went off. The first episode threw me for an FLCL loop. As the story progresses you get more of a FLCL meets The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya feel that starts to develop along with Shafts amazing ability to throw art of the abnormal around.Story -Take a minute to read the Synopsis... That basically covers the first episode. Things start to get real in depth with the story later on. I would say Sasami heavily feels like a Haruhi in this aspect. She has this power that she thinks she doesn't have. She later has to learn how to...control it while trying to fend off abnormal aspects of her life just to be normal. This story can be a bit weird at times.. However its still developing.Art -Things are really unique in this category. Shaft put forth another amazing effort to make a unique anime. The graining they did on certain regions makes it stick out like crazy. The characters are cheeky, cute, and all around appealing. There is fan service to some degree but it doesn't feel terrible.. I guess more awkward sometimes. I really enjoyed this category the most.Sound-I don't have much to complain about here. The sound is normal. The ending themes are unique in a way. The opening is fairly good. My biggest gripe is probably just a few of the voice actors. Not everyone can always be fantastic. Kamiomi sounds to much like an old man at times. Then again it works every now and then.Character-The character development is very... very weird at times. This story can just throw these characters for a loop. Every character has their own unique weirdness about them. If you think this story is heading in one direction, it travels in another. Without giving away spoilers i just ask myself WTF is going on at times.Enjoyment-Lets just say all the weird FLCL Melancholy loopyness with the fantastic art kept me watching episode after episode. I highly suggest a rewatch of episodes just to understand things a bit better. It's very enjoyable for what it is. control it while trying to fend off abnormal aspects of her life just to be normal.

It's very enjoyable for what it is."", ""Anime auteur Akiyuki Shinbo has with Studio Shaft directed a number of highly interesting, willfully off-kilter and generally amusing series. His work is always bold, with visual flair beyond the norm and he usually chooses to direct works with morbid or bizarre sensibilities and humor. Sasami-san@Gabaranai does not break the Shaft mold in the slightest, but it does reaffirm how well it can work. It's a very strange but thoroughly fun ride.Shaft's knack for good visuals keeps the series looking strong. Perhaps some of the tricks used are there to keep the costs down; it doesn't matter, the anime looks distinctive and often beautiful. The...characters are attractive, the action fluid. The actors also play their parts well and the music is kept fittingly quirky. The opening theme is energetic and kinda catchy, though not quite as memorable as some Shaft themes. The ending theme sequences are kinda fun, and the song itself kinda cute.Sasami-san isn't just good on the technical end though, it also tells a wonderfully odd and interesting story. Going into the series, it's kind of hard to tell what it is at first. The first two episodes are really goofy and make it seem like another weird Shaft comedy (which it is to an extent). Then the third and fourth episode are just strange. The fifth episode is where it all gets pulled back some and we see earnest character development and the real clues that they might be taking this more serious than it first appeared. Then episode six comes and turns it all in on itself; where there was a ridiculous and bizarre school comedy with supernatural elements there is now a character driven supernatural adventure with an oddball sense of humor. What was at first diverting, whimsical fun becomes an actually evocative character piece.Character pieces need good characters and Sasami-san has great ones, though it doesn't seem so at first. Sasami herself is an odd character to figure out since she seems so weird and detached initialy. She's actually a strong, willful lead who grows as she comes to make new friends while being just quirky enough to make the comedy work. Her brother on the other hand, while seeming critical to the show at first does not get developed very much, yet he does remain interesting and kind of fun for his silliness; he's a weirdo who does nothing of importance and seems only to be there to creep on his sister and get smacked around by the characters who matter. He hides his face, which adds mystery, but nothing of substance about him is particularly resolved.Aside from Sasami, the other real stars of the series are the three Yagami sisters. At first glance these are characters invented entirely for humor; you got a young girl with an adult body, an adult with a young girl's body and a robot girl. They do certainly lend themselves well to the madcap comedy of the series, but to my surprise they turned out to actually be characters as well. The adult-bodied child, Tama, is ridiculous but still comes across as a sweet, innocent child and also as an earnest, affecting and strong willed presence; she has some very strong scenes and becomes quite likable. Eldest sister Tsurugi meanwhile is cool and competent (while still being silly enough) and works in the mentor/guardian role. Middle sister Kagami is probably my favorite character though, as the arc involving her and Sasami's blossoming frienship is handled beautifully and in a way that makes it gratifying to see her open up. She's also amusing and her fight sequences are always cool.Beyond the main cast, Sasami-San has a small number of other interesting characters,mostly serving as antagonists. Sasami's mother is a standout and the arc spent with her is an exciting one. The show isn't left much time to develop the antagonist for the last little arc, but it convincingly builds her relationship with Sasami and succeeds in making her a fun and interesting enough character. A few other noticeable characters don't get a chance to do much, which makes one wonder if sequels are planned. Given Shaft's record, it's certainly possible and for me at least would be welcomed.Sasami-san is an interesting show to follow. It switches between moods a lot and perhaps it seems a little scattered and weird for the first third. Depending on anime tastes it might be impenetrable or it might just be flat unfunny for some, but, for me, as it kept going it became a thorough delight.

Enter Sasami-san@Ganbaranai, the front-runner for absurdity—playing the seductress, the shrew, the madwoman fueled by crack cocaine. Be forewarned. This is a genuine concoction of the bizarre, lacking any sense of direction, and indeed, having no concern for it. Sheer bewilderment becomes Sasami-san\'s very forte. Yet, this eccentricity is a double-edged sword, and considering the shallowness of Sasami-san\'s loony design, we\'re unfortunately left with a show that is plain disappointing.Both a strength and a weakness, the plot is all over the place. In the first episode for...example, Sasami spends her idle time stalking her brother from home via some unexplained form of ultra-computer technobabble, mixing in Haruhi references (oh the boldness) on the way; then Sasami purchases some Valentine\'s Day chocolate for her brother, which suddenly transforms the world into...chocolate. Now if this weren\'t enough, we have some wacky screenplay done in eroge style, a whole 30 seconds spent watching Sasami undress; cue jazz-fusion music, concurrent with tumultuous action scenes: missile-endowed breasts, chocolate dragons, magical powers, mechanical wings, and sensual cannibalism—all to save the world from becoming a permanent Willy Wonka factory.While we\'re offered nothing of the underlying plot, we\'re so bemused by its over-the-top direction, disoriented into excitement by the story and art direction\'s compounded nonsense. Yet, the underlying problem is that we\'re offered nothing related to the real plot. Instead we\'re served a bowl of shallow eccentricity, leaving a cloyingly sour taste as we\'re still wondering what the heck is going on (!).This is a real shame given that some of the more unique eccentricities are intrinsically linked to the Shinto doctrine. Sasami\'s brother Kamiomi perpetually hides his face under the presence of his sister, a testament to the humility of servants under deities; and the brooding incest between the two—while a common SHAFT delicacy—is canonically supported by the historical myths behind Shinto creationism. These are the occasional subtleties, the acts of brilliance overshadowed by heavy-handed symbols and writing: Sasami\'s mother inserting an awfully phallic totem into her daughter\'s stomach, festering into tangible bloat, and then Sasami birthing her own mother through some Freudian version of catharsis. Better yet, Takamagahara mythology even details this very method as the cycle of creation.Am I overreaching somewhere? Yes, a bit. Unfortunately, Sasami-san clouds itself with so many absurdities (much of the time for fanservice) that it becomes impossible to determine what actually warrants in-depth discussion. It would be too convenient to suppose all of it is just pandering eroticism, especially with the more detailed source material in mind. Yet, this potential existence for merit does not make Sasami-san\'s diluted symbology any more comprehensible from the start, overshadowed by the show\'s refusal to expand upon its elusive—and unfortunately, fleeting—strengths.At the show\'s core we\'re left with nothing but soppy melodrama—a direction that the show initially tried to avoid. This is where Sasami-san truly unhinges itself. While once entranced by the subtleties within the Shinto doctrine, the story takes a jarring left turn, yanking us out of the rabbit hole and placing us into a different tale: one of happiness versus responsibility, an introspective battle between Sasami\'s self-indulgent desires and her shrine maiden duties. Yet, the story forgets what previously distinguished Sasami-san, substituting eccentricity for intense manipulation (and boy is it an emotional roller coaster). Spending time with a zombie mother, only to be handled with a glop of melodrama by the end, simply does not compute. To have such a jarring turn of events (and an awfully serious one at that) alienates viewers from any meaningful connection to the characters.This dramatic venture is only exacerbated as many of the events are unnaturally spontaneous, pulling away from any sense of realism in the story. These are the scenes full of hilarious spunk when the show doesn\'t take itself seriously, but when deus ex machina are integrated with the drama, it\'s difficult to consider any of it to be sincere writing. How unfortunate that the only savior from a time-traveling golem (which just happens to have waited an entire decade in hibernation) is some awkward plot device tantamount to going Super Saiyan.Unfortunately, the narrative lends no favors to the cast either, as all the intriguing characters are offered little substance beneath their eccentric guises. Sasami Tsukuyomi is a hikikomori who also happens to be something of a goddess, and is queerly characterized by opposites: antisocial hikikism and a gooey moe personality. Sadly, her character is inconsistent, and constantly swaps between the two at the flick of a switch, a poor trait for a lead character aiming to pull off realistic drama. As for other cast members, Kamiomi plays the lustful brother, Tsurugi the frivolous red-head, Kagami the cold-hearted robot, and Tama the well-endowed moeblob with the brain age of a nymphet. While we are offered the occasional dynamic cleverly (word)played among these personalities, it is regrettable then that they never amount to anything more than that; the plot simply refrains from developing them past farcical melodrama. Moreover, the show even introduces more quirky characters three-quarters of the way through its 12 episodes, which only seems to confirm that the writers are looking more for gimmicky shells than ripened fruit.In the end, Sasami-san concludes as the devil child that it is. The show\'s dynamics lends itself into an air of ravenous hilarity, pumping out the rare cheekiness reminiscent of more successful shows of its kind. But unfortunately, Sasami-san is so all over the place, and weighed down by its bloated melodrama, that these breadcrumbs are unsavory—ephemeral loaves expanding into excessively sour ones. Worth the watch? LSD\'s better.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------This review is written by members of the club Quiet Discourse. For more details, please see the club frontpage. example, Sasami spends her idle time stalking her brother from home via some unexplained form of ultra-computer technobabble, mixing in Haruhi references (oh the boldness) on the way; then Sasami purchases some Valentine\'s Day chocolate for her brother, which suddenly transforms the world into...chocolate. Now if this weren\'t enough, we have some wacky screenplay done in eroge style, a whole 30 seconds spent watching Sasami undress; cue jazz-fusion music, concurrent with tumultuous action scenes: missile-endowed breasts, chocolate dragons, magical powers, mechanical wings, and sensual cannibalism—all to save the world from becoming a permanent Willy Wonka factory.While we\'re offered nothing of the underlying plot, we\'re so bemused by its over-the-top direction, disoriented into excitement by the story and art direction\'s compounded nonsense. Yet, the underlying problem is that we\'re offered nothing related to the real plot. Instead we\'re served a bowl of shallow eccentricity, leaving a cloyingly sour taste as we\'re still wondering what the heck is going on (!).This is a real shame given that some of the more unique eccentricities are intrinsically linked to the Shinto doctrine. Sasami\'s brother Kamiomi perpetually hides his face under the presence of his sister, a testament to the humility of servants under deities; and the brooding incest between the two—while a common SHAFT delicacy—is canonically supported by the historical myths behind Shinto creationism. These are the occasional subtleties, the acts of brilliance overshadowed by heavy-handed symbols and writing: Sasami\'s mother inserting an awfully phallic totem into her daughter\'s stomach, festering into tangible bloat, and then Sasami birthing her own mother through some Freudian version of catharsis. Better yet, Takamagahara mythology even details this very method as the cycle of creation.Am I overreaching somewhere? Yes, a bit. Unfortunately, Sasami-san clouds itself with so many absurdities (much of the time for fanservice) that it becomes impossible to determine what actually warrants in-depth discussion. It would be too convenient to suppose all of it is just pandering eroticism, especially with the more detailed source material in mind. Yet, this potential existence for merit does not make Sasami-san\'s diluted symbology any more comprehensible from the start, overshadowed by the show\'s refusal to expand upon its elusive—and unfortunately, fleeting—strengths.At the show\'s core we\'re left with nothing but soppy melodrama—a direction that the show initially tried to avoid. This is where Sasami-san truly unhinges itself. While once entranced by the subtleties within the Shinto doctrine, the story takes a jarring left turn, yanking us out of the rabbit hole and placing us into a different tale: one of happiness versus responsibility, an introspective battle between Sasami\'s self-indulgent desires and her shrine maiden duties. Yet, the story forgets what previously distinguished Sasami-san, substituting eccentricity for intense manipulation (and boy is it an emotional roller coaster). Spending time with a zombie mother, only to be handled with a glop of melodrama by the end, simply does not compute. To have such a jarring turn of events (and an awfully serious one at that) alienates viewers from any meaningful connection to the characters.This dramatic venture is only exacerbated as many of the events are unnaturally spontaneous, pulling away from any sense of realism in the story. These are the scenes full of hilarious spunk when the show doesn\'t take itself seriously, but when deus ex machina are integrated with the drama, it\'s difficult to consider any of it to be sincere writing. How unfortunate that the only savior from a time-traveling golem (which just happens to have waited an entire decade in hibernation) is some awkward plot device tantamount to going Super Saiyan.Unfortunately, the narrative lends no favors to the cast either, as all the intriguing characters are offered little substance beneath their eccentric guises. Sasami Tsukuyomi is a hikikomori who also happens to be something of a goddess, and is queerly characterized by opposites: antisocial hikikism and a gooey moe personality. Sadly, her character is inconsistent, and constantly swaps between the two at the flick of a switch, a poor trait for a lead character aiming to pull off realistic drama. As for other cast members, Kamiomi plays the lustful brother, Tsurugi the frivolous red-head, Kagami the cold-hearted robot, and Tama the well-endowed moeblob with the brain age of a nymphet. While we are offered the occasional dynamic cleverly (word)played among these personalities, it is regrettable then that they never amount to anything more than that; the plot simply refrains from developing them past farcical melodrama. Moreover, the show even introduces more quirky characters three-quarters of the way through its 12 episodes, which only seems to confirm that the writers are looking more for gimmicky shells than ripened fruit.In the end, Sasami-san concludes as the devil child that it is. The show\'s dynamics lends itself into an air of ravenous hilarity, pumping out the rare cheekiness reminiscent of more successful shows of its kind. But unfortunately, Sasami-san is so all over the place, and weighed down by its bloated melodrama, that these breadcrumbs are unsavory—ephemeral loaves expanding into excessively sour ones.

I loved every episode save for the last three, and wanted to see if I would feel the same way again. Was Sasami-san@Ganbaranai as good as I thought it was? Read on to find out.Now, I noticed this the first time I watched it, and it’s worth pointing out: the show isn’t deep. Though the story uses a lot of lore from Japanese mythos, it’s just a backdrop and reason for everything that happens in the show. Maybe it takes...a few liberties with its source, and maybe it’ll annoy Japanese mythos junkies, but that would be missing the show’s true focus: a simple story about Sasami the shut-in as she’s watched by the three Yagami sisters—Tsurugi, Kagami, and Tama—to stop her God-like power from making mass chaos in the world. With entertaining results.Cities will turn to chocolate, video games will come to life, clones will run loose, vengeful spirits will arise, and that’s only the problems Sasami makes, and not the chaos caused by the people protecting her and the people who want to use her.But no matter how insane the story gets, it never break its own rules. If a weapon is described as being defensive, the way it shatters another weapon is very clever. If God-like power is useless against one character but strong against three others, it’s because that one character has anti-God abilities. If a character’s power is inconsistent, it’s from a lack of experience using it. Save for one line of dialog, the consistency in the setting’s in-universe rules is perfect; quite a feat considering how easily an insane show like this can break them.The story’s progress is solid in the first nine episodes thanks to its decent characters. Sasami doesn’t have much in the way of personality, but her story of responsibility VS freedom is handled well. The reasons for her being a shut-in make sense when thinking about her back story, though it can be hard to catch from the show’s insanity. On the other hand, her bad friend-making skills make sense since she’s a shut-in, though her friendship with Kagami and a later character is rushed.Kagami herself starts as the show’s resident quiet girl, but soon shows a lot of emotion, smiling and snarking and showing embarrassment this way and that. Unfortunately, the rushed friendship with Sasami can make Kagami hard to take seriously, especially in the show’s last three episodes where Kagami’s back story is explained a bit more, but that back story never comes to play in full force. On the other hand, what she deals with in her spotlight episode is a sign of the story’s growing seriousness.But the story’s serious side starts with Tsurugi. She starts as the pervert but becomes the protector, the mentor of sorts to Sasami, and the Yagami Sister’s de-facto leader. She doesn’t have much in the way of development, but her role in the story doesn’t need it. It just needs personality. And it’s a personality that’s believably serious when it shows itself for the first time in an early episode, considering who Tsurugi is. Starting with her serious side, the show moves nicely from light-hearted to serious in the first several episodes, even as the show’s insanity rises.That said, the last sister, Tama, causes two bad scenes in the show. The first scene being after the show gets really serious, where she starts talking about her bond with Tsurugi, Kagami, and Sasami, except none of what she says makes any sense at all, because the show never shows the crucial part of what she’s talking about. The second scene is in the climax of the first several episodes, where a chance to develop her character meaningfully is wasted for humor. Otherwise, she’s little more than a childlike plot device.Despite that, the show moves well in the first nine episodes, shaky character development aside, though after the first several episodes there are two things about the story that make no sense; no, the show doesn’t break its own in-universe rules, but it involves Sasami, Tsurugi, and a new character.The first problem is the new character, and no, this isn’t the one Sasami befriends. Anyway, this new character has a big role in the story, a believable relationship with Sasami, and quite a bit of personality. This is all well and good, but her behavior after the first several episodes is such a big change from what she was before, it’s jarring; Tsurugi hints to the reason for this, but that’s all it is. A hint.The second problem is the kind of hot potato game Sasami, Tsurugi, and the new character have. At one point it looks like one character will carry it, then it looks like another character will carry it until the other character is ready to take it, then it turns out it’s this character who carries it. Confused yet? So am I. But these two story problems are nothing compared to the mess of the last three episodes, and no, the show still doesn’t break its own rules and it never does.The problem with the last three episodes is it makes no sense, even for a show as insane as this. To explain, it’s a world domination plot by a new character—the one who Sasami befriends—and her reason for this plot makes no sense. Second, this character knows the second story problem, so it makes even less sense for her to bring in Sasami and the Yagami Sisters. The last three episodes are a mess, but at least the insanity continues to rise with the music and visuals to carry it.The music would be better if I counted the opening song, Alteration, but I’m not. The in-show music isn’t anything that can stand on its own, but it does deserve credit for its variety. It uses—or at least, sounds like it uses—the flute, piano, fast techno, epic orchestra, guitar, game show, elevator, blues, suspense chords, jazz, uplifting; it throws everything at the show. And while it doesn’t have a unique identity, the chaotic music lends itself to the show’s insanity, though not at as well as the visuals.The character designs are brightly colored and their faces are expressive, especially with Tsurugi and Kagami. The abstract backgrounds, such as Sasami’s room, stand out because of how scarce they are compared to the normal backgrounds. Strangely enough, most of the show’s chaos happens in the normal backgrounds, making the well-animated chaos stand out even more. The music and visuals carry the insanity, which I know is a word I’ve used a thousand times here, but there’s something crucial about it I need to mention.While the show’s insanity is one of its main strengths, it can also be one of its flaws. To explain, it can be hard to look past the show’s chaos to find any substance, and the substance is a good if flawed story, but that might not be enough for some people. To put it another way, watching this show makes people choose between two options: finding a good if flawed story, or letting themselves be whisked away by the show’s insanity.Of those two options, I first watched this show with the second choice. I remember being wowed by all of the chaos, and called the story and character development unlike nothing I’ve ever seen. But as I might have pointed out, rewatching it made me see it wasn’t as good as I thought it was. That said, I will say with all my heart that I still personally LOVE Sasami-san@Ganbaranai, but this show is definitely a few motivations short of being @the top. a few liberties with its source, and maybe it’ll annoy Japanese mythos junkies, but that would be missing the show’s true focus: a simple story about Sasami the shut-in as she’s watched by the three Yagami sisters—Tsurugi, Kagami, and Tama—to stop her God-like power from making mass chaos in the world.

They may like it, they may not, or they may not be accustomed to the taste so they give it another shot. If you fall into the latter, you will find that Sasami-san is more than meets the eye.With its combination of supernatural occurrences, mysterious story line, unknown depth of characters, and extremely weird chain of events, you\'re not sure where the producers SHAFT is going with this. However, each episode contains enough elements to pique your interest, leaving you with a sense of longing and desire to see the next episode.Story -...6In its confusion, the first episode only gives you a brief glimpse into what Sasami-san is about. In general, there is very little explanation on what is happening. This is surprisingly concealed well by the events that take place, and is more so left up to the viewer to determine how the story unfolds and expands. Overal, the story is fair, not bad, not great.Art - 7I believe the art and animation to be on par with what SHAFT produces. I am not picky on watching anime based solely on that quality, though I have to admit there are scenes that could be drawn in more or higher detail. Overall, it is good, not exceptional.Sound - 9The atmosphere and setting play a large part in the general mood of Sasami-san; this includes the sound quality and background music. SHAFT does a great job in matching the music to the scene. The OP and ED reflect the series well, hinting at times the suspense, and at times the comedy and joking nature of the characters.Character - 8Each character has a unique personality, separate from the others in the series. Sasami-san would lose a lot of its interest if the characters were similar or bland. You will find immediately that each character adds something to the story, even if it\'s comedic relief or bizarre plot device.That being said, these arch-types are common across anime; you have the sleepy, half-closed-eyes character that\'s lazy and unwilling to do anything physical, and you have the short, witty-comebacks character that views life as a joke. At the very least, SHAFT try to do something new with already-used character traits.Enjoyment - 7As I said previously, each week I find myself watching the anime out of interest, and not for the sake of ""completing the series"". This is because the story slowly develops, albeit slow and confusing at times. You\'re left guessing and making predictions on the plot and where it\'s going, so if that\'s not something you want to do, then you may find yourself dropping this anime. I for one believe that watching with no expectations is best, as you may be left pleasantly surprised at the end.Overall -7Sasami-san@Ganbaranai is by no means the perfect anime, and many will detest the direction (if it is heading in one) that SHAFT is taking with it.

This eagerness was answered with the adaption of the light novel Sasami-san@Ganbaranai.  Were these new fans sated by their new weekly dosage of still frames and headtilts?  Let’s just say that these fans are still holding their breaths.  Unfortunately for Shaft, the reception was quite the contrary.  To call Sasami-san merely a disappointment would be an unforgivable understatement.Perhaps the main problem of Sasami-san, much like Hataraku Maou-sama, is that it...suffers from an enormous identity crisis.  Is it an ecchi comedy?  Is it an introspective commentary on hikkikomori shut-ins?  Is it a dark, plot-centric epic battle between the gods?  All and none of the above.  There are certainly points where it tries to be humorous and then inexplicably and suddenly decides to take itself seriously and somehow expect us to do so as well, particularly during the mother arc.  And, occasionally, it will mix the two—rather inappropriately, I might add.  As just one example, the art and animation shifts into a comedic style during what was supposed to be the tense, climactic finale.  If this show was more decisive and chose SOME direction with the plot, either as a full-blown ecchi comedy or a dark and edgy conflict of gods and secret organizations, it would have fared much better.  Some shows can handle having serious elements sprinkled with comedic relief, but Sasami-san clearly showed an utter incapacity to do so.Like most Shaft works, the art is consistently inconsistent.  At times I cannot help but marvel at the sheer beauty and creativity of the way some things are portrayed, such as the light filtering in Sasami’s room which makes it look like it’s done entirely by watercolors (I’m a sucker for Shaft backgrounds); yet, I can’t help but laugh at the utterly lazy and uninspired art and animation that occasionally found their way into some scenes.This brings me to my next point: the characters.  While the character designs themselves are not necessarily bad, I would not call them “good,” either.  Most look average at best, while the worst offenders are dull blobs.  Not only are characters superficially unremarkable, but the personalities underneath are nothing to write home about either.  You can immediately guess the personality of each character simply by their designs.  Some might consider this to be a success; however, I disagree in this case because, frankly, the personalities are disappointingly stale.  Most characters are not original or interesting in the least, almost every single one being a generic rehash of established archetypes we see in every other anime.  If you can predict a character’s every decision simply because of a strict adherence to their archetype, something is wrong.  Beauty is not merely skin deep here.Sasami-san is a show easily forgotten with virtually nothing special about it.  It makes me worry about Shaft's upcoming attempt at the manga Nisekoi.  Will it become a Monogatari, or will it, like Sasami-san and Dance in the Vampire Bund, join Shaft’s ranks of mediocre anime adaptions?

The story revolves around them, and the three Yagami sisters: Tsurugi,  Kagami and Tama.Now, when I watched the first two episodes, I was like ""What the f*ck is happening?"" I mean, everything turning into chocolate? A 30-year old woman in a kid\'s body wielding a sword? A cyborg? A hot 9-year old that can jump real high and stuff? It\'ll really put you in a situation where you don\'t know what is...going on. Now some of you might drop it after the first episode. But don\'t.It gets better, and eventually everything makes sense.Apparently, Sasami holds the power of Amaterasu in her body, and has the ability to alter everything around her according to her liking.

The first two-three episodes have Excel Saga levels of weirdness, but after that the bizarro factor tapers off rapidly and the story jells into coherence. By about halfway through the series you find yourself wrapped up in a coherent story that is simply a modern interpretation of Japanese mythology, with only slight sojourns into the unconventional (but all in the name of presenting the ""fantastic"" i.e. a story of gods).In other words, this anime is much more straightforward than FLCL, which it gets compared to a lot; just watch more...than the first few episodes and it will all fall into place. You only need to watch Sasami-san@Ganbaranai once through to understand what it is about; peeling back one layer of the onion that is this anime reveals all it\'s secrets, unlike FLCL where the onion is many layers deep and takes a lot more effort to reveal it\'s depths. That doesn\'t mean that Sasami-san@Ganbaranai is shallow, though, just not as full of obscure analogies and almost-opaque references. The viewer need not be acquainted with Japanese mythology to any great degree in order to interpret the show and enjoy it.The art style is great, suiting the theme of the story perfectly, and the sound is perfect as well ( I love the way they use one particular piece of jazzy guitar music with someone singing ""lalala"" to set a laid-back dreamy mood).I am puzzled as to why this anime is so underrated; do people really prefer meaningless battles and endless filler arcs to great art like Sasami-san@Ganbaranai? Anime would be a stale artform if we didn\'t get shows like this every so often. than the first few episodes and it will all fall into place.

The show should have ended after the Mom arc, it had great progression and the anime could have ended off on a better note.Instead they decided to continue and introduced a new character. Hardly anything is explained and a lot of the characters are not fleshed out very well. The last episode was a mess, do to a rushed end and troll subs (which were annoying btw). Not to mention more random characters and unanswered questions in the last episode. Even if the series was...going for weird and eccentric it could have done it far better, with actual story progression.The art was good for the most part, I enjoyed the scenery, and while the soundtrack didn't stand out to me at all it wasn't horrible. This series biggest hiccup is lack of progression, and constantly getting off track on what this anime is supposed to be about. going for weird and eccentric it could have done it far better, with actual story progression.The art was good for the most part, I enjoyed the scenery, and while the soundtrack didn't stand out to me at all it wasn't horrible.

I think Sasami-san is a... unique anime. Like the saying goes, ""don\'t judge a book by its cover"", Sasami-san\'s first episode might leave you with mixed emotions.Story:Sasami-san is not what it really seems when you first watch it. Eventually, you\'ll see the events that happen each have a deeper meaning than what you first think of it. It\'s plot is indeed strange, yet intriguing. A lot of what happens also has to do with Japanese mythology. Depending on how well you know Japan\'s history (or maybe the amount of anime you watch), this show...may or may not be your cup of tea.Art:Honestly, I think Sasami-san\'s art is a bit strange...I haven\'t read the manga (or novel...whichever one was adapted) so I don\'t know if this is how the author intended the art to be. Despite this though, I do think that the art matches Sasami-san quite well. It might be because of its strange plot that the art matches it.Sound:Sasami-san\'s opening is one of my favorites of Winter 2013. As for the ending, I\'ve never actually heard a legit version without people talking in the background so...can\'t really rate that. The seiyuu that plays Sasami does a pretty good job. I think it matches her really well.Character:In here, I\'d say there are basically 5 main characters. First off, there\'s Sasami. I think her character development throughout the story is actually quite interesting to watch. She goes though many series of events that eventually builds up on her character. Then, there\'s her brother, Onii-chan. (That is what I will be referring him to as since that what\'s he\'s most commonly called on during the show). His character is quite plain. Most the time you\'ll only see him shouting out his love to Sasami. But there is the mystery of why he hides his face. Lastly, there is the Yagami sisters. Known as the ""gods"" they show somewhat of a character development throughout the show. I\'d say the youngest of the 3, Tamma, has the least character development, as of now.Enjoyment:I won\'t lie. I wanted to drop Sasami-san after the first episode. But I decided to give it a few more chances. And for some reason, every week, I started looking forward to watching it. Maybe it was the weird plot that drew me, or maybe it was just simply because I\'M weird, but I found that as I watched, I liked Sasami-san more and more.Overall:Overall, Sasami-san shows lots of promise, but it probably started off on the wrong foot for most people. If your bored, this anime should keep you entertained. Now, once again, I shall repeat ""Don\'t judge a book by its cover!"" may or may not be your cup of tea.Art:Honestly, I think Sasami-san\'s art is a bit strange...I haven\'t read the manga (or novel...whichever one was adapted) so I don\'t know if this is how the author intended the art to be.

While I find it difficult to categorize it into any particular genre, it could probably be best described as a comedic thriller.The first episode is a bit of a trip through madness, showing the main character, Sasami Tsukuyomi, spying on her pervert brother from home before the world inexplicably turns to chocolate, with three strange girls, the Yagami sisters, bringing things back to normal in a very over the top way. However, the first episode doesn\'t quite capture the true essence of this series, which reveals important details with each...episode that explain what the viewer has seen previously.The underlying theme is Sasami\'s desire to escape from supernatural obligation and live a more ordinary life. The story itself is fairly weak and felt a little a random or directionless at times, with events often resolved with deus ex machina plot elements,  but the characters are enjoyable and developed pretty well. There is a fair amount (though not overwhelming) of ""ecchi"" humour, as well as references to Shinto mythology and Japanese internet culture here, which some people will love, while others might feel lost watching this.Beyond all that, the art style is beautiful, with a very watercolour sort of design that sets it apart from most contemporary anime, along with character designs that really bring out the personality of each of the characters. The music is quite good, too, with a catchy opening theme by ZAQ, and the background music, while it isn\'t memorable, sets the mood well. The ending theme is mostly played for laughs, with off-key singing and commentary by various characters throughout almost the entirety of the series.Overall, I think that Sasami-san@Ganbaranai is a good watch, though not for everyone. If you\'re willing to overlook the aimless storyline and can appreciate the otaku elements though, you\'ll probably enjoy this series too. episode that explain what the viewer has seen previously.The underlying theme is Sasami\'s desire to escape from supernatural obligation and live a more ordinary life.

Unfortunately this wasn't very interesting to me. In fact it was very dull, not very Shafty, nor as wtf inducing as other reviewers would have you believe.The story revolves around Sasami who holds the power of the the ultimate god which basically can control other gods. However this power backfires a lot(world turns to chocolate), also seems to be rather weak or non existent when in a pinch(other gods pick fights with her). Whether or not you take this show at face value like I am, or take it to be some wild illusion as the...base synopsis hints at, your enjoyment and understanding of the show will be the same.How they handle the story isn't terrible, in fact its really great for enjoying and understanding so I do give it praise. The episodes are split into about 2 episode arcs. The first episode is generally the story without any information, and yes it can be a little strange. The second episode generally gives you the information you need to understand what happened the last episode and also wraps it up by either retelling it through a different lens or just continuing it from a different angle. There really is no overarching plot line. Each mini story gives a little of itself to the story as a whole but its pretty much a slice of life show about Sasami.The art wasn't great, nor was it terrible. I love Shaft art normally and was a bit disappointed how tame this show was. The art felt more like a homage to your typical Shaft show. True there were some head tilts, hair moving, odd character traits and many more, but it all felt subdued and not really a part of the show. The soundtrack was alright, didn't really stand out at all.The characters were boring imo. Sasami being the MC, is a shut in who ran away from home and her responsibilities. She was supposed to take over the power that the gods have given her. She instead turns her attention to living her life as a child. Her brother has been trained to take care of her every need, so he does everything for her like she is a baby. You also have the Yagami sisters which are gods themselves, and they are guardians of Sasami.The characters overall didn't leave much of an impact on me. Once and awhile a good speech or scene will arise where a character gets some growth but most of the show revolves around Sasami and her antics of being unsocial and shut in.I enjoyed the show at first. I believed that it would be as others had acted like it was a typical crazy shaft experience. However it turned into a snore fest. This show is flat out boring, stuff happens occasional that could cause interest but it all falls flat. There is little to no comedy, story, character progression, fan service, or anything, its just plain mild. However that being said some may enjoy it. Don't be swayed by people calling it super wild and crazy, its really tame for shaft and easy to follow the action for the most part. So if your into people not living up to their potential, trying their best, friendship, learning to cope, solving issues..etc then you may want to give it a watch.TLDR: Not Shafty enough, pretty boring and mild.

Now, most people would shy away from even approaching this anime, due to its low average score below a 7. However, for a random anime I picked up due to the small hype that ran among my friends, going in expecting nothing comes out with something that is a hidden gem within the many piles of anime that are released every season.Sasami-san begins with, most simply defined, an unclear plot. The first two episodes are, simply said, extremely random. However, as a plot eventually develops, one discovers that the plot,...although with some focus about sasami\'s growing into society, is more random than the first two episodes. But it is extremely difficult to explain without revealing too much.The art, as expected by shaft, is again, amazing and unique. If you, the viewer, has seen anything by shaft, dont expect too much less, as the animation is top notch and unique as always. However, dont expect it to be as stylish and fancy as its most popular animes, such as Madoka.The sound is what got me the most. The OP i thought was great, and the ED i thought was absolutely amazing (when completely sung ;)). The anime also has a long list of popular voice actors, such as Kana Hanazawa. I thought the voice for Kamiomi was also extremely unique and hilarious.Most charecters in the anime are unique to an extent, but sadly most can be explained with one to a few sentences, as if you look at the charecter profiles not much can be said about them. But, as the phrase goes, ""There are no small parts, only small actors"", and these charecters execute their charecters so that the anime is extremely enjoyable. Kagami breaks free of the stereotypical dandere, and Tsurugi and Kamiomi, although in completely different scenarios, really manage to bring a great amount of hilarity to the anime, and although neither tends to have much of a part in the main story, they really bring a smile to your face whenever you see them appear again, just wondering on what their next escapade will bring.The highest enjoyment of the anime is most definitely, the comedy. Sasami-san is extremely funny at times, especially with the unique charecter personalities and how they interact with each other and the rest of the world. The plot also leaves much room to create comedy, as the anime mainly focuses on comedy and completes its goal.For an extremely lowly rated anime (the lowest one i have ever seen), I was suprised at how much i actually enjoyed Sasami-san@Ganbaranai, especially with the fair share of unique charecters. But, because of the randomness and dis-focus of the plot, I can give it an 8. However, if i ever have the time again, I would love to pick up the anime again and rewatch it, just to get some nice laughs and hear that great ED. although with some focus about sasami\'s growing into society, is more random than the first two episodes.

The manic, hybrid-fusion between Japanese mythology and niche, otaku neologisms. Despite the slathering-on of Studio Shaft\'s sensual sense of comedy, the light novel adaptation (originally written by the author, known as ※Akira) rivals NISIOISIN. Ameliorating common bishōjo tropes, to create a series full of twists, turns, and towering lore!※Akira is famously known for the writing the series, Kyōran Kazoku Nikki. The aforementioned series received an anime adaptation in 2008!⚠️ This review will be spoiler-free ⚠️—Story/CharactersUsually Shaft Studios is hit-or-miss for me, but I feel that Mr. Shinbō\'s animation style suites it perfectly. I wasn\'t the biggest fan...of how Nomad adapted Kyōran Kazoku Nikki, but the otaku-humor and zaniness fits Shaft\'s approach to storytelling, like a tight glove! The progression of Sasami\'s character, from being a typical NEET (with a brother complex), is framed in a grander perspective—as the plot begins to thicken and her backstory comes to light. The revelatory context, about her family\'s enclosed community and how that warps Sasami\'s view-of-the-world is very disturbing, at first. By the end of the series, the finale makes the harsh reality easier to accept.There are clashes between deities, who make grandiloquent entrances, akin to the eccentric characters in the Monogatari series. Every character has a strong aura and a duplicity of traits and hang-ups! There\'s even a character that struggles with being intersex! To be more specific, she is what is referred to in Japan as a ""※hangetsu"" (半月, half-moon). All the while, Sasami is blissfully unaware of her own abilities.※In my ""Intersexuality in Anime"" essay, I go more in detail about this mythological trope. There\'s a karate technique with the same name, but it\'s also a term used to describe a person who changes genders, with the differing moon phases.Whether it be from a chocolate-covered dragon that is accidentally summoned, to the ghost of Sasami\'s deceased mother, to Kagami\'s detachable homing missiles... this show is very weird, but in a way that\'s palatable. Some issues that I have had with past scripts, that Shaft has adapted is, this: the experimental nature of series feel contrived. With Sasami-san@Ganbaranai, the avant-garde explorations feel exceedingly natural with the characters and setting.—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Akiyuki Shinbō (director), notable works:* 3-Gatsu no Lion (series)* Arakawa Under the Bridge (series)  ✅* Cossette no Shōzō* Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko* Detatoko Princess* Fate/Extra: Last Encore* Ginga Ojō-sama Densetsu Yuna: Shin\'en no Fairy ✅* Hidamari Sketch (series)* Katteni Kaizō* Kōfuku Graffiti* Kubikiri Cycle: Aoiro Savant to Zaregototsukai* Mahō Sensei Negima!: Mō Hitotsu no Sekai* Mahō Sensei Negima!: Shiroki Tsubasa Ala Alba* Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha ✅* Mahō Shōjo Madoka★Magica ✅* Mahō Shōjo Madoka★Magica (film series) ✅* Maria†Holic (series) ✅* Mekakucity Actors* Metal Fighter Miku* Monogatari (series) ✅* Natsu no Arashi!

The biggest flaw in the series is the confusing composition of certain scenes. Perhaps, in this regard, ""Sasami-san"" should have been longer. The series composition often felt like it had entire novels crammed into a single episode. Episode 7 is one of the most egregious examples of this! There was so much information and dialogue in that one episode, that I had to rewatch it to understand what was going on in the plot.Kana Asumi as Sasami Tsukuyomi, notable roles:* Mio Kitahara, Ano Natsu de Matteru ✅* Yū Kōtari (""Strength""), Black★Rock Shooter ✅* Kana Ushiro, Bokura no ✅* Arnval Mk.2, Busō Shinki* Blanc, Hyperdimension Neptunia ✅* Kyōko Todayama, Ebiten: Kōritsu Ebisugawa Kōkō Tenmonbu* Aina Yoshiwara, Grand Blue* Nyaruko, Haiyore!

Great job!Conclusively, I would recommend this series to anyone who wants a series drenched with a contemporary take on Japanese deities, and doesn\'t mind the prevalence of ecchi in the narrative. Even with Shaft\'s definition of original, ""Sasami-san@Ganbaranai"" takes originality to a new level. Very slapstick, sometimes serious, occasionally geeky, with a milieu all its own! I give the series a solid 6/10!Rating: ★★★☆☆ of how Nomad adapted Kyōran Kazoku Nikki, but the otaku-humor and zaniness fits Shaft\'s approach to storytelling, like a tight glove! The progression of Sasami\'s character, from being a typical NEET (with a brother complex), is framed in a grander perspective—as the plot begins to thicken and her backstory comes to light. The revelatory context, about her family\'s enclosed community and how that warps Sasami\'s view-of-the-world is very disturbing, at first. By the end of the series, the finale makes the harsh reality easier to accept.There are clashes between deities, who make grandiloquent entrances, akin to the eccentric characters in the Monogatari series. Every character has a strong aura and a duplicity of traits and hang-ups! There\'s even a character that struggles with being intersex! To be more specific, she is what is referred to in Japan as a ""※hangetsu"" (半月, half-moon). All the while, Sasami is blissfully unaware of her own abilities.※In my ""Intersexuality in Anime"" essay, I go more in detail about this mythological trope. There\'s a karate technique with the same name, but it\'s also a term used to describe a person who changes genders, with the differing moon phases.Whether it be from a chocolate-covered dragon that is accidentally summoned, to the ghost of Sasami\'s deceased mother, to Kagami\'s detachable homing missiles... this show is very weird, but in a way that\'s palatable. Some issues that I have had with past scripts, that Shaft has adapted is, this: the experimental nature of series feel contrived. With Sasami-san@Ganbaranai, the avant-garde explorations feel exceedingly natural with the characters and setting.—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Akiyuki Shinbō (director), notable works:* 3-Gatsu no Lion (series)* Arakawa Under the Bridge (series)  ✅* Cossette no Shōzō* Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko* Detatoko Princess* Fate/Extra: Last Encore* Ginga Ojō-sama Densetsu Yuna: Shin\'en no Fairy ✅* Hidamari Sketch (series)* Katteni Kaizō* Kōfuku Graffiti* Kubikiri Cycle: Aoiro Savant to Zaregototsukai* Mahō Sensei Negima!: Mō Hitotsu no Sekai* Mahō Sensei Negima!: Shiroki Tsubasa Ala Alba* Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha ✅* Mahō Shōjo Madoka★Magica ✅* Mahō Shōjo Madoka★Magica (film series) ✅* Maria†Holic (series) ✅* Mekakucity Actors* Metal Fighter Miku* Monogatari (series) ✅* Natsu no Arashi!

The biggest flaw in the series is the confusing composition of certain scenes. Perhaps, in this regard, ""Sasami-san"" should have been longer. The series composition often felt like it had entire novels crammed into a single episode. Episode 7 is one of the most egregious examples of this! There was so much information and dialogue in that one episode, that I had to rewatch it to understand what was going on in the plot.Kana Asumi as Sasami Tsukuyomi, notable roles:* Mio Kitahara, Ano Natsu de Matteru ✅* Yū Kōtari (""Strength""), Black★Rock Shooter ✅* Kana Ushiro, Bokura no ✅* Arnval Mk.2, Busō Shinki* Blanc, Hyperdimension Neptunia ✅* Kyōko Todayama, Ebiten: Kōritsu Ebisugawa Kōkō Tenmonbu* Aina Yoshiwara, Grand Blue* Nyaruko, Haiyore!

But if you can follow the pace of this anime, it's actually really good. There's a complex plot that keeps on unfolding, with the addition of humor and some classic tsundere/incest moments for the people that enjoy those things. It's a blend of a lot of things, so every person can find at least one thing that they like or want to watch in the anime. "", ""I almost dropped this on the first episode. Thought I was waching one kind of show and then it abruptly become something completly different without much explination. Thats no bad if you do it right, but this were not the case. The stupid characters (Only Sasami seems fine), the crazy random events and the incest jokes doesn't helped either. But I rarely judge by one episode, so I continued watching and soon found it somehow pretty enjoyable. The show manages to be always cleverly surprising and keeps improving on each episode. And even when there is not a propper plot underneath, there is a lot...of mistery and touchy moments and I was always looking fordward to know what happens next. Characters don't get much better though. They just don't have enought screen-time to develop themself, even when all of them have a rich back-story. Still, the show is pretty good overall. If you have no problem with no-linear story-telling, give it a chance and don't get fooled by the firsts episodes.On more thing, I think the show was tagged wrong: 'dementia' its probably a more proper label. Also, don't expect any romance. of mistery and touchy moments and I was always looking fordward to know what happens next. Characters don't get much better though.

What I didn\'t expect was a bizarre mix of sci-fi and Shinto.Visually, this is some of Shaft\'s finest work. I loved the character designs, the mecha, and the backgrounds-- almost everything was very well polished, even the patented Shaft Neckbreaker Pose (TM). There was one filler frame (or animation hiccup) in broadcast, but in an understandable spot (at least they had the keyframe), and nothing that would actually break the illusion.Episode 1 is basically the overture (to yet again abuse that opera reference). We are...introduced to not only the world and characters, but also their dynamics (basically Onii-chan is everyone\'s whipping boy). In order to begin to get a grasp on the setting and premise of the show, you have to watch episode 2\'s opening monologue... and if you\'re like a lot of people, you might not want to sit through roughly 3 minutes of Sasami explaining stuff. (I\'m fine with it as long as it\'s not a kabuki actor doing it, but then, I\'m a little weird)The animation is in the style of Negima!? and the Monogatari series, which probably means that there are staff members who worked those series-- a typical scene trades wide shots showing everyone with close-ups of detail or reactions, often exaggerated or in the styles of iconic manga artists. While not quite as avant-garde as Monogatari\'s fight scenes (which used words well before Aquarion season 3 made it stale), the battle scenes are large-scale and rich in detail.Prior to Sasami-san, I don\'t remember Kana Asumi playing a brooding, sarcastic character like this. Considering her prior roles, she probably wouldn\'t come up readily in casting, but she took to the role and stretched herself well, delivering one of her best performances. Unfortunately her later non-Yuno appearances started to sound like Sasami, and I was like ""Time for non-hardworking basketball...""The soundtrack isn\'t particularly memorable, but does a reasonable job of matching the scenes. The opening... I guess it\'s a good contrast? It felt like the opening to Elemental Gelade (tempo and instruments). The ending, though. Each episode has the same ending tune, but whether Sasami sings depends on her mood (and usually she doesn\'t sing). The ""next episode"" previews are always something to look forward to, and showcase Shaft\'s unique sense of humor.At first glance, ""Ganbaranai"" sounds like ""Why bother, why try hard?"", but there\'s a ""You\'ve done your best, you\'ve earned a good rest"" angle that is repeated through the show, and the first meaning is often a punch line. This, right here, is the essence of the show. At first glance Sasami or another character seems to have given up (this comes up a number of times), but in reality they\'ve all struggled in unimaginable ways, and they\'ve more than earned a break from trying hard. introduced to not only the world and characters, but also their dynamics (basically Onii-chan is everyone\'s whipping boy).

All the later comedies though had a far more narrowed space to move, and without ever trying to flesh out their characters past the first dimension, or at least having a plot to keep you interested, they ended up becoming boring much sooner. This problem is inherited to their current comedy, which is about a shut-in girl. Just how long can they stretch this joke before it becomes boring; especially when SZS already had such a character? The very first episode is pretty much telling you “Not even 10 minutes.”CASTThere are no characters in this show, unless you can call generic caricatures defined by one stereotype and one personality quirk as such. In case you do, there are 5 of them.- One is a shut-in girl who spends her life indoors and stalks her brother with hidden cameras. She sees him as her slave and doesn’t want anyone to be interested in him; thus she is a spoiled, arrogant, selfish brocon.- The second is said brother, a major siscon who does nothing all day besides trying to please her sister. He loves to hide his face from the camera for no real reason. Probably a parody of the faceless hero in hentai games.- The others are three underage sisters who are all very interested in the brother. They do a lot of things to attract his attention but he is stuck to thinking only of his sister to care.There, that was all I can say about them. Very eccentric in whatever they do based on the one and only stereotype they are made up from and absolutely nothing more. Oh, they are also supposed to be gods but this has as much importance as everything else in the show. Absolutely none.SCRIPTThere never was plot or development in any SHAFT comedy, and this one is following the tradition. It’s complete randomness. All you get is four underage girls messing with the life of a faceless deviant adult in a completely random succession of scenes and plots. And sure, reality keeps messing up because they are gods but this doesn’t add anything to the setting; it just excuses the randomness and shallowness. It doesn’t even attempt to criticize society or otaku culture like SZS did. In the contrary, it makes it look like it’s fun to be a hikikomori. It just oversexualized major social problems Japan faces and threw them in your face expecting you to find that funny. It isn’t.PRODUCTION VALUESMinimalistic, artsy, full of filters, but surely no longer that special after all the similar yet inferior to SZS comedies SHAFT made. Good voice acting, forgettable songs, the whole thing looks like a parody of hentai games.LEGACYA forgettable series.

Weird direction, overly-dramatic animation and sleek style is the signature of the studio and big names such as Monogatari, Madoka Magica and Nisekoi all benefited from this.In this review though, we look at a less-known title of theirs, where they decided to crank the dial of crack in whatever they\'re smoking up to 11. Of course, the title I\'m referring to is ""Sasami-san@Ganbaranai"".The anime is about a girl named Sasami who we first meet as a shut-in NEET living a comfy life under...the care of her slightly mad-with-passion brother. She doesn\'t feel like trying hard at life, but eventually weird things start to happen in the world around Sasami and it\'s up to her and the gang to get to the bottom of it. Each character in this anime is designed as an exaggeration of an exaggeration. I have to admit it can be off-putting to those not used to it, but for me, I found it very charming and amusing to see these walking caricatures go about their insane lives. In essence, it\'s all good parodical fun whenever they are on screen.In regards to the story, I think this is where most would have trouble. To boil it down, the story is basically a Touhou fan-fiction written in Monogatari style. The anime tells a continuous story but doesn\'t use the traditional format of arcs or sequential events. The anime appears to be impulsive in what it is showing and it\'s sort of up to you to keep up with the pace that it dishes the content at. To me, this made the anime feel energetic and engaging, but I can understand that it can be frustrating for those not used to it. Also, while not an obligation, the anime assumes you have some basic knowledge of Shinto and general mythology, since it touches up and parodies those subjects often. Still, it\'s not like you need in-depth understanding, but it would enhance the experience. Overall, the story is great and while not spectacular, it has a good ending.Moving on, the strongest aspect of this show is its art-style which feels sharp, eye-catching and fresh. The characters were designed by Hidari, who has worked extensively on the Atelier series and Fire Emblem as a character design and it definitely shows in how sleek the character designs are. SHAFT was able to fully capitalize on this and flexed their creative muscle when it comes to animation and direction. Action scenes are well-fleshed out and dynamic, while slow talking scenes have micro-movements and nice cuts to keep the watcher visually engaged. SHAFT did an excellent job animation-wise and it is apparent that they had a lot of fun working on this, fun that you as a viewer can easily experience second-hand.The anime just oozes charm and soul and no where is this more apparent than the ED and previews at the end of each episode. They usually use that space to meme about what you just watched, while also giving commentary on the ongoing events in the anime. This used to be common in the 90\'s, but to see it being done in 2013 just felt melancholic and soulful to me. The episodes themselves are also full of comedy, which can be quite raunchy at times. I just loved that since it gave the perception that the anime was not holding back in doing what it wants to do!Overall, Sasami-san@Ganbaranai is yet another unique delivering from SHAFT. It feels similar to Monogatari (on Crack) in many ways, but I think it can stand on its own legs as an amusing parody of modern society and ancient mythology. For those looking for something with a lot of energy, fun and style, then be sure to give this anime a try! the care of her slightly mad-with-passion brother.

So here we go.This show is a bit of a mess. It’s a light novel adaptation by Shaft with a bit of action, a bit of fanservice, a bit of drama, and a LOT of Japanese mythology to completely go over my head. Sasami, our cute little protagonist voiced by my beloved Kana Asumi, becomes a NEET after running away from her responsibility of becoming the next tsukuyomi shrine goddess. The rest of the...cast includes Sasami’s faceless, siscon brother and the three Yagami sisters, which consists of a robot, a perverted high school teacher, and a blonde binbo who is also apparently 9 fucking years old.I can’t say I was ever really emotionally invested in this show, and frankly, if this wasn't made by Shaft, I probably wouldn't have liked it at all. But it is a Shaft show, and so I ended up taking 468 screenshots of it in total. Yep, you heard me right. FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT. So if nothing else, it was very good wallpaper fuel.“In the previous episodes, stuff happened” -Sasami in the episode 11 preview. So true. That pretty much sums up my thoughts on the actual plot of this show. The first half is pretty unfocused, just sort of feeling like whatever crazy shit the author was thinking of at the time, but  episode 6 onward becomes more focused by way of two arcs. The first being about the conflict between Sasami and her mother caused by the whole ordeal at the shrine. Some time travel shenanigans ensue, and it’s eventually resolved. This was the weakest part of the show in my opinion. It’s more serious and just not super compelling. The animation quality also fell off pretty hard during this middle section because Shaft moment. I guess it did have a decent message somewhere along the lines of escapism bad and why being an overly authoritative parent is bad.The last arc involves this girl Edogawa who grows a dick sometimes because reasons. She also wants to destroy the world because uh… reasons. I’m being vague because I actually don’t remember the exact details of what happens in this arc. I did like it more than the previous one though, and Edogawa has a fun personality and great design (all the characters do in fact). The action climax of this arc and end of the show is pretty eh for reasons I’ll explain below.My problem with the action scenes is that due to the characters' god-like powers (did I mention that before?), there really isn't any stakes, and it’s not like these powers are ever really fully explained. It’s at its best when it just goes full weird, like in episode 1 with all the chocolate stuff. The second half of the show tones down the weirdness a bit, replacing it with weaker drama.I know this review sounded mostly negative, but trust me, I did overall like this show. But do I recommend it? If you like SHAFT and weird shit in general, then sure. Otherwise, you probably won’t get much out of it.Thanks for reading my unmotivated@review that I cobbled together over the course of a couple months when I remembered it was actually something I was trying to write. I don’t think it turned out very well but at least it’s something. It is in fact words on a page. cast includes Sasami’s faceless, siscon brother and the three Yagami sisters, which consists of a robot, a perverted high school teacher, and a blonde binbo who is also apparently 9 fucking years old.I can’t say I was ever really emotionally invested in this show, and frankly, if this wasn't made by Shaft, I probably wouldn't have liked it at all.

Everything it\'s as if I\'m supposed to know previews events or entities that are presented. It has this monogatari series feel to it (hell it\'s even has the same animation studio), but having only one season so clustered with information and things that...are never explained just makes this anime fall real deep into oblivion.In short, Sasami-san has lots of potential that was and will sadly never be explored, it\'ll stay as this ""special"" anime that couldn\'t be what it could are never explained just makes this anime fall real deep into oblivion.In short, Sasami-san has lots of potential that was and will sadly never be explored, it\'ll stay as this ""special"" anime that couldn\'t be what it could']"
Shugo Chara! Party!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7082/Shugo_Chara_Party,"['I consider myself someone who believes in reason and poise in his reviews, and therefore I will try to hold myself to such decorum and not break down crying like a 5-year-old girl who skinned her knee.Oh who am I kidding. THEY CANCELLED SHUGO CHARA!!!! T____TI knew the very moment I was asked if I was ""shugo-genki"" that hell had found one of my favorite magical girl series to date and placed its icy grip around its throat mercilessly. I watched in horror as the main character was reduced to an obligatory stand-in. I watched as Ikuto disappeared entirely. I watched as the Guardians followed...in suit. I watched as those hellish cosplaying twits sucked up the airtime. And I watched as Pucchi Puchi became what I looked forward to more than the actual series. I knew Shugo Chara, and this was not Shugo Chara.Laying blame will do no good, as we all know by now that blame deserves to go to a variety of sources. The existence of Rikka and Hikaru is most notable and seems a good launch point. Obviously, Shugo Chara is a show for children, but one of the show\'s biggest strengths was that none of the characters seemed to pander toward children. They tackled age-appropriate issues with a surprising amount of respect and understanding, and most notably without any condescension or beating the moral into the audience. Rikka and Hikaru did everything in their power to subvert this into oblivion. Cliched as they were at the start, they wasted no time beating the lesson of the day into us every week, were childish to the point of pandering, and just overall irritances who seldom grew as characters. This would not be so bad if the cast I had grown to adore was there to pull me through it, but they were all systematically removed and never heard of again. By the end, there were episodes that only had Amu, her Shugo Chara, Rikka and Hikaru. I weep.The story... what story? This was pure filler and not even good filler like the Lulu arc in Doki!... yes I liked the Lulu arc. It dragged, but I\'ve seen much worse. Case in point, Rikka and Hikaru. This wasn\'t so much a story arc as it was just episodic nonsense, often covering ground that the series had already covered, just with younger and more irritating characters. This was offset by the somewhat enjoyable Pucchi Puchi segments. Miki\'s Laboratory and Shugo Bomber were two recurring stories in Pucchi Puchi I was always happy to see. Shugo Bomber especially, if solely for the Commissioner, which single-handedly made Su my favorite of the charas. But I digress.What held this sloppy execution together was the young girl singing troupe, Shugo Chara Egg, and make no exaggeration when I say this is the go-to con point for anyone who suggests live-action and anime can coexist in the same series. The four girls are annoying, uninteresting, and Spade at times looks like she\'s thinking she\'s made a terrible life decision. Newsflash, honey. You did.Shortcuts in art appeared incredibly early when opening sequences turned into clip shows. Frozen imagery moved around like Satelight had suddenly inherited the budget of an early Shinbo Akiyuki show. The vibrant world of the series became increasingly dull to the point that they just couldn\'t hide it by the end. A shame, really.The soundtrack was still enjoyable, but I had grown to love the songs throughout the series. Even the Guardians 4 OPs in Doki!, but by the end everything felt painfully generic to the point of terrible, Nana Mizuki\'s last song, while pretty, was not the Utau we had come to know, and Buono! is pretty much gone outside the final ED for each episode.In one episode of Party!, Amu told Utau that doing something different could be good. If Party is any indication, Amu lied. Party took the formula of the series, tried and true through two seasons, and ruined it with live-action and horrendous filler. The only redeeming point here is Pucchi Puchi, and only then, mostly for Shugo Bomber. Why I\'m giving this the rating I\'m giving it is both because of Pucchi Puchi and out of respect for the series I loved and the characters it mercilessly tossed to the wolves. Only the diehards will make it through this, and then, only they will be the ones to weep for the commercialization and utter mistreatment of such a wonderful little show about growing up and being yourself.Why, Shugo Chara? Why did you unlock my heart only to rip it out of my chest, throw it to the ground, and tap dance on it?Overall, Shugo Chara Party! gets a 5 out of 10. in suit.

Doki, she was a filler character, along with the whole plot behind her. Shugo Chara! Party! is also a filler, but it is a very BAD filler.Not only, by making Rikka, do they get contradict things that were explained earlier in the series, but they ruin the original plot from the manga. It has NOTHING to do with what happened in the manga! It's completely different. This wouldn't be as bad if it was actually ENTERTAINING! Not only that, but over half the...show is full of cosplayers who are also terrible actresses, and a corny, poorly drawn cartoon. Even when I skipped the cosplaying and corny cartoon, I was still very disappointed. Way to ruin a great anime, and manga.I tried to force myself to watch it, at least until I got past the episode about my favorite character, but it was so awful, I couldn't even manage that.They might as well get the manga, rip it apart, stomp on it, throw it in a fire, and when the fire goes out, dance on the ashes. That is how much respect they showed the manga. show is full of cosplayers who are also terrible actresses, and a corny, poorly drawn cartoon.

That is how much respect they showed the manga."", ""For those of you who have been watching Shugo Chara!, you may have noticed that it's starting to get cuter and fluffier. Shugo Chara!!! Dokki Doki is no exception.At first, it seemed as if the plot the anime was following was going to catch up with she manga story line soon, but that won't be happening. Similar to the story arc with Lulu, another anime-original character has been introduced: Rikka, a bubbly second-grader who can see Shugo Charas and understand X Eggs and X Charas. It's original, but throws the anime off track from the plot line most fans of the series want.To add to...this, there's a new anime within the anime: Shugo Chara! Pucchi Puchi. It's a cheesy attempt to make the series more appealing to younger fans, and thus, there isn't much the older fans, like me and probably the majority of you reading this, will find interesting about it. Unless you want to watch an over-done mini-anime that focuses on the Shugo Charas, I suggest you skip the first nine minutes of each episode.I have nothing against the art. It's fairly standard shoujo anime art, just like the art from Shugo Chara! and Shugo Chara! Doki.As for the music, things begin to get strange. Now there are two openings. Yeah, you read that right: TWO OPENINGS. The first opening, which comes before the Pucchi Puchi segment, is a bit odd. The second is by far better. It's not as cutesy as the previous Shugo Chara! Doki openings, and definetly not another attempt to draw in younger fans like the Pucchi Puchi opening. The end song, sung by Buono!, is reasonable.As I mentioned before, an anime-original character, also reffered to as a filler character, has been introduced in order to make up for the sudden advance in plot in the previous ten or so episodes. Just because Rikka is a filler girl doesn't mean she isn't well developed. I can already tell that this story arc will be interesting, and that Rikka isn't just a character that will be left undeveloped.One of the most annoying things was the three Shugo Chara Egg! members popping up throught the episode. In between the Pucchi Puchi segment and the anime itself, and before and after the entire episode. It's a lot more fun to mock them than to take them seriously. The epsode itself wasn't so bad.Bottom line: Skip Pucchi Puchi and just watch the episode. Don't waste your time with the fluffy stuff. this, there's a new anime within the anime: Shugo Chara! Pucchi Puchi. It's a cheesy attempt to make the series more appealing to younger fans, and thus, there isn't much the older fans, like me and probably the majority of you reading this, will find interesting about it. Unless you want to watch an over-done mini-anime that focuses on the Shugo Charas, I suggest you skip the first nine minutes of each episode.I have nothing against the art. It's fairly standard shoujo anime art, just like the art from Shugo Chara! and Shugo Chara! Doki.As for the music, things begin to get strange. Now there are two openings. Yeah, you read that right: TWO OPENINGS. The first opening, which comes before the Pucchi Puchi segment, is a bit odd. The second is by far better. It's not as cutesy as the previous Shugo Chara! Doki openings, and definetly not another attempt to draw in younger fans like the Pucchi Puchi opening.

No offense to those of you who found it appealing, or equally appealing, as its first two seasons.The first thing I hated when I watched the first episode was that there were  girls cosplaying as three of my favourite shugo charas; Ran, Miki, and Su. What happened to the three of them starting off the episodes? I showed it to my friend, who also watches Shugo Chara, and she found it slightly revolting. She said it seemed more like a music video than an anime itself.Secondly, the actual...anime only had like, 10 minutes of airtime. How is the plot going to develop if it only has that limited amount of time frame? There's still so much we don't know. Like, did Ikuto go and find his father? When will the other guardians find out the secret Nagi's hiding?And, I'm sure, like myself, there are a number of you who want to see development in the love triangle of Ikuto, Amu, and Tadase.So, for now, I'll give the season an overall of 6. anime only had like, 10 minutes of airtime.

I discovered it when it was about in episode 80. I fell in love with the show. It was cute, funny, magical, and adorable. This was the very first anime that really did encourage the romance of a young girl and a older guy.As each episode went by, everything started changing, and getting worse. As soo as Ikuto was gone and the show became a filler-marathon. I was pissed!In my opinion, Ikuto made the show. He made it interesting!I dont want to spoil anything else, but, the worst part about this show is that.THEY MADE THIS SHOW...START SO GOOD, AND MAKE IT END SO BAD! START SO GOOD, AND MAKE IT END SO BAD!', 'After the complete fail ending they gave me in Doki, I was originally looking forward to Party. Maybe they\'d fix it. Maybe they\'d manage to bring back the scenes that were supposed to be there in the first place and actually try to follow the manga somewhat.It did not occur to me that they would only make it a million times worse.Even aside from the cosplay and Puuchi-Puuchi...which, in essence, succeeded in turning this once awesome anime into a show for preschoolers...the anime itself is the most disgraceful excuse for a Shugo Chara season I\'ve ever seen. It is made up entirely of filler. It\'s...as if the writers all said, ""Alright, fans want more. How can we give them more and still do as little and crappy a job as possible?"" ""Hey, how about we bring in a totally new random character, bring back old story arcs from the original series and compress them into meaningless ten minute episodes, and make the entire season about something that has no impact on the storyline whatsoever? They\'ll never notice the difference!""People have been complaining about Ikuto leaving. What they don\'t seem to get is that him leaving isn\'t the problem--it\'s how he left. And the main difference here is in how the manga did it, and how the anime did it.Manga: Amusement park scene. Airport scene. Where Ikuto actually explains where he\'s going, Amu gets UPSET and runs off, catches up him later at the airport.Anime: Ikuto: ""I have a secret to confess."" *kiss* ""See ya!"" *leaves*Amu: ""There he goes."" oh well, too bad. *smile smile*me: .....wtf was that.And then he\'s just gone. And Amu is still standing there watching him leave. Nope, no problem here at all.Does anyone else find something wrong with this?Okay, fine. So I get over this shock, start looking forward to Party. Maybe they\'ll have him come back temporarily and bring the right scenes back.But...no.Why on Earth would they do that? That would make sense!Instead, they decide to bring in a PHONE CALL--for NO APPARENT REASON except to make fangirls happy. Which they did, very much so...with a line that has unfortunately been burned into my mind as one of the most horrifying things they could do to this character.Ikuto: ""I\'ll kiss you and hug you and everything else.""me: .....................Could they have made him say something else more out of character? I dare anyone to try. The worst part of it is, fangirls are so happy to see him again for a whole two minutes that they\'re eating it right up. Never mind the fact that this line makes him seem like exactly the perverted pedophile that Party seems to want him to be. Which is just not true, and if anyone bothered to read the manga, they would know that too. What that line does is give Tadamu fans an excuse to CALL him a perverted pedophile. And now it\'s not even possible to argue with them, because Party\'s just given them the proof they needed. There\'s a reason why he never says anything like that in the manga.Alright. I get over that, or I try to. Then I hear the very last episode is coming out, with Ikuto in it, and something about him taking Amu to the amusement park. Could Party finally, finally be redeeming themselves???Yeah. Guess again.Where should I start? The fact that Tadase makes his sudden appearance right in the middle? The fact that Ikuto STILL didn\'t confess to her in the anime at all, but poked her instead and repeated his ""grow up faster"" line (which, thanks to that phone call, people have now interpreted as a desire to do ""stuff"" to her...)? The fact that Amu didn\'t get upset to his leaving at all, AGAIN, and said some bullshit line about ""I\'m pretty much used to him disappearing by now""? The fact that TADASE kissed Amu instead? How about the fact that Party had Ikuto wearing a shirt that said ""FREE HUGS"" ON IT!?!?I wish I could give a visual image of what they\'re doing to his character right now. Does ripping a piece of paper up into miniature pieces help? How about burning them? Maybe pouring water into the sink and watching it go straight down the drain...Actually, that\'s a pretty good metaphor for Shugo Chara in general. Party has now officially killed it.And poor Hikaru...they killed HIS character before the manga even got a strong hold on it. Maybe the writers missed the crucial part of the last story arc, but Hikaru has gotten his heart\'s egg BACK. His emotions are all BACK now. He\'s trying to understand them better, not acting  like an unfeeling robot. He might be a little more reserved than most other kids, which is understandable, but Party takes this to the extreme.The graphics and music are the only thing which keeps me from giving this anime an overall 2 rating instead of a 1. And even those aren\'t that great. It\'s nothing next to the original series. But they\'re not completely abominable, and I\'ve seen/heard worse before. So I\'ll give Party credit for that.Basically, what Party did was take the manga, original season, all the character development, put them in a big pile, and stomp on them. I have no idea what the writers were thinking, and I truly wish that Party had never existed. I can\'t even recommend just watching Doki and stopping there, because the end of Doki is such a fail that it gives watchers the wrong impression. The only thing that saves Shugo Chara at this point is the manga. Party seems to have been made only for commercialism and giving fangirls what they want, and if that means flinging all character and personality down the drain, they won\'t hesitate to do so. Which is pretty much what they did. as if the writers all said, ""Alright, fans want more. How can we give them more and still do as little and crappy a job as possible?""

AWFUL!To begin with, there\'s no story whatsoever. Only episodic filler that really didn\'t have to be made and it\'s incredibly disappointing. The characters meet up, shenanigans ensue, and that\'s about it. Nothing important or exciting.The art is pretty much the same as the previous two seasons, which is a relief. One thing they didn\'t manage to screw up!The music... what music? I don\'t remember any music, which is funny considering they have two opening songs! One for the live-action segment, Dokki...Doki (which takes up about 15 minutes of screen time by the way. No, I\'m not kidding.), and the other for the actual anime (which only gets 11 minutes of screen time). None of the four (they change both songs midway through) are very memorable. The two ending songs by Buono! is better, but by then I was already so pissed off I couldn\'t appreciate it.The characters are the worst thing about this whole season. Kukai, Utau, Nikaidou, Yukari and Kairi are almost nowhere to be seen and Ikuto disappears completely, only to show up in the last episode but vanish just as quickly again. I\'m not a major Ikuto-fangirl, but I was still angry about his absence, mostly because of the unsatisfactory way he left.Of all the Guardians, in the end only Amu appears consistently. Yaya, Rima and Nagihiko get little screen time and Tadase don\'t exactly fare much better himself. Instead they bring in Hikaru and this annoying, obnoxious, spotlight stealing Mary Sue named Rikka as ""Guardian Apprentices"".Needlessly to say, this was a mistake! None of them get any development and stay just as unlikable as they started out. Hikaru actually go backwards in development, appearing emotionless even though he got over that in the end of Doki!Come to think of it, Ikuto\'s character also gets mercilessly botched the few times he appears.Of all 25 episodes only three of them is mercifully Rikka-free. Episode 7 is about Nadeshiko ""coming back"", Rima giving Nagi a hard time trying to keep up the ""Nadeshiko-and-Nagihiko-are-two-different-persons"" facade, and Amu being none the wiser. It\'s also my favourite episode this season because of two reasons, besides Rikka’s absence:1. Nagihiko running back and forth changing clothes, Rima doing her very best to torture him and Amu not getting the picture is HILARIOUS.2. The slight RimaxNagihiko teasing at the end. Yes, I\'m a hardcore Rimahiko fangirl, your point?The other two Rikka-free episodes are ep. 12 and 19, and even then both those episodes are pretty much ""meh"".In conclusion, no matter if you\'re a fan of Shugo Chara! or not you shouldn\'t watch this. There\'s nothing redeeming about it at all and it\'s all just a waste of time. If Doki! didn\'t satisfy you and you want a real end to the story you should go read Shugo Chara! Encore! instead. Much more fulfilling. Doki (which takes up about 15 minutes of screen time by the way. No, I\'m not kidding.), and the other for the actual anime (which only gets 11 minutes of screen time).

I went through the tears in the dia arc, to the yelling and screaming between amu and ikuto. I was there when Amu was confused, sad, mad and even happy. From when utau through she loves ikuto. from when she hated amu then learned to love her. At the end of season 2, i was a bit sad. they ended my favorite show. i was in tears on the last episode. then i read 'shugo chara! party!' and i was happy....i was more than happy. they aired it, and i was disappointed. this was not shugo chara. it wasn't even close. it went from something for a teens to something for a 5 year old.the live-action was bad, they sounded like they were talking to 5 year olds. and just personally, i think they ruined it even more than it already was.the small segments with the guardian characters, miki, ran & suu, were amusing. i enjoyed these the most out of everything.& the anime itself which by the way, last 10-15 minutes, was not as good.the storyline? well, there is none. it is a complete filler season. nothing to do with the manga. every episode was nonsense.characters. well besides already having some annoying characters. they decided to bring in two more.

Nana Mizuki's last song was pretty, but it was not the Utau we had come to know.If i were the producers, i would feel disappointed and a failure for this season. they took something great and ruined it. you know how many fans shugo chara lost after this? i think we'd all lose count.so, if you watched the first 2 seasons of shugo chara, i recommend not watching this seasons.& if you are new, and you clicked on shugo chara party, go watch teh first 2 seasons. they are amazing.i rate this a 4 out of 10 (: i was more than happy. they aired it, and i was disappointed. this was not shugo chara. it wasn't even close. it went from something for a teens to something for a 5 year old.the live-action was bad, they sounded like they were talking to 5 year olds. and just personally, i think they ruined it even more than it already was.the small segments with the guardian characters, miki, ran & suu, were amusing. i enjoyed these the most out of everything.& the anime itself which by the way, last 10-15 minutes, was not as good.the storyline? well, there is none. it is a complete filler season. nothing to do with the manga. every episode was nonsense.characters. well besides already having some annoying characters. they decided to bring in two more.

But thanks to some encouragement, I broke down and watched it. Before I knew it, I had become a fan and looked forward to every episode to the point where I was searching everywhere to find what website was releasing the subs first. I really loved the art, the concept, the characters (especially Ikuto ^^), even the girly mushy-gushy moments. I even liked the Lulu filler, though it wasn\'t my favorite. I watched the complete second series and cried at the end because it was...so amazing. It should have ended there.Story: 3If you watched the first 2 seasons, you know the basic story- find the x-eggs and make them good again. It\'s the same thing in this, only it\'s used in a boring manner that I\'ve seen too many times before. And then there\'s the addition of the cosplayers. I know I\'m not the only one who looked forward to this 3rd season and was like ""screw this"" halfway through because of the cosplayers and cartoons they played before the actual ep. I didn\'t watch the series because I loved the chibis, I watched it because it had a good storyline. Wtf.Character: 3Ignoring that half the anime is replaced by these kids playing dress-up and filler cartoons, I\'d like to ask the producers ""Why did you get rid of Ikuto?"" Yes, I am another Ikuto fan, I just had to ask ^^  But getting rid of Ikuto was not the main problem. They completely trashed the other charas! You don\'t see the gang that Amu used to hang out with, or really her at all. You see these two kids taking over and trying to be this new generation, and doing a really poor job at that. I HATE it when they make another season to try and extend the series just because the ratings are good. No-it\'s not that. It\'s when they try to make another generation of characters to do the EXACT SAME THING the previous generation did! It\'s annoying and frustrating,which is why I never finished this season and don\'t plan on it. You have to know when to end the anime. Extending it as long as this one has been is unnecessary and uncalled for. If you really want to extend it a little, an OVA or 2 generally work, not an entire season.Overall: 3Looking at all the other reviews and hearing all the complaints, I have nothing really to say that hasn\'t been said before. I want Ikuto, the plot is overused, this filler sucks, and I don\'t like the 2 kids they\'ve chosen to be the new generation.

Sometimes that works very well, but this is not one of those exceptions.Secondly, I miss the old anime which was more ""mature"" than this season. This season was VERY childish which was definitely not okay. The new character was my first clue to the fact that this would not be the same Shugo Chara we always knew. It makes it seem as...if the introduction to characters like Ikuto and Utau was all for nothing and that their part was just cut out.Lastly, I think it was pointless for the interview with the people at the beginning, and I\'m pretty sure that the little short with the shugo charas was longer or as long as the the actual episode.Nevertheless, I don\'t suppose that it is exactly fair to judge the anime on the first episode, but on second thought, whether you continue watching an anime or not depends on the first episode. I can honestly say that I probably will NOT be watching Shugo Chara Party for much longer. if the introduction to characters like Ikuto and Utau was all for nothing and that their part was just cut out.Lastly, I think it was pointless for the interview with the people at the beginning, and I\'m pretty sure that the little short with the shugo charas was longer or as long as the the actual episode.Nevertheless, I don\'t suppose that it is exactly fair to judge the anime on the first episode, but on second thought, whether you continue watching an anime or not depends on the first episode.

The actual anime was only 11 minutes long! And it didnt follow the manga like I thought it would. And then I started to view the series as seperate from the manga, and then it was really good so I'm going to write this review as Shugo Chara Party being completely seperate from the manga.The live action segments are...horribly CHEESY and childish with some bad acting, but thank god they're only 1 minute long.The Pucchi Puchi is too cute NOT to like, and can be very funny...at times.The anime part is great. I might be the only one, but I really like the new character. Bubbly anime girls are cool :D. And she's friends with X eggs. Even more cool.

Not only will this season be filled with fillers, but there's only ten minutes of airtime in the actual anime. Barely. If I were to be specific, and take out the ending song, and the cosplayers that pop out of no where, then, oh, I'd say...about 7 - 9 minutes? Yep, you heard me right. They make you wait a whole week just so you can have 7 - 9 minutes of filler. It isn't until the later episodes where the plot sorta picks up the pace,...before just hitting a dead end again.An anime show within an anime show...How original! Sadly, it isn't a huge hit. And sadly, it's rather annoying. As much as I love Ran, Miki, Su, I would actually like to see some development in the plot. And speaking of plot, I'm willing to bet that it'll be a while before the actual, non-filler plot kicks in. I suppose that's understandable since the manga updates every month, where as the anime releases are weekly, BUT was shrinking the anime down to 7 - 9 minutes a good move? Probably not.So overall, I'd give the Story a 3. I've only seen the first few episodes, but the silliness of it is just plain obnoxious. It might be entertaining, and perhaps even amusing for a younger audience, but this Shugo Chara! fan isn't won over.As for the Art. Well, it hasn't changed much, if at all. And to be frank, it's probably the best part of Shugo Chara! Party! It's the typical Shoujo art; Not necessarily a bad thing, but kinda boring. Of course, I'm sure most Shugo Chara! fans will be happy that at least the art hasn't changed (unlike everything else...). So overall, I'd give it a 6; Fair. The art was never a real WOW-factor to me. Just likable. But beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, is it not?The music was...decent. It wasn't super great, but it wasn't horrible. Just decent. But it depends on the person, I suppose. The singing group that sings for Shugo Chara! Party! is actually three seperate groups. Guardians 4, Shugo Chara Egg!, and Buono! I find it ridiculous that they would need three singing groups. Speaking of which, not only was one group of singing cosplaying-girls not enough, they decided that they needed TWO. In the first Opening Song, you'll see the Guardians 4, lip-syncing to the song, smiling and looking 'cute'. Then later on in the episode, you'll see the Shugo Chara Egg! group, who occasionally pop up out of no where when you least want them to. (I'd recommend to skip the parts that they show up in.)Earlier, I had mentioned that in this new installment of Shugo Chara, there would be an anime series within the anime series itself. And of course, an anime series, would be incomplete without an opening song! So instead of one, you get two! What a great deal, right? Well, it depends on the person. For me, there were so many things going on that it gets a bit confusing.Besides the Story, I'd have to say the characters were the biggest fail. A new character is introduced in this season; Rikka Hiiragi. A spunky, energetic, kind second-grader. Sorta reminds you of someone, doesn't it? Basically, a Mary Sue.There's not much development between the characters (at least, not of yet), and I don't expect it to anytime soon. With only a few minutes per ep, not much can really happen. As for the others, there's not really much to them, and I don't really expect anything spectacular to happen in this season; They're same, likable, almost bordering Mary Sue, characters. Their background stories were already explained in the previous seasons, so what is there to say?Oh, and on another note, for those who looked forward to seeing more Ikuto, will be VERY disappointed. He does show up, don't worry, but he doesn't show up very often.Did I enjoy it? Not really. Most of the episodes made me want to bang my head against a nearby wall, but some were a bit amusing, though.Overall, I'd give it a 4. It's decent. Compared to the first and second season, Shugo Chara! Party is, as I've said before, a huge disappointment, but it isn't all entirely bad.

But I\'m just writing how I personally feel about Shugo Chara Party. I honestly loved this show, and Party is my absolute favorite season! Here\'s why: it gets so deep!I started watching Shugo Chara years ago (maybe when I was 13 or 14?) and stopped at around episode 98. And a month ago is when I picked it up again. And I\'m so glad I did! I will admit, I skipped the first half of every episode because I couldn\'t stand it, so I honestly have no comments about that. But I\'m talking about the /main/ thing here!...So my rates are about Party, not Puchii Puchii. (Btw, those girls looked like they absolutely hated their jobs, lol)I see that a lot of people dislike Rikka, but I honestly loved her. Even when she was annoying at times, I concentrated at her feelings! We can all relate to her wanting to be somebody, and hey, she even had self-hatred. Hiraku is also someone who I admired strongly in the show because of his strong development. Amu also grew up, and even Yaya. And I honestly was annoyed with Yaya in the past for being so... ""I don\'t want responsibilities"" type of kid?Also, a lot of viewers are mad about Ikuto not being in the Party season. Well, at least he had a reason why, correct? Plus, he was mentioned a lot!The only thing that really hurt my feels is that I didn\'t get to see a lot of things I was hoping for, but I guess that\'s okay.... (no it\'s not)I\'m trying to be spoiler-less as possible, but like I said in the beginning, this season dug deep into life! With Rikka\'s help, the show was able to make crystal clear of the lessons and morals of the episode (not every episode!). My personal favorite was the episode focused of Utau not wanting to change her singing style! Because that advice given to the X-Egg was extremely relatable to all and something that we always got to keep in mind! The most deepest thing was the symbolism of suicide near the end of the show. But I\'m keeping that as a hush. So my rates are about Party, not Puchii Puchii.

Party! is mostly filler content, with VERY little relevance to the main story. The series mainly revolves around a filler character who is training to be a new Guardian.Another very large issue I have with this show is that of the 25 minutes we get, 10 minutes of Live Action/Shugo Chara extras, 10 minutes of actual anime, and 5 minutes of OP/EP. Half the show...is not even devoted to the anime itself, but a side story/extra.To be blunt this series is entire filler, the filler from Shugo Chara!! Doki, was bad, but it at least tried to stay close to the manga as far as storyline is concerned.My main reason for watching this series after episode 2-3 was to ""complete"" the anime series.

I was excited, surprised, and kinda bored all at the same time when I heard that.Getting to the point, When I watched it I had no idea what was going on.

Then you see some thing with some kiddy cartoon and I was just thing, when is the episode starting? Finally it started and I saw some thing that had nothing to do with the Manga. This Rikka girl shows up and everything is some kind of dumb filler. The art is still pretty awesome as expected from Peach Pit and the music is still rocking too.

There's not a lot of depth to the storyline so far. There's just those animes that I get into and fall in love with because of their depth (the original Shugo Chara and it's sequel Shugo Chara Doki), and it always makes me want to give up if there's too many useless fillers.. So far it just seems like the entire Shugo Chara Party series is...a bunch of unnecissary fillers.Art (8)-The artwork was enjoyable for me, that's the strong point in my opinion. The characters themselves are well drawn and the backgrounds were well detailed.Sound (8)-Another factor that keeps me watching is the sound. I like the sound of the character's voices. The voice actors were well selected, so that none of them have particularly 'painful' to listen to voices. The op and Ed are alright, not the best out of the Shugo Chara collection, but not the worst.Character (6)-Some of the characters are unnecissary, and I feel that the season could've progressed quicker if some of them had been taken out.Enjoyment (3)-Even though the characters are nice to listen to and easy on the eyes, the story drags everything else down.Overall (6)-Shugo Chara Party is fine to watch, I still plan to see where it goes (considering it's still ongoing) and to finish out the season, however the story is dry. I don't find myself excited for the new episode each week like I have been in the past.

The first half will cover the season standalone, and the second will act as an overall review for the entire series. Please note that spoilers may be present. Additionally, the Party! review will treat Puchi Puchi, the anime segments and the live action as a single series.Shugo Chara! Party was in a difficult position from the start; needing to follow the manga and its pacing was one of its first problems, but the second was the apparent lack of faith to the manga, instead taking the series in a wildly different direction, which...was met with valid levels of skepticism from some viewers, myself included. The main reason for this is that while the series was never exactly the most mature in its original seasons, it felt like it at least had a handle on the message and themes it was trying to send. It\'s hard to convey how seriously Party! takes this, because it is such a drastic contrast from even the season prior (a mere 25 episodes prior), due not only to the live-action aspects of the series, but an apparent disinterest in continuing the manga; the last arc of the manga is unadapted and as far as I can tell, is left untouched as though it never existed. This is a true shame, because I found the last arc of the manga very decently written.At times, it can be difficult to feel like Shugo Chara! Party! isn\'t openly mocking itself or its audience, or making a parody of what it itself created. While there are references and easter eggs to previous seasons (no pun intended), the structure of the series feels as though it is written as though Party! would be a viewer\'s series introduction. For instance, nearly every major character is re-introduced every single episodes, which comes across as (and is) excessively redundant at best, and pandering at worst. Segments on the show range from decent to poor, with the live-action segments being arguably some of the worst uses of the medium this show could muster. However, this isn\'t even what I feel digs the series grave, nor is it even the introduction of Rikka and her new development, which would be interesting enough as a standard 26 episode season in of itself at minimum. No, in my opinion, what really kills the season is the wasted potential; there were many ways this could have worked and been done properly and re-invigorated the franchise without resorting to pandering or re-inventing the wheel. After all, Sailor Moon\'s live-action series is one of its arguable best versions, as it went in an interesting direction and showcased possibilities using its more realistic setting. However, Party! does not go this route.Instead, it feels as though Party! simply cashes in on the cheap allure of using live-action actresses (or, the ""Eggs""), to the point that it feels they\'re only IN the series to sell merchandise and keep little girls engaged. Aspects of the live actresses such as copying the likes of repetitive and overtly simply dance instructions, figurines of Charas from the show, and interviews with the cast members for exclusive items do not help with the insinuation that the series feels like it was only continued to sell merchandise. In my opinion, this makes the series a sellout in and of itself, and the lack of used potential that could have been here makes this series one of the worst possible attempts. Even a decent ""anime"" plot with Rikka and Hikaru can only go so far, especially considering both STILL rely on the overt use of stock footage, not to mention cramming an episode\'s worth of content into 11 minutes. In short, Party! is the series\' ultimate lowest point in my opinion, and an absolute ""must avoid"" unless there is a pressing need to see what amounts to a relatively minor plot development. As a season, Party! scores a 1/10.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------As for the series as a whole, in case it wasn\'t obvious, Shugo Chara is wholeheartedly a mixed bag. While I\'ve discussed the specific problems with past seasons in their individual reviews, one of the main initial attractions to Shugo Chara in the first place was the concept of dealing with the lost emotions of children who have lost who they want to be, which can also be interpreted as simply their personal identity. Shugo Chara\'s concept is not at all the problem; the idea is great and has a lot of potential to be built off, especially with characters such as Utau creating strong character arcs. One of the issues with Shugo Chara is that practically every other element with how it was written and executed seems to actively work against its favor. Shugo Chara has mind-numbingly poor pacing, which is terrible in conjunction with forgotten or nearly abandoned plot points being put aside for large scores of episodes at a time.In my opinion, Shugo Chara may have failed to fully explore the brand of potential that was made possible with Characters, Eggs and X Eggs/Characters. While I am not an expert on issues such as depression and mental health issues, I believe that there are multiple layers and nuances that can be explored in a cohesive manner which could have been able to tackle these issues appropriately and with sensitivity. Unfortunately, in my opinion, Shugo Chara fails to realize the depths to which they can explore, or simply that they wish to keep things light-hearted as it is a children\'s show. These, as well as a seemingly increasing amount of peculiar inconsistencies with the lore of X Eggs and Charas themselves, create an odd puzzle of the situation that causes it to feel incomplete, or that things are being half-assed as the writers go. A good example of this is in Party!, where a situation gave the initial implication that an X Egg ""bursting"" would imply the person would want to end their life, only for this assumption to be incorrect.Despite my initial enjoyment with Shugo Chara, it ultimately comes across as underwhelming, which is extremely difficult to say, as I wanted this series to be a positive experience that I could recommend. Unfortunately, it turned out to be anything but; near the end, finishing the series felt like a chore rather than a fun task, and the light-hearted excitement of watching soon turned to boredom and frustration. This was particularly sad, as if executed better, this could have been a true masterpiece. The score for the entire series is a 1/10, unfortunately; it may be in one\'s best interest to skip the series altogether, as a half-hearted investment will leave heavy expectations to fill that may not be met. was met with valid levels of skepticism from some viewers, myself included.

Uchuu Senkan Yamato: Aratanaru Tabidachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3071/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato__Aratanaru_Tabidachi,"['SBY: Aratanaru Tabidachi is the series’ first feature length film, and with anime, usually these are of higher quality than their episodic equivalents, since they typically have higher budgets, and the shorter length forces them to tell a complete story, and without much room for filler. Usually, I say, because Yamato is a clear exception, it’s only 90 minutes, but I was only able to watch 70 before losing interest, and in retrospect, I should’ve realised how hollow it was in half that time.The story we’ve got this time around is that the Yamato is engaging in a live-fire exercise with a series of new...recruits, Tokugawa’s son among them, and as this happens, another race of aliens is introduced, who wish to destroy Iscandar, where Kodai’s brother is stranded, and due to the position of the Yamato, with the help of Desler, they engage in a search & rescue mission, and storywise, it’s all fine, there’s nothing wrong with this premise, the only real problem is that there’s so little story of which to speak of.Firstly, it is strange that these new recruits know almost nothing about the functionality of the ship they’ve been prepared to crew, someone asks them “just what did you learn in the academy?”, and I have to agree, a recruit is obviously not going to be as well trained as a veteran, but it is peculiar just how little these people know. But the main issue I have is in the first hour there’s so much time that they could have used better, they spent about as much time talking about Kodai and Yuki’s wedding (the ideal amount of time for that would have been none at all, and this is one of many equally unimportant scenes) as they did these new aliens, all I can tell you about them is that they’re grey, and they like mining stuff. Compare that to the 1977 TV anime, wherein you saw factionalism, character motivations and strategy, not to mention the architecture, weapons and uniforms, things that made it feel alive, like Gatlantis was a real empire that operated as an empire would, and clearly with a lot of thought put into it, whereas these are just grey aliens with flying saucers, lifted straight from a 50’s B movie. Also, Kodai’s brother refuses Desler’s offer of rescue, for no reason.Secondarily, the art quality is very inconsistent, at certain times it looks a lot better than the last entry in the series, and it is a major step, but for some reason, this is only about 10% of the time, and the rest of the time it ranges from being on par with the 1977 anime, to sometimes feeling like a straight up downgrade, and as such it has an undeniably rushed quality to it. When it comes to the soundtrack, it feels equally inconsistent, but for different reasons, the music itself is fine, and it’s a good idea of them to expand the soundtrack beyond almost entirely being comprised of different renditions of the opening theme, but the problem is, the music is missing in a lot of crucial moments, while there are certain situations in which the absence of music can accentuate a scene, this is not one of those situations, in the battle sequences especially, which often went on uninterrupted for over five minutes, with no music, no dialogue, just a montage of ships being destroyed, which feels very directionless, I have no reason to have any real emotional response to these nameless, characterless aliens being killed.At the end of the day, Aratanaru Tabidachi is just very bland, perhaps it is my fault for watching a 40 year old anime, but the action sequences are unengaging, since it was the strategy and character that made them special, the enemies are as empty as conceivably possible, and there is just too much filler, it takes too long to actually get in gear and have something of consequence happen, but even when it does, there’s not anything interesting on offer. recruits, Tokugawa’s son among them, and as this happens, another race of aliens is introduced, who wish to destroy Iscandar, where Kodai’s brother is stranded, and due to the position of the Yamato, with the help of Desler, they engage in a search & rescue mission, and storywise, it’s all fine, there’s nothing wrong with this premise, the only real problem is that there’s so little story of which to speak of.Firstly, it is strange that these new recruits know almost nothing about the functionality of the ship they’ve been prepared to crew, someone asks them “just what did you learn in the academy?”, and I have to agree, a recruit is obviously not going to be as well trained as a veteran, but it is peculiar just how little these people know.

ViVid Strike! Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34812/ViVid_Strike_Specials,"['I absolutely loved Vivid Strike. After watching it twice and thoroughly enjoying the action and drama both times, I\'ve come to the conclusion that it\'s one of, if not the most underrated anime on MAL (in my opinion). With that said, the specials were a nice, fairly enjoyable way to get a little more out of the show and spend a bit more time with the characters but they don\'t really add anything of value to the story. The first two episodes take place between episodes 5 and 6 of the original show and mostly contain parts of the story that apparently weren\'t important enough...to be included in the main series. The first special does have some good action as Fuuka fights two girls in ""mixed magical battles"" instead of just martial arts. That\'s the only time you\'ll get to see some more fights in the special.The final special episode is a 24 minute beach episode. If you were hoping to see Fuuka and Einhart\'s fight (I was), you won\'t, you\'ll just get a brief summary in the beginning about where all the girls\' careers in martial arts and magical battles are going and then... a beach episode, a pretty average one at that. I mean, I\'m glad to see Fuuka and Rinne together some more, but I didn\'t get a whole lot out of the episode beyond that. Seems pretty anticlimactic to hype up a big fight at the end of episode 12, then make a special episode numbered 13 and completely gloss over it with a brief summary that doesn\'t even explicitly say who won (heavily implies who wins though).Art and sound are fine, good as the original series which I think looked pretty great and had a good opening theme (only plays in the 3rd episode of the special). Not much else to say here.I didn\'t enjoy this as much as the original series, but I enjoyed it for the purpose of completing the series and at least getting to see a little more of Fuuka and Rinne whom I\'ll probably never see anywhere else again since this show wasn\'t that popular.

Rather than simply being ""specials"" as the name would suggest, these episodes actually provide several revelations to some characters, which may not be so obvious at first glance, and even less so when you realize that: first, there are only three; and second, that only one of them is a full-length episode. These episodes aren\'t anything groundbreaking, but they help to explain certain plot elements that wouldn\'t be obvious at first glance, necessarily.The more obvious of the two is the correlation between the first and second episodes. Standalone, they don\'t do much. Together, they provide an interesting contrast:...the first shows Fuka\'s relationship with Nakajima Gym, and the second Rinne\'s relationship with her Frontier Gym. It\'s pretty telling of their contrast to show the different ways they practice, gain experience, and bond with others. The final episode is a complement more than anything; it wraps up Fuka and Rinne\'s arc and gives a worry-free relaxation ep, gathering up all the main characters thus far since ViVid (which is still a lot) for a fun beach adventure. Overall, this was an enjoyable side adventure and good as an extra. However, you may be disappointed by the filler-ish nature. 7/10. the first shows Fuka\'s relationship with Nakajima Gym, and the second Rinne\'s relationship with her Frontier Gym.

Spoon Obasan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2612/Spoon_Obasan,"[""Show of hands, who here has even heard of Mrs. Pepperpot before Discotek Media announced that they licensed it in February 2022? No? Yeah, me neither. But out of nowhere, Discotek got the license for it and put it out on Blu-Ray this past April. I thought it looked cute, and since it's based on a series of Norwegian children's books and looked similar to stuff like the World Masterpiece Theater, I decided to blind-buy it and see if it's any good. The story centers on an elderly lady named Mrs. Pepperpot, or Auntie Spoon in the Japanese version (The show's called Auntie Spoon in...Japanese as well), who lives a quiet life with her painter husband. But one day, she suddenly gains the ability to shrink to the size of a teaspoon, and often winds up doing so at inconvenient times. Not only that, when she shrinks, she finds herself able to communicate with animals. Her newfound ability gets her in all sorts of shenanigans, but also comes in handy, whether it be helping the woodland creatures with their problems or dealing with the trio of children who like to pull pranks and cause trouble. Every day brings all manner of new adventures for Mrs. Pepperpot.The series runs for a whopping 130 episodes, but if you're worried about the length, don't worry—Mrs. Pepperpot's episodes are all ten minutes long, including the opening and ending, so they're a breeze to get through. Mrs. Pepperpot was made in 1983 by Studio Pierrot, and the work they did here...has me conflicted. The actual motion is fine, the character designs are charming and distinct, looking more like something you'd find in a Western cartoon than a Japanese production, and there are some parts that are very well done, like the animation in the opening sequence. But the watercolor backgrounds are rather simplistic, looking more like something painted by elementary school students as backdrops for their school play. Plus, I found plenty of blatant animation mistakes throughout the show. In several episodes, some characters' hair randomly changes color for one scene before turning back to their usual color, and I don't mean when the characters are in the background. I mean when they're the main focus of the scene in question. In one early episode, Mrs. Pepperpot is babysitting a neighbor's baby and has to change his diaper. At one point the diaper is taken off, but in one scene, the diaper is somehow back on the baby even though it had been removed previously, and in the scene after that, the baby doesn't have the diaper anymore. How the hell do you miss such an obvious continuity error?! I don't have as much to say on the soundtrack either, other than it's pretty stock standard children's fare. The opening and ending themes are very nicely sung though, and you can thank Mari Iijima for that.If you're looking for a series with an overarching plot that's constantly changing, you'll need to look elsewhere, as Mrs. Pepperpot is pretty episodic and formulaic. Every episode consists of Mrs. Pepperpot shrinking and finding herself in some sort of situation where she has to either help someone or find a way to deal with whatever's happening around her while making use of her shrunken state. That's not to say the anime doesn't have some sense of progression or continuity. In one episode, Mrs. Pepperpot has to learn how to swim, managing to do so with the help of a frog, and this skill is repeatedly brought back and put to use in later episodes. Plus, the series does have some two-part episodes, though not much. Basically, the series just focuses on Mrs. Pepperpot's day-to-day adventures and that's it. From what I've heard, the anime expanded on the books a lot, creating tons of original stories from the ground up, which I can only assume are anime original filler episodes. I've never read the books, so I can't comment on their accuracy.With the series' episodic, formulaic nature, you're not going to find much in the way of character development, either. The characters largely stay the same throughout the series' run. Mrs. Pepperpot's husband Pot is the grouchy old man, the three prankster boys remain rambunctious and energetic, the three pets never change beyond self-centered cat, lazy dog, and angry chicken, and so on. Even the original character the producers created just for the anime, the orange haired girl named Lilje (Referred to as Lily in the English dub, but I'm going to call her by the name used in Discotek's subtitles on their BR release), doesn't have much to her beyond being a nice girl who lives in the forest, communicates with animals, and behaves far older than her age (She says she's seven years old in the show). Now, there isn't anything inherently wrong with this, but with a series that's as long as Mrs. Pepperpot is, the situations the characters get in, along with character development taking a back seat, start to get stale after a while, especially during the mid-point of the series.Which leads me to what I feel is the show's biggest flaw: Since Mrs. Pepperpot starts to lose its inspiration halfway through the series, some episodes had the writers make some characters act really out of character, to the point of having them act really mean-spirited, in order to force conflict. Even Mrs. Pepperpot herself gets subjected to this, as she's normally portrayed as a nice but tenacious and spirited old lady, but there are some episodes that have her act really mean for seemingly no reason. In one episode, a pilot (Who almost looks like an older version of Lilje) makes an emergency landing when her plane malfunctions, and Mrs. Pepperpot winds up getting on the plane and losing control of it. At the end of the episode, Mrs. Pepperpot suddenly just goes on this diatribe on how the pilot should behave in a more ladylike manner...which makes absolutely no sense because, 1. The pilot hadn't done anything to warrant such a lecture, and 2. Mrs. Pepperpot was the one piloting the plane and having trouble controling it, yet she acted like she did it better than the more experienced, younger pilot. I know Japan is really rigid when it comes to enforcing gender roles, more so than countries like America and Canada do, but that whole lecture just felt really out of character for Mrs. Pepperpot, as she hadn't done anything similar in previous episodes. In another episode, she tries to teach Chip, who is literally a two-year-old toddler, how to ski, and gets mad at him for not wanting to ski and being understandably scared of skiing. For one, I'm pretty sure its extremely dangerous to force a toddler at that age to partake in a dangerous sport like skiing. Second, most skiing schools state that the minimum age in which a child can be legally taught to ski is three years old, and Chip is canonically stated to be two years old in the show! Do you see what I'm getting at here? Oh, and in case you're wondering: The show never provides an answer for why Mrs. Pepperpot shrinks and how. I had initially thought the spoon around her neck caused it, but one episode showed that that wasn't the case.So yeah, Mrs. Pepperpot as an anime is a pretty average children's show that relies heavily on maintaining a status quo and starts to dip in quality after the midway point. But I honestly don't regret watching it. Yeah, the show can be annoying at times, but I still found most of it to be a pretty fun time. The Blu-Ray release even has some detailed liner notes on not just the show's production and reception during its run in Japan, but the history behind the books and how their author, Alf Proyson, created them. I don't know if I'm going to read the books or not, and I wouldn't consider Mrs. Pepperpot one of the better kids anime that came out during the 1980s, but it's still fairly cute and wholesome in its own way. From what I've heard, the English dub isn't very good, so I'd recommend watching the Japanese version if you can. Just be warned that the show isn't legally streaming anywhere and the Blu-Ray is literally the only way you can watch it in any capacity. Japanese as well), who lives a quiet life with her painter husband. But one day, she suddenly gains the ability to shrink to the size of a teaspoon, and often winds up doing so at inconvenient times. Not only that, when she shrinks, she finds herself able to communicate with animals. Her newfound ability gets her in all sorts of shenanigans, but also comes in handy, whether it be helping the woodland creatures with their problems or dealing with the trio of children who like to pull pranks and cause trouble. Every day brings all manner of new adventures for Mrs. Pepperpot.The series runs for a whopping 130 episodes, but if you're worried about the length, don't worry—Mrs. Pepperpot's episodes are all ten minutes long, including the opening and ending, so they're a breeze to get through. Mrs. Pepperpot was made in 1983 by Studio Pierrot, and the work they did here...has me conflicted. The actual motion is fine, the character designs are charming and distinct, looking more like something you'd find in a Western cartoon than a Japanese production, and there are some parts that are very well done, like the animation in the opening sequence. But the watercolor backgrounds are rather simplistic, looking more like something painted by elementary school students as backdrops for their school play. Plus, I found plenty of blatant animation mistakes throughout the show. In several episodes, some characters' hair randomly changes color for one scene before turning back to their usual color, and I don't mean when the characters are in the background. I mean when they're the main focus of the scene in question. In one early episode, Mrs. Pepperpot is babysitting a neighbor's baby and has to change his diaper. At one point the diaper is taken off, but in one scene, the diaper is somehow back on the baby even though it had been removed previously, and in the scene after that, the baby doesn't have the diaper anymore. How the hell do you miss such an obvious continuity error?! I don't have as much to say on the soundtrack either, other than it's pretty stock standard children's fare. The opening and ending themes are very nicely sung though, and you can thank Mari Iijima for that.If you're looking for a series with an overarching plot that's constantly changing, you'll need to look elsewhere, as Mrs. Pepperpot is pretty episodic and formulaic. Every episode consists of Mrs. Pepperpot shrinking and finding herself in some sort of situation where she has to either help someone or find a way to deal with whatever's happening around her while making use of her shrunken state. That's not to say the anime doesn't have some sense of progression or continuity. In one episode, Mrs. Pepperpot has to learn how to swim, managing to do so with the help of a frog, and this skill is repeatedly brought back and put to use in later episodes. Plus, the series does have some two-part episodes, though not much. Basically, the series just focuses on Mrs. Pepperpot's day-to-day adventures and that's it. From what I've heard, the anime expanded on the books a lot, creating tons of original stories from the ground up, which I can only assume are anime original filler episodes. I've never read the books, so I can't comment on their accuracy.With the series' episodic, formulaic nature, you're not going to find much in the way of character development, either. The characters largely stay the same throughout the series' run. Mrs. Pepperpot's husband Pot is the grouchy old man, the three prankster boys remain rambunctious and energetic, the three pets never change beyond self-centered cat, lazy dog, and angry chicken, and so on. Even the original character the producers created just for the anime, the orange haired girl named Lilje (Referred to as Lily in the English dub, but I'm going to call her by the name used in Discotek's subtitles on their BR release), doesn't have much to her beyond being a nice girl who lives in the forest, communicates with animals, and behaves far older than her age (She says she's seven years old in the show). Now, there isn't anything inherently wrong with this, but with a series that's as long as Mrs. Pepperpot is, the situations the characters get in, along with character development taking a back seat, start to get stale after a while, especially during the mid-point of the series.Which leads me to what I feel is the show's biggest flaw: Since Mrs. Pepperpot starts to lose its inspiration halfway through the series, some episodes had the writers make some characters act really out of character, to the point of having them act really mean-spirited, in order to force conflict. Even Mrs. Pepperpot herself gets subjected to this, as she's normally portrayed as a nice but tenacious and spirited old lady, but there are some episodes that have her act really mean for seemingly no reason. In one episode, a pilot (Who almost looks like an older version of Lilje) makes an emergency landing when her plane malfunctions, and Mrs. Pepperpot winds up getting on the plane and losing control of it. At the end of the episode, Mrs. Pepperpot suddenly just goes on this diatribe on how the pilot should behave in a more ladylike manner...which makes absolutely no sense because, 1. The pilot hadn't done anything to warrant such a lecture, and 2.

Stars*Collection!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50934/StarsCollection,"[""HoloStars to me, is actually better than the Hololive Girls to be honest, and that's primarily i've gotten annoyed to the cutesy, high pitched voices of the hologirls, no offense to any of the Hololive Vtubers, i'm sure they're all very good people.Anyways, stars*collection is basically just a spin off of the currently airing Holo no Graffiti, but instead of the girls, we get the guys. The shenanigans are pretty much the same, with stars*collection just being shorter because it's basically just new, though the characters are just charming as it's female counterparts.Aru-ran, Roberu, Oga, Izuru, and Shien are the only ones that have appeared...so far in the anime, but the short runtime has us peek at their personality shortly, in these 2 minute shorts. The problem with many short anime is that the characters are never really explored and that they have no depth, and by how many episodes are out (only far rip) that criticism is probably right, but that doesn't take away the actual selling point of this anime.That being cute male idols getting into shenanigans, and if you don't like what i described, then you won't enjoy this anime. so far in the anime, but the short runtime has us peek at their personality shortly, in these 2 minute shorts.

Does it even compare to beloved Holo no Graffiti? Well yes actually.Stars*Collection is more similar to a sitcom – it’s about the guys living together and their hijinks. Fret not though, despite this, there is still the brand chaos you might come to expect. The scale is usually smaller, sure, but that only makes the randomness spikes more effective as a gag comedy. If anything, it’s an achievement that Holostars managed to keep up the quality...while having considerably less cast available to work with.I’ll give out the obligatory statement of comedy being subjective, but form my personal experience I can say that this anime caught me off guard and made me laugh out loud several times.The finale is also quite nice, especially for a gag comedy series, and I'm sure it will get a positive reaction out of you if you've been following the Holostars idols.As with Holo no Graffiti, this too is made with fans of the idols as the intended demographic, but although knowing the cast from their actual idol activities will improve your enjoyment, I will actually say that this one can be watched without knowing the characters beforehand and the comedy should still work most of the time. while having considerably less cast available to work with.I’ll give out the obligatory statement of comedy being subjective, but form my personal experience I can say that this anime caught me off guard and made me laugh out loud several times.The finale is also quite nice, especially for a gag comedy series, and I'm sure it will get a positive reaction out of you if you've been following the Holostars idols.As with Holo no Graffiti, this too is made with fans of the idols as the intended demographic, but although knowing the cast from their actual idol activities will improve your enjoyment, I will actually say that this one can be watched without knowing the characters beforehand and the comedy should still work most of the time.""]"
Suteki Tantei Labyrinth,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2965/Suteki_Tantei_Labyrinth,"['I really like this anime because for me its something knew. It is unlike an other detective anime which on revolves around crimes and such. The characters have different kinds of past and it was very interesting.When we talk about the supernatural the first thing that will come into our minds will be ghosts and monsters. This anime has defined supernatural on another level which is a bit interesting. Well if you like something new watch this anime ', 'How often do you see series listed on MyAnimeList have close to no reviews? The society of anime lovers barely ever leaves a show unattended and this particular oddity tickled my fancy.I\'ve started watching Suteki Tantei Labyrinth out of curiosity. The trailer and art suggested it must have been a great show of its time and now it was my job to reveal the mystery behind the absence of reviews. After all, it also meant a great opportunity to be noticed—if I wrote one, it wouldn\'t be lost in the sea of others. Was I any intrigued for the plot? Barely.As the series begun, the...first thing I\'ve noticed was art. In my opinion, 2007 was generally the year of visually appealing series and the point when animation and digital art had completely taken over the industry and introduced the audience to the style most of the mainstream animes rely on today. Although a lover of old school, I\'m a huge fan of the stereotypical millennium anime art style. Suteki Tantei Labyrinth, aired in the fall of 2007, had also adopted the back then novelty style, which made the series particularly pleasant to my eye. It was especially delightful after Gakkou no Kaidan I\'ve reviewed a while ago.The beginning gave anime a positive vibe of secrecy and a mystery filled story ahead, although I was a little disappointed to see no opening at the first episode. I\'m that oddball who genuinely listens to the opening and ending songs, and often judges series by the soundtrack. As stupid as it sounds. Truth be told, the beginning made me tense with paranoia: will everything go wrong in the beginning or will the creators mess up by the end?It did not take long \'til I found myself genuinely enjoying the show. Surprisingly, two episodes into the anime I found myself fully captivated and even gasping as events unfolded. As a person who\'s seen a handful of series, I must admit it\'s rare to have me on the edge and truly interested at the very beginning.What had truly impressed me were the plot twists and unexpected turns. On multiple occasions I would roll my eyes thinking I\'ve already solved the mystery before the characters did, meaning the next two episodes were to drag, and every single time I\'d be proven wrong. It was a pleasant surprise and something you\'d expect from a detective anime.Another highlight should be placed on the characters. Suteki Tantei Labyrinth has loads of them and yet we never know who (apart from Mayuki) are actually the main cast or who are side characters. In fact, it changed so much through the series it is simply impossible to tell now. My biggest compliments are dedicated to the villain, though.A common thing to see in anime shows is that the villain is a bad guy no one wants to deal with as he seeks to destroy everything and everyone on his way. And so this leads to the fact the ""good"" characters only interact with the ""baddie"" when it\'s a fight time. In Suteki Tantei Labyrinth, however, the villain is actually pretty chill to talk even to representatives of the enemy. I was very pleased to see the antagonist being presented as a human being, capable to hold a civilized conversation instead of just yelling and destroying everything in his sight.However, once the villain eventually stepped into the game, the anime went downhill. Although creators clearly tried to make it a transition in a new arc, even changing the ending song, I seriously wish they simply carried on with the primary mood of the series.Now, where do I even begin with the cons? Probably the unnecessary episodes AKA fillers. Although Suteki Tantei Labyrinth is only 25 episodes long, holy molly, it\'s full of fillers. While I could understand the first episodes not contributing much towards the main story and are just there to hook the audience in, throwing absolutely unrelated episodes midway the series is just wrong, especially when the anime is so short.Next step would be the characters. Although it\'s understandable the new arc will require new characters appearing, there was absolutely no need to throw so many of them in, especially with no intention of developing them anyhow. It felt as if the author just didn\'t know how to cope with another half of anime he produced—either it was too much for him, or not enough room he tried to squeeze everything in. In the end, the result stays the same: it sucked and lost its primary vibe. Worst of all, it became predictable.Previously logical and consistent anime in the blink of an eye turned into an incoherent chaos with a bunch of new characters, new powers, new concepts, new backstories. Although I\'ve somewhat enjoyed learning more about Seiran, whose story was probably the best of the lot, it was still pretty bad. The beautiful series that kept me tense and curious were long gone and replaced by what seemed like a sloppy fan continuation. It had so very little to do with the first episodes it was awful.In the end, nothing really made sense and so many plot holes were left it made me sad.When I\'ve first started the series I did not think I would like it. I did not expect to dislike it either. All I wanted was to review it and to find out why others haven\'t done so. I can\'t tell if I came across the reasons, but I\'ve come up with an assumption.The series started great and from episode 2 I was mentally planning how I will praise this unnoticed masterpiece and recommended it to my boyfriend at once. However, midway the series it changed so drastically the previous joy of mine had vanished, leaving me nothing but a bitter taste of ash.Such unexpected let down hit me harder than I thought and in fact, I felt like giving up on the review altogether. It was just painful how an anime with such great potential was ruined by what seemed to be a careless flick of a wrist.Truth be told, I myself postponed this review for two weeks, now nearing the end of another series I watch, but eventually decided to share my insights.In conclusion, I\'m sure the anime was noticed and seen by many. The lack of feedback is likely caused by feeling cheated and general confusion of how a 10 went down to a weak 5. It is difficult to rate an anime half of which was brilliant, but the other half a disaster.Did I enjoy it? Yes.Am I disappointed? Also a yes. first thing I\'ve noticed was art.

Madhouse did a great job of capturing Santa\'s artwork on the pages. The backgrounds seem like an urban wall and tend to stick out quite well. The big problem is they captured Santa\'s art TOO well. The lips tend to look awkward and the faces tend to look smashed at times. Still, this is a passable offense and doesn\'t interfere with the enjoyment. It\'s amazing how well they designed the clothes and how well they kept up with the trends...even if everyone wore the same clothes for the whole series.The sound is EPIC. The hip hop in this anime is amazing, including songs by the Illmatic Buddha MC\'s. I seriously was digging the music and finding an OST for this anime is well worth it. There is a bad part. They recycle the music too much. It seems that I heard some of the songs more than 20 times throughout this anime. Not that recycling is bad, it\'s just that variety could have been better.The characters are really vibrant and it doesn\'t look like there are any stereotypes in this anime. My personal favorites were Haseem and Secretary, but the problem is they didn\'t get face time. Hell, hardly anyone but Kai, Mera, Buppa, and Skunk got any face time. Tera is supposed to be very important in this series but he hardly shows up at all. The great part about this anime is that you will love or hate every character. This IS a good thing.I really enjoyed this anime and marathoned the last 5 episodes today and this has officially gone into ""MY Favorites"".

The anime is a good starting point to know a bit about the characters and their music.If you already watched and liked it, then you will like S2 too. The format is the same, and seeing how our boys changed now that they are 4 years older is nice. :)About the story and characters: it's episodic, there's barely any plot. But it does the job well, which is showing each idol's personality and their relationships...with the other idols. They mostly go by pairings, and their dynamics are really nice. (I love Arata and Aoi so much.)About the animation: overall it's the typical of low budget. But hey, the characters look pretty, that compensates the lack of movement. Just look at the adults in Hajime's episode. And the 3D MVs are really good.Sound: I can't say much because I don't really pay attention to the background soundtracks, but the ending songs are really good. Then the VAs, expect a really experienced cast (since Tsukiuta started in 2013), they are all seriously good singers and voice actors.Conclusion: mediocre anime but worth watching if you want to get into Tsukiuta. It's good, I promise.

I still highly recommend that you watch the first two episodes.This is an anthology series of works from different studios and sources, with a general theme around mythology and superstition. It's more like arthouse animation than conventional shows so be warned! I provide commentary here for the first three episodes, and my overall score of 7 / 10 is based on them.Episode 1: Nobody (the original English title), or A Little Monsters' Summer (the literal translation of the title)This is a stellar work from start to finish, and it easily warrants a 10.../ 10. Created by the legendary Shanghai Animation Film Studio, this story is a twist on the tale of Journey to the West, which traditionally follows a band of four iconic protagonists. Instead, here you see the tale from the villains' point of view, showing their preparations for numerous schemes to capture the original protagonists in the days before their arrival. The story combines this with a harsh lens of modern society: it draws parallels between the monster underlings to today's workers, examines the difficult demands of the monster kingdom, and mixes in a brief touching portrayal of family. Within this story, you will likely find a sincere reflection of your life and a sense of optimism in the message.The art is stunning. There is great cinematography work (e.g., layout of scenes), good mix of different animation styles, and traditional ink-style backgrounds that all enhance the immersion of the story. Props to the sound design and voice acting too (apparently one recorded dialogue is directly taken from the classic 1986 Journey to the West TV show).Episode 2: Goose Mountain (the original English title), or Goose Goose Goose (the literal translation of the title)You are a traveler carrying geese to a village. As you walk through the rarely-trodden mountain path flanked by sharp cliffs, you encounter a mysterious man on the road with a sly face. (Basically Ozu from the Tatami Galaxy.) He wants you to carry him up to another mountain. What do you do?This is interesting. It's definitely more abstract than episode 1, but is more restrained and figurative. The meaning / message is hard to grasp, but the story will leave you with some emotions. There's no dialogue - only title cards in the style of silent films of the past. The pacing is likely inspired by French and German animation (e.g., Filmbilder & Friends) but the art maintains an ink-wash aesthetic. Overall, it's very stylized, but at the cost of being more opaque story-wise, so it gets a 7 / 10.Episode 3: Shewolf (the original English title), or Lin Lin (the literal translation of the title)This one is about a wolf who can turn into a girl called Lin Lin. It basically explores her relationship with the villagers living near the forest. There's not that much to the story, and the themes hinted throughout are shallow and inadequately explored. What's more, I felt the animation was a bit lacking, especially the facial designs of the humans, which look very off-putting. The narration is also cringe. This is the weakest episode so far, so it gets a 4 / 10. / 10.

In some ways, this is good, because it allows the other two to shine, but given how often they're on screen, it's sure to bore any long-term Aikatsu fans.ART & SOUND: 7Again, somehow, it's actually better than in the main series. Probably because a lot of it is just being re-used and re-made rather than being entirely new and rushed.  It's no masterpiece, by any means, but it's cute and appropriate.

Bakuretsu Hunters,https://myanimelist.net/anime/495/Bakuretsu_Hunters,"[""Bakuretsu Hunters (Sorcerer Hunters in english) falls under the categories of Fantasy, adventure, and comedy.This show starts off with each episode having its own plot line, but eventually once we get some back stories, the full plot comes into view.  There is nothing really complicated about the story, nothing intricate, in fact it is a very linear plot line, but that doesn't mean its not interesting.  And things do pick up a lot in the second half of the series (known as the Spell Wars)Through the story, we get to know the characters very well, getting flashbacks and such so we can have...a better understanding of the relationships they share with eachother.

The emotional/sexual tension between them is always good for a laugh as well.The art is done decently, not top notch, but for the old hand colored style, it is great.  although the personalities of the characters keep the mood up, the color schemes and overall environment of the show tends to place a dark tone which is a nice balance, especially towards the end.The sound is very good in this show.  they use of comical effects and magical ones is on the ball, and everything from character themes to the opening and closings are very enjoyable to listen to.  I have seen both the dub and sub, and must say the dub is pretty funny, they really brought out the characters with it, but the sub is also done amazingly.  I think i would recommend the sub over dub just because in the dub, Tira can be annoying to listen to, and she doesn't seem to have the best match up ever.Overall, they mix of drama and comedy is done very well, especially as the show goes on.  The secrets that some of the characters possess are also very fascinating to learn about.  A great watch, very entertaining.

Check it out."", ""Bakuretsu Hunters is a fantasy story that largely stars five characters - the idiotic and perverted Carrot, the muscular Gateau, the pretty Marin, the spectacled Tira, and the red-haired Chocolate. Together they are the Sorceror Hunters, hired by a mysterious woman called only Big Mama to police the Spooner Continent.By and large, the bulk of the series are stand alone episodes. The Hunters recieve a job from Big Mama, they go to some new town, find a new evil sorceror, kick his ass, and then move on to the next episode. These things are light and really empty. They aren't bad, they just aren't...that good either. Since each episode features a different bad guy - as well as different side characters - there is very little chance for anything to feel like a threat or for the audience to get attached to the side characters.As the series moves on, it does develop a larger, VERY epic-in-it's-scope, story, but even that feels hollow. The show's main villain is totally one-note, his motivations are lacking, and the conflict between him and the Hunters is almost never touched upon.The characters themselves are really just empty and that's what bothered me most about the show. The basic idea of the cast is nice - there's a love triangle going on between Carrot/Chocolate/Tira, but with the caveat that Carrot isn't interested in either of the girls. They grew up together and so he thinks of them as sisters, but this isn't stated until the show is practically over. Given that Carrot spends 90% of the show chasing after women, it's hard to understand why he doesn't just give these ladies what they want when no one tells you WHY he won't.Gateau and Marin have a sub-plot in that it seems like they're an item - or at least that Gateau has feelings for Marin - but again, this is never touched upon or developed. Perfectly good drama, wasted!When it's all said and done, I'm really torn on this show. If this was something I had seen when I first got into anime - if this ever aired on Toonami - I'm sure I'd be a fan. The comedy is there, there's a touch of ecchiness, there's action, and the animation in most episodes is clean. There are the usual animation shortcuts - namely repetative transformation sequences - but that's standard for anime. The twists at the ending were interesting as well. But I feel like I've seen all of this before and seen it done better.If you have nothing better to watch, then I'd be fine suggesting this. Otherwise, pass this up. that good either.

Otherwise, pass this up."", 'If I had to describe Bakuretsu Hunters in one word it would be: mediocre. The story is the cliche of a villain trying to destroy and recreate the world. I\'m sure that you can all think of several anime and JRPGs with the same premise, Bakuretsu Hunters is nothing special in that regard. The characters can be described in tropes. That\'s right, they\'re all cliches who rarely show any more depth than that. There\'s the shrinking violet, the childhood friend action girl, the boisterous bruiser, the smart guy and the crazy pervert. To be fair they all occasionally show more depth than their defining tropes,...but it really doesn\'t happen often. The art is middling, for its time, in the present it would be called dated. The mostly comedic atmosphere with occasional seriousness doesn\'t quite work in Bakuretsu Hunters. It isn\'t bad, it just isn\'t done as competently as it s in an anime like The Slayers. The comedy is generally hit or miss. There are some genuinely funny moments, but there are also some painfully bad attempts at comedy.There are only a few aspects of Bakuretsu Hunters that aren\'t mediocre. Let\'s look at what they do well first. The voice acting. All of the voice actors are competent, but a few stand out with truly excellent voice acting. Madono Mitsuaki, Mizutani Yuko, Tamagawa Sakiko and especially Hayashibara Megumi. They just do a great job. The other aspect of this anime that\'s really good is the music. To be specific, the themes. The opening is an ensemble with the entire cast. The ending is a duet, very well done.It does an equal number of things poorly. The first is the fan-service. This is one of those anime where they like to show their female characters half naked frequently. It\'s even worse in the final episode where they actually wear bondage gear, and no, I\'m not kidding. The other big problem I have with it is the love triangle. This is one of those anime where two girls, both very attractive, are interested in a plain looking guy with no redeemable qualities.There is no yuri in this anime. So don\'t watch it hoping to find cute yuri scenes. So who should watch this anime? Well there are only two groups who I would recommend this to. 1. People who love the ""villain trying to recreate the world"" plot and will watch anything that uses it. 2. People who are huge fans of one or more of the seiyuu and will watch anything that has them in it, like I will with Hayashibara Megumi. Otherwise you can find the music pretty easily and you can see the cast in better anime. You can also see much better comedic fantasy anime like The Slayers or Mahou Senshi Louie. In the end I give Bakuretsu Hunters a 5/10. but it really doesn\'t happen often. The art is middling, for its time, in the present it would be called dated.

In the end I give Bakuretsu Hunters a 5/10.', 'I really do love this show. The comedy is very tongue and cheek but yet it has a lot of interesting characters. It also has an underlineing meaning behind most of the episodes about family ties.We meet the characters a bit forcefully with some being rather pushy and perverted and others being rather expository. They imply that they have been traveling around a great deal already and so some things have to be worded out a bit oddly so we could understand them. I do have to wonder why the girls end up changing personalities when they take off their clothing. I’m also not sold...on their names being the names of pastries. It makes me think they should be French or something.I wish Big Mama would actually explain a bit more about what the flash backs are about and who the male is that she thinks about it. I also wish they would say her real name a bit more then calling her Big Mama. No offense but when they call her that, I can’t help thinking about a large black women being called that instead of her. From what I know of, she isn’t even a mother to them so why call her big Mama?The animation is rather nice, having that old vintage charm. Sometimes the characters look stiff, and other times it’s like they have runny egg symptoms. Carrot is the most out of control on the runny eggs images where his body doesn’t seem to want to keep his shape. He frails his arms around like crazy and at times looks like he’s actually broken or made from rags. The other characters don’t really have times like this (Well, the girls mostly do but not as badly as Carrot) so why change it.The English voices are alright in a bit, though Terra and Chocolate are actually really annoying. They are high pitched and rather whinny. I don’t have much wrong for the males because they don’t hurt my ears. I fell in love with Marron’s voice, the younger of the brother. The scripts are pretty forced and end up having to explain a lot sadly, taking away the charm. Other then that, the rest of it is pretty tongue and cheek with the comedy. Sometimes, how they talk is actually way too hard to figure out. They end up mumbling or screaming into the mic which makes things hard to understand. on their names being the names of pastries.

I didn't fully understand it but the epicness and insanity- you could just feel it. This was an overall very enjoyable anime it got a little slow in the middle and kinda confusing in the end but if you like epic conclusions you'll enjoy this anime. The animation is a little old, but what can you do? Some of the episodes were just plain boring and didn't relate to the antagonist's plot so i just skipped them. I would have preferred a little more action from Chocolate and Tira in...their attempt to win Carrot's love but that might just be me. Also they didn't really go in to each character's personality like it basically said nothing Marron's personality and reason's for doing what he does. Carrot's pervertedness is on a relatively low level even though this was his main attribute.  But it was a really fun anime to watch and each character fully supported the overall feel of the anime.

The main character himself is on his own personal quest to de-virginize himself, despite the fact that he's literally whipped by the Misu sisters. The storyline is there, though at the end of the series everything that they never told you about is sorta thrown at you, so much so that you could basically watch the first few episodes and then the last four and totally know what's going on. But hey, if you did that, you'd miss out on a lot of funny moments and interesting supportive characters. This is a...series you'd want to check out if you're looking for something raunchily funny. series you'd want to check out if you're looking for something raunchily funny."", 'Bakuretsu Hunters holds a special place in my heart as one of the few and better shows 2 decades ago.While more episodic than I prefer for a 26 episode show, it does have somewhat of an overarching main plot that culminates in the last few episodes. The story isn\'t quite there, but the fun part is watching the lovable main cast deal with the good and bad sorcerers in the world.And best of all? The uber epic opening and ending themes, ""What\'s up guys"" and ""Mask."" Watching either sequence still gives me the chills.I went back to watch the ending sequence of the final episode...where they played the full Mask song. Soooo campy, yet so good because of the sheer epicness of this song. where they played the full Mask song. Soooo campy, yet so good because of the sheer epicness of this song.', ""This anime is a bit too light-hearted for this genre of anime in my opinion. The main character, Carrot, spends most of his screentime chasing girls with Tira and Chocolat chasing after him and Gateau and Marron stand back and watch. It doesn't get serious until the last few episodes of the anime, and even then, it's still a bit light-hearted.The art and the music were pretty good, Marron was soo pretty! Mask was a great ending song.It would have been better if they'd dug deeper into the character's lives and their reasons for being who they are. Why did they choose to become sorcerer...hunters? And, even though they're mentioned a few times, where are Onion and Apricot Glace? They're Carrot and Marron's parents, but we never see what they look like or know what happened to them. Carrot's trauma of Zaha Torte isn't all too traumatic, and you are stuck with a lot of questions about why Big Momma hid the memories. Marron is slightly obsessed(is that the right word???) with his brother for who knows what reason. It's slightly hinted that Gauteau is attracted to Marron. Zaha Torte wants to destroy and remake the world because every person's heart has evil in it. What kind if reason is that? You'd think he'd have a better reason.The end of the anime is kinda confusing on my part. It takes place is this city that does not fit the time zone of the anime.

A gift for longtime fans who want to see more of the characters they know and love but this is not an accessible starting off point for those unfamiliar with the series....I'd give the episode a 7 but it gets a bonus point because I don't think The Feathers show up at all.
