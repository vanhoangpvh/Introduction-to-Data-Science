Naruto Narutimate Hero 3: Tsuini Gekitotsu! Jounin vs. Genin!! Musabetsu Dairansen Taikai Kaisai!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1074/Naruto_Narutimate_Hero_3__Tsuini_Gekitotsu_Jounin_vs_Genin_Musabetsu_Dairansen_Taikai_Kaisai,"[""In this special Naruto OVA, sparks fly. Literally.In the special, Tsunade decides to hold this competition where Jonin must fight genin. Which seems kinda unfair, but whatever.I was very annoyed at how it was handled. This OVA hinted at many things: That we would see some sweet Gaara action, that we would see Neji VS Asuma, that we would see Naruto and Sasuke team up against Kakashi. But this OVA didn't deliver. Every time something exciting happened, the scene would switch. WTH? And the endong ends in a total cliffhanger! Man!This OVA isn't that good, so only fans of Naruto should even consider watching. "", 'I am a diehard naruto fan, and this is the worst naruto i have ever watched, not only was the story pathetic there was absolutly no plot and at the end naruto hints that this has all been a COMMERCIAL for some naruto game. even if you enjoy naruto i would suggest just skipping this eppisode altogether. ', ""This OVA has been made as a extra for the naruto ultimate ninja 3 game, so of course it don't have a plot, the rest you have to play it. If you watch this OVA and then play the game, then you will say that its a great job, the game its like an RPG and fight game put together. About the OVA, well its an OVA, those who say that it dont have a plot, it dont go across the main story, well... you should think about what you say, and learn what an OVA is, if not, then dont even care in whatching "", 'I was really disappointed with this and regret wasting time watching it EVEN-THOUGH i am a die-hard fan of Naruto- if you can, then i would recommend that you seclude this from your pile of ""to watch"" and divert it into your pile of not to watch unless your one of the most hardcore naruto freaks who have to watch it whilst knowing that it will be placed forth at an (overall) appallingly disgraceful standard of naruto anime. ', ""This is good for the ones that play Naruto games. Specially the one that this OVA belongs.It's definitly an OVA for diehard fans. It's good if you're the type that likes everything about Naruto.I enjoyed quite a lot, it was entertaining. "", ""It was all an unsensible mess until Naruto broke the fourth wall and made an announcement for some upcoming game (at the time). It's a lengthy commercial your favorite show, yay! No, not really. Konoha is holding a global event for every Ninja to participate in, every individual is given a crystal neckless, and tasked with keeping it intact and take over the others' in hope of staying in the competition that's rewarding as a prize to make any wish they won't come true. Naruto and Sasuke, of course, start getting competitive and all, and set Kakashi as their target, hence the “Jonin” in Naruto...Narutimate Hero 3: Tsuini Gekitotsu! Jounin vs. Genin!! Musabetsu Dairansen taikai Kaisai!!.I haven't seen Naruto in a long time, but, from this, it's safe to assume that its way over the usual budget. The animation was fluid, colorful pallet and amazing particle effects.I was one to experience part one Naruto in DUB, I had no prior knowledge on what the SUB sounded like, however, I was welcomed with generous open arms, the voice acting was just as high in quality if not better.I had quite a happy time seeing all of those young characters before the demi-Gods era of late Naruto Shippuden and Boruto but still cringed very hard at every desperate attempt of throwing dull jokes, never change Naruto, never change.

Unfortunately, it fails to live up to the hype. I think a large part of my disappointment has to do with my initial failure to properly understand the nature of this OVA. This is designed to help promote and set it up its accompanying video game. This means that to completely experience this OVA, you have to experience the game as well. It's meant to be a prologue and not a complete story. Once you understand this and manage your expectations accordingly, the OVA becomes an enjoyable little adventure that promises more to come....I wish it were more action-packed, but it's still entertaining to see a lot of familiar characters engage in some lighthearted fun.

Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder The Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9988/Otome_wa_Boku_ni_Koishiteru__Futari_no_Elder_The_Animation,"['having watched the Prequel Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru, my rating for its sequel revolves around essentially the same guidelines.the one major factor that was the same in both was the lack of Romance. the title ""maidens are falling in love with me"" can give viewers the presumption that they are going to be watching a good romance series, but that only appears to be the case in the final episodes of both series.focusing now on Futari no elder, the overall feeling i got after was finishing the last episode was border lined with ""That was cute"" or "" . . . and...they lived happily ever after"". Not that i was unsatisfied with the show, but i  was left feeling that there could have been sooooo much more. especially with the relationships of the characters. along side the relationships, many of the characters personalities could have been portrayed a little more, instead of leaving the viewer with one a two impressions. Now stepping away from the plot, if i were too give this anime a score based solely on animation, sound, and art i would give it an 11. the artwork was fantastic, and the music worked perfectly with the soft romantic feel.Within the 3 episodes you meet the 2 main characters who obviously are the titular elders. Chihaya and Koruko are extremely likable characters, and in some ways complete opposites of each other, for one Chihaya is a male. Now the story does revolve around the actions that involve these two, but the other characters are what act as the foundation for their building friendship, and eventually Romantic feelings as seen in the final episode which was beautifully made, a little too coincidental, but nonetheless beautiful.My only regret about the anime is that some of the problems,relationships, and pasts of the characters could have been fleshed out more to give the viewer a better understanding of the situation the main character Chihaya was in.That\'s the end of my Review and i hope you to watch the anime as well! they lived happily ever after"".

Generally short series have the short end of the stick, they rake in nothing but dismal ratings and are average at best. Maidens are Falling for Me 2 has the same pitfalls being only 3 episodes long.A lot of what I disliked in its prequel or parent story are essentially the same, lack of this and not enough of that.The story didn\'t have enough build up time only being 3 episodes long and anything that...short gets royally shagged in the ass and has to totter off stage right. As before the plot revolves around a boy posing as a girl who transfers into an all girls school only to become idolized by the general population. The interaction between characters was the only selling point because 3 episodes just don\'t rustle your jimmies enough. The drama build up in the last episode redeemed it enough but the reality is the show as a whole is abysmal after episode 1.I\'ve always been a trap fan, some others won\'t share that love due to some incident involving lotion and expectations of a vagina. The main character is cute and the rest of the cast is cute, or moe as the common weaboo calls it. The interaction between character is average, nothing amazing or poor just average. The characters are essentially copycats from the prequel so nothing is new at all. The girl\'s love element really isn\'t present enough for this to be labeled as such since the main cast knows the situation.As before, the trap isn\'t exposed to the whole student body and that pretty much pissed me off. I wasn\'t expecting a lot from 3 measly episodes but it\'s just no fun if you can\'t expose the main event as a fraud. It\'s like ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" It doesn\'t make sense why they would make paper cover rock, it does nothing to tarnish or benefit the rock. And when you think about it, all it does is leave you with a feeling of boredom after its all said and done.Most of the animation is pretty stifling, I sense in Japan that school uniforms are generally uncomfortable if dress code is really that bad. Character designs and backgrounds are what you might except from a show about Catholic nuns but shoujo animators tried to bring on the goth loli appeal. I\'m no fan of the backgrounds or scenery, combined with the music scores they\'re almost designed to put you to sleep. I\'d rate everything average or below average.The voice actors and theme songs aren\'t anything special, performed well but the voice acting was boring. A romance needs more feel, and all these feels were not there. The theme songs won\'t be going on my favorites anytime soon but they were fair.Regardless the ending scenes gave this some shining light. After the main characters came to terms with their feelings and own wants you come out with the final end scene kiss and dual election of elder sisters. A change in pace from before but I was still craving that trap exposure. I think we all have a want to live our own lives at one point, by stepping out of your parents shoes you get that opportunity. As for the main character being forced to live the life of his twin sister he ultimately ends up in this situation. They did a good job of focusing on one relationship rather than several and I felt the storyboard writers could have given Chihaya and Kaoruko another episode.Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder had its moments but 3 episodes really weren\'t enough. short gets royally shagged in the ass and has to totter off stage right.

I reached episode 7 out of the 12 it has. I was so bored, I was forcing myself to watch more. At one point, I just couldn\'t do it. I found out it had a sequel. An ova series, based on the original, but with a different story. I searched it on youtube and after watching a cute shoujo-ai clip, I decided to watch it...BIG MISTAKE. Okay, maybe I am exaggerating, but hear me out.Story----I have no idea why I was convinced this was shoujo-ai. Because its not. It follows the...main idea of the original series, which is basically a guy, cross-dressing like a girl and attending an all-girls school. Why did I think this was going to be different? I don\'t know. Just because I am a girl x girl love enthusiastic, I wanted to believe that it would be, well...girl x girl. But let\'s focus on the story and not my confused little mind. It has a simple story, as I said. At times it got more deep and at others it was just evolving around basic school things. Was the story bad?...Emm...I wouldn\'t say it was good. It was alright. Although at the beginning I found it quite nice and interesting, later on I found most of the story boring. The only interesting part was for me, the reason why he was crossdressing. That was the part when it actually got my attention. But it was mainly focusing on simple school everyday life. It had romance, which was not really my cup of tea, because I wanted to watch shoujo-ai. And that is not exactly what you describe as shoujo-ai. So, I guess my overall opinion was negatively affected just by that fact. And I tried to let that aside while watching the ovas, but I just couldn\'t. It was a major turn off for me. Lastly, I found the ending, disappointing and pointless. I felt like it was missing something.Art---I really liked the art style. Bright colors, nice animation. It was good.Sound------The opening and ending didn\'t do such a big impression on me. They were ok, but nothing memorable. As for the soundtrack, it was nice. The voice actors did a great job. I really liked Chihaya\'s feminine voice. I felt like it fitted her as a character, set aside the fact that he was actually a boy...How do you even do such a feminine voice when your a boy?...Character--------I don\'t know what to say about the characters. For a 3 episode ova series, I feel like the development they got was fair. There was of course more development to the main character, Chihaya, which was satisfying. Kaoruko, a very important character as well, also got nice development. From all the characters, I liked her the most.Enjoyment---------So, being completely honest, I\'ll say that I did not enjoy this anime. The main reason behind this is that I didn\'t get what I expected. While I was expecting shoujo-ai, I got boy x girl, set aside the fact he was in a girl\'s form. And maybe if it was truly a shoujo-ai anime, I would have enjoyed it much more, but sadly, right now this is my honest opinion about it.Overall------""Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder"" is not a great anime. It is rather a mediocre anime. I did not enjoy it but that does not mean you will not either. Maybe it will be a turn off for girl x girl fans, just like it was for me, and maybe it won\'t. Its all up to your taste. I would not really recommend this anime, but then again, if you are interested in its unique nature, maybe you should check it out. After all, since it is only 3 episodes long, you will only spend an hour with this ova series. Now, if this hour will be worth it...I wonder...Story - 5/10Art - 7/10Sound - 6/10Character - 6/10Enjoymen - 3/10---------------Overall - 5/10 main idea of the original series, which is basically a guy, cross-dressing like a girl and attending an all-girls school.

That's why I give an 8.Overall, it's a fair ova.I suggest those who can read Japanese to play the original vn.For those who can't, this anime may be the one you can watch when there is nothing else...left. left."", ""I'm going to try and keep this short, especially since the anime is only 3 episodes long. The title is misleading just as one of the other reviewers stated. There is a lack of romance and comedy that one might expect.  There is definitely a story there worth seeing, but it isn't realized.  The viewer is left to wonder and speculate as to the what happens to our lovely crossdresser. The characters seemed interesting. I found many of the secondary characters of more interest than the leads.  How much can you delve into a story and character development in 3 episodes?...Therein lies the major problem.  Aside from that the pacing was a bit off and that has nothing to do with the length.When it comes to short series and OVAs I rate them  based on whether or not I would be interested in watching a full series with these character.  I would watch (attempt to anyway) a full series with these characters. In short it's worth watching if, like me, you were looking for something to waste time or just to watch in the moment.

Ojamajo Doremi OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12591/Ojamajo_Doremi_OVA,"[""Since these weird specials are all in circulation now, let me write a quick review after finishing them.These mysterious specials are basically what it says on the tin, they teach traffic safety and recipes. The traffic safety episodes are only available in truly terrible video quality and even the audio feels weird, with them cutting down on the sounds of the usual transformation sequences. Maybe higher quality video will surface eventually, but for now these really don't look good.Spoilers from here on, I'll describe the plot of each of the episodes:In the first episode of this OVA, Doremi receives a surprise order for a cake...delivery in a short timeframe. She manages to finish the cake with help from Pop and Onpu, but is almost out of time after doing so. So she grabs Pop and rushes through traffic, breaking all the rules and almost getting run over multiple times. When she arrives at the house of her client in time, it is revealed that the Witch Queen had ordered the cake and was watching her through her crystal. She chastises Doremi for her careless behavior, which leads to her returning to the Mahou Dou depressed. Onpu then uses magic to dress up in a cop uniform and shows her the rules of traffic safety, like how to cross a street properly and how traffic lights work. In the end, they visit the Witch Queen again and she congratulates Doremi on learning the rules and reveals that she was the one who asked Onpu to teach them to her.In the second episode, Pop is challenged by Kimitaka to a bike race, since he just got a new fancy bike. The two go at it while Doremi and Momoko watch from their brooms in the sky. Focused on going fast, Kimitaka misses a turn and wrecks his new bike. He is saved from injury by magical intervention from Doremi, but the bike is broken. Momoko then uses magic to dress up in a battle rangers costume to teach the two the proper rules of bike safety, which is again all about traffic rules.In the third episode, Pop is accused by Kimitaka and some classmates to not be able to bake like the other members of the Mahou Dou. She replies by saying she'll prove it by making them all delicious food, but quickly realizes she's in over her head. She asks Doremi and Momoko for help, and they create three dishes together. First they make pancakes, but Doremi makes too many, which leads to them making a cake out of the remaining ones, decorating them with cream and fruits. Lastly, they make little puddings that look like bunnies. Pop takes the sweets to her classmates and they are impressed. This last episode is noteworthy because it incorporates live action segments. Between explaining the recipes and showing lists of ingredients, the video repeatedly cuts to a little girl and an adult woman dressed in Doremi costumes who are replicating these recipes in a real kitchen.There is also a fourth and fifth episode floating around, although they are not part of this OVA, but instead a simple recap of the second and third season with no new animation. Doremi is simply talking over clips of the seasons and explaining it's events. I just thought I'd mention them in case you come upon it.All in all, this wasn't all that special. Doremi is a great franchise, but there isn't really all that much of it in here, with most of these episodes being focused on explaining traffic rules and recipes. If you still must seek these out for the small bits of unique story and animation, just make sure to brace yourself for the terrible video quality in the first two. delivery in a short timeframe.

Naruto: The Cross Roads,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7367/Naruto__The_Cross_Roads,"[""Unlike other Naruto Special/OVA episodes that feel kind of slow, this one moves at a nice pace. The Cross Roads managed to keep me interested all the way through and I was very happy to see that it's pretty much like a normal episode... Except for the art. This one is not animated like your typical Naruto episode. It has somewhat of a 3D-ish style to it. Although I'm usually not that big of a fan of this style, I thought it looked decent and it wasn't much of a problem when you got into the action.I had only a few issues with The Cross...Roads. For example, it had a cheap way of getting the story where it needed to go, but I guess it's unfair to expect much else from a 26 minute episode. Also, there were a couple of things that did not make any sense. All in all, I think this episode was pretty enjoyable. More so than many fillers in the anime itself. Roads.

I'm okay with the classic slice of life episodes and am also fine with the ones that add further characterization or plot depth. But with these varying expectations, the common thread is always a sense of value added--the sense that this is something that contributes an additional element I can enjoy outside of the main series.This does not have that expected value added. It's not a slice of life, and it also doesn't add anything to the current characters and plot, though it does attempt to do the latter. It...has a generic battle with generic opponents and the end goal is to introduce a plot line and characters that are already introduced in the main anime. As a result, it feels completely redundant. Its placement in relation to the main series also confuses me. Chronologically speaking, it is situated right after the Zabuza arc and right before the first Chuunin exam. But if we watch it this way, the central antagonists of the Chuunin exam arc are spoiled for us. On the other hand, if we watch it after we've already watched said arc, it feels (like I said) redundant and unnecessary because at this point we already know about the antagonists and their plan. So what really is the point of this special?The animation here is also different and resembles that of a video game, and it distracted me throughout the special.One thing I did like, however, was watching Sasuke and Naruto work together in battle. Too often we see them fighting individually or against each other, so this was a breath of fresh air. has a generic battle with generic opponents and the end goal is to introduce a plot line and characters that are already introduced in the main anime.

Too often we see them fighting individually or against each other, so this was a breath of fresh air."", ""As a celebration for the 10th year of Naruto's serialization, the OVA under the title of “Naruto: The Cross Roads” was released on the 12th October 2009 that offers something different as far as the Naruto releases go.This time around, with a flashback centered story all in a style that settles between the classic 2D and 3D animations, and it actually doesn't feel as bad as it sounds, but it was never about animation alone, unless you're just like the brats dropping their jaws whenever they spot colors, that's the power of visual, and it's easily deceiving.- Story (6.0/10):Before diving in into the story dissection,...I'd really like to warn you on the spoiler heaviness you'll encounter, so,in case you've already passed the first 300 episodes of Naruto Shippuden, this would be as normal as a review gets, major spoilers ahead, if you'd like to avoid them, please skip the story analysis and move on to later parts.The premise of the story is one short flashback of Sasuke's from the point of the story where he was a member of the Akatsuki, one that goes back in time to the much simpler times when he was still part of team 7, somewhere after the events of the Hidden mist arc and before the Chunnin exams.A lame classic plot point had Sasuke of course taken hostage by the baddies in order for Sasuke and Naruto to save her whilst Kakashi is absent. It was all fast-paced action that Orochimaru orchestrated in order to “test Sasuke and tease later events like him switching sides.It really felt like a painful excuse to milk an OVA out of all the build-up that lead to him joining the Akatsuki, with few references to Itachi and the Uchiha clan.- Art (7.0/10):CGI, and before you face the other side and start running away, it actually looked decent, not the best, One Piece Mugiwara Chase 3D had me pin it as one if not the best 3D adaptation for an already long-running serialization and Naruto tried holding on to the safe zone and was almost there.It all looked more like a game cutscene rather than a normal animated episode, keeping it as close to 2D as possible differently helped lower the strangeness of it a bit. The water mechanics were cool, the smoke animation as well. However the fights despite being a lot more fluid and organic they still felt like a stranger and took away a lot of what made Naruto fights look cool.- Sound (8.0/10):I really appreciate the nostalgic soundtracks and sound effects.The voice acting was above average, nothing too jaw-dropping. A lot of room for improvement is different there, it seems so cheap for a milestone anniversary to be honest.- Character (5.0/10):Disappointed, Sasuke couldn't be less out of character here, you'd figure they would give her a moment of shine in such an important OVA like this one, she still played the bait role after all and contributed in nothing good.The focused bad guys had terrible character designs and even worse ideology, they looked way too weak for the struggles they put team 7 at. Generally, very forgettable and interesting to say the least.- Enjoyment (6.0/10):The main spotlight here was enjoying the hand to hand combat with minimal ninjutsu (remember when it was all about that?).Probably the coolest thing was the references to future arcs, even the ones in Shippuden. Such a waste, it had literally no re-watch value whatsoever.- Overall (6.4/10):I would strongly suggest avoiding this until you've watched through the first 300 episodes of Naruto Shippuden. Despite it being set on the timeline of the original series, it does deal with topics from future arcs, even going as far as showing massive spoiler clips from mid-Shippuden.

The animation it had was simply unbelievable, and for all the wrong reasons. It\'s unintentionally funny to an extent, except the story itself leaves little room for any such ""laughs"". The action is fairly decent, but the weak 3D animation makes it easily forgettable. Only a few quick shots of jumping through trees actually feel well done and the rest of it works because the story is somehow entertaining.Naruto\'s appearance and personality, since he is a funny character, is more or less unfazed by the 3D conversion and possibly the only one that...doesn\'t feel truly out of place. Others, such as Sakura, Sasuke and even Kakashi feel too plastic and the villain is somehow fine. It\'s a simple action episode focused on a fight with villains and somehow is salvaged by the writing. Yes, it\'s nothing groundbreaking or extraordinary but still gripping enough to let the 26 minutes fly by without much of a pain. The ending music is very good.If you are a fan of Naruto, and especially its traditional yet catchy animation style, you will find this episode a major disappointment. (Don\'t get me started on how funny, though unintentionally, it is when we get to see a closeup of Sasuke\'s ""terrified"" face and instead of feeling worried for him we\'re left laughing in bits) Yet, some of the action and humor work, making this a worthwhile watch for the same reason (being a Naruto fan). Not a must watch, but decent enough to be given a try since it does take guts to try something different that comes with the risk of instant rejection from the traditional viewers.

They can really hold candles to today's animation.Design wise, this antiquated movie has better character design than any animes that feature anthropomorphic animals I've seen. It's no wonder why Pero is still used as Toei Animation's mascot.The art can't be compared to today's computer-assisted drawings, but all of the scenes...featuring buildings are top notch.

While the film series continued onward with annual releases under a slightly different name, this was the last we saw of May and Max. The first Advance film gave Max some focus, but both characters were generally reduced to supporting roles. Luckily for May, Pokémon Ranger and the Prince of the Sea: Manaphy decided to focus on her. And lucky indeed she is, because the fourth Advance film is the only of the four I can consider good without reservations.While the slapstick antics of the titular ranger, Jack, did initially turn...me off the film, they\'re used sparingly. Phantom and his pirate crew border on the ridiculous as well, but just like Jack, they\'re used in moderation and mostly in good taste. Mostly.One of the major things that make this film stand out from most Pokemon sequels are interesting side characters. The family Ash and company come in contact with this time aren\'t exceeding strange or special. They feel like normal people and as normal people, they have small quirks which the film uses to flesh them out as unique and interesting - the ways they dress, talk, walk and think. The film succeeds at painting the relationships of the supporting cast as real and fine dialogue makes them interesting enough to follow. Their distinct ""house"" is given its own visual identity, as well. Because of this, film successfuly indulges into 40 minutes of set up and casual character building.Handled wrongly, Manaphy herself could have ended up as an annoying baby and a catalyst for many frustrating moments. This doesn\'t happen. In the film, Manaphy bonds with May, and although May isn\'t interesting here as she is in the fourth season of the regular Pokemon show, she can take the spotlight just fine.While the film is plot driven, a large chunk of the middle half is spent on a journey. Here the focus is on the relationship between May and Manaphy and I\'m happy to say - this relationship makes the film shine. And it\'s accompanied by some quite sophisticated dialogue for a Pokemon film, or at the very least for a later Pokemon film. These scenes are the best that this film has to offer.Some other standout moments are Manaphy\'s search for May\'s scarf and the exchange between Jack and Ash with May joining in later. On a less positive note, the migrant family of circus entertainers has enough money for top tier sea equipment, boats and submarines. In the film they proceed to destroy these vehicles and you can\'t stop and wonder - how rich do they have to be not to even mention the loss?The last third of this film, features a fantastic sea temple and while I\'ve had my rants regarding vague magic in Pokemon before, this one\'s not a thorn in my side. ""A legendary did it"" is not the best possible explanation, but considering how the temple was used in the film, it gets a pass.In the last act, the film serves us a nice surprise - Ash acting heroic. There\'s some neat action and Ash, who usually spouts exposition while his pokemon do all the work, plunges right into the action and saves the day. While the ending could certianly do with some more May, Ash makes it worthwile.All in all, while the whole deal with nonsensical yellow powers at the end does lower the score, the vast majority of the film is nested in the fine-to-pretty-good area.

The fight scenes were, as usual for the series, very well-done, and there was a nice amount of very well-done emotional and cute moments surrounding May and Manaphy.But the best part...about the movie was the animation and direction. The obvious CGI got annoying after a while, but when it was 2D, it was top-notch. There were so many great scenes here. The absolute highlight was the FANTASTIC scenes with them going through the ocean. The music, animation, and atmosphere mixed perfectly to create some of my favorite scenes in the series.

They limit many aspects to maintain Pokémon's family-friendly spirit, avoiding complex plots to not overwhelm the younger audience with too much information. And it's a shame! Each film had great potential and good ideas, but none have exploited them as well as the 5th film and this 9th film.The story is beautiful, moving, even touching.

Manaphy is not as flashy as Jirachi or Deoxys, the Pokémon featured in the 6th and 7th films, but perhaps that’s precisely why this film succeeds. In my opinion, Pokémon movies tend to focus too much on the Pokémon they want to highlight. They try to find a story that showcases the Pokémon in question, which is not the case with this 9th film. Yes, the story centers on Manaphy, but everything doesn’t revolve around him. Manaphy contributes something to the story, and the story contributes something to Manaphy. The two combine to enrich the film's universe and plot, and that, to me, is the biggest difference from previous films. They are not trying to sell us a Pokémon and force us to like it; they are telling us its story and what surrounds it.I also found that this film had a good balance of screen time between the trainers/humans and the Pokémon. One does not overshadow the other; both have their impact on the story, a perfect balance!The animation is also a great success. I was surprised by the risks taken for a 2006 film, but without overdoing it. For example, the 4th film about Celebi overused 3D, making it quite ugly.

Senjou no Valkyria: SenVal Theater,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7016/Senjou_no_Valkyria__SenVal_Theater,"['Based off the hit PS3 video game of the same name, the ""Valkyria Chronicles"" series was probably one of the best adaptions from a game to an anime to come out in a while. Made by Sega, who ended up making their own spin on the events of World War 2. It was a roller coaster ride of emotions--from laughter, anger, pain and commitment. The series really took the audience to the next level with it’s story. Upon it’s success the actual anime series got some special side stories made for them, called ""Valkyria Chronicles: Theater"". Now if you think these specials are just something...they threw together for the sake of extras on a DVD, then you would be wrong...for the most part.Each episode is episodic, with not one necessarily leading into another. However, they take place during different times of the series. There are occasions when we even get to see a little bit of extra backstory that wasn’t mentioned in the actual anime. Whether it be past situations between characters, to the gang taking a comedic relaxing day. Now because these take place during different times of the story, it’s not really a special you should watch before the actual anime, because there are some minor spoilers to be had, especially with the last episode. I should mention that most of these episodes are in fact made to make you laugh, with the exception of a few, so the whole ""war theme"" isn’t as evident as it was in the series. The main reason why I think fans of the series should check these out, is because of the excellent final episode of these specials. It takes place after the events of the anime, and bring the series to a wonderful close. So if you’ve watched the series, and are debating on whether or not to pick up the theater specials, I would recommend to AT LEAST watch the last episode of these, you won’t regret it.The music in this is the same as the series, which is the same as the video game. Ported exactly the way the game sounded. So if you loved the soundtrack, you will be happy to learn that it has been brought over as well. Instrumental background music both soft and aggressive depending on the situation, and really make you feel like you are back in the 1930s. All the Japanese voice actors also returned to filler the character’s roles.The visuals on this at times are a bit more...uhhh...cartoony. This is especially true with the first episode, where everyone is on the chibi side. For the most part though it looks pretty much the same as the series, it even retains that blurred color effect found in some of the characters and scenery.I think the biggest problem I had with the specials were with some of the characters. Because a lot of these were more comedy driven, some characters were given comedic roles that didn’t seem to gel right with their personalities from the series (this is especially true with characters like Selvaria and Cordelia). So it may seem a bit awkward at some parts. Everyone else though, is fine. It should also be mentioned that many of the episodes highlight a different character or unit.If you’re a fan of the Valkyria Chronicles series, anime or video game, I recommend giving these a try. If you are new to the franchise then I would say to watch the main anime or play the video game before going into these. You’ll be glad you did once finished. they threw together for the sake of extras on a DVD, then you would be wrong...for the most part.Each episode is episodic, with not one necessarily leading into another. However, they take place during different times of the series. There are occasions when we even get to see a little bit of extra backstory that wasn’t mentioned in the actual anime. Whether it be past situations between characters, to the gang taking a comedic relaxing day. Now because these take place during different times of the story, it’s not really a special you should watch before the actual anime, because there are some minor spoilers to be had, especially with the last episode. I should mention that most of these episodes are in fact made to make you laugh, with the exception of a few, so the whole ""war theme"" isn’t as evident as it was in the series. The main reason why I think fans of the series should check these out, is because of the excellent final episode of these specials. It takes place after the events of the anime, and bring the series to a wonderful close. So if you’ve watched the series, and are debating on whether or not to pick up the theater specials, I would recommend to AT LEAST watch the last episode of these, you won’t regret it.The music in this is the same as the series, which is the same as the video game. Ported exactly the way the game sounded. So if you loved the soundtrack, you will be happy to learn that it has been brought over as well. Instrumental background music both soft and aggressive depending on the situation, and really make you feel like you are back in the 1930s.

I daresay it won\'t be the last.What impressed me the most about Pupipo! was how balanced each four-minute episode was. Every episode was complete. The action and dialogue always pushed the story forward. The creative team excelled at ""showing"" not ""telling"".The pacing was well done, leaving me craving the next episode, while wondering: What exactly is Po-chan? What\'s Yuuki\'s problem? Will Himeji-chan and Yuuki-kun ever get a break?Conflict and angst didn\'t last too long (unlike a certain regalia\'s whiny phase. Yukine, I\'m looking at you). Questions and conflicts were resolved without dragging out.The art...style is a bit different from some of the mainstream shows. For some reason, it reminded me a little of the first season of Moyashimon, or the first Minami-ke. A little quirky, but extremely charming.The sound quality was excellent, extremely clear. The music supported the dialogue and action without overpowering them.The characters are likable. Even the annoying classmates were bearable.The seiyuu did a wonderful job at conveying Himeji-chan and Yuuki-kun\'s character through inflection. Their worries and hopes came through loud and clear, as did Azuma-chan\'s passion for the occult.Then, there\'s Po-chan.

If you want to watch this anime, do it. Despite it having only 4 minute duration per episode, essentially it has a very good story just like any other anime..ALERT: (I rated this a 6 because that\'s an awesome score in my book, don\'t let it discourage you.) Also, don\'t let the rating ""PG"" Discourage you either. I have no idea why it\'s rated that. It uses bad words sometimes, it\'s story is pretty complex  also, just like any other anime. I think this anime honestly doesn\'t get the hype it deserves, [ meaning it deserves more ].Story: ( Insert Synopsis...here ) My synopsis:  Yeah, basically it\'s about a 5th grade girl with no friends because she has spirit sensitivity, why does that affect her?

But let\'s break it down a bit further.1: Story- Now i\'ll be frank, the story was short with a bit of inconsistencies, but it grows on you as the story goes on. The story follows a young girl named Wakaba who happens to see spirits and as a result, anyone who has any contact with her ends up ""cursed."" As a result Wakaba is the center of ridicule and has no friends, ultimately keeping...her in a very depressing isolated state. This changes one day when she spots a pink being later named ""Po"" and Wakaba brings him home.2: Art- Slightly above average for an anime this short, though I did annoy me a little that the other characters had pointed teeth, possibly to represent these characters as the not-so-friendly crowd. Animation was average at best.3: Sound- Definitely one the highlights of the show, not one track was out of place and fit the mood perfectly.4: Characters- The main characters both had meaning and their personal back stories were interesting, but the other two characters who showed up to be the plot devices were uninteresting and plain. I would have liked to see a bit more on who they were and where they came from before they met the main characters.5: Enjoyment- A part of me likes the show, while another part wanted to see more to fully understand what the creators were trying to push with these characters, but the last episode was probably my biggest ""WTF"" moment when you come to terms on what PO really is and how Wakaba displayed a bit more of her feelings outside of a blank stare as the show progresses. It\'s definitely worth your hour of viewing time, if you really don\'t have anything else to watch. her in a very depressing isolated state.

If you have seen ""High Score Girl"" you will recognize it. This short anime is not CG mind you.All episodes put together are 1 hour of watching, so with such a modest length, even if you do not like it, you will not have lost much.

I think it is worth the ""risk"", and I am certainly glad I checked it out', 'Pupipo! is a surprising find, as I don’t think I’ve found a show this short that has such a robust and fully-realized narrative structure as this one. It only takes about an hour to finish, and yet it has all the qualities which shows three or four times its length can boast of. There’s solid worldbuilding, compelling characterization, and a story which gracefully arcs through every necessary moment and point, culminating in a shocking yet satisfying ending. Having said this, I must explicitly reiterate how great the story is here. A good story is the foundation of any anime, and I believe it had the...potential to just keep going. Indeed, while its brevity made it a convenient watch, it could easily have gone for much longer, and I wish it did, which is this show’s only serious drawback. It could have played on a monster-of-the-week scenario by encountering different ghosts and having the main trio (yes I’m counting Pupipo) overcome different challenges and grow closer as a result. Then the courting phase of the romance could have had its own whole arc, maybe add Yuuki as another member of the gang for season 2, really letting these relationships simmer and build up to the ending we already got here. Regardless of its length, it manages to excel and meet every expectation perfectly, and I honestly don’t know how they did it. There are huge, multi-season epics with endings that aren’t half as satisfying and poetic as the ending to this little anime from 2013. The art meets all standards of quality, with a fun art direction that really expresses itself in the general character design, as well as the visual language of the spirit world. Though, the static illustrations in the ED look like absolute garbage, and I have no clue why they look so bad. Of course, they’re only on screen for maybe 15 or 20 seconds an episode, so it’s not that much of a problem. The sound was satisfactory, with fun and engaging voice work throughout. The characters rise to the occasion of the world they’re in, and every one of them manages to occupy comedic and dramatic moments in equal measure, my favorites being Azuma and Himeji. Overall, Pupipo! is an anime with shocking depth, construction, and emotional intelligence. I was expecting this to be baseline at best, but instead I was met with a strong, high-quality show that I can enthusiastically recommend. potential to just keep going.

Shinpi no Sekai El-Hazard Season 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/118/Shinpi_no_Sekai_El-Hazard_Season_2,"['I am not a professional reviewer, and to be honest I\'m not sure if I can even call this a review, but I\'ve got to say something and I hope it will be useful. First of all I\'d like to note:El Hazard OVA 1 ≠ El Hazard OVA 2I only could stand one episode, but that was enough to make this conclusion. I was really disappointed to see another failed sequel which I wish was never made. Why? OK, let\'s dig deeper.First, OVA 2 focuses TOO MUCH on character relationships, which are so typical that while I was watching I wondered whether it\'s really the...sequel of El Hazard or some mainstream harem anime! And there follows the second complaint - the characters. What happened with their behaviors? Why Mr.Fujisawa is a chicken? Why Fatora is a perverted crosdresser? Miz? What\'s up with her? And third thing... production quality. Art work is definitely worse (excluding the backrounds, which seem to be copied from OVA 1), and I feel seiyu were slacking. However, let\'s talk about the story. Well, the magic feeling of an unknown world is no more, OVA 2 starts where OVA 1 ends. And there\'s not really much new to see, we already know everything - Eye Of God, Priestesses, princesses... No intrigue whatsoever.Before I finish, I\'d like to add - if you\'re new to El Hazard, start with OVA 1 and forget OVA 2 even exists.And so, I finish my \'review\' and put ""El Hazard 2: The Magnificent World"" to ""Dropped"" with a score of 5. Sad story, but it\'s over. sequel of El Hazard or some mainstream harem anime! And there follows the second complaint - the characters. What happened with their behaviors?

Sad story, but it\'s over.', ""Whatever you liked about the first OVA, you won’t find it here. Don’t bother.I enjoyed the first OVA, it’s nothing spectacular but it’s full of charm and adventure. It’s fun and entertaining with a charismatic cast of characters. Unfortunately, the second OVA missed the mark on those things almost completely. It’s not awful, it’s just a non-event. It’s bland and charmless with lazy writing, which is disappointing because the sequel has potential to be great if only they’d put a bit more effort into continuing the actual story.It’s hard not to compare it to the first OVA and it just suffers by comparison...in almost every regard (by the way, I’m assuming that if you’re reading this then you’ve seen the first one - if not, why are you reading a review of the sequel?). This felt like a side story not a sequel, something harmless and frivolous to watch but in no way had enough stakes or plot for a full OVA.STORYI was invested in the plot of the first series. It has a coherent plan and focused goals and antagonists. It has a build up and a sense of adventure. This series really just meandered around as if the writers were lost. I perhaps suspect they thought the cast and the comedy would be enough of a selling point for this series and they’re just not. They leaned into the comedy and it’s just not that funny. The comedy skits are fun when it’s an aside to the actual adventure story but when it’s the bulk of what’s happening, you’re just left thinking - this isn’t that funny and it needs to be.In the last OVA, MAL had the nerve to call it a romance but this anime, they really made up for the lack in the previous series. This is mostly a rom-com but unfortunately it’s not a good one. The mind-boggling thing is that this no longer has the romance tag!? Also, this has somehow turned into a harem. Makoto basically somehow has three women lusting after him by the end.Now if you need a reminder, the first series was largely a fantasy adventure. The first episode of this OVA is about a jilted bride looking for her runaway husband, which is a far cry from the war and potential apocalypse they faced in the previous series. Sure things amp up a bit by the third episode but not in any way that you would care about. It just takes too much time to get going. In the first series, it keyed in to the main plot from the get-go and it allowed the main content of the OVA to be focused on that. This doesn’t really get started till well over halfway through the run time.CHARACTERSMy first problem with how this OVA handles characters is that I hated the way they included “Ifurita”. It just seemed like a cheap way to sort of include her but not have to explain how she got back to El Hazard. It's lazy and feels inconsequential by the end. They really wanted that character design to make an appearance but couldn't be bothered to think about a way to get her back from Earth. It was just a bit disappointing because I was hoping to see more of her in this series and see the relationship between Makoto and her develop but instead they teased it then took the possibility away. Lame. Also, the new incarnation was milquetoast.Perhaps the biggest problem with this OVA is Kalia - she's such a bland villain. Such poor reasoning or explanation is given to the villain’s motives - I mean, she doesn’t really have any motives. I couldn’t even tell you why she’s doing this. There was a moment where I thought we were getting a back story and it just fell completely flat. She has no real character or anything remotely distinctive or interesting about her. It’s lazy writing and it’s a shame.Jinnai was always played for laughs but they really have him as nothing but a fool in this - he might as well not be there. Believe it or not, there’s more maniacal laughter in this OVA than the last one - seemingly it’s the only consistent motif between the two series. Also, anyone watching this OVA will feel all the characters’ regret for saving the princess in the first season considering how unbelievably irritating she is in this - since when did she turn into a groping lesbian?I sound like I hate the characters. I don't. I actually do like this cast, they’re fun together. There's some good camaraderie but with some people missing, the newly-added characters being somewhat annoying and a few of them having not that much to do (Nanami might as well not be there), it sort of took the fun out of it.ART/ANIMATIONArt and animation took a bit of a nosedive this season. It’s distinctly more sloppy than last season. While the previous OVA wasn’t always top-notch quality art, it had some great moments that elevated it - this just seems basic. Although some of the sequences using their magic I actually thought improved. It was cool to see their powers take on manifestations of titans, dragons etc. but it’s nothing to shout about and is barely utilised.HOW COULD IT HAVE BEEN BETTER?I think what makes this OVA frustrating is there are so many things that were set up in the first OVA that could have been used as a natural jumping off point for the second series and that’s what I was expecting. By the end of the first series it leaves us with several cliff-hanger questions: What happened with the Phantom people? Will Ifurita get back to El Hazard? Will Makoto and his friends get back to Earth? Yet, not a single one of those questions is answered is this. I don’t get why they wouldn’t just build a story around one of these questions.Personally, I think it would’ve been so much better if this season had been about taking on the Phantom people as the main villains - I really don’t know why they didn’t. They weren’t the main focus in the previous story (in fact, we barely found anything out about them) but they had interesting powers and sort of just disappeared at the end so I thought they were primed for a comeback. The series could have explored the lands underground where they live, given more detail on their backstory and how they ended up in El Hazard etc. and it would have made a much more interesting adventure that both tied in to the previous series and gave the viewer something new to see.OVERALLSo, would I recommend it? Well, it depends what you liked about the first one. If you like the sense of fantasy, adventure and seeing a colourful cast of characters band together in a common goal to prevent factions from destroying the world...then don’t watch this. This has basically none of that or certainly not done with any finesse. If you loved the daft comedy moments and didn’t really care about a good plot or villains then this might be made just for you.It’s not awful by any means but it's not good either. It’s probably best just to enjoy the first season for what it is and not bother continuing with it unless you found the first season hilarious and are dying to see these characters prat around while a vague story continues in the background.Sadly, it had a lot of potential but it’s a disappointing sequel. It’s really not worth your time. in almost every regard (by the way, I’m assuming that if you’re reading this then you’ve seen the first one - if not, why are you reading a review of the sequel?). This felt like a side story not a sequel, something harmless and frivolous to watch but in no way had enough stakes or plot for a full OVA.STORYI was invested in the plot of the first series.

This doesn’t really get started till well over halfway through the run time.CHARACTERSMy first problem with how this OVA handles characters is that I hated the way they included “Ifurita”. It just seemed like a cheap way to sort of include her but not have to explain how she got back to El Hazard. It's lazy and feels inconsequential by the end. They really wanted that character design to make an appearance but couldn't be bothered to think about a way to get her back from Earth. It was just a bit disappointing because I was hoping to see more of her in this series and see the relationship between Makoto and her develop but instead they teased it then took the possibility away. Lame. Also, the new incarnation was milquetoast.Perhaps the biggest problem with this OVA is Kalia - she's such a bland villain. Such poor reasoning or explanation is given to the villain’s motives - I mean, she doesn’t really have any motives. I couldn’t even tell you why she’s doing this. There was a moment where I thought we were getting a back story and it just fell completely flat. She has no real character or anything remotely distinctive or interesting about her. It’s lazy writing and it’s a shame.Jinnai was always played for laughs but they really have him as nothing but a fool in this - he might as well not be there. Believe it or not, there’s more maniacal laughter in this OVA than the last one - seemingly it’s the only consistent motif between the two series. Also, anyone watching this OVA will feel all the characters’ regret for saving the princess in the first season considering how unbelievably irritating she is in this - since when did she turn into a groping lesbian?I sound like I hate the characters. I don't. I actually do like this cast, they’re fun together. There's some good camaraderie but with some people missing, the newly-added characters being somewhat annoying and a few of them having not that much to do (Nanami might as well not be there), it sort of took the fun out of it.ART/ANIMATIONArt and animation took a bit of a nosedive this season. It’s distinctly more sloppy than last season. While the previous OVA wasn’t always top-notch quality art, it had some great moments that elevated it - this just seems basic. Although some of the sequences using their magic I actually thought improved. It was cool to see their powers take on manifestations of titans, dragons etc. but it’s nothing to shout about and is barely utilised.HOW COULD IT HAVE BEEN BETTER?I think what makes this OVA frustrating is there are so many things that were set up in the first OVA that could have been used as a natural jumping off point for the second series and that’s what I was expecting. By the end of the first series it leaves us with several cliff-hanger questions: What happened with the Phantom people? Will Ifurita get back to El Hazard? Will Makoto and his friends get back to Earth? Yet, not a single one of those questions is answered is this. I don’t get why they wouldn’t just build a story around one of these questions.Personally, I think it would’ve been so much better if this season had been about taking on the Phantom people as the main villains - I really don’t know why they didn’t. They weren’t the main focus in the previous story (in fact, we barely found anything out about them) but they had interesting powers and sort of just disappeared at the end so I thought they were primed for a comeback. The series could have explored the lands underground where they live, given more detail on their backstory and how they ended up in El Hazard etc. and it would have made a much more interesting adventure that both tied in to the previous series and gave the viewer something new to see.OVERALLSo, would I recommend it? Well, it depends what you liked about the first one. If you like the sense of fantasy, adventure and seeing a colourful cast of characters band together in a common goal to prevent factions from destroying the world...then don’t watch this. This has basically none of that or certainly not done with any finesse. If you loved the daft comedy moments and didn’t really care about a good plot or villains then this might be made just for you.It’s not awful by any means but it's not good either. It’s probably best just to enjoy the first season for what it is and not bother continuing with it unless you found the first season hilarious and are dying to see these characters prat around while a vague story continues in the background.Sadly, it had a lot of potential but it’s a disappointing sequel. It’s really not worth your time.""]"
Sinbi Apartment: Ghost Ball Bimil,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38923/Sinbi_Apartment__Ghost_Ball_Bimil,"['It\'s been a little while since I watched this series, so I might be a little vague on the details, but I found this to be a nice show.  I definitely recommend it.  Nothing world changing, but worth watching for an amusing afternoon or two.  (Yes, this series is 24 episodes long.  Yes, I might have basically watched it continuously.)The series revolves around two siblings, older sister Ha-ri and younger brother Doo-ri.  They and their parents live in Shinbi Apartments, a building rumoured to be haunted.  Of course, the rumours are true.  Not only are there several ghosts...who refuse to move on, the building is also home to a goblin, who is also called Shinbi.  (He\'s oddly cute for a goblin, in a stuffed animal sort of way.)  Shinbi draws energy from the people who live in the building, and he won\'t be able to survive if the ghosts scare everyone away.  So when Ha-ri and Doo-ri meet him, he offers them a deal: get rid of a ghost and he\'ll grant one wish.  The two agree.From there, the story takes off in standard monster-of-the-week format, but gradually develops an over-arching plot that builds on the surprisingly deep emotions expressed by the guest cast.  As in so many shows, some of the guest cast joins the main cast, bringing their hidden problems with them.  Which, long story short, least to near catastrophe for the characters, and the city.The characters were by far my favourite thing about this show.  There was real character depth and growth throughout the series.  And not just from the main siblings.  Like I said, the guest characters are pivotal to the episodes.The one major complaint I have about this show was with the first and last episodes.  The first one began in media res.  Everything I recapped above, the basic plot, is told in a recap in about one minute.  I think this was a missed opportunity for character development.  The series could have benefited from that recap being its own episode.  I had a similar problem with the finale.  It basically cut from the climactic last battle to ""well that\'s over and everything\'s pretty much back to normal.""  I think a longer plot resolution would have tied things together better.  For the record, there were no loose ends, but a few more sentences confirming that and elaborating on it would have been greatly appreciated.All and all, I found this to be a really enjoyable show, and definitely recommend it. who refuse to move on, the building is also home to a goblin, who is also called Shinbi.

I didn't know it was Korean until I checked the audio thing on Netflix, but it was still spectacular. You should watch it. I loved the character design and their voices. I wish there were more episodes because I was really intrigued by this show. Plus the boy with black hair and the vampire boy were cute.

Once Sinbi enters the picture, she works hard to help each ghost overcome their internal dilemma (if possible). The supporting characters are all really sweet too. She makes new friends and meets a potential romantic partner in the process. Overall, it's a more lighthearted anime with enough dark, personal themes to keep the story interested.

Perhaps you thought this would be a formulaic continuation of the rather mediocre power fantasy isekai/slice of life the first season was. Little did you know that the showmakers decided to pander to a different market segment altogether. Yes, this show is now officially an ecchi harem isekai. Bring out the champagne!Well, that wasn\'t totally fair. It is not just an ecchi harem isekai. It also has elements of (explicitly acknowledged) incest, polygamy, and sexualization of underage girls. Your FBI agent will definitely shake his head. That much, I can guarantee.I can hear...you say: ""Surely, you\'re joking, Mr. Zolmir! You must be mistaking siscon/brocon for incest, right? They surely wouldn\'t go that far!"" Alas, my friends, I kid you not. Ruti, our protagonist\'s little sister explicitly acknowledges that:(1) she is OK with her brother marrying Rit because she herself cannot marry him (pesky social norms),(2) despite not being able to marry him, she can still be his lover,(3) this is OK because her brother can ""handle two partners with ease"", and ergo(4) Rit can be the number one wife and Ruti can be the number one lover.This is followed by Ruti joining the main couple (and the elven side chick) in a hot bath while totally naked. I rest my case, dear reader.As for the sexualization of underage girls, just watch the opening. The main couple are nowhere to be seen, and we are treated to several half- and fully-naked scenes with Ruti (officially ""17"") and Tisse (looks 11 to me, but what do I know.)Now that we have satisfactorily established the genre, the question becomes: ""Is it a good ecchi harem isekai? What about the plot? I-I mean the actual plot!""In terms of the actual plot, it is your run-of-the-mill slice of life isekai with sub-standard writing. In the span of three episodes, we have not one but *two* naked bath scenes (one hot spring, one bathhouse), one town festival, one outdoors trip/picnic, one ""misunderstanding"" battle, and one actual battle. Unfortunately, the battles have zero stakes. Since our protagonist\'s sister is the Hero with a capital H, they just auto-resolve battles, to put it mildly.The dialogues are sleep-inducing and I am not even sure if they contribute anything to the show. In fact, you might want to seriously consider turning off the subtitles, because I am quite confident what you imagine the characters are saying to each other is bound to be more interesting than what the writers actually came up with.What about the characters? As was the case in season 1, they are all cardboard cutouts. I mean that figuratively, of course. In reality, all our harem members (with the exception of Tisse) boast very respectable cup-sizes. And there is something for everyone! All cup-sizes are represented. Since it is their most distinguishing character trait, I am going to list our harem members sorted by descending cup-size:1) Rit: Rit is the fiancée and prospective wife of our protagonist. She sports the biggest hooters of them all. Hence, it makes sense that she is going to be the official wife, and the primus-inter-pares of the harem. She is the girl-next-door and the faithful waifu.2) Yarandrala: Yarandrala is the now-stereotypical libertine elf. In terms of rack size, she comes second to Rit, but she makes up for it by being completely unbound by human social norms, because... she is an elf, duh! (RIP, Tolkien...) She is brazen enough to join Red in the hot springs while totally naked.3) Ruti: Ruti is the little sister of our protagonist, and she has a crush on him as previously discussed. She looks and sounds like a middle schooler, but she is officially 17, which checks out if you are a staunch believer of 500-year-old dragon lolis. Her cup-size is just above-average, which means almost flat by anime standards. Her existence is summarized by being the Hero and a brocon.4) Tisse: Tisse is Ruti\'s sidekick. Her distinguishing features are being shy, being even younger than Ruti, and owning a cute spider familiar whom she has named as if she was a kindergartner. She looks and sounds like a grade schooler, so I guess that makes her a middle schooler? Her cup-size is below-average, and she is the only member of the harem who doesn\'t explicitly have a crush on Red... yet! Or perhaps she is afraid Ruti would murder her.What about the protagonist? He is the stock-standard self-insert male anime protagonist: honest, hardworking, has black hair, and is admired by every female in existence.To sum it up, the show is exactly what it says on the tin. If you are an enthusiast of ecchi harem isekais, you\'d probably rate it at 6/10. To me, it is barely a 4 if I am being generous, and an easy drop... you say: ""Surely, you\'re joking, Mr. Zolmir!

Season 1 asked the question ""Do you have to live as your blessing dictates?"" and answered it through Ruti overcoming the life consuming blessing of the hero and gaining the freedom to live as she wants.But what if the person with the hero blessing actually wants to be the hero? Season 2 features Van, the ""new"" hero, and instead asks ""Is simply doing as your blessing dictates enough to fulfill your role?"" The clash in ideologies between Van, a devout follower of the Almighty who confers blessings,...and Gideon, the previous hero\'s guide who has learned to live outside those blessings, makes for a compelling central conflict.Within Van\'s party, Theodora (now going as Esta) tries to advise Van to be more flexible, as she\'s learned from Gideon, but Lavender (a mysterious fairy who loves Van) keeps telling him he\'s fine as he is. The last member of the party, Cardinal Ljubo, seems to want to use Van, but somewhat comedically throws his arms up in the air when it comes to actually controlling his actions.Meanwhile, in Zoltan, Ruti is learning to live a normal life with help from Tisse. Much of the extended cast returns to Zoltan as well, and there are plenty of fun episodes with them all. While there isn\'t as much focus on Red and Rit\'s romance as there was in the first season, there\'s still development, and Rit\'s love for Red makes for an interesting parallel with Lavender\'s love for Van later on.The conclusion of the season was very satisfying and wrapped up everything nicely. Overall I enjoyed this season slightly more than the first, since I was more invested in the plot around blessings than the comfy romance (though both aspects are good), but if you care more about Red and Rit\'s romance I think you\'ll like the ending as well. and Gideon, the previous hero\'s guide who has learned to live outside those blessings, makes for a compelling central conflict.Within Van\'s party, Theodora (now going as Esta) tries to advise Van to be more flexible, as she\'s learned from Gideon, but Lavender (a mysterious fairy who loves Van) keeps telling him he\'s fine as he is.

The new antagonist of S2, just doesn\'t have the same gravitas as the one from S1 did, simply because Ruti is now a permanent feature of the group.In a lot of the first episodes of S2, without going into hefty spoilers, Ruti is shown to be struggling to integrate due to how...OP she is; this is all well and good and shows character growth, but also has the side-effect of removing any stakes.Red, Rit or Tisse could be in danger, but you know Ruti would show up in 0.2 seconds and nuke whatever was posing the threat.It\'s like being a newbie in an MMO, but having a maxed-out level 100 player you can rely on at a moment\'s notice in your friend\'s list.Now, the anime does try and work around this, by having the other characters use their strengths in various scenarios, without bringing out the ""trump card"" every 2 seconds and even has the main gang be away from the action for a while, however there\'s no way to ignore what Ruti is and what she can do. This is even despite showing what the new antagonist is capable of.Again, I\'m not saying this show has suddenly dropped into trash-tier, as I still like all the characters and think the way they\'ve been built-up and grown is great, especially Tisse in this season, who was one of the major ones lacking from S1. We also have more of previously less-shown characters like Danan and Yarandrala.I will say here as well, that the other reviews are from EP3/EP4, whereas the antagonist features far more prominently and becomes the major plot-point of this season from that point onward - so bare that in mind if you feel the first several episodes don\'t include a whole lot (they focus on Ruti integrating into the group).As for the elephant in the room, which is how ecchi this show is, which seems to be a major negative for some, I will agree that there is more of that going on in S2, compared to S1, as well. Rit still has her large oppai and there are a few more bathing scenes in this one compared to S1 (and an extremely mis-placed swimwear scene), although I do not agree on the whole ""Red is a siscon"" thing that people have created, as the scene in question that that stems from is clearly being played for gags with how Tisse reacted.He still very clearly only has eyes for Rit and her only, which is an ongoing positive that has carried across from S1.Overall, I am enjoying this second season, just not quite as much as I enjoyed S1.As I gave Season 1 a 7/10 and recommended rating, I will have to give this a 6/10 and mixed-feelings.

Join me, dear reader, as I navigate the sequel's labyrinth:The initial foray into this tale was acceptable, a hero opting for the tranquility of village life after the tumult of adventuring. It maintained a semblance of coherence, and I relished the character progression that unfolded, concluding the story on a satisfying note.Now, as the second season unfolds, I find myself pondering the elusive purpose it seeks to unravel. Is...there a grander design, a narrative tapestry awaiting revelation, or does it merely tread the path of a protracted OVA, attempting to wring out what remnants of intrigue linger from the first season?Despite my initial uncertainty, I grant it a few more episodes in the hopes of discovering a discernible thread. Shall it weave a tale worth following, or am I poised to preserve the fond memories of the inaugural season? The journey continues, with my curiosity ever-tinged with skepticism.Update: Alas, i will be backlogging this anime to potentially binge on a bored winter night.

Little spoiler : I loved seeing the Red/Rit couple having a good time together and even getting engaged. Certainly Van and his little idiot behavior was a bit hard to follow but it's good that he ended up changing his mind and evolving afterwards (even if it was a bit long I admit) but it had to be because the demon king must be defeated after all.This season 2 allowed us to develop a lot of characters like Ruti, Theodora/Esta, Albert and many other characters. I really enjoyed seeing these characters change for the better....Don't forget that it's a romance and slice of life anime in a medieval universe so it's normal that the anime doesn't emphasize combat.In short, I would rate this season 9/10.

As well as seen how Ruti deals with her new life along with Tisse in Zoltan.The plot focuses on Ruti, Tisse and the appearance of the new ""Hero"", however we come to find that the new hero has a worped perception of how a ""hero"" is meant to be and his view of ""God"" and what he expects of him.At the end of the season I think most viewers will be very pleased and happy how it ends and sets up for a Third season.Overall this season compared to...the first season is good, however most of the significant events happen during the first season like the development of Red and Rit from friends to lovers. So I prefer the first.I´ve done a review of the First seaon if you´d like to see it, please check it out. the first season is good, however most of the significant events happen during the first season like the development of Red and Rit from friends to lovers.

A lot is also about a new Hero that has been found since Ruti has “disappeared”.The plot very much revolves around the normal life the group has in the village, and how the new Hero is. The plot is very straight forward with little to mysteries or convoluted plots, which makes the story somewhat bland and predictable.When it...comes to the characters, do they very much seem stagnant, kinda like the development for them is already done. Which makes the characters feel very flat and simple, which doesn’t help with the already rather bland plot. The new characters introduced do have room for some development but are still very predictable in their behavior.The animation is the same style as the previous season and holds a very average but smooth animation level. There is nothing very noteworthy about it, but it is not bad either.Overall does it kinda seem like the story is dragged too far, and the finished characters are put into a new story where there isn’t room for much development. There is one opportunity that is in the season though, since they are starting to hint towards a possible plot line that could bring more into the show.So I would say that if you really like this show and its characters is it worth watching this season.

This second season turns into an action packed full on adventure type anime after episode 6 or so which is exactly what I am not looking for. If I did I could have started watching one of the 500 other options. It has lost its unique selling point and became generic.I would not recommend it, unless you enjoy the generic magic and sword fights you have seen a thousand times before. Also Van the Hero is a really annoying spoiled...brat that needs to be killed asap, including that stupid fairy that is with him. Awful characters.I'll finish it as Im on Ep . 8 but if they are trying to get a third season going I wont be watching that. brat that needs to be killed asap, including that stupid fairy that is with him.

Unfortunately, the second season veers off this course substantially and instead opts for an ill-advised attempt to increase the stakes, seemingly betraying the ""slow life"" theme of the story.The introduction of Van (the new ""hero"") and his – to put it lightly – annoying fairy counterpart in Lavender makes the show nigh unbearable at times. The kid is simply a lost cause to his very core and his repetitive religious fanaticism is horrible to watch. Lavender\'s...banal trash talking makes for a doubly unpleasant experience. To center the second season around this sociopathic idiot really ruins the good-natured fun that made the first season worthwhile in the first place. The pacing of the show falters because of this overloading of the narrative. Van is really not worth the time being spent by the Zoltan crew or by the Cardinal that employs him. The reduction of Red and Rit to mere side characters in this mess removes much of the enjoyment that was to be had in the first season. Where did the narrative surrounding the Demon Army go?Ruti\'s arc presents one of the lone bright spots in this otherwise disappointment of a season, focusing on her struggles to adapt to the ""slow life"" that she has opted to pursue with hopes of living normally, but even this is undermined by the dabbling with Van.Visually and sonically, the series really does not make many changes from the first season, further emphasizing the downfall of the storyline. While it is understandable to alter a few things and provide more motivation for the Hero\'s party to get involved (even if they wish otherwise), one can\'t help but feel that the viewer\'s enjoyment was sacrificed to do so. banal trash talking makes for a doubly unpleasant experience.

With Red and Rit now fully invested in their life in Zoltan, they take on every day life like a quest - ""what needs to happen today?"" is the every day question.  This is the story for most of the first half and I honestly wasn\'t really into it.  The arcs that were presented to us didn\'t really feel like they were part of something bigger.My sense...of it all was to start to try and develop our last hero - Ruti.  Now living in Zoltan, with help from Red, Rit and Tisse, Ruti seems to be taking a keen interest in trying to find out how she can live as not-the-hero.  With such a shallow personality in the first season, the differences between then and now are like light and day.  She\'s more into what she\'s doing, she has more of an ability to think on her own, and doesn\'t jump to violence right away.  In a sense, I guess you can say that the first half did accomplish something, but doing so over such a long haul barely feels like enough reason to do it.Red and Rit are mostly unchanged from the first season.  The apothecary, and Zoltan in general, are much less of the focus on this season, so Red and Rit are mostly used to guide us through the story elements.  They both take on a bigger role in the story in the back half of the season though, and mostly for the better.  It\'s here that they focus more on Red\'s smarts, which is at least a little enjoyable, especially consider who he fights in the last episode.  The romance bits in the story are not quite as evident than those found in the first season which is where it had some of its better plot points.  There is some, and it was decently told.With Ruti effectively out of the picture as a hero, Van takes up the mantle as the new one.  His personalities mirror what Ruti was in the first season, though a little too similarly for my liking.  His ideals stubbornly cling to him and figuring out what to do with him does feel like the objective of the back half.  He clings to his Divine Blessing like a mother and child and it can get old.  He is guided by Ljubo, Esta and Lavender.  Ljubo was an addition I didn\'t mind.  I actually like that they gave him more personality because they certainly had issues with this before.  His love of wine and cigars made me chuckle on a few occasions.  I wish they did more with Esta because she clearly has a strong sense of duty to try and guide an imperfect hero.  Lavender has a very strange backstory, one of which I just couldn\'t attach myself to.  Maybe her purpose is to push Van\'s older ideals, but would much of changed without her?  Her interactions with Rit might be a redeeming quality, but that\'s about it.The second half of the story, as I alluded to earlier, was much stronger than the first because now at least our Zoltan group have an objective.  The pacing is pretty unsteady, as some episodes have far more to them than others, while the encounters between Van\'s part and Red\'s fared much better.  Tisse and Yarandrala are a little more involved in the story as we carry along, but it sometimes does feel like the roster is a little too overcrowded.The way in which they decide to leave the story off seems about right for what I expected.  Not every adventure story needs to result in violence, and even if the action sequences here were much better than last season.   It never got too silly like some of the scenes did last time around.  The way forward doesn\'t seem super clear so I have a hard time seeing this get another season, but I\'ve been surprised before.  (Story: 6/10, Characters: 6/10)Art: Studio Flad returns and they do a much more consistent job than they did the first time around.  Quality never really crumbles, and the colouring and lighting remain mostly consistent.  (7/10)Sound: Like with last season, I wasn\'t terribly impressed by any of the tracks, but they are enough to get you by.  Voice work was much stronger this time around, in part because I feel like Tia Ballard (Ruti) settles into her role better than in the first season.  As someone who loves her work, I was pretty disappointed with how she acted as Ruti, so that\'s nice to see.  Aaron Campbell (Red) and Jad Saxton (Tisse) still offer strong performances, while Dani Chambers (Rit) is someone you can never go wrong with.  Macy Anne Johnson (Lavender) was probably my favourite though - where\'d she pull this one from?  I\'m used to hearing her in more subtle, quiet roles.  (8/10)Overall: Banished From The Hero\'s Party, I Decided To Live A Quiet Life In The Countryside Season 2 scores out roughly the same as the last season.  It\'s strength lies in the back half, which is the opposite of last season, as the story around Van was stronger than anything else.  I\'m glad they built a little bit on top of Ruti after she is no longer the hero, and even if it\'s not the most interesting thing to listen to, they probably picked the right character to base the first half around.  It\'s hard to judge what kind of audience this would appeal to because it doesn\'t do anything on an exceptional level.  It\'s just another season, talking about Divine Blessings and Zoltan.

There you could find a really good and fast paced romance, some fights and the characters had arcs of themselves.Season two, however, is just lackluster, when it's not downright appaling.Red and Rit are just completed characters. They have nowhere to go. That COULD not have been a problem if the story had become a slice-of-life of those two living a newlywed, but it's not, quite the contrary! The rare moments of romance and slice-of-life are good, but they really are few and far between.Ruti and...the assassin girl adapting to the new life are not too bad, but it is not good either.

However due to stupidity from another party, this by greed and simple brainwashing and believing in just 1 way it gets messed up to some degree. Now, a lot of the reviews stop within the first 3-4 episodes while spitting venom over nothing. People will need to...learn to understand titles and take it up in their reviews and while watching anime. It very clearly states ""I Decided To Live A Quiet Life In The Countryside"" and as I already stated, this fits the anime perfectly including the more quiet style.The story is indeed very quiet, but there seems to be a good reasoning behind it. You should take into consideration that they had their fights and this is post events. There for yes, they will take it easy and follow a life philosophy that doesn\'t include fighting or being high profile. Although Ruti makes it difficult in part of the story along with Tisse.There is in the very beginning a story of something going on with the forest and monsters, the story does mention here and there something about it but never fully explains why or what. It remains a open story, this makes me believe season 3 will be about this as the ""new hero party"" thing sucked up all time to really handle the start story well enough. So for al the haters with 3-4 episodes only, I do believe a lot more is coming and yes even you that judge too quickly might just get what you want to see. More fights are likely to erupt in season 3 along side other parts that remain open to some extend.The story is a bit too scattered, I will admit that as much has likely been cut out of the manga to just fit in this one season. A lot of context is likely lost there for. However I do think it\'s well worth to watch this anime and it still does end up having a 8 in my book as you do need to think more then just ""this is boring as nothing happens"". Everyone complaining about this clearly are not looking deeper into things. Please do not believe in this shallow way of thinking.Danan never really leaves the town even if he states he will, so season 3 might see him more away anyways or join the main party to resolve the issues regarding the monsters acting weird. Van and his party are likely going off screen for most of season 3 if not entirely. Yarandrala is likely to stay inside the shop for a while longer, this to understand the village more and understand why Red and Rit prefer to stay there. This is likely going to add extra plot reasons. I do think Yarandrala would make a good one to stick around as she does have the power and could even be a good teacher for local kids. And yes I do think the local kids will be trained properly, specially Tanta who likely gets his powers unlocked in season 3.Now, it remains to be seen if I\'m right or in the right ball park. However it would make sense at least to think in this direction.And oh yeah, season 3 might have at the end a wedding between Rit and Red which might be a good solid point to look out for. learn to understand titles and take it up in their reviews and while watching anime.

So for al the haters with 3-4 episodes only, I do believe a lot more is coming and yes even you that judge too quickly might just get what you want to see. More fights are likely to erupt in season 3 along side other parts that remain open to some extend.The story is a bit too scattered, I will admit that as much has likely been cut out of the manga to just fit in this one season. A lot of context is likely lost there for. However I do think it\'s well worth to watch this anime and it still does end up having a 8 in my book as you do need to think more then just ""this is boring as nothing happens"". Everyone complaining about this clearly are not looking deeper into things. Please do not believe in this shallow way of thinking.Danan never really leaves the town even if he states he will, so season 3 might see him more away anyways or join the main party to resolve the issues regarding the monsters acting weird. Van and his party are likely going off screen for most of season 3 if not entirely. Yarandrala is likely to stay inside the shop for a while longer, this to understand the village more and understand why Red and Rit prefer to stay there. This is likely going to add extra plot reasons. I do think Yarandrala would make a good one to stick around as she does have the power and could even be a good teacher for local kids. And yes I do think the local kids will be trained properly, specially Tanta who likely gets his powers unlocked in season 3.Now, it remains to be seen if I\'m right or in the right ball park. However it would make sense at least to think in this direction.And oh yeah, season 3 might have at the end a wedding between Rit and Red which might be a good solid point to look out for.', 'Season 2, here we go. In my opinion, Season 2 is living off the anticipation that drew in the viewers of Season 1. The animation quality has noticeably declined, and the anticipation for Red\'s reunions has dwindled. Now, the main antagonist seems to be a rather... how shall I put it... really really reeeally dumb child?Yes, driven by twisted beliefs and arrogance, our heroes are forced to confront this child who has somehow become the current antagonist of the story. It\'s a bit of a unique and interesting concept how this boy became the antagonist, however, it\'s clear that the narrative is starting to...lose sight of what initially drew its fanbase in: the hidden competence of the protagonist and the dynamic relationships within the party.It seems that these aspects have now become somewhat meaningless. In an attempt to push Red and Rit into the spotlight as a destined couple, the story is sidelining the other female characters, either by pairing them off with other men or by diminishing their interest in the protagonist. Some have even become passive, resigned to their fate. This shift in relationships may not sit well with everyone, but it\'s certainly a notable change.Furthermore, Season 2 has lacked any significant moments thus far. In fact, it feels like the focus is shifting away from the protagonist, with some episodes giving him minimal screen time. I had hoped that the protagonist\'s reunions and the addition of new comrades would strengthen the group\'s bond and lead to further character development.However, instead of progressing as a unit, the story has become fragmented, with individual character stories instead of collective growth. When they come together, it\'s been more about mundane activities like having dinner or taking a bath, rather than significant events that propel the ""family"" forward.Honestly, I was really looking forward to Season 2 after enjoying Season 1 quite a bit However, all that excitement has been shoved up my butthole with nowhere to go. All the anticipation has been sucked back in, leaving me feeling disappointed and let down. lose sight of what initially drew its fanbase in: the hidden competence of the protagonist and the dynamic relationships within the party.It seems that these aspects have now become somewhat meaningless.

Entirely preticable and while the old characters are fun, the new ones are largely two dimensional, predictable, tropes.The series is, again, split in half.

And now that Season 2 is out, the unfortunate reality (as is everyone concurring) is that novelist Zappon\'s story elements...do not hold up to the standards of the prequel.A retrospective, otherwise, it\'s where to really begin with Season 2\'s content. The continuation with Volume 5...of the LN and beyond (to God knows where) with Ruti finally acknowledging her older brother Red\'s intention to settle down with Rit in Zoltan and live the life of freedom away from trouble, she, along with her bestie Tisse, also settles down in Zoltan, trying to make sense of the freedom that Red, Rit and the others like elf Yarandrala and giant Danan are now living. The sense of letting go of the troubles of a Heroic life, it\'s getting used to a slow life where the mundane becomes precious time spent with friends, it\'s a new feeling for Ruti and Tisse, that swords and shields are nothing compared to baths and meals, at the obvious expense of lives lost against moral company. And to be fair, it\'s a renewed feeling that it takes time getting used to, which Season 2 showcases a lot more from the brocon and her trusty loyal assistant\'s POV.The things above ain\'t that bad...until you consider who the antagonist really is for Season 2. The whole trip about Ares and him getting served back in Season 1, really make for a good antagonist worth hating and seeing him get his karma and ass being beaten, it\'s such a treat. And the sequel here...opted for a new Hero who thinks that the Goddess has enshrined his Blessings to him, and that he must be loyal to her cause for the sake of others\' Blessings being a nuisance. It\'s clear as day that the Hero in question, Van, is being brainwashed himself, but to the extent of being worse than Ares is not something I can complement about, being a weaker antagonist than the former leader who\'s all sorts of messed up. I mean, we get it that ""life is not a bed of roses"", but this sequel just gave me the feeling that the story elements past Season 1, which I thought would be good (until it wasn\'t), it\'s just a shame that the writing suffered tremendously here.Even without the help of Wolfsbane for the studio collaboration, Studio Flad made decent use of sticking close to Season 1\'s quality, which it did, and makes me feel relieved. Not like I\'ve expected animation to carry the show with its good storytelling (from the prequel) but being largely unchanged...when you think about it, it\'s likely for the better.The OST may still be the same, but the theme songs have gotten worse. The same pairings of Yui Nishio and JYOCHO are back, though I find that the former\'s OP song is a decent fit given the change of POV, but the latter\'s ED song...is a very messy song that though carries the spirit of Season 1\'s musically sound and great song, does not translate well onto here.Dear good golly God, Shin no Nakama, you\'ve could\'ve been great or at least back up the quality of Season 1, but Season 2 here just does not give you justice.

Super Lovers,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31680/Super_Lovers,"[""This anime...was very unsettling. This is my first review so be kind. Now let me try and break it down without giving out too much in the way of spoilers.1. The StorySo our uke/sub/bottom, Ren, grew up in Canada and was more or less raised by wolves (???) but unfortunately that's probably the least ridiculous thing about this anime. The seme/dom/top, Haru, meets him there where he becomes his caretaker and tries to teach him how to live like a civilized human in modern society (Oh the irony, but more on that later). A seven-year timeskip and unnecessarily dramatic plot device later, Ren ends up...at Haru's doorstep as his adopted younger brother.Not that there's anything particularly wrong with this premise as far as shounen-ai goes, but it's the way the show keeps trying to push the idea of 'family' down our throats while the two act as anything but brothers. On the plus side the pacing was fairly decent; once the main setting was established it didn't feel like anything was being rushed. While some viewers may find it a bit draggy, at least it felt a bit believable.Get ready for that usual trope of everyone living in a nice, expensive house, Haru getting cars as presents and actually just getting whatever he wants, money isn't an issue here.- - -2. The PairingWhy, oh why would anyone be okay with this?! I've seen my fair share of uncomfortable anime pairings but this one takes the cake. Throughout the show the pure and noble concept of 'brothers' is taken and beaten up and spit upon, then sucker-punched for good measure. I guess what's scariest about the pairing is how closely Haru resembles a pedophile predator. Every move he makes on Ren is manipulative, creepy, inappropriate and criminal.It's hard to take this show as the light-hearted fluff it presents itself to be, because your main pairing is inherently dark when you think about it. Ren has no idea he's more or less being groomed by his legal guardian, and the morons who serve as side-characters in this show do nothing to stop it, or even see anything wrong with it for that matter.- - -3. The CharactersWhich brings us to the third strike for this show. Most of the characters are useless, bumbling idiots. The two women on this show are treated as harsh, dominatrix slave-drivers on permanent PMS, while the girls are either dust-brained Haru fangirls or evil, conniving and wicked. The only girls who're treated with some grace are those who don't pose a threat to our main pairing.Apart from Haru and Ren, Haru's younger adopted twin brothers, Shima and Aki, are also important. No, they aren't actually, it makes no difference whether they exist or not, because they have no real opinions about anything. Shima is your token megane; while after one episode of what looked like interesting family dynamics and a strong characterization for Aki, he was reduced to another Ren fanboy for absolutely no real reason. The two see nothing wrong with their brother sexually imposing himself on a minor, as do most of the others - something is very wrong with everyone in this Lala land of Haru's fantasies.On that note...don't get me started on Haru. You feel like reaching into the screen and slapping him 9 out of 10 times. Apparently he's incredibly good-looking, which seems to be why everyone forgives him for the stuff he does, I mean I can't find any other reason why this criminal is roaming the streets. He acts like a silly, loving, affectionate older brother but I swear it just comes off as CREEPY. He's so touchy with Ren - any scene involving the two, especially later on, is bile-inducing. I tend to compartmentalize fictional characters separately from real people so that even 'evil' characters can find a place on my favourites list, but with Haru...I can't remember the last time I disliked someone so much. I guess it's because he gets away with everything he does and no one sees any wrong in him.I will say that Ren is a bit of a saving grace for the show. While I didn't outright like him, he was treated much better than the others as far as his character was written. But throughout he felt like the victim of the sick and perverted Haru.- - -In conclusion I'll say that this show does have its strengths, especially for the audience it targets. If you're into yaoi/shounen-ai then this isn't a bad choice, there's plenty of fanservice sprinkled about and it gets heavier as you go ahead. I'm guessing people who enjoy this genre are either used to its cliches or actually enjoy them, so I won't mention that as a flaw. And while I personally found the pairing distasteful, there are those who might end up liking it. And as much as I hate to admit it, I can see Haru being popular with the younger fujoshi crowd. The music, atmosphere and artwork was also really good, to give credit where it is due. Oh and if you like dogs and canines in general, there's plenty of that as well.On the other hand if you don't particularly care for yaoi/shounen-ai then don't bother with this anime, it'll just get you frustrated and angry. For me the best part about it was that it was only ten episodes long, but the bad news is that a season 2 is in the works. Hopefully it'll begin with Haru getting sent to prison *fingers crossed* at Haru's doorstep as his adopted younger brother.Not that there's anything particularly wrong with this premise as far as shounen-ai goes, but it's the way the show keeps trying to push the idea of 'family' down our throats while the two act as anything but brothers.

If you're not a fan of the genre or are new to it, this may not be the one you should start with. It's not lightly sprinkled with the yaoi but the core content of the anime is.This review is biassed as I'm a huge fan of this genre.First up, for the yaoi fans, don't fret, the anime definitely has adorable scenes you won't regret waiting for. The get slightly more at the end than what you would have noticed at the beginning. Watching the mangas scenes animated on screen was adorable af....The story is great. It's based on the characters Kaidou Haru and Kaidou Ren who are step-brothers who try to find a way to accept their place in a family and their growing feelings for each other. It's interesting especially as the art, with the multiple and frequent chibis, enhances the comedic aspects of the plot. Some of the important events of the actual plot line do end up rushing by so a complete grasp of the plot cannot be taken. But that's no complaint as the actual art and the colours of the show make up for it.The characters are super relatable, the story mostly does revolve around their very human feelings and their flaws. Despite their classic bishounen and overly appealing features, I would expect most of us to relate to at least a few of their traits. You see an adult, sort of, working to help support his younger brothers and hence get a glimpse of the work aspects and taking care of a family. On the other side, you see our unsociable and slightly stoic Ren get attached to Haru and try to come to terms with this development in his life. The others characters such as the high school twins Aki and Shima are quite strong characters themselves. Haruko is also shown to have a distinct strong personality of her own adding a flavour to the mix in the anime.The opening and ending themes are quite catchy too and I personally loved the ending theme. I sat through it every time.Overall, I loved the anime! Honestly, I expected it to be a longer series. When I updated MAL and it showed that I've 'completed' the anime. I wasn't ready for it to end. At all.For all the veteran yaoi fans, no way you'd miss this so I have nothing to say to you.For those attempting this genre, you can give it a try and it's lighthearted enough for you to be able to enjoy it, especially if you love cute romance animes.

At all.For all the veteran yaoi fans, no way you'd miss this so I have nothing to say to you.For those attempting this genre, you can give it a try and it's lighthearted enough for you to be able to enjoy it, especially if you love cute romance animes."", ""I'm not a fan of these type of anime but i given it a try and honestly its really good.Its boy on boy instead of usual boy on girl but everything is really good.The art is great,the story is really good and we have a season 2 announced to start airing in January 2017.The characters are awesome and there is a lot of development through out the episodes.All in all i really enjoyed this anime and i recommend you to watch it too.I give it overall 8,it would be 9 but for me 10 episodes is simply to little but its great and worth of...your time your time"", ""Speaking of the anime, I enjoyed it. Yes, the age difference between Ren and Haru did make me uncomfortable, and I wished Haru would have been younger (or Ren be older) but then my mind wandered to the blatant display of the nipples of 14 year old in the ecchi anime that I’ve watched (ya know, the kinda content that the haters of this show are totes okay with), and then I was completely okay with this relationship. I liked the character development of all the characters, especially the growing bond between Ren and Haru. I also liked how the twins warmed up to Ren,...as well as people’s reaction to finding out Haru’s intention towards Ren. Haha! Those were some genuine reactions, right there.I liked the twins, especially Aki's feelings towards Ren and how they progress throughout the series. I also loved it when the two called out Haru on his intentions and actions - watching Haru left red faced was truly hilarious. I laughed when I should have, and smiled when I should have. The music’s good – it complements the series nicely as well. The art’s alright; nothing good, nothing bad. It did seem jarring to me when the art form became chibi (?) during funny scenes, because it completely took away from the seriousness of the situation, especially when Ren and Haru were having their moments.The only thing that befuddled me is to why Haru took such a strong liking to Ren. I mean, he’s tall, good looking and an obviously charismatic dude with no scarcity of men or women – so why Ren? Apart from finding him “kawaii”, I didn’t find much reason for Haru’s dependency and feelings for Ren. The inclusion of Natsuo seemed pointless to me, but whatever. Who cares? It’s made for fans and it did great fan service – much better than I expected, to be honest. Without, you know, sexualizing a minor. If you’re into BL/yaoi then you’re sure to enjoy this series.PS. If you're chill with shipping Eren and Mikasa (adopted siblings), then you should be cool shipping Ren and Haru.

That's about it.The story made no sense at all. It was rushed and the back stories didn't make sense.The characters were bland and not much fun. I liked Ren, however, Haru is creepy (which I'll get to). You really didn't even need the brothers.Here's what bothered me: Super Lovers tries to appear as a light-hearted anime when in reality, it's actually really dark.The most concerning thing to me was the pairing. It's borderline pedophilia. Ren...is 16 but looks like he's about 11 or 12. As shown in the anime, he had no knowledge whatsoever about sex and was shown to be immature for his age. Haru was basically grooming and manipulating him. Not to mention — they're adopted brothers! Come on, shouldn't your immature (physically and mentally), adopted brother that's 8 years younger than you be off limits? No one in the anime seems to care at all.

I\'ve been delaying on making this review because I\'ve been writing my own thoughts in essay format for my own personal enjoyment. Anyway, this is a boys love series, this is labeled with shounen-ai themes and homosexual relations. If you are not a fan or are squeaked out by even the mere sight of light same sex relationships in anime/manga then I suggest not giving...this episode a try. You will not like it at all. My reason for making this a crucial point in this paragraph is because the comments and reviews I\'ve seen both on MAL and on other anime sites are written by non-bl fans so you can just imagine how biased and narrow-minded some of the comments are. If you\'re a fan of bl but not shounen-ai or age gaps then once again, I suggest skipping this anime and moving on with your anime lifestyle.When it comes down to the controversial aspects, I\'ll cut it down to the two major issues people seem to have with this series. The age gap is the most primary complaint. Ren and Haru have a 8-9 year age gap yet people are mistaken for when the relationship between Ren and Haru start. Haru meets Ren when he is just an eight year old boy and Haru is 16 years old himself. That\'s the premise for episode one, chapter one. Haru sees Ren as a little brother, someone who his mother forces him to take care of over summer break and Haru, being the caring teen he is, decides to brave the storm and lend his mother a hand. Eventually, Haru has to leave and go back to Japan so he makes a promise with Ren about them living together in the future. He wants someone to baby, someone who he can cook for and look after. This episode was cute as it emphasized Haru\'s worrywart self and Ren\'s stoic personality.People seem to have a problem with Haru\'s kiss on Ren\'s lips in episode one but I fail so see why everyone is so up in arms? Haru is a foreigner, he stated (in the manga and later on in the anime) that Aki and Shima (his step siblings) told him to cut it out because it was embarrassing since they grew out of his brotherly affection. A pretty normal occurrence and reaction for siblings. Ren responds by punching him and saying how it\'s not normal for him. So, Haru listens and resorts to giving him a peck on the forehead to which Ren doesn\'t argue against. Nothing is particularly wrong or ""controversial"" in episode one. I mean, Alex from Kuroko no Basuke kissed everyone on the lips, even though it made people uncomfortable within the show, viewers had no issue whatsoever. Anyhow, there\'s multiple time skips and if you pay close attention, you\'ll see that the platonic love (on Haru\'s side) turns into a romantic one once Ren turns 15 and makes it clear that he\'s in love with Haru. However, his first confession was when he was 13 but since Abe decided to make Haru into such a dense character, he didn\'t really process the information and only did what he could to make Ren happy, which was go after him when he moved back to Canada and after lots of unsuccessful attempts, they move back to Japan. Ren is 15 when it happens so he\'s not a child anymore but he\'s a freshman in high school.The second major issue with viewers is the supposed incest. Pseudo incest if you wanna be technical. However, Ren and Haru are only siblings on the family registry. This is because of what happens in episode 3 but basically, Haru and Ren never knew they\'d be siblings five years later and Ren never ever sees Haru as an older sibling. He makes it explicitly clear to both Juuzen (a student he befriends at his new school) and even adults (like Takamura-sensei) that him and Haru are not brothers because Ren has fallen for him and thus just can not see him as anything but a lover. This is where the viewer\'s personal opinions come into play because if Ren does not want to be seen as Haru\'s brother then who are we (and the other characters of course) to tell Ren what he can and can not say or think. There is a point later on where Ren and Haru talk about the siblings thing but pretty much come to an agreement on the subject.The last thing I want to comment on is how some viewers and well, complainers for lack of better word, seem to say how Ren is too young and Haru is too old cause he\'s 23/4 while Ren is 15/6 but I think they\'re missing a crucial point in Ren\'s mental abilities. Ren at a very young age was home-schooled, taught multiple foreign languages, and even learned enough math, English, and other studies that he\'s basically on equal footing with college students. I think people have an issue with the age of consent laws more so than Ren\'s own well developed choices and decisions. Haru makes a comment about how Ren can not skip grades in Japan so he has to deal with taking easy classes until he graduates. Ren was taught by Harvard graduates when he was a child so it\'s really unlikely for him to still think and act like a naive kid. He\'s pretty clueless when it comes to emotional thoughts but he isn\'t a defenseless child that some reviewers seem to imagine him as.Anyway, I like the series because Abe managed to take such...""taboo"" and problematic elements of the fictional world and combine a few to make such a detailed well developed story. The manga is indefinitely better than the anime. Shoving 60+ pages worth of large amounts of text and art just can not be compressed accurately in a 23 minute episode. That\'s what the anime tried to do, compress these chapters into these small episodes so details are often overlooked and well, it made the anime awkward in some parts. The story was told wonderfully but I have to admit, it can get wonky and confusing unless you read the manga. Still, I gave the story a 10 only because the blend of all these different tropes make for an interesting plot. There\'s a TON of comedy so you\'ll be laughing at the most stupidest things! The soundtrack wasn\'t anything too wild or crazy but it was pretty...Exotic since it was mostly country. It gave me that nice slice of life feel. The characters, they feel relatable, some more so than others but my major complaint is the lack of screen time for the side characters and timing felt a bit off when it transitioned between the main couple and others\' problems. Still, I give Studio Deen props for including more issues and such of the other characters rather than just focusing on the fanservice that some studios cater towards nowadays. Overall, I rate it a nine! If I had chosen to only watch the anime, my rank could have possibly been lower but the manga made me understand more and did a real good job of keeping me on my toes! I\'m not even a fan of yaoi/bl/shounen-ai so this series was an honest surprise for me! It did not fit into any of my preferred tastes.In the end, if you\'re an open-minded individual who does not care for trivial matters in fiction such as age, relations, and such then I say give Super Lovers a chance! The art is pretty too, the studio makes the scenery stand out more so than the characters sometimes ahaha. This probably isn\'t the best of reviews but I just wanted to calm down new viewers nerves before they get into something they dislike and end up hating that thing forever.Enjoy! this episode a try.

Who doesn’t mind what is considered as incest in some countries.’PS : Yes, the law regarding adopted children varies from one country to another, some perceive it as incest, some don’t – just pointing out since I’ve seen both sides being claimed as some sort of absolute truth – in case of Japanese law, it isn’t considered as incest, so the product itself isn’t incest, but it is perfectly normal that for inhabitants of other countries it is perceived as such.PPS : No, the rating has nothing to do with it being male on male or...young/old, I was fully aware what I was getting into from the title to the poster to the synopsis ; my reason for trying it out was because I was positively surprised to see such an Anime with such a high rating on MAL, so I was really curious to try it out. You’re curious to know why then ? Welp, let’s keep it short, shall we ?Art :First of all, let’s start with the only quality of this show : its art. The art is consistent for the most part, except episodes 8 and 9 where there’s a perceptible drop, but it is never dramatic. One complaint I’d formulate, though, is the overuse of “sparkles” or “stars” to emphasis the “prettiness” of a scene, it’s so used it becomes funny after a while. Overusing anything tends to have that effect.Soundtrack :While it isn’t bad, there’s one soundtrack for one tone and with a constant tone shift, you end up hearing the same soundtracks several times per episodes, to the point it can sound redundant and lose all its charm, or even become tiring.Characters :With only 10 episodes and the show being closer to a resume of the manga rather than a proper show, most characters remain stereotyped and aren’t particularly explored. They may have more or less strong traits, but it never goes further. The same can be stated for the two protagonists. While it is obvious they are supposed to evolve over the years, the nature of the show makes it rather hard. While there’s no distinct evolution regarding Haru, Ren gets through slight changes, but it is hard to pin point a proper process with the writing constantly jumping from one thing to another and its numerous ellipses.Story :When the first episode of a show feels like the equivalent of an entire season, you can already foresee that the rest of the show will be a marathon in terms of pacing. And that’s not a compliment. I understand 10 episodes isn’t much and they wanted to cover as much of the manga as possible – apparently the pacing is slower and it takes time to develop its elements – but a show isn’t supposed to be a resume of another medium, it has to stand as its own.The plot points are so quick one after the other, the ellipses so numerous, that there’s little time left for elements to sink in and the tone shifts are so severe you go from one extreme to another and the positive as the negative feel overdone. (and here I speak of the story, not a character being overdramatic, which is fundamentally different) Good writing consists of ups and downs, yes, but repeatedly being on the extreme and too close to one or another is misunderstanding that basic concept.Lastly – yes, I did say I’d keep it short – but the last episode is problematic. Its cliffhanger is immediately shattered by the aftercredits. ….Do the people who wrote this know how a cliffhanger works ? Hahaha, there was 0 reason for the narrative closure to feature that element if it’s broken in an epilogue (it’s too consequent to call it a simple extra). ^^’Entertainment :I was amused at times, though, since it’s a theme that makes me uncomfortable outside pornography I was more than once off-put, especially in the forelast episode. I liked most characters, though considering the way females are portrayed more than once I question the unwanted potential reading that can be done. Well, at least I hope it’s unwanted.On the same unwantedness…Haru’s attitude which can very easily be perceived as...abusive. No, I don’t think it was the aim of the show, I think it wanted to be fun, lighthearted and cute with “sometimes” a bit of drama, but the way he acted and made Ren believe his actions are normal, kept repeating them and pushed himself on him (metaphorically and literally) is….er, let’s just say that such a situation IRL would lead Haru in prison and that the kid or teenager would be taken in charge by a psychologist for probably a few years. Anything but a funny or positive situation. And that thought – while I knew this is a fiction not taking this consideration at all, backed up by the fact in the end of the day no one ever thinks of it as damaging for Ren – always lured in the back of my mind. Now, of course, it’s just this theme that I have issues with, it doesn’t mean others have to have it and I don’t mind all those not having it, after all there are other themes who don’t bother me at all, some form of incest, for example, when it’d bother others.

The main character Haru and Ren are not blood related, but are expected to treat each other like brothers and might not completely understand the definition which makes for flirty scenes.Other than romance the story focusses on Ren's past life and gradually explains to you, the viewer, what caused him to be the way he is. His distachment and misunderstanding of the world is not overly done and explained throughout the story. Yet there are several cliché parts in the series, such as...Ren not understanding the reactions of his own body, the friends and family members of the two brothers hardly think badly of them for behaving overly flirty with other other even though they are supposedly related, not to mention males and of very different ages, that may be true elements in a teenager's life, but not in a gay community. It is great that everyone (albeit not openly supportive, but) is accepting of them, but most turn a blind eye to Haru's obvious attempt to get touchy-feely with a boy that should not match his age. The side characters however are enjoyable and more realistic about the entire set-up which is pleasant to see.In my opinion this series only got interesting at episode 07 where conflict between Haru and Ren about their current relationship and what they actually should be is brought to a climax with truthful, but hurtful words. After that there is far more development for both characters. Especially Ren comprehends that at his age his hormones are active and bring changes to his body and his reactions to Haru's endearments that have not changed from the very beginning but suddenly spark something desirable in Ren.For those among us who wish to experience a bit more intimacy, I recommend watching episode 09 over and over. It is subtle and there are no explicit images shown, but the dialogue and setting of the scene makes for the very first sexual experience between Haru and Ren. How exciting this may be, it is only one episode away from the end, which was rather dissatisying, because only just recently did the two of them get to explore the levels of their relationship and suddenly it is announced by Haruko that the two of them will be separated. This is, of course, against their will, and promises more interesting conflict in the near future, but for me personally it felt like going back to episode 01 and not having acchieved anything by watching the 10 episodes in total. I sincerely hope season 02 proves me wrong.All in all I give this series a 6/10. The story was intriguing enough to keep my attention and make me come back for more. However, I prefer the theme of homosexuality, incest and the fact that there's quite the age difference to be more realistic when it comes to being in a relationship with such elements and how the environment with family and friends respond. This was a romantic and dramatic season with lovely scenes of endearment between two people who obvioulsy care a lot about each other. So far it was an imagine of what we hope for them to happen, not so much what would actually happen.

It\'s basically a story of bromance between two brothers that turns into... proper romance. However, the characters that interact with the two main characters (especially the brothers) make...this an extremely interesting and captivating story.

Especially since the last few episodes seemed like they were going somewhere.Art 7/10Very nice character designs and a vibrant art style that\'s hardly unique, however really aesthetically pleasing and actually pretty enjoyable. That\'s all I have to say.SoundNo need for a mark here. The opening and closing songs are good enough, and the voice acting is pretty good. I don\'t feel the need to elaborate any further or associate this category with a numerical value.Characters 8/10This is where this show shines. I love the characters in this show. All of them. They have their own unique personality and thing that they bring to the show. It\'s surprising how much development and personal attachment you feel to the characters in just 10 episodes.

Again; PLEASE ERASE MY MEMORY OF THIS MESS."", 'Right after I watched the first episode of this anime, I already had a feeling that I am going to love this series. And man! I was right. This show was really so good I’ve given it’s first season a 9 out of 10 stars rating, *wink. Super Lovers have a total of 2 seasons, both with 10 episodes each and an OVA with 2 episodes.After the first yaoi that I have watched, I realized that I prefer 1 couple per show, and man! I can’t be happy enough that I am having that in this anime. Super Lovers gives us a very sweet (and...sometimes funny) narration on Haru and Ren’s romantic relationship.When I started this series, I was actually kind of confused with Haru and Ren’s relationship. It was really unusual and kind of nauseating (?) when you really think hard about the technicalities but with those wonderful graphics and the couple’s chemistry, it’s hard to dwell on that thought for long. So yep, as early as the first episode, I already accepted the fact that Haru and Ren belong to each other. I don’t want to spoil it for you so I am not going to explain more about that, instead, I’ll tell you that the age gap is really big. But that’s normal in yaoi anyway so I guess it’s fine.I don’t like stories with amnesia in it so I guess that’s the only thing I hated on the first season of this anime. The scenes we’re nicely done and I love how Haru and Ren’s relationship were progressing. And yes, you can definitely expect massive number of funny scenes in this anime in both seasons 1 and 2 as well as on its OVAS. As for the season 2, I actually don’t love it as much I love season 1, but I still ended up giving it an 8 out of 10 stars rating because in that season, it really focused on their relationship (a boy to boy relationship). And yes, there’s definitely a lot of times the S thing was mentioned which eventually became an issue to both the main characters. In relation to that, I really feel sorry (while laughing my heart out, haha) to a certain school nurse who’s always subjected to Ren’s question about a certain topic (it starts with S, haha) that is so awkward for a guy to answer, haha.Thinking back, I think it was a pretty good angle for season 2 because Haru and Ren’s relationship were really progressing. There were also some references to things couples do (if you get what I mean? haha) but it was usually done in a funny way so you won’t definitely feel uncomfortable. And nope, there’s definitely no explicit scenes here (but I think almost?, haha), but I’m still issuing you a warning though, because some kissing scenes we’re HOT AF! (Awww! haha)I love the graphics of this anime. Of all the yaoi (and possibly all the anime) I have watched, Super Lovers done it so perfectly. I’m a very visual person so imagine how my eyes turned into heart shapes every time I watch this anime. I just love everything – the character design (Haru’s definitely looks like Adonis and Ren is so cute I want to get him out of the screen and hug him), the animation, everything! And the music isn’t that bad either, *wink. Most yaoi anime features animals in them, and for this anime, it’s a dog!I don’t have any complaints about the characters either because my eyes were feasting on their good looks its hard to get mad at them, haha. But seriously, I don’t have any characters that I hated so much I want to kill them. Ofcourse there we’re some characters that was kind of against Haru and Ren’s complicated relationship but that’s normal, atleast in the end they we’re able to understand and eventually accept it.Super Lovers is definitely one of my top yaoi anime recommendations, curious? You’ve got to check it out!PS: It’s not a pedo, you need to watch the anime or read the manga before jumping into that conclusion, please! sometimes funny) narration on Haru and Ren’s romantic relationship.When I started this series, I was actually kind of confused with Haru and Ren’s relationship. It was really unusual and kind of nauseating (?) when you really think hard about the technicalities but with those wonderful graphics and the couple’s chemistry, it’s hard to dwell on that thought for long. So yep, as early as the first episode, I already accepted the fact that Haru and Ren belong to each other. I don’t want to spoil it for you so I am not going to explain more about that, instead, I’ll tell you that the age gap is really big. But that’s normal in yaoi anyway so I guess it’s fine.I don’t like stories with amnesia in it so I guess that’s the only thing I hated on the first season of this anime. The scenes we’re nicely done and I love how Haru and Ren’s relationship were progressing. And yes, you can definitely expect massive number of funny scenes in this anime in both seasons 1 and 2 as well as on its OVAS. As for the season 2, I actually don’t love it as much I love season 1, but I still ended up giving it an 8 out of 10 stars rating because in that season, it really focused on their relationship (a boy to boy relationship). And yes, there’s definitely a lot of times the S thing was mentioned which eventually became an issue to both the main characters. In relation to that, I really feel sorry (while laughing my heart out, haha) to a certain school nurse who’s always subjected to Ren’s question about a certain topic (it starts with S, haha) that is so awkward for a guy to answer, haha.Thinking back, I think it was a pretty good angle for season 2 because Haru and Ren’s relationship were really progressing. There were also some references to things couples do (if you get what I mean? haha) but it was usually done in a funny way so you won’t definitely feel uncomfortable. And nope, there’s definitely no explicit scenes here (but I think almost?, haha), but I’m still issuing you a warning though, because some kissing scenes we’re HOT AF! (Awww! haha)I love the graphics of this anime. Of all the yaoi (and possibly all the anime) I have watched, Super Lovers done it so perfectly. I’m a very visual person so imagine how my eyes turned into heart shapes every time I watch this anime.

And that's just the story- the animation did not do its score any favors, and all of the characters are shallow and unrelatable, even for a gay male viewer like myself.I gave it a score just barely above a 1 because...I liked the dogs, though, and because being able to roast it with friends is genuinely enjoyable.

I didn't even realize the change in Ren until Haruko pointed it out. Everything seamlessly connects.The art is amazing, and the characters are really good-looking, which is great...

Regarding the quality of it, it is very good, but I'm no expert on that.Overall, this was a really great show. There were no hardcore yaoi moments (ep. 9 could have turned into one, though), but there was fan service, kissing most episodes, and just affection in general.Probably not the first yaoi you should see, if you want to venture into this genre.

When Ren turns 15 or 16 years old there, but starts with a love with fewer touches because it is SHONEN-AIand it's not bad, why? It is simple and very easy to understand many at that age we fall in love with people over one (Haru is 21) and many get to have relationships at that age with people like that, if it happens, only here you show it with men and they are not brothers of blood.It's not SHOTACON because Ren was 15 or 16 years old, he's a teenager, which is impossible to refer to as SHOTACON.Ren and Haru feel the same and respect each otherAlso one thing if you were in love with someone older or younger than you and that other person also feels the same as you, you would ignore the people who know who insults them and are against that relationship, you would listen to those people or yourself?It is not difficult to understand, if you have a case of homophobia or you did not pay attention to that I think that in that case you understand a lot.another thing I read many protests and they did not understand that Ren was raised by wolves XDHe gave me a little laugh because Ren is not raised by wolves, Ren is fond of the wolves and spends time with them because he is antisocial with his breeders and besides that in the huerfaneria he was abused.Ren lived a very bad life in that horfanato alone, but when Haru's mother went to see him he takes the dogs with him and apparently Ren liked them becoming a fan of that kind of animals besides that it is known that many times animals understand us more than a human.Ren is adopted by Haru's father and stepmother, so that he will be legally with Haru's mother, because it is understood that Haru's mother is alone and she was the one who wanted to adopt him but for the reasons that she should be with The other family adopted the spouse while being the family of the three, I know it is confusing that topic but if you watch the anime or the manga once more and take a little more attentionRen in Canada is very antisocial with his family so he spends more time with the wolves for personal reasons of him and becoming examples to follow.When Haru arrives he imitates the behaviors of the wolves, Haru and Ren coexist as brother and become attached to each other.It is not difficult to follow this anime seriously is sooooo easy, I still had doubts about a part of that series but analyze it well and watching the manga I understood.If you did not understand the Manga or the Anime you can ask, but if you judge it just for calling attention to being a homophobe and not understanding that relationship thinking about pedophilia, without understanding very well that Ren is a teenager and Haru is 21 years old, and that many people have not fallen in love with it in the way of Ren and Haru. I think there is a lot left to think about people.Art I liked a lot as the designs of various things such as trees and other aspects.Sound more or less, the effects and some melodies were good but the Opening was not so pegadiso and honestly is not my favorite.But the enjoyment was a lot, thank you also get to practice much the compression of an anime to see this because most only come to opinions that were not to see this Anime with depth but only see it looking for errors to throw things.It's a good Anime shonen-ai.I loved it.I know it was long but I had to explain and leave it because I liked it and it shows a lot, also because most of my girls do not see shonen-ai and only Yaoi with Hard.I explain when Haru and Ren met, at the age of Ren's 8 years old, real love does not start there and it is seen that it is not, it is only a behavior between brother and brother ADOPTED.

I am really new to this genre (surprising myself), but decided to give it a try (despite a name I find ridiculous and misleading) after watching Love Stage!! and Doukyuusei. I think I have officially become a convert... and that is because I finally am getting love stories that are realistic and gritty. This anime did not play around with the feelz, make you painfully wait a season and a half/umpteen episodes for a kiss out, or play cat and mouse with the pink love elephant in the room.... and that made me straight up spiral into the story. Idk if it's because men...are emotionally different or what, but I felt like the anime could actually explore and build upon the characters and their emotions because it didnt take forever brow beating around the bush. You SAW actual progression, and it hooked me...The animation was well done in my opinion, the humor was delivered in spades, I liked the musical scores and loved the story...I also didn't feel like I was thrust into some soft core f*** fest, but was guided naturally (for the most part). The ONE qualm I had was the whole kissing on the lips thing, although it became so damn hilarious later on.. but I am docking a point since it felt forced/unnatural in the beginning. This is an anime that plays around with Taboo shit, so if you aren't prepared to watch it subjectively with that in mind just keep on scrolling. I went into it neutral, and came out ok.

Ill give a somewhat detailed rundown as to why this anime is great without spoiling anything.Story.(10/10)From episode 1 to this anime has it highs and lows for the Main Characters Ren and Haru and at several points the show made me sad for the characters and thats something that the vast majority of shows cant do but in contrast to that the show has...many moments that make me smile and laugh which shows you how well written it is. Withoout going into any spoilers i can safely say you will enjoy the story even if you dont like Shounen Ai  anime.Sound(10/10)Not much to say hear both the music and the voice acting and other sounds are done outstandingly. Only one issue here but its more a personal one and doesn't take a way from the 10/10 score and that that with my eyesight issues reading subtitles is very hard and therefore id love the chance to rewatch the show in English at some point.Characters(10/10)All  of the characters are great and seem overall like believable people. The anime primarily focuses on the Main 2 characters Ren and Haru. Ren is  my favourite character in the anime by a large margin however as i find his personality very similar to my own as he seems very much like the kind of peroson who is smart and honest but straight forward and he hates crowds whcich i can understand as well all as his sometimes lack in social skills which i also have at times. The other characters are also great but Ren stands out to me the most .Art(10/10)The art for this anime is beautiful and the characters are very cute and well drawn as well as the backgounds and objects , small details etc .  Not much more to say here.Overall(10/10)Overall the anime is  pretty much perfect except for the fact there isnt enough of it and i wish it was englsish  so  one request is that the creators make a third season and please dub the anime :)  Hope my review helped many moments that make me smile and laugh which shows you how well written it is.

No? Does this sound like something that you should never, ever hear, or that it should never, ever exist? Welcome to Super Lovers!Don\'t get fooled though; Super Lovers knows exactly what it is, and its audience knows that fully well. It\'s just shounen ai sibling fantasy comfort food for shotacons. There is a certain trend in romance stories that appears quite often, and that is yes-we-are-relatives-but-not-exactly-since-one-of-us-is-adoptive-so-it-is-taboo-but-it-doesn\'t-really-count. Trying to both have the cake and eat it as well, Super Lovers falls straight into this category, throwing in the age difference in order to satisfy more fetishes....One would expect though, that a story with such a theme, would be ripe with drama and conflicts and generally lots of trouble. Nope! Super Lovers has none of that! It doesn\'t want you to worry, or make you feel uncomfortable (which it inadvertently does by the sheer factor of creepiness). It just wants to make you sit back, relax, and enjoy the daily lives of a ""family"" of hot men where the oldest one humps the younger one and nobody sees absolutely any reason to call the police, they just laugh at how cute it is. Enter nice looking still shots and only the smallest possible amount of any kind of movement in animation, courtesy of DEEN.Now, the main issue with Super Lovers is how it tries to present a completely toxic and illegal situation as completely normal and cute instead. The story could work, in the hands of someone who would actually want to do something more with it; Make a clear distinction between familial love and romantic love and point out the problems in such a possible relationship. But nope! Super Lovers seems to believe that there is no distinction between those two kinds of love if you are adopted and there are no blood ties! You could easily have a drinking game every time the words ""family"" and ""brother"" are being said in each episode. You wouldn\'t survive the night. And yet... kissing and humping seem mandatory as well. Who in the right mind thought of making this connection I wonder.If that wasn\'t enough, what makes this even creepier, is the fact that even if Ren is a teenager at 16 years old (I guess?) the series goes out of its way to really stress the fact that emotionally and sometimes mentally, he\'s still a little child. That makes Haru\'s doting on him feel like he\'s taking an advantage over a confused child who knows no better and molests him - even if Ren is supposedly of an age when he\'s capable of making such kind of decisions for himself, it still feels like child grooming - and I guess, that was the point?The supporting characters are absolutely pointless. They do nothing to contribute to the story in any way. If they weren\'t there, absolutely no one would be able to tell the difference. Because that would demand the existence of something akin to plot. And there isn\'t such a thing here. Nope.Now, I\'ve watched my fair share of yaoi - yes including all kinds of hentai - but what I found peculiar here, so I\'m writing about it, it\'s how hard the creepiness factor hit me in the face in this one. If you think about it without prejudice, it\'s just the romance with 9-10 years of age difference, a doting seme and a grumpy uke. But throwing the concept of family, and stressing it out so intently, and showing those people live supposedly as ""SIBLINGS"" in a ""FAMILY"", and also stressing out how small the uke is and how he needs protection and someone to look after him and raise him, really hit some creep-o-meter levels that shouldn\'t even be possible.Also, dogs. The creator obviously has a thing for dogs - see Hakkenden. No, throwing in some dogs and making constant metaphors and analogies with dogs will not make such a sick situation any cuter! The audacity of it all!In conclusion, if you\'re into yaoi and have a special fetish with fake siblings, watch it why not. If you are not please don\'t do this to yourself. Run away. You can still make it! I\'m into yaoi so I\'m giving it a 5, but here I\'ll give it a 4/10 - sometimes it was mildly watchable so I won\'t go any lower.

WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS???I kept screaming as I watched all ten episodes of this molestation shit way back 2017.On a review streak lately and I just had to come write one on this anime cause I can't even comprehend, not even a little why the score for this is high as it is.I like a lot of Gay stuff(besides most yaoi). Shoujo-ai is my second favorite genre, an escape when I watch too much straight people bullshit, like wise shounen-ai. So back in 2017 I wanted to try something different & I stumbled upon this and Antique bakery,...I watched the latter first and loved it so much. Then I started Super lovers, yikes! I remember shutting myself under my bed cover and screaming under the pillows how so sick this was.Plot:1/The story is so fucking pathetic, like pathetic is too kind a word. I can remember something about the lil kid being adopted by the old guys mom, later on they began living together. All of a sudden, that fucking old creep begins to touch the boy, like touching him in all the wrong places, ewww. Like C'mon that's your fucking step bro and he is so little for fuckssake! I never got to hear that lil boy's age announced, I was just so freaked out by the entire thing. I finished this regardless cause back in 2017 I made sure no matter how horrible something is I had to go on completing it. This anime is fucking sick I swear.Art:1/I hate everything about this anime.Sound: 1/Can't remember the soundtracks thank fucking God!Characters: 1/That Pedophile is just the worst. Molesting a lil kid. I think he put it in at one point😭A Lil boy's cherry popped!Enjoyment: 1/I still can't believe I completed this, like how the fuck did I finish this?

But boredom has got to me. Also, as i have watched super lovers a good 2+ years ago my memory may be a little murky.Super lovers is what you\'d call a shounen-ai, a genre that has very pedophilic roots.In super lovers we get to see a grown ass man groom his little brother while everybody watches and doesn\'t say shit. I think what i find most disgusting is that everybody in that series knows it\'s wrong but doesn\'t do anything to help ren get away...from his disgusting older brother.Now the other thing that\'s so utterly strange about super lovers is the entertainment, yes all the characters were dogshit, if not worse that that. But I somehow managed to blast through those episodes so quickly, it\'s kinda shocking.Onto the art, there isn\'t really much to say about it except the fact that occasionally throughout the series, (from what i can remember) the art got nicer. Either way it\'s a waste of talent overall considering how shitty this series is.Overall this series could\'ve been at least a tad better if the 2 weren\'t literally brothers and 8 years apart.Well that\'s the end of my small rant that i will call a ""review"", also sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes. from his disgusting older brother.Now the other thing that\'s so utterly strange about super lovers is the entertainment, yes all the characters were dogshit, if not worse that that.

At first, I was expecting something Boku No Pico-esque but it was surprisingly cute.The characters are well developed and likable. The art style is beautiful; being a 2016 anime, the sound and art is very clean.It's not entirely obvious how young Ren is, so depending on how comfortable you are watching children as part of a yaoi, this anime may not be for you. It's certainly not as disturbing as other underage yaoi, and it's certainly not graphic,so it may be good even for the faint-hearted.It's extremely slow build which is I find irritating, especially since there isn't...much of a payoff by the time things get going. I was expecting more Junjou Romantica-type scenes but there just weren't enough of them. Hopefully because their relationship only really got off the ground in the final few episodes, a second season will contain cuter scenes. much of a payoff by the time things get going.

The problem is, it would work SO PERFECTLY if it didn't have the romance. If this was just a sweet show of an older brother getting his younger brother to get out more and open up to him, it would've been so cute. Heck, the older brother could still be gay but maybe date another adult. Instead, he decides to date his younger brother. The one who he helped raise when the kid was 8. The kid (uke) is now in middle school, and the seme is a goddamn full-grown man (maybe in his 20s?).It's basically grooming with a...cutesy family theme. Seriously, there wasn't even enough romance in it for it to be constituted as romance. If they removed those kiss scenes and just kept everything else, it would've been a very heart-warming family anime. cutesy family theme.

In addition, they did not make the characters as siblings to avoid incest, but the relationship between them is basically based on a big brother-little brother relationship. The older one's interest in the other begins when the other is still a child. Totally disgusting. The child then becomes a highschool student and is still a child. The man is much older than him. I also remember the man trying to kiss and touch him even though he didn't want to. This is blatant harassment. Why don't people react negatively to this anime?

It's very light-hearted and comedic as well, their gags are absolutely hilarious and their little emotional moments will tug at your heart strings. YOU WILL NOT regret watching this anime, it's so amazing I really wish they could just release so many more episodes all at once because it's like I can't get enough of all the...characters in this anime. 10/10 characters in this anime. 10/10"", ""I give this show a 10/10, i would go into more detail but i dont feel like writing a 10 paragraph review about why people are wrong and why this anime is #1.A quick little summary:  The Plot is Great, It may start out slow but so do most anime nowadays. The characters are 10/10 IGN and The Artwork is fantastic.  Now onto me addressing the negative reviews.i hate to trample on other people's negative reviews(Not really, i enjoy it actually) But to the people that are saying Haru is being manipulative, Go fuck yourselves. If you Numskulls actually watched the...anime you would see that Ren is smart enough to know if he is being manipulated, he also Would know when enough is enough with Haru.Also on a side note: To the idiots saying this is incest, go fuck yourselves harder. By law definition, incest is sexual intercourse between 2 BLOOD related family members. Ren and Haru are not blood related so it is technically not incest, and for Christ's sake, Ren is fucking 16 years old, He is old and smart enough to know when Haru is crossing the line and when he does not want something.  IF you fucktards actually looked at the anime you would see that Ren is not against what Haru does, he may act a little awkward but you would too if you were in his shoes.Overall score for the fucktards who gave negative reviews: Go fuck yourselves and jump off bridges.

Despite the bright cover art, this is as far as you can possibly get from it.. The show's premise is of a 20 something year old man (Haru), pursuing a relationship with a 15 year old(Ren)... And some how that's supposed to be cute, or acceptable, and nobody should question the status quo about this very problematic relationship.In real life and in anime I have no problem with age gaps as long as it's between consenting adults. But the problem here is that...Ren is a minor, an abused minor, and there in lies the problems with the relationship with Haru and effectively the series as a whole, because without the romance there's not much plot here. This BL anime like other popular works in this genre are shown in a bright cheery note as a cute romance show, but as I said one of the characters is a minor. Despite the sparkles and weird floating geometric shapes, the actual story of the relationship is pretty dark when you think about it.Haru is responsible for Ren's wellbeing, but seems unaware about a lot of things given the fact he's responsible for raising him essentially.  We have to assume that Haru knows about some of the things Ren had gone through, he even mentions it in the first episode, but past that it seems like he doesn't know  why  Ren is acting the way he is or he just simply does not care like he says he does. For instance if someone doesn't like to be touched, kissed or hugged, you don't keep forcing yourself on them, this is typical behavior in those who've been abused physically, and that's the only abuse we're told about. This constant violation of boundaries continues for much of the series, Ren does or says something contrary to what Haru wants and Haru pretty much forces himself on Ren to get the result that Haru wants. It makes me think that Haru doesn't care if he comes off as abusive, that's horrible.Ren is probably the saving grace of the show because he is fundamentally different than what he was at the beginning of the season, he has growth, but I can't say the same for Haru he really doesn't change at all even though he's supposed to be the main character and *love* interest. I also generally like the supporting cast, especially Haruko, I'd almost rather see a series of her and Ren, then Haru and Ren. Tanuki might also be my favorite character even more than the people in this show.The art is also another thing I didn't hate, yes it's generic and stiff, and there's errors in animation. But given the fact there's still not a lot of Yaoi anime out there even now, it's not the worst out there.Overall I stuck with watching the series because I like to hate watch, and like to make myself mad over fictional characters.

Nothing made sense to me, such as, the flashbacks when they showed up it didn\'t sense for that scene they just randomly appeared. The fact that they were (adoptive) brothers made me feel very uncomfortable and I didn\'t realize this until I actually watched the anime. How I found this anime...was by Youtube I was looking for a new Boys Love to watch and I came across cute moments of this series. I didn\'t realize that they were ""brothers"" or the fact that there was an age gap though I was a little confused when watching the videos on Youtube because Ren looked like a damn 12 year old which scared because the man Haru looked like 30 year old. And trust me this isn\'t me just being dumb, I\'ve seen people who are 28 years old and sure some may look older but most look like they\'re at least from collage. This man looked like some creepy thing, I don\'t even know what to call him at this point, I don\'t even know if I can call him a human being.And before I watched this anime I also watched another anime with an age gap may I mention but this anime made me feel uncomfortable because of what Ren looked like. Even though the age gap was exactly the same I\'m pretty sure. Plus I watched some of the scenes because I skipped episodes and I didn\'t quite like the fact that the side characters just ignored their relationship pretty much.I\'m just going to say this is my own opinion about show. Everyone has their own opinion so if you enjoyed this good for you but I\'m just going tell I hated it.Story (1)Art (4)Sound (6)Character (4)Enjoyment (1)Overall (1) was by Youtube I was looking for a new Boys Love to watch and I came across cute moments of this series.

This is a strange thing to watch. If you're usually not a yaoi/shounen-ai/BL fan, this is the review for you.To begin with, I have to tell you that if you want to watch this series and not gouge out your own eyes, you have to forget regular social convention and that it takes place in the real world. If you can't get past the fact that the main ship is incestual (adopted brothers, so not technically blood related) and kinda pedophilic (seme is a grown ass adult: around 25ish, uke is probably like 15, definitely looks kinda shota) and very few people in...the anime are concerned about these facts.But if you can get past all that, you might actually enjoy this show. Am I on the NSA watchlist yet? Probably. (I swear I'm not a pedophile you guys please)Let's begin. The story itself is pretty lackluster. It completely revolves around Ren, the kid, and Haru, the lowkey predatory adult. Ren has a lot of baggage to deal with, but it's not really explored. Long story short: little to no plot. They tried to throw in a couple of plot elements to spice things up but it created too many plot holes and strange connections and overall, it's just easier to ignore the aspect altogether.The art itself is actually pretty. Haru's eyes are done very well, most of the character are really attractive, and Ren is just a little darling. The backgrounds are forgettable, but there's hardly any that really deserve to be looked at other than the Canadian wilderness. The animation is eh a lot of the time though, but it's not bad enough to bother me.Personally, I didn't really like the opening and closing, but I suppose that's pretty normal for any anime of this genre. Throw in any sparkly music with a lot of bishies and you're good to go! Background music included a lot of flute solos, and it was hard for me to concentrate because it reminded me of the Titanic Flute Fail Meme (look it up it's hilarious). The voice actors did an amazing job for the most part.Ugh, the characters are in a class of their own. I'll be honest, I adored Ren. I have a soft spot for abused or neglected children because of my own past, and I just wanted to give him a hug the whole time. I think in the context of the real world though, Haru is grooming Ren to become an accepting and submissive child and I find it pretty disgusting. If we are to pretend this is in some other universe and all normal convention is void, even then I'm not completely comfortable with what's going on. It's strange to describe because what's going on IS sexual abuse, pedophilia, and domestic abuse, but yaoi seems to not talk that into consideration.I hate myself for enjoying this as much as I did.I would recommend this if you: like shounen-ai, like incest-y ships that can still happen, like brotherly love in general, like older semes and shota ukes, don't have problems with any of the problematic shit going down, like to binge yaoi/BL/shounen-aiI would NOT recommend this if you: are here for smexy time (implied but not shown), are uncomfortable with pedophilia or incest-y relationships, dislike jealousy and seme-uke tropes, wanted a plotHave a great day everyone! the anime are concerned about these facts.But if you can get past all that, you might actually enjoy this show.

Every single episode left me feeling extremely sorry for Ren.

Ren is a fourteen year old child, and every adult around him watches as he is constantly molested by a twenty two year old...adult.

Regardless of how badly Ren wants to be treated like an adult, he isn\'t one, and it\'s the responsability of the ACTUAL adults around him to take care of him and not abuse him.

It reminded me of Shounen Maid, where someone takes over guardianship of a kid, and slowly they start to bond and open up to each other. The first episode was beautiful, and I loved how Haru was able to bring out the good side of Ren. That wall was coming down. So call me ignorant, but I was expecting a beautiful story of brotherly bonding. Two people who learned to trust each other and love each other even when hardships came. What actually came was completely unexpected. I didn't even know what...shounen ai was before watching this. The way Haru kissed Ren on the lips was odd, but I looked past it; for all I knew it could have been a normal custom for him. Some of his other actions just looked like cuddling like one may normally do with a sibling (every once in a while - however the frequency was something I overlooked because they both seemed as though they had been hurt and needed to lean on each other - obviously, I was wrong). What I'm trying to say, is I was not expecting a romance to blossom between these 2 brothers. I don't care if Ren was adopted; family is family and that sort of thing should not happen between brothers, especially not when they are so far apart in age. I'm sure this appeals to somebody, but not me.

I  have seen a lot of recommendations and clips about this yaoi so here is my opinion/review.***Enjoy***Story ~ {5}The story seemed all over...the place, in the beginning it made sense just for a brief moment Haru visiting his mom but. As the story progressed it was honestly everywhere,  Ren being raised by wolves? Ren\'s parents still a mystery... haru having a relationship with his under- aged brother (adopted)  more then a sibling should ever cross? and ren reciprocating a love hate-relationship with haru is somewhat entertaining, cute and very uncomfortable (AT TIMES!!!) , the story got better but there were times when me as a viewer would get whip lash because of several misinterpretations for example the 7 year time elapse, Haru getting in a car accident, (moving forward) Haru telling ren that he had to kiss him when he left and got home from school and i cant forget when ren was being chocked by that over obsessed  woman.. personally I  had to go back and re watch some episodes because they were unclear and very vague.ART~ 10I honestly like the art a lot, it seems that they took time to strategically make out the characters faces, I love the setting in japan, the cherry blossoms outside the room Ren was hardly in. even the BMW  Haru was ridding around ** spoiler** ( I know yall seen that BMW in the episode  where Haru says Ren has a low sex drive) getting all the woman\'s attention I even liked the cute dog Ren always held.Sound ~ 10I loved the ending music it was very enjoyable, the music playing softly in the background giving the anime a melody vibe, Also the extra sound effects that the characters gave off  was really good i enjoyed it.Characters ~ 5I have given my opinion on all the characters that  were important in the animation.Haru Kaido:( let me get start on this pedophile...) He is the older brother of shima, aki and ren Kaido he is very loving and caring to his siblings  but is rather interested in his younger adopted brother ren his is very controlling we all can see in the beginning that he also makes sexual advances to ren but at the same time can be very caring and supportive ( AT TIMES!!)..  he is rather sneaking and just his character makes me uneasy i had to pause the video sometimes because he was just going crazy (almost raping ren that night when he was drunk), him kissing ren all the time im surprised they didn\'t shower together but him masturbating ren was to much, his character is just uncomfortable but its ""yaoi so its what I would expect"".Ren Kaido : A very anti- social boy, who is very naive when it comes to certain things.. (Not knowing how to release himself) he is very fragile and small for his age, can be very stubborn at times as well. Even when ren was trying to laugh was funny ... He has good exceptions but can be seen being very immature for his age "" enticing Haru  coming out the shower naked???""  and can be very submissive at times letting Haru do almost anything to him also (Knowing his limits respectfully). I like Ren\'s character with few flaws it has.Aki & shima Kaido: I honestly think the twins were very irrelevant to the story it seemed like they were just thrown in the story without further planning, only to be introduced later on in the story and they were disregarded a lot i wish they had more screen time but they weren\'t really involved with ren (except shima having dinner with him)... I think having them in the story-line  for a brief minuet at a time  also helped to give us a break from Haru (grooming and attempting to molest Ren) There were many flaws with these two character. shima and the girl he was tutoring had a similar a  relationship to that of Ren and Haru that needed more screen time period.!!!Iuyoshi Sasaki : He was ""VERY VERY VERY"" annoying to me, he just seemed like ""a rat scavenging for cheese""  in my opinion he never had his own money because he was always begging Haru to buy him lunch. but he did work so i give him that, he was so annoying and that cute name he gave ren (ren ren) was so cute and funny but he was more so the gossip one who honestly had organic vegtables and a profit on the store he was investing in with Haru going for himself.Haruko D.Diechmann; she was funny, serious and had a interesting relation with her son Haru i like that she took ren in but,  rather disappears when the setting takes place in japan only to be just thrown back in the story later on... (moving on)Enjoyment ~ 6It was ok very cringe worthy and im going to leave it at that.Overal ~ 8I liked this anime in-spite of the molestation\'s going on in the animation  i would recommend it to ( Tv-14) for mature young adults, the art was great i loved the music it was an emotional, cringe-worthy, roller coaster i hope the twin brothers are incorporated more in the animation as we all await for season 2, im kinda excited i just have been watching naruto in the mean time overall i would recommend to watch... the manga was really bad compared to the animation thank god they left some of what they really did behind closed doors alone.Enjoy *** the place, in the beginning it made sense just for a brief moment Haru visiting his mom but.

He is the older brother of shima, aki and ren Kaido he is very loving and caring to his siblings  but is rather interested in his younger adopted brother ren his is very controlling we all can see in the beginning that he also makes sexual advances to ren but at the same time can be very caring and supportive ( AT TIMES!!)..  he is rather sneaking and just his character makes me uneasy i had to pause the video sometimes because he was just going crazy (almost raping ren that night when he was drunk), him kissing ren all the time im surprised they didn\'t shower together but him masturbating ren was to much, his character is just uncomfortable but its ""yaoi so its what I would expect"".Ren Kaido : A very anti- social boy, who is very naive when it comes to certain things.. (Not knowing how to release himself) he is very fragile and small for his age, can be very stubborn at times as well. Even when ren was trying to laugh was funny ... He has good exceptions but can be seen being very immature for his age "" enticing Haru  coming out the shower naked???""  and can be very submissive at times letting Haru do almost anything to him also (Knowing his limits respectfully). I like Ren\'s character with few flaws it has.Aki & shima Kaido: I honestly think the twins were very irrelevant to the story it seemed like they were just thrown in the story without further planning, only to be introduced later on in the story and they were disregarded a lot i wish they had more screen time but they weren\'t really involved with ren (except shima having dinner with him)... I think having them in the story-line  for a brief minuet at a time  also helped to give us a break from Haru (grooming and attempting to molest Ren) There were many flaws with these two character. shima and the girl he was tutoring had a similar a  relationship to that of Ren and Haru that needed more screen time period.!!!Iuyoshi Sasaki : He was ""VERY VERY VERY"" annoying to me, he just seemed like ""a rat scavenging for cheese""  in my opinion he never had his own money because he was always begging Haru to buy him lunch. but he did work so i give him that, he was so annoying and that cute name he gave ren (ren ren) was so cute and funny but he was more so the gossip one who honestly had organic vegtables and a profit on the store he was investing in with Haru going for himself.Haruko D.Diechmann; she was funny, serious and had a interesting relation with her son Haru i like that she took ren in but,  rather disappears when the setting takes place in japan only to be just thrown back in the story later on... (moving on)Enjoyment ~ 6It was ok very cringe worthy and im going to leave it at that.Overal ~ 8I liked this anime in-spite of the molestation\'s going on in the animation  i would recommend it to ( Tv-14) for mature young adults, the art was great i loved the music it was an emotional, cringe-worthy, roller coaster i hope the twin brothers are incorporated more in the animation as we all await for season 2, im kinda excited i just have been watching naruto in the mean time overall i would recommend to watch... the manga was really bad compared to the animation thank god they left some of what they really did behind closed doors alone.Enjoy ***', 'If you love the genre, you also might like this Anime. But there is nothing you haven´t seen yet, so I really would say this Anime is complete average.Exept for the fact, that there is such a huge difference in age between the two boys, it´s creepy. And additionally, the two are brothers, so I am still not able to familiarize with the relationship between the two.Also, they always skip huge time periods, and everything goes so fast, I don´t understand why they are producing 2 seasons and rushing so fast forward - especially after having watched the end. Therefore, the story looses its...depth, and parts, where something important could be discussed, just get ruined by comedy-parts or the jump in time.I liked the Comedy part, don´t get me wrong, but sometimes it just...didn´t fit.The most beautiful thing - and the one part of the Anime that makes it really worth watching- are the bright colors and the awesome wonderfully drawn landscapes. Hard but true. So, just watch the first episode and see for yourself.So, all in all a pleasant Anime for in between if you are able to ignore the age of the main characters and like the genre, but nothing outstanding. depth, and parts, where something important could be discussed, just get ruined by comedy-parts or the jump in time.I liked the Comedy part, don´t get me wrong, but sometimes it just...didn´t fit.The most beautiful thing - and the one part of the Anime that makes it really worth watching- are the bright colors and the awesome wonderfully drawn landscapes.

Some people will never look beyond the surface of their phobias and biases and are too stupid to figure out there's a human element to the interactions between the characters that is being portrayed. When Ren was a very young child his drug addict mom sold him to buy drugs. There is a brief scene that shows adult men looming over him, suggesting he was probably molested early in life. That is something that will affect his relationships.  Haru was unloved and basically...abandoned by his selfish mom, coupled with the accident that killed his father and step-mom and nearly killed him, which would have an effect on his relationships. There's more being said in this story than BL.I'm glad for the diversity that anime brings to the viewer - whether I'm watching Attack on Titan, Blue Exorcist, Kado The Right Answer, or Super Lovers - it's all about the story, the character interaction and development, and the art of the graphics.  So for all the narrow minded little bitches out there, just shut up, stop whining about your phobias. You don't have to watch it if makes you uncomfortable and it's just anime.

Later when Ren is older, he moves to Japan to live with Haru and Haru’s two half-brothers. While they work on sorting out Ren’s psychological issues stemming from his past as an orphan, Ren and Haru slowly develop romantic and sexual feelings toward one another.The art here is undeniably lovely, crisp, and clean, and the slice-of-life elements are soft and sweet. However, though it doesn’t use many of the typical problematic yaoi tropes, the anime still falls apart...on its core romantic relationship. Partially because they first meet when Ren is so young and such an unusual child, everything the older Haru does feels really manipulative and inappropriate. Even though they aren’t related by blood, Haru is still in a position of power over Ren as his guardian, which makes everything have a very awkward and uncomfortable overtone. They even discuss this element repeatedly throughout the anime but somehow aren’t ever able to come to the obvious conclusion. What’s worse is that everyone around them can see what’s going on and essentially enables the ongoing relationship instead of interfering to protect Ren, who is still a child.While it’s clear that Ren and Haru certainly care for each other, the anime would have worked better if the romantic aspect of their relationship had waited until Ren was older, with time to come to terms with his own sexuality, and then chose to pursue Haru, but it doesn’t work as it is and just feels unpleasant instead of the cute and funny tone it was going for. on its core romantic relationship.

I started it because I really like shonen voiced by women and it featured 2 of my favourite voice actors.First, the plot is definitely quite interesting though some parts felt a little out of place. The pacing didn\'t feel off, nothing feels too stagnant. It\'s kind of like a slice of life with BL elements sprinkled in.The BL element to all this is perhaps the most controversial part of this anime. Though Ren and Haru\'s relationship would certainly be uncomfortable and...discouraged in real life, I found it interesting to delve into it in a fictional setting.Though it may not be intentional, I found it interesting the more subtle ways their relationship could be considered unhealthy. For example, Haru\'s treatment of Ren depends on his own mood and feelings at the moment-- he\'ll shower him with affection when he feels like it, and neglect him if he\'s not feeling up to par. He doesn\'t show signs of being ready to be a guardian figure for him.Their relationship can almost be described as codependent; it\'s clear that Haru clings to him for his own self-fulfillment, and he likely needs Ren more than Ren needs him. It\'s much like ""throw a dog a bone once, he\'ll guard your house for life"". He formed a bond with Ren during his formative years, which established a foundation for this relationship.Ren is definitely susceptible to manipulation, and quite accepting of Haru\'s antics. He is utterly devoted to his wants and needs. In short, he\'s a very convenient person for Haru to lean on and take what he needs from him. While Haru does care for him and spoil him, it does seem like he\'s doing it for his own benefit just as much.Super Lovers has caused divide among the anime community for its controversial elements. I personally find this anime interesting yet average. I found the plot quite uneventful and sometimes dry, but there were cute moments and the relationship between Ren and Haru was incredibly fun to analyse. discouraged in real life, I found it interesting to delve into it in a fictional setting.Though it may not be intentional, I found it interesting the more subtle ways their relationship could be considered unhealthy.

The boy had been abandoned, mistreated and deeply traumatized as young child before he came into the care of a Canadian female scientist living in the woods. For reasons that escape me, this child does not get counseling or professional psychological help learning to deal with this early trauma, but what do I know?Through circumstance,...Ren is later adopted into a Japanese family consisting of Haru - the oldest brother, a 24-year-old man and the son of the Canadian scientist - and his male twin half-brothers in their late teens/ later early twenties.What I think they were trying to depict is that in a relationship the older is not necessarily the more mature; and that a teenager can be firm in his desires and sexual orientation. That would have been ok. But.Despite the pretty visuals, good music, and good dubbing, what we then see is how the adult man, the person expected to protect his younger siblings and ward, is a pedophile. Ren imprinted on Haru as 8-year-old since Haru was the first male to treat him kindly and with affection when he visited Canada. His feelings last into teenage years; he is in love with Haru and asks for a sexual relation. We then follow how Ren and Haru share a bedroom and the same bed daily. Haru initiates kisses on the mouth in private and in public and is otherwise overstepping the boundaries between caring, comforting and sexual intimacy. The twins and other side characters are entirely ok with this behavior; they laugh at their older sibling and excuse his naivete.How is this story ok?Why should we accept that the boy – this underage child - is being preyed upon and that his isolated upbringing following the childhood trauma gives him little protection from the advances of a man that he trusts and who is legally responsible for him? In a very cute way, this anime promotes pedophilia and makes it seem ok that an adult shares intimacy with a child; It does not help that Ren although about 15/16 is stunted and looks like an 11-year old. There would be an uproar if we would see a teenage girl looking 11 sleep next to her male guardian in the same bed and see how he takes intimate liberties. Many people would realize that that storyline is unacceptable yet just because Ren is a boy, we should think it cute or right or acceptable when an adult is out of bounds.The whole time I have been waiting for someone from the sidelines to step in and stop this atrocity instead of seeing the other characters smile, support this behavior and go along with it. When there was the opportunity, I chanted in my head: ""Go to Switzerland! Go to Switzerland!"".I wish that Ren had left Japan at that opportunity, be educated in Switzerland and work with the researchers at CERN, get distance and more life experience, explore his sexuality with peers, grow a head taller than Haru, bulk up, then return at 18 and see how things played out. That would have been healthy(er).I wish more viewers would protest and speak up to protect boys from abuse as much as girls.

The first one is a critic point and the other is me as an old and nostalgic watcher.Plot:18+ year old haru(I don\'t remeber the exact age but he was not a minor) go back to Canada to visit his mother. When he got there discover that she adopted a new child(ren)and he has the ""misson"" to transform this savage child into a real person.There is no much to say about it, I enjoyed the time when Yuki was taking care of Ren, the family scenes were pretty cute. The time...passed and haru had to go back to Japan, but Ren didn\'t want him to go so he makes haru promise that they will live togeter in Japan. The history along is very dramatic, basicaly when Yuki was on his way home with his adopted mother and father they suffered an Carr accident(they both died and haru lose his memories of everything he passed with Ren) I\'m not going to say more because is going to be spoiler.Characters:I kinda like some characters like ren(even tho he is annoying some times I got that he is just a kid, lol) he is very cute, very ``responsible`` and the fact that he´s almost every time with a straight face :| just make me more happy when he smile. The two siblings are really cute and fun too, I like de dynamics. Yuki is 5/10 for me, he doesn\'t look like an adult, doesn\'t act like and is very annoying but I just got used to it.Couple:ok we all know that this is not right in any way but let me tell you something, at the time i do not care, I mean the anime is Almost from the time of junjou romantica, what BL wasn\'t romantized, like?? I\'m not saying that this is right I literaly pedophile but if you used to watch BL those times you know that wasn\'t a big deal. Anyways, now that I give my critic point let\'s go to what I used to think(because know is kinda weird) I loved LMAO like that time I thought it was sooooooo CUTE I the way their were hugging, kissing etc,is stil cute but also weird.Spoiler alert!Development:there is some realy good historys below the anime, like about yuki\'s job, ren in school etc. And it was going well until Ren starts to wanna have sex with haru(obviously he said no) and when he felt rejected , he dried to do with another guy(that was literaly haru with brown hair), haru get very mad and gives an ultimate to ren(we all know that ren doesn\'t get his feelings that Good and an ultimate? Like please your an grow ass man)Art:7/10 is cute, nothing mutch to say but for this tipe of anime it matchs(i like more on the manga)Sound track:7/10 is ok tooWhat I like: characters, even the secondary  ones wasn\'t bad and i enjoy seeing some of them(like ren and haru\'s friend)What I didn\'t like? to much dramaDo I recomend?

I won\'t bore you with a plot summary here and this review is spoiler free for the most part, though expect some minor spoilers for the first 6 episodes. Additionally the bulk of this review is from a blog post I uploaded last week in response to the controversy as seen on places like Mal and other chat boards, as-well as a discussion I had over it with a friend. I felt I might as well place it here as a review.Shying away from the controversy for a moment to focus...on what\'s presented, the show is a slice of life anime about overly intimate brothers. For the genre it serves its purpose well and while its by no means a revolution step for the area its simple plot of found family works well. In particular I found episode one covered large amounts of time in a really natural way and struck me as a strong opening gambit. In fact as general note the story\'s passing is great. It\'s got what I call a \'JC Staff Feel\' where-in when you look at the episodes remaining time your oft pleasantly surprised to see another 10 minutes, not in the sense the show is dragging but rather that it\'s got very little filler which is always good to see in a genre known for meandering.It is therefore the sort of show you can casually watch an episode of a day or indeed one a week as when it was originally aired, however I can personnel vouch from experience in writing my essay on it, that it\'s an easy show to binge watch as-well. Furthermore I didn\'t find the 10 episode length to be much to it\'s detriment as it was able to tell a small scale story more then a little competently. As for it\'s ending it is a little open, however I was lenient in that regard as the second season and an Ova had allegedly already been announced when the first series finished, with a second ova being announced at a later date.Characters are somewhat of a weak point in the show. They\'re likeable enough but as is the case with many shorter runtime shows, there\'s a limit to the characterization available to many of the side cast. As such Haru and Ren are decently fleshed out as is Haru\'s mother and the twins, although they were sorely underserved in terms of screen-time and I think more time with them would of been beneficial. All in all however what characterization that\'s there is good and for shows of this nature, static characters like Ren\'s school friend are more then acceptable, though not much in the way of stand out. I also liked the landlord and his crappy daughter in law problems, as well as his dog but again their fairly one note.The art of the show is similar if not a bit better served then the characters. Episode one is the stand-out here with some genuinely beautiful renders and compositions of the Canadian Rocky\'s. Past episode one the more mundane Tokyo setting doesn\'t particularly stand out from any other Tokyo based anime however there\'s a welcome lack of many CGI crowds and the general style, though generic, is well executed upon. For what it wants to be, it\'s an admirably done job.Same for the music which while unassuming is by no means bad. The intro and outros are standard J-pop boyband fair, however it\'s well worth noting the outro has multiple variations as sung by the casts four brothers. It\'s a nice touch and I always apricate when a small length anime like this goes to the extra trouble of having multiple ending songs that people probably don\'t even pay all that much heed to. The general OsT is much of the same with some decent tracks but is overall not that memorable compared with the OP and ED(s).Overall Super Lovers is an above average yaoi slice of life anime that does what it says on the tin. It\'s generally a light hearted romp but takes the time to address it\'s more series issues at length and constantly questions the morality of it\'s main due in relative but never bogged down detail. It\'s a solid 7.5 out of 10 (Mal doesn\'t allow point 5s so I\'ve listed it as an 8). If your not a big fan of contentious genres like yaoi and incest then your best off steering clear of this one (Which is more then a little understandable) but if your more open minded or a fan of said genres, you should have a decent time here.Now what follows next is my aforementioned essay on the subject of volatile subjects in anime and the culture shock they bring with them. To answer one loose thread in that essay, having now finished the last two episodes of the series, I\'m glad to say my views that it handles its topics with tact and that stories of an antagonistic nature are important to society, holds firm. I did send the essay to my friend but her only response was to send me an image of the legal age of Japan/Tokyo, so my advice if you should find yourself in the company of someone with a disposition of disgust towards shows of this nature is to simply keep quiet and mind you own business. Finally I\'d like to preface the essay with another reminder that I by no means ever endorse any form of peodifllia or the relationship of someone above 18 with someone below, I am simply advocating for a greater shared understanding for everyone through the safe space medium of anime. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy;On Culture Shock and Imposing the Standards of the West;Anime Relations: Super Lovers, Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon;As anyone who has spent any length of time in otaku culture knows, Japan and more particularly anime, is weird. From neko girls to gaint robots and every where in between, anime covers a wide array of topics and subject matters that tv networks in the west would traditionally of never gone near and while this is starting to change with the prevalent rise of streaming platforms like Netflix and cartoons like bowjack horseman pushing the limits of more varied story telling, Japan still holds the crown in, lets say awkward to show your parents television. In particular to this are the two least mainstream of anime genres, Yaoi and harems.Think back to your earliest anime, the first time you came across these genres in a big way, if your old school maybe it was something like Love Hina, HQ holder or worse yet Kiss x Sis. As anime enthusiast we all become, over time, desensitized to it, we become used to the newest season\'s imouto, isekai, power fantasy romcom and eventually they have become less weird in the minds of the community and more ""Well that\'s just how anime is"". At this stage there are few among us who even give it a second thought any more, that was till recently. To anyone not living under a rock, you\'ve probably come across the controversy over the new Dragon Maid sequel and the outraged twitter mobs both defending and attacking the merits of the show\'s new Lolita character. I have yet to watch the new series and as such shant pass any judgement on it here but it reminds me greatly of another controversy that was recently brought to my attention from a few years ago, about a show called \'Super Lovers\'.Before we properly delve into the meat of the topic, lets take a step back as westerns and try to understand why harem anime and all that the blanket term encompasses, exists. Maturity - no really. Harems along with isekai and the like are often viewed as the immature little brother of the more serious story telling anime has to offer, light entertainment and guilty pleasures as it were and this is by no means incorrect as for many, especially adults, this is what the genres represent but in context they represent Japan\'s differing societal views. Keeping the history very brief ( It\'s well worth properly reading into in your own time if this sort of content interests you ) for those of us in the west during the 60\'s governments and tv standards boards alike came together to form the standards we now abide, later reinforced throughout the 80\'s (epically by the likes of Mary Whitehouse in Britain among many others) the ideas that young adults and teens must be protected from sexual explict content or even the sin-full horrors of swear words, was born.Think for a moment about your own time as say a 15 year old, how much of the tv supposedly catered towards you actually interested you? How many grew tired of the wallpaper media produced for the youthful and turned their attentions to sports, more recently the internet and if your reading this, most likely anime. We\'re all drawn to anime for a myriad of different reasons but when were starting out, I think it would be fair to say that a large factor is the freedom it allows, not afraid to explore \'grown up\' topics through the guise of a cartoon aesthetic. Remember back to your first experience with something like \'heaven\'s lost property\', \'High-school DXD\' or more tame shows like \'Infinite Stratus\', how the content presented seemed taboo, not quite porn but still not socially acceptable. This feeling is no accident but by design.Something we often forget is the actual target audience of these show, teenagers. Your standard harem has demographic of 15 into the early 20s, with some even being rated as low as PG 13. This is in part due to Japans more lenient rating system but also because of the aforementioned maturity. Those making the anime and the tv networks airing them are fully aware that the wish-fillment fantasies of these shows are those of young adults. There more then a little knowing of the fact that teenagers are naturally and biologically horny and taking a western approach of prudence, simply pushes the audience away. After all a teenage boy will seek out porn if they so desire, no amount of Christian platitudes will prevent this. So in this way the anime culture of Japan accepts these basic facts and gives young men and women what they seek, titlating fanservice with a side of self-insert fantasy. None of this is to be any means insinuate that harem anime have no value, in fact many of my favorite anime are harems because of the passion clearly put in by those worked on them or by the message the writer was trying to get across because all this links to the second reason they exist. Sex Sells.This one may at first seem obvious, as its far less culture shock ridden then my first point. While it may at first be hard to get over the fact that adult implication like sex are marketed publicly towards teenagers in the East, the idea that \'Sex Sells\' is far to common in the West. Indeed a great deal of the genres were discussing find their origin in a cheap buck ( That\'s not to say all isekais are made with zero ambition, many talented animated and directors etc. may give something their all, I mean to say that from a board room funding perspective ) but there is a second reason to include fanservice in a story aside from just the money, though heavily linked.If you lack confidence in your story or you want it to have broader appeal and to reach more people, then you may well include fanservice to get punters in the door. The meme "" I came for the \'plot\' but stayed for the plot ;{ "" springs to mind, where in a show will include often copious amounts of fanservice in order to capture a larger audience. Some take this a step further and incorporate it into its more series story elements, with two famous example from Gainx being Evangelion\'s infamous ""They\'ll be plenty more fanservice next week"" tag line and Gurren Lagan\'s use of fanservice to link into it\'s themes of boyhood and growing up. A simpler and very prevalent example would be the Shoen genre. While many anime from it curb the trend (HunterxHunter, Fma, Assassination Classroom) the majority take advantage of their primary audience being young men and chose to include a vulumtous women in the main cast to add sex appeal to the story and marketing (One Piece, Fairy Tail, etc.).All this is to try and get across that Japan\'s anime is less shrewd then our western television standards, appealing to horny 15 year old\'s and adding small amounts of sex appeal to otherwise family friendly shows is par for the course if it increases viewing figures and blu ray sales. Anime isn\'t afraid to appeal to a kink if it thinks there\'s money to be made and on a less cynical note, is that bad? The advantage of exploring you sexual desires through the guise of wish-fulfillment is far more beneficial then keeping said desires pent up and through Japans anime we can often see what the \'degenerates\'are contemplating. One trope of particular note, that even many \'veteran\' fans of the genre will cringe at, is incest. Once again we need to detach our western bias and look at this from their perspective. Incest is both immoral and biological counter-productive yet Japan continues to a varying degree to grapple with an issue based in what was once a very insular and almost tribe like culture.It\'s a complicated topic, probably best suited for its own discussion, though we will have to touch on it again shortly. Moving past it for a moment, I\'d like to conclude my pre-amble by conveying the point that not all fanservice in anime is intended to be taken as the objectification of women/men. Nor do our western politics nessacerily match up with Japan\'s. Do harem anime objectify women? Many of them yes, especially the cheaper cash grab kind and that\'s because there\'s a market like with anything else but should you presume that all harem anime are out to get women? Never, to do so is to narrow one\'s own mind and miss out on the opportunity to learn and experience great and compassionate stories. The likes of Shuffle, who\'s narrative tries to gently show young men the folly of their self insert fantasies, or shows so well written that we forget their harem anime, like Toradora. Or shows aimed at the same demographic that aren\'t quite harem but have many of the symptoms. The strong women of Shakugan no Shana, the flawed nobility of zero no tsukima\'s Louise, Henriette and Tabita (among others) or the highly competent and professional soldiers of Full Metal Panic like Sgt.Maj. Mou, Lt.Grey and Captain Testa.I don\'t stay with this genre for 2D cleavages that I could find in any doujinshi, I stay because of a love for the heartfelt and genuine storytelling the genre can offer while still managing to be escapist, often light hearted and almost always fun. Moving forward lets try and keep all this in mind, weather you like it or not, anime is not as politically charged with the same agendas as the West and while your standards may lead you to believe a show is promoting something your creed defies, the truth may be far simpler or greatly more nuanced.Part 2 - Super Lovers;I had for some time intended to write a similar piece to this, detailing my thoughts on Lolicon culture and how in the last decade there has been a worrying and deeply unsettling trend in loli\'s ( Female characters of a childlike aesthetic ) becoming more and more childlike, however this week a different, almost antithetical yet contradictorily linked topic came into my attention. As someone who watched anime seasonally for some 2 or 3 years I was aware of Super Lovers ( season 2 at-least ) when it aired, however my lack of interest in Yaoi based anime meant I never went near the property. During a discussion over the perceived treatment of women in anime communities with a friend of mine, the show jokingly came up. My friend described it as Pedophilia and grooming. Seeing as it was on Funimation ( who infamously took down \'Interspecies Reviewers\' recently due to the public backlash ) and the tendency of young people to use harmful and defaming rhetoric, I hazarded that this comment might be a bit harsh. The response i received was one of doubling down, she informed that it most certainly was pedophilia pushing and made light of such topics as grooming.There were some context-less pictures as-well as a comment that the show was disgusting and I should \'take my word on it\'. unfortunately I\'m afraid curiosity got the best of me and I\'m ashamed to say I made something of a point of watching the first 2 episodes and then questioning my friend on what exactly she found so outrageous about the show compared to any other. It was wrong of me and I\'ve since apologies, furthermore I should make it clear that from here on the \'opposition\' I refer to is not her but taken from forum posts and reviews here on Mal, reddit and even Facebook rants that I came across in the pursuit of my research. With that made clear, lets talk about a 4 year old controversy that no one cares about anymore.As mentioned I can be a bit pig headed and I\'ll generally refuse to take anyone\'s word on anime unless they\'ve been shown to be highly reputable and unbias, so I goggled the show and came across the discourse pertaining to it. Blog posts and Facebook rants detailing a rabid attack and defense against the show and after reading a few of these I concluded the best way to source information would be to simply watch the show. At the time of writing I\'m on episode eight which I believe at this point has more then amply shown the intentions of the show and the tonal context it\'s striving for. I\'ve also spent a sad amount of time reading up more on the debates over it and while I\'m by no means an expert on anime, Japan or Yaoi (I\'m a rank amateur if anything), I feel I\'ve seen enough to throw out my two cents and also to simple get it off my own mind.Lets start quickly by putting everyone on an even playing field (There\'ll be no major spoilers but beware of ones for the first six episodes). As this isn\'t strickly a review of the show, I\'ll skip any major further pre-ample over the exact detail of the story and cut straight to dispelling many of the myths and arguments I\'ve seen around the show. Firstly I\'m not interested in the source material which does strike me as a bit more problematic, nor does the Mal or wiki over-rule what\'s presented in the show, as such in episode 2 after a time skip between episodes 1 and 2, Haru (The older of our two protagonists) states that he\'s 22 and by episode 6, six additional months have passed with no mention of a birthday, so it is fair to insinuate that within the anime at-least, Haru is 22 years old. Where the number ""24"" and ""26"" come from I can only presume retains to the manga.As for Ren, his age is a little more vague, we know his birthday is on Christmas and that he\'s in highschool. Episode 8 actually clears it up with Ren stating he was 8 in the flashback scene and the nearly 8 year time-skip would therefore make him 16 after his birthday in episode 3, which the internet seems to agree with me on. An age gap therefore of 6 years, not 9 as many have suggested. Will get into the nitty gritty of said age gap momentarily.Sticking with Ren(The younger of the two leads), there\'s some sort of misconception that he was raised by animals. This is blatantly a cause of not paying enough attention to what\'s portraited on screen. We\'re told Ren was found on the streets in Canada with memory loss and that after taking badly to an orphanage, he ran away, while were told this we are shown him down a back ally with a pack of \'dogs\'. This is not meant to imply that Ren was raised by animals but that he instead has an affinity for them, as people ( possibly his birth parents ) threated him cruely in the past and in actual fact this is meant to draw clear and simply parallels to Haru, who also has an affinity for animals, non of this suggested he was raised in the wild and is another piece of pure speculation, while it could be possible, all evidence suggests not.For our last simply one we have the promotional poster used here on Mal. It depicts a young Haru and Ren in what can definitely be interpreted as an intimate position. This image has lead some to vastly mistake the depictions and ages of the two characters and its either a miss step on Studio Deen\'s PR team or a not so out of character slip up on Mal\'s part, that they make use of a image from episode one. That\'s right, from before the time skip. So yes the characters are very young in the poster because its essentially a shot from an elongated flashback. Its a bad representation of the show but lets for a moment give it another look to see if the complaints levied at it hold any water. I believe there\'s three ways to look at it, as pedophilia, as overly intimated brothers or as fanservice bait.As mentioned I can definitely see someone interpreting it badly and I would happily agree with them that it is awkward and I can also understand the people defending it as brotherly. Its brotherly in the sense of wish fulfilment sense that certain young women (and men) have where they perceive brothers as overly intimate bishojen boys, interpreting it as cute rather then creepy. To most of us in the west it\'s very creepy but in Japan there are many who want this form of escapism, an oddly pure, non-sexual gay relationship between brothers. Its sounds weird and it is but so too is the idea of anime about self insert guys pursed by dozens of adoring girls who never actually engage in sexual activities. This is, in a sense, the yaoi equivalent to the male orientated harem genre. Its culture shock but no less real. As such I think the true answer lies in the middle, the shot does have some brotherly vibes but all in all I\'d suggest its their to bring in as broud an audience as possible, those who like Yaoi, does who want shota, etc. As such, the shot interestingly doesn\'t appear at any point during the flashback episode, almost as though legions of angry internet uses got baited into a piece of marketing with very little relevance to the show, zero context and if anything did the promoting for it by complaining about it.Now we get to a tricky topic. The legal age in Japan, oh boy. The debate around this is the sort that I dread, image the setting, you\'ve watched one or two episodes and lay out a series of points in favor of the show. You feel the story while simplistic, was well set up and  executed, you felt the art, especially that of the Canadian country-side was really well done and that the music for a yaoi show was in keeping with the genre but a little above average. Furthermore you feel that the story is going to handle the age gap of its two leads with tact and besides that, technically the legal age makes the pairing legal and therefore its less pedophilia and more a question of possible abuse.The unfortunate response to this will probably be a rant ignoring all you points except for the one about the legality of it all and you\'ll find your opposition claiming the immorality and arguing that the law has nothing to do with it. Its a painful thing to try and recover from as it probably means your opposition has no interest in an adult conversation. If you want my advice, never get technical, people will think you\'re being patronizing or insensitive and the conversation will go no-where. For the sake of this essay covering all areas of this discussion lets address it. First off the majority of both sides are wildly wrong about this, the defense claiming that 13 is Japan\'s age of consent and the offense arguing that it\'s more a kin to the whims of the Provence you\'re in. There\'s some truth in both and some misconceptions. In actual fact a small amount of reading on the topic will reveal its a little more nuanced.A 13 year old can have sex with another 13 year, as can two 14 year old and in the most part they will not be taken to court and charged with a criminal offence (It can still happen but its simply what the law means when it refers to 13-14 year old\'s), however a 15 year old and up, Can Not Have Sex With a 14 year old and lower without it being an offense. To summarize, 13 is not the age of consent. So its 15 right? well that\'s where the modicum of truth comes into the opposition, depending on where you are it is possible you could be taken to court for having sex with a 15 year old, however broadly speaking 15 is the age of consent, so on a technical level if our 16 year old Ren is in a relationship with our 22 year old Haru, then no clear cut crime is being committed. Does that make it right, not really but what it does do is make something clear, on at the very least, a technical level Super lover\'s premise is not pedophilia instead the question is to weather Haru is abusing Ren and as to weather, consenting or not, Ren is mentally developed enough to be in a relationship with an older man six years his senior. Furthermore if there relationship was actually sexual this would get more complicated as Tokyo in specific has its own laws in place for such activities but considering Haru and Ren aren\'t in a sexual relationship, there\'s no need to delve into any more legislation for the minute.This may all seem pedantic but rhetoric is a sort of pet peeve of mine and to me is one of the most dangerous things to come out of modern discourse. For example anyone who takes an interest in politics will of seen the many \'incidents\' in American and Canadian collage campuses these past few years with students berating public speakers and refusing to engage in conversation. The left will often throw out terms like \'begot, sexiest\' and the most bizarre \'Nazi\', while the right will try to dismiss the left with the likes of \'snowflake\' and \'Social Justice Warrior\', all in all its a downright mess and we should all aim to be more careful in our use of rhetoric, after-all a term like \'Nazi\' is incredibly loaded with negative conations and implications and simplifies an intensely complicated matter.As such when you tell someone causally that a show is \'pedophilia\' or its desensitizing \'grooming\' your painting it in marvelously black and white terms and instantly killing the conversation, furthermore if the person you tell parrots on your words, non the wiser, your creating a falsehood without even realizing it. I should again reiterate this is not aimed at my friend but rather at the discourse around this show that I\'ve witness on the interwebs and that this is one of my main stakes in this argument, that we should be careful not to \'cry wolf\' to often, lest no one listens in the future.To conclude this most fragile of topics, from a legal standpoint and from a definitions standpoint, \'Super Lovers\' is not pedophilia, will get to the actual evidence of the claim pretty soon but just to end this section about the use of rhetoric when discussing the show, beware the words you carelessly throw around, generalization leads to extremism and we should all take the time to try and be a little more nuanced in our day lives.Part 3 - The Big ThreeSo we\'ve discussed the blatant misconception that Haru is above 22 at the series onset and dispelled the myth the Ren is Mogly from the Jungle-Book, as well as explaining why the poster is little more then official fan art and cleared up a bit of the confusion over Japan\'s rather complicated age of consent system. Now lets finally get to the heart of the problem and the three big issues levied at the show; ""It\'s Incest, Grooming and Pedophilia"", will take them one at a time and in that order seeing as each term is a bit more damning and complicated from the last.Incest is a very Japanese fascination, of course its been prevalent to varying degrees all across the world but Japan certainly has quite the fascination with it. Lets go back a moment and remember what we\'ve all ready discussed, the audience for a show like this is young women(and men) who like to fantasize about this particular preference and incest is a part of that. I could just leave it as that, ""fanservice, magical girls, gaint robots and incest are just part and parcel of anime, deal with it"" but lets have a proper look at the case in hand shall we?Lets start by being transparent this show deserves the tag of incest - on a technical level. The problem with throwing \'incest\' as an insult at this show is that it doesn\'t really accomplish anything, I\'ll happily concede that its technically incest as long as the opposition accepts that the show isn\'t pedophilia on a technical level. You can see the problem correct? Will be mentioning this a-lot as we go forward but people have a bad habit of double standards and hierocracy, usually without realizing it. Saying the show isn\'t podophilic in the eyes of some of Japan\'s complicated laws, isn\'t productive and doesn\'t strike at the issue in hand - is it right or moral?Examining the relationship with the two above points of context we now get a new picture, categorically its fairly tame for the incest trope, for example Domestic Girlfriend, the spiciest show from a couple years back has incest between step siblings(who\'s parents are married) but aren\'t blood connected. Conversely in Sword Art Online, Suguha is actually Kirito\'s cousin but not his real sister, meaning that they share more DNA then the example from domestic girlfriend but aren\'t actually siblings or step siblings. Ren doesn\'t fit either of those categories nor are one of his and one of Haru\'s parents the same and thankfully it isn\'t a case of first degree incest with them sharing both parents.No in actuality their only link is that of a piece of paper decreeing them brothers, they don\'t ( To my knowledge sticking solely to the anime ) share any DNA nor are any of their other relations related to one another. This is as already mentioned, still incest but its a far cry from what we are used to, compared to most anime that include incest, its really a rather tame connection. Lets go one step further though, we can infer by the time of the time skip, that Ren and Haru have spent up to 6 months total together maximum, all of which Haru forgot after a traumatic accident. They don\'t seem to of had any other contact in the intervening time and furthermore neither Haru or Ren knew that Ren had been adopted until after the time-skip. So lets review, Ren and only Ren has a living recollection of 6 months spent with Haru whom he is neither related to in law via marriage of relatives or by blood. When you think about it like that, by looking at the actual given facts and context that your presented with, what you realize is that these two are in reality less related then your standard protagonist and childhood friend duo.It sounds hyperbolic but actually think about it, the sort of childhood friend under-dog who we all route for in shows like Niseki, Darling in the Franx, etc., the type who bathed with the protagonist as kids, went to school with them, woke them in the morning, lived close or even next door to them, is clearly more of a sibling then Ren could ever hope to be and interestingly the show acknowledges this with the primary conflict after episode two being Ren trying to fit in with a family he knows he doesn\'t actually belong to. Shuffle is a show that touches on this idea of the morality of the childhood friend as a love interest if your interested in exploring that concept but it should suffice to say that Ren is Haru\'s brother but only on the most technical of levels, I\'d go as far as to say Haru\'s best friend Iku has a better claim then Ren does.But let\'s say for a moment that it was a more straight forward case of incest. Will talk more about this when addressing the allegation of \'Pedophilia\' but since when can you not make a story about an immoral topic like incest? Stories have and I hope will always be, in large part about the continued communication of ideas and an effort to bring us all closer together in our understanding of one another. If a story wants to be about exploring the morality of incest, the reason those within the relationship are there and the consequences of such a union, then of course its valid for it to do so, how else are we meant to understand? There are 3 primary reasons to make an incest story, to appeal in a sexual way to a particular kink ( we call this heintai and it doesn\'t tend to get a full length run, more like an episode or two at most), to explore the topic in a cautionary manner or finally examining the workings of such a relationship and the morality of it or in a more comical, non sexual way. The first one of those, the heintai, is the one with the least moral scruples and is by far the most harmful as it is bluntly promotional. The second two are more interesting, they essentially appeal to the same audience as the first but in a safe, more tame environment, that allows the viewer to enjoy and work through a fantasy while also teaching them about its downsides and preventing them from feeling alienated and resorting to more extreme views on the matter, which brings us back to my initial point about the maturity and understanding anime shows to its more horny teenage audience base. Is it not better for a young women with this strange kink to explore it through a fairly tame slice of life anime, then to turn to the likes of 4chan or straight up heintai?So to finish, the show is barely incest at worst and even if that\'s still to much for you, its not wrong to make stories about uncomfortable topics so that we might all come to understand them better. Everyone is thought about 9/11 and the holocaust in primary school because we want to understand and prevent such event from ever happening again, so why would harsh topics like incest and pedophilia not also be something we want to learn about in order to prevent?Grooming;Alas if only this referred to the hygiene kind. The claim of grooming is the oppositions most baseless, however its more implicit then the charge of incest. Where that one has a foothold, the \'grooming\' claim is one of a gross miss-use of wording and a naivety to the terrible, irredeemable act that is grooming. Lets be clear the act of grooming is usual that of threating a younger person kindly before slowly coaxing them into activities of a sexual nature that which they wouldn\'t of agreed to prior. Its done by extreme manipulation, such as convincing the victim they have no self worth if they loose there supposed \'partner\' or that they \'owe\' their partner for his perceived kindness or by simply convincing them that the gradually more corrupt activities are perfectly normal for couple. Its a horrible thing to be through and those prediters who partake in it deserve the entire book, however to claim Haru\'s minor episodes of teasing amount to grooming is simple an audacious act of trying to fit a text to your own narrative.A few important points to be established here, Haru is a ""womanizers\' and professional host, who alongside a loneliness complex and a troubled upbringing which included the scorn of his fellow kids and having to move around different countries, he has developed to be a very physical person, he has something of a complex retaining to him only being abled to feel self-worth when being physically intimate with others. Think Misato Katsuragi from Neon Genesis Evangellion. Combine this with the shows need to get fanservice included to help bring in more viewers and you certainly have what seems like a-lot of hugging and kissing, Indeed Someone Could Cut all these scenes out of context and try to make the argument based on just that, in extremely miss-leading bad faith, that is till you actually bother to watch the material in full, with its context. Any kiss which Haru instigates is short and immediately met by a hearty beat down from Ren and the scornful disapproving looks of those around them. It is made very clear that Haru\'s overly intimate tendencies are over the line and wrong. The only scenes that are allowed to play out with a dramatic swoon of the score are those where-in Ren makes a move on Haru. Now you might be thinking that its certainly a little better that Ren is the aggressor but its still clearly eligible for grooming right?No. In fact most of the background cast question the intimacy of the relationship, not only making it clear that they think its unnatural but also helping to clarify the nature of the relationship, it isn\'t sexual. It comes to ahead in episode six when Iku straight out asks Haru if he actually fancies Ren once you get past all the comedy hijinks and fanservice teasing and Haru answer with out a second though is that he\'d never go ""for a kid with so little sex appeal"". In fact its shown that Haru has till this point been a straight hetro-sexual. Is all this to say that they wont eventually become intertwined? Of course not, its very clear that eventually the duo will end up as something more, however its also very apparent that it will be one that forms from a natural bond and not from grooming. Its abundantly obvious on multiple occasions that Haru has no grand or even small plan to captivate and manipulate Ren into a sexual relationship that he, as a teenager isn\'t ready for and on the contrary when the relationship does inevitably form, I\'m confident on what\'s been presented that it will be one formed of mutual consent and written in a tactful, polite manner.All in all, Haru was unaware of even having a brother and had no memories of his teenage days with Haru. How he could of planned anything seems questionable to begin with but combine it with his actual statements and those of the people/characters around him and the fact that any actions not instigated by Ren are threated as either yaoi fanservice or as an inappropriate action by the people around him and were left with a clear picture that indicates a complete lack of grooming.Pedophilia;As an issue within anime, this one is the \'biggy\'. As said at the top, there has recently been a-lot of hate for Miss.Kobioshi\'s Dragon Maid and the general twitter movement to \'redesign\' loli\'s. It\'s a fascinating issue as I\'d agree loli\'s are getting more childlike, as what was once a fan term based on a Russian book for characters of a short build (i.e. JC-staff\'s own big 3 of Shana, Louise and Taiga), has now become an almost meta narrative with shows like eromanga sensei trying to one up each other in just how child like and just how incestual we can make Lolitas. It\'s a complicated trend and it has an inverse, in the form of shotacon.The main issue as I see it is three fold. Firstly that the very concept of a story that deals with pedophilia shouldn\'t be allowed, secondly that the height and other features of Ren make him \'child coded\'(to borrow a hip phrase) and thirdly that the age gap puts Ren in a vulnerable, abusable position. So lets slow down, dispense with all the hollow rhetoric and look at the work, at the facts as their presented and at the feelings of the authors intent.First in the interest of reminding everyone that all discourse is about finding a middle ground, and an understanding between one another, allow me to give my bias, my feelings as it were, rather then the empirical view I\'ve so far taken. Yaoi fanservice is not my cup of tea and shota even less so, in fact I find the fan service scenes (rare as they are) pretty awkward for the most part and furthermore Ren is definitely a bit shota coded, not as much as some have suggested but definitely a decent amount.With that said lets get back to facts. For the uninitiated the reverse of harem fanservice (Top heavy girls with unrealistic personality traits and an uncanny attraction to the main male protagonist) is the bishojen boys. Even if you\'ve never got through a whole yaoi anime you\'ll of seen them around, think the cast of \'Free!\' or \'Haiku\' and you\'ll know what I mean and while Shojo manga do use bare chests in the same way you might get a female\'s cleavage plastered on the screen, something more unique to the yaoi genre is its intimacy. Yaoi boys are almost always depicted in comprising positions which might seem a bit familiar even for a causal harem viewer/fan. This is actually based in biology, I did have a large segment here about how on a base level, there is a difference in men and women, where-in they search for different things in the opposite sex and how that leads to women essentially having a higher standard for their fanservice, something which Shojo-Ai seems very aware of, however the segment was a bit bogged down and I think were already being political enough as it is, if you want to learn more there\'s a great lecture series from an actually collage professor on YouTube (1. Introduction to Human Behavioral Biology).It should for our purposes, suffice to say that women in general look for a different, more personal and intimate form of fanservice in their anime, yaoi or otherwise, where as men in the para-phrased words of greater writers then I ""Will go for anything with boobs that\'s alive"". This comes to ahead when combined with shota. Every kiss in Super lovers is automatically subject to the scorn of the public because of Ren diminutive stature and Haru\'s pretty boy tallness. However once again I think we hit a snag on what it is people are upset over. If it\'s simply the imagery of someone tall with someone short then why does the likes of Toradora get a pass? Or Clanned and Kanon? The answer is context, that of the fact that while the likes of Rioji tower a good head or two over their significant other(depending on the scene and the mood the artist is in) we are under the impression that the two are of the same age or at the very least with-in a year of one another age.With all that said I think its therefore safe to assume the issue is not simply \'height\' but rather one of child coding and of an age gap. Lets tackle the former first as it\'s currently quite the hot topic within the anime community.Child coding refers to the idea thought by western art schools that we intentionally design characters in such a way as to incorporate details that might otherwise be unclear. It doesn\'t just apply to children but to anything the character designers sees fit and there\'s certainly some truth to it. My problem with people using child coding as some sort of sword that proves all their claims correct, is that its a flimsy as all heck argument. Firstly while clearly all theory\'s of art have something of this nature involved in their creation, its heavily defined by the induvial and is something we as westerners are trying to impose on to eastern standards and views. Secondly its almost completely interpretation based and I ruddy hate interpretation based science.Allow me to give you a topical example, \'Kana\' from Dragon maid has been proclaimed as child coded. Firstly, yes. You need to be a speical kind of person to of not noticed that Kana is not just coded but is quite clearly - a child, something which the text itself backs up, stating that while she may be some number of years old by human standards, by \'dragon standards\' she\'s very young/a child. So straight off the bat this idea that the show is hiding is gone, because it clearly isn\'t hiding, kana being technically hundreds of years old is just D&D or even Lord of the rings dragon style flavor text and anyone that uses that as an excuse to \'lewd\' her is out of line as the show itself makes it more then abundantly clear that she is in fact a child. There no secret here folks, no conspiracy of pedophiles.To get slightly more back on track as to my issue of interpretation, some have insinuated that Kana\'s white thigh high socks are a form of sexualizing\'s her because of the view they afford of her aforementioned thighs. This is by no means a bad interpretation but its just that after all, I as someone more familiar with Literary theory have always seen her socks as being colour coded the way they are as a representation of her child-like-ness, they\'re white often associated with purity and their long length can easily be seen as a way to show how short she is that they reach so high. Furthermore I would of suggested that there white rather then black (As some have suggested would be better) because it matches her pre-existing pink and silver/grey colour pallet.I hope now you see what I\'m trying to say, Characters coding is a loose subject matter based solely on interpretation that can only be backed up by the original designers (who are often unreliable narrators - see Hideki Anno for an example of an underplaying director/screenwriter) coming out to publicly verify a certain set of claims. However if we can all acknowledge that fact then lets take a proper look at post time-skip Ren. He\'s certainly short, in fact its stated numerous times he\'s short for his age in general, aside from that his features aren\'t particularly exclusive to that of a child, his face is the same as those around him and while he\'s lanky, that\'s a common trait of many yaoi boys ( The alternative is being more buff or solidly build like Haru is).So after all this we\'ve whittled down the issues from miss-read child coding to once again a simply question of height. Now I could refer again to the heroines of Key VNs and their short stature as proof of a double standard but lets be less pretentious, the reason Ren is short is not to pander to pedophiles but to pander to young men and women who have an affinity towards this particular preference. Actually stop and think about all the reverse harems and yaoi anime you\'ve seen, just like the vast majority of standard harem anime have a loli, most yaoi have a shota or in our case, a shorter man. Heck even universally loved Ouhran Highschool Host Club has one and you don\'t hear anyone complaining.Is it right? That\'s questionable, refer back to the top of the essay for my extensive thoughts on this but all in all I don\'t see that big of an issue in the sorts of young men and women who have these fantasies being catered to in a tame environment where they can work through this stuff in a mature manor and then as they get older and move into adult-hood move on with their life\'s. I am quite confident that most of all the studies indicate (and please do check for yourself) that when kids are denied expose they simply seek out more extreme versions of what they\'re looking for in the form of heintai or actually illegal porn, which leads to the continued production of those far more harmful media streams. Its not a perfect solution but I think anime and manga isn\'t a half bad middle ground for taboo thoughts and emotions to meet up on and be explore through.So that\'s height out of the way, before we deal with the age gap, lets take a moment to look at the simplest of these issues, the idea that any and all media discussing such topics should be dis-allowedAs I already said a great length in my previous paragraphs, I think there\'s a-lot to be said for exploring the taboo through the harmless medium of anime but to add to that lets do a quick fire round;""Does even minor pedophile run the chance of creating a pedophile""; It\'s complicated and there\'s conflicted views on it, my view as should already be transparent by now, is that if the medium handles the topic with tact and sensitivity, even if it shows it in an overall positive light as long as it also shows the immorality of it and establishes the irregularity of it, it is free to give us the perspective of the involved parties. So that we might understand better why anyone would do these terrible things or why others might see it as something erotic. To simply try and sensory it gets you nowhere, as suchI by no means condone Pedophilia or a relationship between the sensitive mind of a sixteen year old and a 22 year old but I am not afraid to see why someone else might think that\'s ok and then to discuss how best to deal with it in society rather then simply try to ignore the inevitabilities of the human condition,To end allow me to give you a different example, there are many documentary\'s and even some dramatized examples of WW2 from the perspectives of the Nazis, weather that be from the war cabinet or the soldiers on the ground or the innocent civilians that all sides had. Many of these will include incredibly horrifng topics such as the holocaust and may delve into how some knew it was wrong but had no choice but to go along with it and how others really believe the Aryon people were a \'supior race\' that was more then justified in murdering the innocent Jewish peoples. We wouldn\'t call these movies and documentaries Nazi propaganda, yet Neo Nazi\'s are a thing . We called it,- well a documentary or a record, a way to teach and warn the future about the dangers of radicalism and so on. This is what I mean when I rally that shows that handle volatile opinions, that society at large has condemned, should not only be allowed but actively used as a resource to better understand one another.""Ya but are you sure it doesn\'t \'inspire\' certain deviant people""; My answer to this one may seem a bit crewed but please give it some genuine though. Does playing call of Duty turn you into a murder? A school shooter? Does a Pride march magically convert your children from straight to trans?To anyone sensible reading this you\'ll already know the simple answer is, that it\'s not that simply. While a pride march might help an LGBT person realize that they were gay or lesbian etc. all along and they just hadn\'t known the right words to express themselves, it does not mean they weren\'t LGBT before they witnessed the march, they always were and always would of been if that\'s the way they were born. People become murders due to mental illness, society, their upbringing, circumstances and a whole slew of other reasons and not because they saw it in a video game.The sad thing that can get lost in all this rhetoric and name calling is that a Pedophile who never acts on their ingrained urges is just a human. If they do act on the urges then they deserve the punishment they receive but most of them don\'t choose to be that way, they don\'t choose to develop unlawful feelings and I think that\'s worth remembering, were all just people. So no I don\'t think a light hearted, well meaning, slice of life yaoi anime is going to turn anyone who wasn\'t already, into a Pedophile anymore then teaching kids in school about LGBQ+ rights will fundamental change them, accept to make them more open minded, caring, empathic and understanding people and I think we\'d all do well to remember that.""Are you condoning or \'Ok\'ing\' Pedophilia?""; God no and I think that should be more then apparent by now. I by no means condone of the relationship in Super lovers or of any other relationship between an adult and a minor. What I\'m trying to communicate is two-fold, one that young men and women with this preocular kind of kink are better catered to in the relatively safe and tame environment of anime and that more importantly (but sort of unrelated to this particular anime) that we should not be afraid to discuss and portrait immoral or even evil subject matter so that we might all one day understand it better. I by no means endorse even the most minor of pedophilia but I\'m not some naïve idealist who believes sticking my fingers in my ears and shouting rhetoric from the roof tops will make an issue as troublesome as pedophilia magically go away. I want to understand why any terrible thing occurs, so that one day we can all come together to help prevent it from ever occurring again, as much as possible. We can jail as many pedophiles as we can catch and so we should, just like we would jail a raspiest but that won\'t ever solve the problem and maybe Japan\'s way of allowing young people to explore all manners of socially unacceptable kinks from their own safe spaces, is a far more mature and \'grown-up\' idea then we\'d all like to acknowledge. I\'ll end this segment by just reminding everyone that when we talk about these terrible, horrible topics that put the lives of children, our most precious and vulnerable people at risk, that everything were talking about, is people and all of our continued struggles with the human condition and that goes for those born with the disease of peodifllia but whom never act on it to.The age Gap;So we\'ve gone past the false claims of grooming and the rather hard cutting topic of peodifllia as well as the more silly but highly relevant topic of character coding. What are we now left with? A show staring a short guy and a tall guy in a gay relationship - except for one crucial thing, the age gap.This is maybe the most sensitive issue of them all, where we\'ve already discussed the merits of the other points and how all the evidence would indicate there done to appeal to the Shojo fan base and not to the end of glorifying pedophiles, the age gap does seem to oppose this. However I hope by this point, nearly 8000 words in, think we have demonstrated all the exhibitions we require for our fictional court case as it were.Is the age gap right or something that I endorse? Heck no. Is it in context appropriate? I would suggest yes. The show sets a light tone but clearly takes itself seriously enough when dealing with this topic and its my belief it has every intension of continuing to do so. I haven\'t finished it yet and once I do I\'ll be happy to re-asses my opinion but I\'m quite confident that the main duo will become a couple in a manner that is appropriate to the context with both being fully consensual in the matter. As of episode 6 the have introduces a second relationship dynamic involving Haru\'s x love for an older women and its quite clear to me that this will is being used to further examine and highlight the grey morality of the situation. As I\'ve already made clear it is straight up normal for shows to deal with immoral topics from within a fictional realm and while I completely agree pedophilia and the technically legal relationship of a 16 year old and an 18 year old is wrong, I cannot agree that we should try to pretend these aren\'t both the fantasies of real life people and in a more serious way, the realities for some, which I believe it is only right to explore in a safe, fictional environment where no is hurt.The hate Super Lovers gets in particular does strike me as strange, as mentioned Domestic Girlfriend was huge amongst men and women and it involves a teenager and a women ( who considering her full teaching degree must at-least be around Haru\'s age if not a few years older ) and that brings us on to our last point - Hypocrisies. I will quickly apologies if this section seemed shorter then those previous, I didn\'t intended it like this but I believe I covered most of my points in the peodifllia section and I have no desire to bore anyone by reiterating facts and opinion that which have already been mentioned..On Hypocrisy;Hierocracy or rather \'hypocrite\' is one of those rhetoric words that I hate to see flung around so much but it is apt for this section. I think its worth including this here for its relevance to the more current discussion around the topics we\'ve gone over here today. People have developed a habitual double standard, giving passes to pieces of media which they belief are \'higher-brow\', more intellectual or more innocent then the lower tier trash tv that deserves no such credit.I\'ll keep my examples brief, first if you still belief the idea of peodifllia deserves zero understanding or exploration, than I ask if you also disavow Evangellion who, without any major spoilers, has a 14 year old openly offer herself to a 30ish years old man, going as far to take him linger shopping and even take her shirt off for him. It goes no further but is used to illustrate her mentality. Regardless of its purpose I\'d argue that if you believe \'Super Lovers\' is damaging, then surely Eva showing that a 14 year old actually \'wants\' sex with a far old man must surely be far more damaging, telling a potential pedophile that there \'right\' could be incredibly dangerous. That\'s not to mention that the man in question had an almost abusively physical relationship with his mentally balmy x-lover and yet is considered by almost all to be one of the show best written characters.Some smaller examples. I\'ve already talked at length about how yaoi fanservice in context is factually a more intimate equivalent for standard female fanservice, as well as addressing how shows like Clanned, Kanon and Toradora have majortively shorter leads then is normal height or when compared to their respective significant others/spouses.I\'ve also already gone over how from Sao to Hagani(""We don\'t have any friends"") to Code Geass we see varying degrees of fairly damned incest and about how we have a whole myriad of shows (Pretty much a sub-genre at this stage/point) of shows including a teenager as one half of said coupling, with an adult as the other, that no one seems nearly as offended by ( i.e. \'Domestic Girlfriend\', \'After the rain\' and this very seasons \'Hige wo Soru\' to name a few).Then of course we\'d be remise not to mention the shows that claim a child is actually a 100+years old and then use that as justification to lewd them or have them be dressed in an unfitting fanservices deminer. The likes of \'Seraph of the End\', \'Dance in the Vampire Bund\' and \'Gate\' spring to mind.The point this should get across is its easy to take a high ground and toss rhetoric and hyperbola down on us mere mortals but it takes a much bigger person to stop, learn the facts for yourself and form fair and unbiased opinions. If you truly have an issue with \'Super Lovers\' or most of its contemporize, then maybe its time to take a look at just what else you\'ve watched loved and never realized is guilty in small or big ways of the very same crimes.Conclusion;As I\'ve already alluded to, I\'m not writing this as some petty retort to my friend but rather because this whole topic, from loli to shota has been one of curiosity on my mind for some time now and this simply pushed me to finally write of it, mainly because it was bugging me to continue thinking about it. Is \'Super Lovers\' Peodifllia Pushing? No, while you can argue it\'s an element of the show, it does not promote it as a solely positive thing but instead takes a kind look at elements of it and asks you to form you own opinions and learn from it while also pandering to young women (And men) who wish to explore their peculiar kink. Is it grooming? Clearly not. Is it incest. Kinda, there is certainly an element of incest but it is clearly not a show about incest, making the use of the word, as with the other two, counter-productive and foolish.I\'m by no means a professional and while I try to do the best research and analysis I can, at the end of the day I\'m an amateur at literary study, non-the-less I\'m the sort that likes the think about and research a topic, I\'ve been working on a \'Shuffle!\' essay for months now, though progress is slow considering I only started actually writing it a few weeks ago. Shuffle! itself is well over a decade and a half old now and as far as I can tell no one gives a flying monkeys about it anymore safe me and my recently introduced to it brother, regardless its a show I\'m passionate about and so I\'m possibly writing the world\'s longest and mostly needless analysis of it. All this is to say I\'d rather devote my time and energy to thinking, writing and expressing myself about things I love rather then wasting brain power fighting a losing battle with those of a close minded disposition.And I think in their maybe a simpler point, one that ignores gender politics, or harsh thoughts like peodifllia, because what were actually talking about is a show which averages about a minute or two an episode on yaoi fanservice and spends the rest of its runtime being an above average slice of life show about found family, belonging and loneliness. So \'take it from me\' if you will and try divorce yourself from gender politics, the objectification of women and the grooming of children and just watch your Japanese cartoons for what they are; Wonderful, exciting, beautifully told and varied stories about every topic you can ever image, with so much passion and heart-filled effort put into even the cheapest of productions, not afraid to go where other country\'s would still cringe and more then happy to accept anyone, weather you be a casual weeb, a Shoen head, an idol simp, a basement dwelling degenerate, a Sakuga nerd, or just a plain old fashion closet otaku. Enjoy what you want to because there really is not just something for everyone but plenty of it too. Judge and criticize but do so in good faith, not with rhetoric or you western views, that through the careless use of words like peodifllia and grooming may lead to the devaluing of those but as what we all our underneath the politics and bureaucracy. Anime Fans.I\'d like to end this with a quote from a man more wise, more controversial and more nuanced then I can ever hope to be. A man far more debated and maligned then an anime like \'Super Lovers\' will ever be. its a kind reminder about the merits of judging others without talking into consideration their circumstance and the context surrounding them, as-well as a warning to look in on ourselves before looking outwards at others and its a quote, I think we could all do to heed more often, Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed;""Let no one look down on those honorable, well meaning men whose actions are chronicled in these pages, without searching his own heart, reviewing his own discharge of public duty and applying the lessons of the past to his future conduct."" on what\'s presented, the show is a slice of life anime about overly intimate brothers. For the genre it serves its purpose well and while its by no means a revolution step for the area its simple plot of found family works well. In particular I found episode one covered large amounts of time in a really natural way and struck me as a strong opening gambit. In fact as general note the story\'s passing is great. It\'s got what I call a \'JC Staff Feel\' where-in when you look at the episodes remaining time your oft pleasantly surprised to see another 10 minutes, not in the sense the show is dragging but rather that it\'s got very little filler which is always good to see in a genre known for meandering.It is therefore the sort of show you can casually watch an episode of a day or indeed one a week as when it was originally aired, however I can personnel vouch from experience in writing my essay on it, that it\'s an easy show to binge watch as-well. Furthermore I didn\'t find the 10 episode length to be much to it\'s detriment as it was able to tell a small scale story more then a little competently. As for it\'s ending it is a little open, however I was lenient in that regard as the second season and an Ova had allegedly already been announced when the first series finished, with a second ova being announced at a later date.Characters are somewhat of a weak point in the show. They\'re likeable enough but as is the case with many shorter runtime shows, there\'s a limit to the characterization available to many of the side cast. As such Haru and Ren are decently fleshed out as is Haru\'s mother and the twins, although they were sorely underserved in terms of screen-time and I think more time with them would of been beneficial. All in all however what characterization that\'s there is good and for shows of this nature, static characters like Ren\'s school friend are more then acceptable, though not much in the way of stand out. I also liked the landlord and his crappy daughter in law problems, as well as his dog but again their fairly one note.The art of the show is similar if not a bit better served then the characters. Episode one is the stand-out here with some genuinely beautiful renders and compositions of the Canadian Rocky\'s. Past episode one the more mundane Tokyo setting doesn\'t particularly stand out from any other Tokyo based anime however there\'s a welcome lack of many CGI crowds and the general style, though generic, is well executed upon. For what it wants to be, it\'s an admirably done job.Same for the music which while unassuming is by no means bad. The intro and outros are standard J-pop boyband fair, however it\'s well worth noting the outro has multiple variations as sung by the casts four brothers. It\'s a nice touch and I always apricate when a small length anime like this goes to the extra trouble of having multiple ending songs that people probably don\'t even pay all that much heed to. The general OsT is much of the same with some decent tracks but is overall not that memorable compared with the OP and ED(s).Overall Super Lovers is an above average yaoi slice of life anime that does what it says on the tin. It\'s generally a light hearted romp but takes the time to address it\'s more series issues at length and constantly questions the morality of it\'s main due in relative but never bogged down detail. It\'s a solid 7.5 out of 10 (Mal doesn\'t allow point 5s so I\'ve listed it as an 8). If your not a big fan of contentious genres like yaoi and incest then your best off steering clear of this one (Which is more then a little understandable) but if your more open minded or a fan of said genres, you should have a decent time here.Now what follows next is my aforementioned essay on the subject of volatile subjects in anime and the culture shock they bring with them. To answer one loose thread in that essay, having now finished the last two episodes of the series, I\'m glad to say my views that it handles its topics with tact and that stories of an antagonistic nature are important to society, holds firm. I did send the essay to my friend but her only response was to send me an image of the legal age of Japan/Tokyo, so my advice if you should find yourself in the company of someone with a disposition of disgust towards shows of this nature is to simply keep quiet and mind you own business. Finally I\'d like to preface the essay with another reminder that I by no means ever endorse any form of peodifllia or the relationship of someone above 18 with someone below, I am simply advocating for a greater shared understanding for everyone through the safe space medium of anime. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy;On Culture Shock and Imposing the Standards of the West;Anime Relations: Super Lovers, Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon;As anyone who has spent any length of time in otaku culture knows, Japan and more particularly anime, is weird. From neko girls to gaint robots and every where in between, anime covers a wide array of topics and subject matters that tv networks in the west would traditionally of never gone near and while this is starting to change with the prevalent rise of streaming platforms like Netflix and cartoons like bowjack horseman pushing the limits of more varied story telling, Japan still holds the crown in, lets say awkward to show your parents television. In particular to this are the two least mainstream of anime genres, Yaoi and harems.Think back to your earliest anime, the first time you came across these genres in a big way, if your old school maybe it was something like Love Hina, HQ holder or worse yet Kiss x Sis. As anime enthusiast we all become, over time, desensitized to it, we become used to the newest season\'s imouto, isekai, power fantasy romcom and eventually they have become less weird in the minds of the community and more ""Well that\'s just how anime is"". At this stage there are few among us who even give it a second thought any more, that was till recently. To anyone not living under a rock, you\'ve probably come across the controversy over the new Dragon Maid sequel and the outraged twitter mobs both defending and attacking the merits of the show\'s new Lolita character. I have yet to watch the new series and as such shant pass any judgement on it here but it reminds me greatly of another controversy that was recently brought to my attention from a few years ago, about a show called \'Super Lovers\'.Before we properly delve into the meat of the topic, lets take a step back as westerns and try to understand why harem anime and all that the blanket term encompasses, exists. Maturity - no really. Harems along with isekai and the like are often viewed as the immature little brother of the more serious story telling anime has to offer, light entertainment and guilty pleasures as it were and this is by no means incorrect as for many, especially adults, this is what the genres represent but in context they represent Japan\'s differing societal views. Keeping the history very brief ( It\'s well worth properly reading into in your own time if this sort of content interests you ) for those of us in the west during the 60\'s governments and tv standards boards alike came together to form the standards we now abide, later reinforced throughout the 80\'s (epically by the likes of Mary Whitehouse in Britain among many others) the ideas that young adults and teens must be protected from sexual explict content or even the sin-full horrors of swear words, was born.Think for a moment about your own time as say a 15 year old, how much of the tv supposedly catered towards you actually interested you? How many grew tired of the wallpaper media produced for the youthful and turned their attentions to sports, more recently the internet and if your reading this, most likely anime. We\'re all drawn to anime for a myriad of different reasons but when were starting out, I think it would be fair to say that a large factor is the freedom it allows, not afraid to explore \'grown up\' topics through the guise of a cartoon aesthetic. Remember back to your first experience with something like \'heaven\'s lost property\', \'High-school DXD\' or more tame shows like \'Infinite Stratus\', how the content presented seemed taboo, not quite porn but still not socially acceptable. This feeling is no accident but by design.Something we often forget is the actual target audience of these show, teenagers. Your standard harem has demographic of 15 into the early 20s, with some even being rated as low as PG 13. This is in part due to Japans more lenient rating system but also because of the aforementioned maturity. Those making the anime and the tv networks airing them are fully aware that the wish-fillment fantasies of these shows are those of young adults. There more then a little knowing of the fact that teenagers are naturally and biologically horny and taking a western approach of prudence, simply pushes the audience away. After all a teenage boy will seek out porn if they so desire, no amount of Christian platitudes will prevent this. So in this way the anime culture of Japan accepts these basic facts and gives young men and women what they seek, titlating fanservice with a side of self-insert fantasy. None of this is to be any means insinuate that harem anime have no value, in fact many of my favorite anime are harems because of the passion clearly put in by those worked on them or by the message the writer was trying to get across because all this links to the second reason they exist. Sex Sells.This one may at first seem obvious, as its far less culture shock ridden then my first point. While it may at first be hard to get over the fact that adult implication like sex are marketed publicly towards teenagers in the East, the idea that \'Sex Sells\' is far to common in the West. Indeed a great deal of the genres were discussing find their origin in a cheap buck ( That\'s not to say all isekais are made with zero ambition, many talented animated and directors etc. may give something their all, I mean to say that from a board room funding perspective ) but there is a second reason to include fanservice in a story aside from just the money, though heavily linked.If you lack confidence in your story or you want it to have broader appeal and to reach more people, then you may well include fanservice to get punters in the door. The meme "" I came for the \'plot\' but stayed for the plot ;{ "" springs to mind, where in a show will include often copious amounts of fanservice in order to capture a larger audience. Some take this a step further and incorporate it into its more series story elements, with two famous example from Gainx being Evangelion\'s infamous ""They\'ll be plenty more fanservice next week"" tag line and Gurren Lagan\'s use of fanservice to link into it\'s themes of boyhood and growing up. A simpler and very prevalent example would be the Shoen genre. While many anime from it curb the trend (HunterxHunter, Fma, Assassination Classroom) the majority take advantage of their primary audience being young men and chose to include a vulumtous women in the main cast to add sex appeal to the story and marketing (One Piece, Fairy Tail, etc.).All this is to try and get across that Japan\'s anime is less shrewd then our western television standards, appealing to horny 15 year old\'s and adding small amounts of sex appeal to otherwise family friendly shows is par for the course if it increases viewing figures and blu ray sales. Anime isn\'t afraid to appeal to a kink if it thinks there\'s money to be made and on a less cynical note, is that bad? The advantage of exploring you sexual desires through the guise of wish-fulfillment is far more beneficial then keeping said desires pent up and through Japans anime we can often see what the \'degenerates\'are contemplating. One trope of particular note, that even many \'veteran\' fans of the genre will cringe at, is incest. Once again we need to detach our western bias and look at this from their perspective. Incest is both immoral and biological counter-productive yet Japan continues to a varying degree to grapple with an issue based in what was once a very insular and almost tribe like culture.It\'s a complicated topic, probably best suited for its own discussion, though we will have to touch on it again shortly. Moving past it for a moment, I\'d like to conclude my pre-amble by conveying the point that not all fanservice in anime is intended to be taken as the objectification of women/men. Nor do our western politics nessacerily match up with Japan\'s. Do harem anime objectify women? Many of them yes, especially the cheaper cash grab kind and that\'s because there\'s a market like with anything else but should you presume that all harem anime are out to get women? Never, to do so is to narrow one\'s own mind and miss out on the opportunity to learn and experience great and compassionate stories. The likes of Shuffle, who\'s narrative tries to gently show young men the folly of their self insert fantasies, or shows so well written that we forget their harem anime, like Toradora. Or shows aimed at the same demographic that aren\'t quite harem but have many of the symptoms. The strong women of Shakugan no Shana, the flawed nobility of zero no tsukima\'s Louise, Henriette and Tabita (among others) or the highly competent and professional soldiers of Full Metal Panic like Sgt.Maj. Mou, Lt.Grey and Captain Testa.I don\'t stay with this genre for 2D cleavages that I could find in any doujinshi, I stay because of a love for the heartfelt and genuine storytelling the genre can offer while still managing to be escapist, often light hearted and almost always fun. Moving forward lets try and keep all this in mind, weather you like it or not, anime is not as politically charged with the same agendas as the West and while your standards may lead you to believe a show is promoting something your creed defies, the truth may be far simpler or greatly more nuanced.Part 2 - Super Lovers;I had for some time intended to write a similar piece to this, detailing my thoughts on Lolicon culture and how in the last decade there has been a worrying and deeply unsettling trend in loli\'s ( Female characters of a childlike aesthetic ) becoming more and more childlike, however this week a different, almost antithetical yet contradictorily linked topic came into my attention. As someone who watched anime seasonally for some 2 or 3 years I was aware of Super Lovers ( season 2 at-least ) when it aired, however my lack of interest in Yaoi based anime meant I never went near the property. During a discussion over the perceived treatment of women in anime communities with a friend of mine, the show jokingly came up. My friend described it as Pedophilia and grooming. Seeing as it was on Funimation ( who infamously took down \'Interspecies Reviewers\' recently due to the public backlash ) and the tendency of young people to use harmful and defaming rhetoric, I hazarded that this comment might be a bit harsh. The response i received was one of doubling down, she informed that it most certainly was pedophilia pushing and made light of such topics as grooming.There were some context-less pictures as-well as a comment that the show was disgusting and I should \'take my word on it\'. unfortunately I\'m afraid curiosity got the best of me and I\'m ashamed to say I made something of a point of watching the first 2 episodes and then questioning my friend on what exactly she found so outrageous about the show compared to any other. It was wrong of me and I\'ve since apologies, furthermore I should make it clear that from here on the \'opposition\' I refer to is not her but taken from forum posts and reviews here on Mal, reddit and even Facebook rants that I came across in the pursuit of my research. With that made clear, lets talk about a 4 year old controversy that no one cares about anymore.As mentioned I can be a bit pig headed and I\'ll generally refuse to take anyone\'s word on anime unless they\'ve been shown to be highly reputable and unbias, so I goggled the show and came across the discourse pertaining to it. Blog posts and Facebook rants detailing a rabid attack and defense against the show and after reading a few of these I concluded the best way to source information would be to simply watch the show. At the time of writing I\'m on episode eight which I believe at this point has more then amply shown the intentions of the show and the tonal context it\'s striving for. I\'ve also spent a sad amount of time reading up more on the debates over it and while I\'m by no means an expert on anime, Japan or Yaoi (I\'m a rank amateur if anything), I feel I\'ve seen enough to throw out my two cents and also to simple get it off my own mind.Lets start quickly by putting everyone on an even playing field (There\'ll be no major spoilers but beware of ones for the first six episodes). As this isn\'t strickly a review of the show, I\'ll skip any major further pre-ample over the exact detail of the story and cut straight to dispelling many of the myths and arguments I\'ve seen around the show. Firstly I\'m not interested in the source material which does strike me as a bit more problematic, nor does the Mal or wiki over-rule what\'s presented in the show, as such in episode 2 after a time skip between episodes 1 and 2, Haru (The older of our two protagonists) states that he\'s 22 and by episode 6, six additional months have passed with no mention of a birthday, so it is fair to insinuate that within the anime at-least, Haru is 22 years old. Where the number ""24"" and ""26"" come from I can only presume retains to the manga.As for Ren, his age is a little more vague, we know his birthday is on Christmas and that he\'s in highschool. Episode 8 actually clears it up with Ren stating he was 8 in the flashback scene and the nearly 8 year time-skip would therefore make him 16 after his birthday in episode 3, which the internet seems to agree with me on. An age gap therefore of 6 years, not 9 as many have suggested. Will get into the nitty gritty of said age gap momentarily.Sticking with Ren(The younger of the two leads), there\'s some sort of misconception that he was raised by animals. This is blatantly a cause of not paying enough attention to what\'s portraited on screen. We\'re told Ren was found on the streets in Canada with memory loss and that after taking badly to an orphanage, he ran away, while were told this we are shown him down a back ally with a pack of \'dogs\'. This is not meant to imply that Ren was raised by animals but that he instead has an affinity for them, as people ( possibly his birth parents ) threated him cruely in the past and in actual fact this is meant to draw clear and simply parallels to Haru, who also has an affinity for animals, non of this suggested he was raised in the wild and is another piece of pure speculation, while it could be possible, all evidence suggests not.For our last simply one we have the promotional poster used here on Mal. It depicts a young Haru and Ren in what can definitely be interpreted as an intimate position. This image has lead some to vastly mistake the depictions and ages of the two characters and its either a miss step on Studio Deen\'s PR team or a not so out of character slip up on Mal\'s part, that they make use of a image from episode one. That\'s right, from before the time skip. So yes the characters are very young in the poster because its essentially a shot from an elongated flashback. Its a bad representation of the show but lets for a moment give it another look to see if the complaints levied at it hold any water. I believe there\'s three ways to look at it, as pedophilia, as overly intimated brothers or as fanservice bait.As mentioned I can definitely see someone interpreting it badly and I would happily agree with them that it is awkward and I can also understand the people defending it as brotherly. Its brotherly in the sense of wish fulfilment sense that certain young women (and men) have where they perceive brothers as overly intimate bishojen boys, interpreting it as cute rather then creepy. To most of us in the west it\'s very creepy but in Japan there are many who want this form of escapism, an oddly pure, non-sexual gay relationship between brothers. Its sounds weird and it is but so too is the idea of anime about self insert guys pursed by dozens of adoring girls who never actually engage in sexual activities. This is, in a sense, the yaoi equivalent to the male orientated harem genre. Its culture shock but no less real. As such I think the true answer lies in the middle, the shot does have some brotherly vibes but all in all I\'d suggest its their to bring in as broud an audience as possible, those who like Yaoi, does who want shota, etc. As such, the shot interestingly doesn\'t appear at any point during the flashback episode, almost as though legions of angry internet uses got baited into a piece of marketing with very little relevance to the show, zero context and if anything did the promoting for it by complaining about it.Now we get to a tricky topic. The legal age in Japan, oh boy. The debate around this is the sort that I dread, image the setting, you\'ve watched one or two episodes and lay out a series of points in favor of the show. You feel the story while simplistic, was well set up and  executed, you felt the art, especially that of the Canadian country-side was really well done and that the music for a yaoi show was in keeping with the genre but a little above average. Furthermore you feel that the story is going to handle the age gap of its two leads with tact and besides that, technically the legal age makes the pairing legal and therefore its less pedophilia and more a question of possible abuse.The unfortunate response to this will probably be a rant ignoring all you points except for the one about the legality of it all and you\'ll find your opposition claiming the immorality and arguing that the law has nothing to do with it. Its a painful thing to try and recover from as it probably means your opposition has no interest in an adult conversation. If you want my advice, never get technical, people will think you\'re being patronizing or insensitive and the conversation will go no-where. For the sake of this essay covering all areas of this discussion lets address it. First off the majority of both sides are wildly wrong about this, the defense claiming that 13 is Japan\'s age of consent and the offense arguing that it\'s more a kin to the whims of the Provence you\'re in. There\'s some truth in both and some misconceptions. In actual fact a small amount of reading on the topic will reveal its a little more nuanced.A 13 year old can have sex with another 13 year, as can two 14 year old and in the most part they will not be taken to court and charged with a criminal offence (It can still happen but its simply what the law means when it refers to 13-14 year old\'s), however a 15 year old and up, Can Not Have Sex With a 14 year old and lower without it being an offense. To summarize, 13 is not the age of consent. So its 15 right? well that\'s where the modicum of truth comes into the opposition, depending on where you are it is possible you could be taken to court for having sex with a 15 year old, however broadly speaking 15 is the age of consent, so on a technical level if our 16 year old Ren is in a relationship with our 22 year old Haru, then no clear cut crime is being committed. Does that make it right, not really but what it does do is make something clear, on at the very least, a technical level Super lover\'s premise is not pedophilia instead the question is to weather Haru is abusing Ren and as to weather, consenting or not, Ren is mentally developed enough to be in a relationship with an older man six years his senior. Furthermore if there relationship was actually sexual this would get more complicated as Tokyo in specific has its own laws in place for such activities but considering Haru and Ren aren\'t in a sexual relationship, there\'s no need to delve into any more legislation for the minute.This may all seem pedantic but rhetoric is a sort of pet peeve of mine and to me is one of the most dangerous things to come out of modern discourse. For example anyone who takes an interest in politics will of seen the many \'incidents\' in American and Canadian collage campuses these past few years with students berating public speakers and refusing to engage in conversation. The left will often throw out terms like \'begot, sexiest\' and the most bizarre \'Nazi\', while the right will try to dismiss the left with the likes of \'snowflake\' and \'Social Justice Warrior\', all in all its a downright mess and we should all aim to be more careful in our use of rhetoric, after-all a term like \'Nazi\' is incredibly loaded with negative conations and implications and simplifies an intensely complicated matter.As such when you tell someone causally that a show is \'pedophilia\' or its desensitizing \'grooming\' your painting it in marvelously black and white terms and instantly killing the conversation, furthermore if the person you tell parrots on your words, non the wiser, your creating a falsehood without even realizing it. I should again reiterate this is not aimed at my friend but rather at the discourse around this show that I\'ve witness on the interwebs and that this is one of my main stakes in this argument, that we should be careful not to \'cry wolf\' to often, lest no one listens in the future.To conclude this most fragile of topics, from a legal standpoint and from a definitions standpoint, \'Super Lovers\' is not pedophilia, will get to the actual evidence of the claim pretty soon but just to end this section about the use of rhetoric when discussing the show, beware the words you carelessly throw around, generalization leads to extremism and we should all take the time to try and be a little more nuanced in our day lives.Part 3 - The Big ThreeSo we\'ve discussed the blatant misconception that Haru is above 22 at the series onset and dispelled the myth the Ren is Mogly from the Jungle-Book, as well as explaining why the poster is little more then official fan art and cleared up a bit of the confusion over Japan\'s rather complicated age of consent system. Now lets finally get to the heart of the problem and the three big issues levied at the show; ""It\'s Incest, Grooming and Pedophilia"", will take them one at a time and in that order seeing as each term is a bit more damning and complicated from the last.Incest is a very Japanese fascination, of course its been prevalent to varying degrees all across the world but Japan certainly has quite the fascination with it. Lets go back a moment and remember what we\'ve all ready discussed, the audience for a show like this is young women(and men) who like to fantasize about this particular preference and incest is a part of that. I could just leave it as that, ""fanservice, magical girls, gaint robots and incest are just part and parcel of anime, deal with it"" but lets have a proper look at the case in hand shall we?Lets start by being transparent this show deserves the tag of incest - on a technical level. The problem with throwing \'incest\' as an insult at this show is that it doesn\'t really accomplish anything, I\'ll happily concede that its technically incest as long as the opposition accepts that the show isn\'t pedophilia on a technical level. You can see the problem correct? Will be mentioning this a-lot as we go forward but people have a bad habit of double standards and hierocracy, usually without realizing it. Saying the show isn\'t podophilic in the eyes of some of Japan\'s complicated laws, isn\'t productive and doesn\'t strike at the issue in hand - is it right or moral?Examining the relationship with the two above points of context we now get a new picture, categorically its fairly tame for the incest trope, for example Domestic Girlfriend, the spiciest show from a couple years back has incest between step siblings(who\'s parents are married) but aren\'t blood connected. Conversely in Sword Art Online, Suguha is actually Kirito\'s cousin but not his real sister, meaning that they share more DNA then the example from domestic girlfriend but aren\'t actually siblings or step siblings. Ren doesn\'t fit either of those categories nor are one of his and one of Haru\'s parents the same and thankfully it isn\'t a case of first degree incest with them sharing both parents.No in actuality their only link is that of a piece of paper decreeing them brothers, they don\'t ( To my knowledge sticking solely to the anime ) share any DNA nor are any of their other relations related to one another. This is as already mentioned, still incest but its a far cry from what we are used to, compared to most anime that include incest, its really a rather tame connection. Lets go one step further though, we can infer by the time of the time skip, that Ren and Haru have spent up to 6 months total together maximum, all of which Haru forgot after a traumatic accident. They don\'t seem to of had any other contact in the intervening time and furthermore neither Haru or Ren knew that Ren had been adopted until after the time-skip. So lets review, Ren and only Ren has a living recollection of 6 months spent with Haru whom he is neither related to in law via marriage of relatives or by blood. When you think about it like that, by looking at the actual given facts and context that your presented with, what you realize is that these two are in reality less related then your standard protagonist and childhood friend duo.It sounds hyperbolic but actually think about it, the sort of childhood friend under-dog who we all route for in shows like Niseki, Darling in the Franx, etc., the type who bathed with the protagonist as kids, went to school with them, woke them in the morning, lived close or even next door to them, is clearly more of a sibling then Ren could ever hope to be and interestingly the show acknowledges this with the primary conflict after episode two being Ren trying to fit in with a family he knows he doesn\'t actually belong to. Shuffle is a show that touches on this idea of the morality of the childhood friend as a love interest if your interested in exploring that concept but it should suffice to say that Ren is Haru\'s brother but only on the most technical of levels, I\'d go as far as to say Haru\'s best friend Iku has a better claim then Ren does.But let\'s say for a moment that it was a more straight forward case of incest. Will talk more about this when addressing the allegation of \'Pedophilia\' but since when can you not make a story about an immoral topic like incest? Stories have and I hope will always be, in large part about the continued communication of ideas and an effort to bring us all closer together in our understanding of one another. If a story wants to be about exploring the morality of incest, the reason those within the relationship are there and the consequences of such a union, then of course its valid for it to do so, how else are we meant to understand? There are 3 primary reasons to make an incest story, to appeal in a sexual way to a particular kink ( we call this heintai and it doesn\'t tend to get a full length run, more like an episode or two at most), to explore the topic in a cautionary manner or finally examining the workings of such a relationship and the morality of it or in a more comical, non sexual way. The first one of those, the heintai, is the one with the least moral scruples and is by far the most harmful as it is bluntly promotional. The second two are more interesting, they essentially appeal to the same audience as the first but in a safe, more tame environment, that allows the viewer to enjoy and work through a fantasy while also teaching them about its downsides and preventing them from feeling alienated and resorting to more extreme views on the matter, which brings us back to my initial point about the maturity and understanding anime shows to its more horny teenage audience base. Is it not better for a young women with this strange kink to explore it through a fairly tame slice of life anime, then to turn to the likes of 4chan or straight up heintai?So to finish, the show is barely incest at worst and even if that\'s still to much for you, its not wrong to make stories about uncomfortable topics so that we might all come to understand them better. Everyone is thought about 9/11 and the holocaust in primary school because we want to understand and prevent such event from ever happening again, so why would harsh topics like incest and pedophilia not also be something we want to learn about in order to prevent?Grooming;Alas if only this referred to the hygiene kind. The claim of grooming is the oppositions most baseless, however its more implicit then the charge of incest. Where that one has a foothold, the \'grooming\' claim is one of a gross miss-use of wording and a naivety to the terrible, irredeemable act that is grooming. Lets be clear the act of grooming is usual that of threating a younger person kindly before slowly coaxing them into activities of a sexual nature that which they wouldn\'t of agreed to prior. Its done by extreme manipulation, such as convincing the victim they have no self worth if they loose there supposed \'partner\' or that they \'owe\' their partner for his perceived kindness or by simply convincing them that the gradually more corrupt activities are perfectly normal for couple. Its a horrible thing to be through and those prediters who partake in it deserve the entire book, however to claim Haru\'s minor episodes of teasing amount to grooming is simple an audacious act of trying to fit a text to your own narrative.A few important points to be established here, Haru is a ""womanizers\' and professional host, who alongside a loneliness complex and a troubled upbringing which included the scorn of his fellow kids and having to move around different countries, he has developed to be a very physical person, he has something of a complex retaining to him only being abled to feel self-worth when being physically intimate with others. Think Misato Katsuragi from Neon Genesis Evangellion. Combine this with the shows need to get fanservice included to help bring in more viewers and you certainly have what seems like a-lot of hugging and kissing, Indeed Someone Could Cut all these scenes out of context and try to make the argument based on just that, in extremely miss-leading bad faith, that is till you actually bother to watch the material in full, with its context. Any kiss which Haru instigates is short and immediately met by a hearty beat down from Ren and the scornful disapproving looks of those around them. It is made very clear that Haru\'s overly intimate tendencies are over the line and wrong. The only scenes that are allowed to play out with a dramatic swoon of the score are those where-in Ren makes a move on Haru. Now you might be thinking that its certainly a little better that Ren is the aggressor but its still clearly eligible for grooming right?No. In fact most of the background cast question the intimacy of the relationship, not only making it clear that they think its unnatural but also helping to clarify the nature of the relationship, it isn\'t sexual. It comes to ahead in episode six when Iku straight out asks Haru if he actually fancies Ren once you get past all the comedy hijinks and fanservice teasing and Haru answer with out a second though is that he\'d never go ""for a kid with so little sex appeal"". In fact its shown that Haru has till this point been a straight hetro-sexual. Is all this to say that they wont eventually become intertwined? Of course not, its very clear that eventually the duo will end up as something more, however its also very apparent that it will be one that forms from a natural bond and not from grooming. Its abundantly obvious on multiple occasions that Haru has no grand or even small plan to captivate and manipulate Ren into a sexual relationship that he, as a teenager isn\'t ready for and on the contrary when the relationship does inevitably form, I\'m confident on what\'s been presented that it will be one formed of mutual consent and written in a tactful, polite manner.All in all, Haru was unaware of even having a brother and had no memories of his teenage days with Haru. How he could of planned anything seems questionable to begin with but combine it with his actual statements and those of the people/characters around him and the fact that any actions not instigated by Ren are threated as either yaoi fanservice or as an inappropriate action by the people around him and were left with a clear picture that indicates a complete lack of grooming.Pedophilia;As an issue within anime, this one is the \'biggy\'. As said at the top, there has recently been a-lot of hate for Miss.Kobioshi\'s Dragon Maid and the general twitter movement to \'redesign\' loli\'s. It\'s a fascinating issue as I\'d agree loli\'s are getting more childlike, as what was once a fan term based on a Russian book for characters of a short build (i.e. JC-staff\'s own big 3 of Shana, Louise and Taiga), has now become an almost meta narrative with shows like eromanga sensei trying to one up each other in just how child like and just how incestual we can make Lolitas. It\'s a complicated trend and it has an inverse, in the form of shotacon.The main issue as I see it is three fold. Firstly that the very concept of a story that deals with pedophilia shouldn\'t be allowed, secondly that the height and other features of Ren make him \'child coded\'(to borrow a hip phrase) and thirdly that the age gap puts Ren in a vulnerable, abusable position. So lets slow down, dispense with all the hollow rhetoric and look at the work, at the facts as their presented and at the feelings of the authors intent.First in the interest of reminding everyone that all discourse is about finding a middle ground, and an understanding between one another, allow me to give my bias, my feelings as it were, rather then the empirical view I\'ve so far taken. Yaoi fanservice is not my cup of tea and shota even less so, in fact I find the fan service scenes (rare as they are) pretty awkward for the most part and furthermore Ren is definitely a bit shota coded, not as much as some have suggested but definitely a decent amount.With that said lets get back to facts. For the uninitiated the reverse of harem fanservice (Top heavy girls with unrealistic personality traits and an uncanny attraction to the main male protagonist) is the bishojen boys. Even if you\'ve never got through a whole yaoi anime you\'ll of seen them around, think the cast of \'Free!\' or \'Haiku\' and you\'ll know what I mean and while Shojo manga do use bare chests in the same way you might get a female\'s cleavage plastered on the screen, something more unique to the yaoi genre is its intimacy. Yaoi boys are almost always depicted in comprising positions which might seem a bit familiar even for a causal harem viewer/fan. This is actually based in biology, I did have a large segment here about how on a base level, there is a difference in men and women, where-in they search for different things in the opposite sex and how that leads to women essentially having a higher standard for their fanservice, something which Shojo-Ai seems very aware of, however the segment was a bit bogged down and I think were already being political enough as it is, if you want to learn more there\'s a great lecture series from an actually collage professor on YouTube (1. Introduction to Human Behavioral Biology).It should for our purposes, suffice to say that women in general look for a different, more personal and intimate form of fanservice in their anime, yaoi or otherwise, where as men in the para-phrased words of greater writers then I ""Will go for anything with boobs that\'s alive"". This comes to ahead when combined with shota. Every kiss in Super lovers is automatically subject to the scorn of the public because of Ren diminutive stature and Haru\'s pretty boy tallness. However once again I think we hit a snag on what it is people are upset over. If it\'s simply the imagery of someone tall with someone short then why does the likes of Toradora get a pass? Or Clanned and Kanon? The answer is context, that of the fact that while the likes of Rioji tower a good head or two over their significant other(depending on the scene and the mood the artist is in) we are under the impression that the two are of the same age or at the very least with-in a year of one another age.With all that said I think its therefore safe to assume the issue is not simply \'height\' but rather one of child coding and of an age gap. Lets tackle the former first as it\'s currently quite the hot topic within the anime community.Child coding refers to the idea thought by western art schools that we intentionally design characters in such a way as to incorporate details that might otherwise be unclear. It doesn\'t just apply to children but to anything the character designers sees fit and there\'s certainly some truth to it. My problem with people using child coding as some sort of sword that proves all their claims correct, is that its a flimsy as all heck argument. Firstly while clearly all theory\'s of art have something of this nature involved in their creation, its heavily defined by the induvial and is something we as westerners are trying to impose on to eastern standards and views. Secondly its almost completely interpretation based and I ruddy hate interpretation based science.Allow me to give you a topical example, \'Kana\' from Dragon maid has been proclaimed as child coded. Firstly, yes. You need to be a speical kind of person to of not noticed that Kana is not just coded but is quite clearly - a child, something which the text itself backs up, stating that while she may be some number of years old by human standards, by \'dragon standards\' she\'s very young/a child. So straight off the bat this idea that the show is hiding is gone, because it clearly isn\'t hiding, kana being technically hundreds of years old is just D&D or even Lord of the rings dragon style flavor text and anyone that uses that as an excuse to \'lewd\' her is out of line as the show itself makes it more then abundantly clear that she is in fact a child. There no secret here folks, no conspiracy of pedophiles.To get slightly more back on track as to my issue of interpretation, some have insinuated that Kana\'s white thigh high socks are a form of sexualizing\'s her because of the view they afford of her aforementioned thighs. This is by no means a bad interpretation but its just that after all, I as someone more familiar with Literary theory have always seen her socks as being colour coded the way they are as a representation of her child-like-ness, they\'re white often associated with purity and their long length can easily be seen as a way to show how short she is that they reach so high. Furthermore I would of suggested that there white rather then black (As some have suggested would be better) because it matches her pre-existing pink and silver/grey colour pallet.I hope now you see what I\'m trying to say, Characters coding is a loose subject matter based solely on interpretation that can only be backed up by the original designers (who are often unreliable narrators - see Hideki Anno for an example of an underplaying director/screenwriter) coming out to publicly verify a certain set of claims. However if we can all acknowledge that fact then lets take a proper look at post time-skip Ren. He\'s certainly short, in fact its stated numerous times he\'s short for his age in general, aside from that his features aren\'t particularly exclusive to that of a child, his face is the same as those around him and while he\'s lanky, that\'s a common trait of many yaoi boys ( The alternative is being more buff or solidly build like Haru is).So after all this we\'ve whittled down the issues from miss-read child coding to once again a simply question of height. Now I could refer again to the heroines of Key VNs and their short stature as proof of a double standard but lets be less pretentious, the reason Ren is short is not to pander to pedophiles but to pander to young men and women who have an affinity towards this particular preference. Actually stop and think about all the reverse harems and yaoi anime you\'ve seen, just like the vast majority of standard harem anime have a loli, most yaoi have a shota or in our case, a shorter man. Heck even universally loved Ouhran Highschool Host Club has one and you don\'t hear anyone complaining.Is it right? That\'s questionable, refer back to the top of the essay for my extensive thoughts on this but all in all I don\'t see that big of an issue in the sorts of young men and women who have these fantasies being catered to in a tame environment where they can work through this stuff in a mature manor and then as they get older and move into adult-hood move on with their life\'s. I am quite confident that most of all the studies indicate (and please do check for yourself) that when kids are denied expose they simply seek out more extreme versions of what they\'re looking for in the form of heintai or actually illegal porn, which leads to the continued production of those far more harmful media streams. Its not a perfect solution but I think anime and manga isn\'t a half bad middle ground for taboo thoughts and emotions to meet up on and be explore through.So that\'s height out of the way, before we deal with the age gap, lets take a moment to look at the simplest of these issues, the idea that any and all media discussing such topics should be dis-allowedAs I already said a great length in my previous paragraphs, I think there\'s a-lot to be said for exploring the taboo through the harmless medium of anime but to add to that lets do a quick fire round;""Does even minor pedophile run the chance of creating a pedophile""; It\'s complicated and there\'s conflicted views on it, my view as should already be transparent by now, is that if the medium handles the topic with tact and sensitivity, even if it shows it in an overall positive light as long as it also shows the immorality of it and establishes the irregularity of it, it is free to give us the perspective of the involved parties. So that we might understand better why anyone would do these terrible things or why others might see it as something erotic. To simply try and sensory it gets you nowhere, as suchI by no means condone Pedophilia or a relationship between the sensitive mind of a sixteen year old and a 22 year old but I am not afraid to see why someone else might think that\'s ok and then to discuss how best to deal with it in society rather then simply try to ignore the inevitabilities of the human condition,To end allow me to give you a different example, there are many documentary\'s and even some dramatized examples of WW2 from the perspectives of the Nazis, weather that be from the war cabinet or the soldiers on the ground or the innocent civilians that all sides had. Many of these will include incredibly horrifng topics such as the holocaust and may delve into how some knew it was wrong but had no choice but to go along with it and how others really believe the Aryon people were a \'supior race\' that was more then justified in murdering the innocent Jewish peoples. We wouldn\'t call these movies and documentaries Nazi propaganda, yet Neo Nazi\'s are a thing . We called it,- well a documentary or a record, a way to teach and warn the future about the dangers of radicalism and so on. This is what I mean when I rally that shows that handle volatile opinions, that society at large has condemned, should not only be allowed but actively used as a resource to better understand one another.""Ya but are you sure it doesn\'t \'inspire\' certain deviant people""; My answer to this one may seem a bit crewed but please give it some genuine though. Does playing call of Duty turn you into a murder? A school shooter? Does a Pride march magically convert your children from straight to trans?To anyone sensible reading this you\'ll already know the simple answer is, that it\'s not that simply. While a pride march might help an LGBT person realize that they were gay or lesbian etc. all along and they just hadn\'t known the right words to express themselves, it does not mean they weren\'t LGBT before they witnessed the march, they always were and always would of been if that\'s the way they were born. People become murders due to mental illness, society, their upbringing, circumstances and a whole slew of other reasons and not because they saw it in a video game.The sad thing that can get lost in all this rhetoric and name calling is that a Pedophile who never acts on their ingrained urges is just a human. If they do act on the urges then they deserve the punishment they receive but most of them don\'t choose to be that way, they don\'t choose to develop unlawful feelings and I think that\'s worth remembering, were all just people. So no I don\'t think a light hearted, well meaning, slice of life yaoi anime is going to turn anyone who wasn\'t already, into a Pedophile anymore then teaching kids in school about LGBQ+ rights will fundamental change them, accept to make them more open minded, caring, empathic and understanding people and I think we\'d all do well to remember that.""Are you condoning or \'Ok\'ing\' Pedophilia?""; God no and I think that should be more then apparent by now. I by no means condone of the relationship in Super lovers or of any other relationship between an adult and a minor. What I\'m trying to communicate is two-fold, one that young men and women with this preocular kind of kink are better catered to in the relatively safe and tame environment of anime and that more importantly (but sort of unrelated to this particular anime) that we should not be afraid to discuss and portrait immoral or even evil subject matter so that we might all one day understand it better. I by no means endorse even the most minor of pedophilia but I\'m not some naïve idealist who believes sticking my fingers in my ears and shouting rhetoric from the roof tops will make an issue as troublesome as pedophilia magically go away. I want to understand why any terrible thing occurs, so that one day we can all come together to help prevent it from ever occurring again, as much as possible. We can jail as many pedophiles as we can catch and so we should, just like we would jail a raspiest but that won\'t ever solve the problem and maybe Japan\'s way of allowing young people to explore all manners of socially unacceptable kinks from their own safe spaces, is a far more mature and \'grown-up\' idea then we\'d all like to acknowledge. I\'ll end this segment by just reminding everyone that when we talk about these terrible, horrible topics that put the lives of children, our most precious and vulnerable people at risk, that everything were talking about, is people and all of our continued struggles with the human condition and that goes for those born with the disease of peodifllia but whom never act on it to.The age Gap;So we\'ve gone past the false claims of grooming and the rather hard cutting topic of peodifllia as well as the more silly but highly relevant topic of character coding. What are we now left with? A show staring a short guy and a tall guy in a gay relationship - except for one crucial thing, the age gap.This is maybe the most sensitive issue of them all, where we\'ve already discussed the merits of the other points and how all the evidence would indicate there done to appeal to the Shojo fan base and not to the end of glorifying pedophiles, the age gap does seem to oppose this. However I hope by this point, nearly 8000 words in, think we have demonstrated all the exhibitions we require for our fictional court case as it were.Is the age gap right or something that I endorse? Heck no. Is it in context appropriate? I would suggest yes. The show sets a light tone but clearly takes itself seriously enough when dealing with this topic and its my belief it has every intension of continuing to do so. I haven\'t finished it yet and once I do I\'ll be happy to re-asses my opinion but I\'m quite confident that the main duo will become a couple in a manner that is appropriate to the context with both being fully consensual in the matter. As of episode 6 the have introduces a second relationship dynamic involving Haru\'s x love for an older women and its quite clear to me that this will is being used to further examine and highlight the grey morality of the situation. As I\'ve already made clear it is straight up normal for shows to deal with immoral topics from within a fictional realm and while I completely agree pedophilia and the technically legal relationship of a 16 year old and an 18 year old is wrong, I cannot agree that we should try to pretend these aren\'t both the fantasies of real life people and in a more serious way, the realities for some, which I believe it is only right to explore in a safe, fictional environment where no is hurt.The hate Super Lovers gets in particular does strike me as strange, as mentioned Domestic Girlfriend was huge amongst men and women and it involves a teenager and a women ( who considering her full teaching degree must at-least be around Haru\'s age if not a few years older ) and that brings us on to our last point - Hypocrisies. I will quickly apologies if this section seemed shorter then those previous, I didn\'t intended it like this but I believe I covered most of my points in the peodifllia section and I have no desire to bore anyone by reiterating facts and opinion that which have already been mentioned..On Hypocrisy;Hierocracy or rather \'hypocrite\' is one of those rhetoric words that I hate to see flung around so much but it is apt for this section. I think its worth including this here for its relevance to the more current discussion around the topics we\'ve gone over here today. People have developed a habitual double standard, giving passes to pieces of media which they belief are \'higher-brow\', more intellectual or more innocent then the lower tier trash tv that deserves no such credit.I\'ll keep my examples brief, first if you still belief the idea of peodifllia deserves zero understanding or exploration, than I ask if you also disavow Evangellion who, without any major spoilers, has a 14 year old openly offer herself to a 30ish years old man, going as far to take him linger shopping and even take her shirt off for him. It goes no further but is used to illustrate her mentality. Regardless of its purpose I\'d argue that if you believe \'Super Lovers\' is damaging, then surely Eva showing that a 14 year old actually \'wants\' sex with a far old man must surely be far more damaging, telling a potential pedophile that there \'right\' could be incredibly dangerous. That\'s not to mention that the man in question had an almost abusively physical relationship with his mentally balmy x-lover and yet is considered by almost all to be one of the show best written characters.Some smaller examples. I\'ve already talked at length about how yaoi fanservice in context is factually a more intimate equivalent for standard female fanservice, as well as addressing how shows like Clanned, Kanon and Toradora have majortively shorter leads then is normal height or when compared to their respective significant others/spouses.I\'ve also already gone over how from Sao to Hagani(""We don\'t have any friends"") to Code Geass we see varying degrees of fairly damned incest and about how we have a whole myriad of shows (Pretty much a sub-genre at this stage/point) of shows including a teenager as one half of said coupling, with an adult as the other, that no one seems nearly as offended by ( i.e. \'Domestic Girlfriend\', \'After the rain\' and this very seasons \'Hige wo Soru\' to name a few).Then of course we\'d be remise not to mention the shows that claim a child is actually a 100+years old and then use that as justification to lewd them or have them be dressed in an unfitting fanservices deminer. The likes of \'Seraph of the End\', \'Dance in the Vampire Bund\' and \'Gate\' spring to mind.The point this should get across is its easy to take a high ground and toss rhetoric and hyperbola down on us mere mortals but it takes a much bigger person to stop, learn the facts for yourself and form fair and unbiased opinions. If you truly have an issue with \'Super Lovers\' or most of its contemporize, then maybe its time to take a look at just what else you\'ve watched loved and never realized is guilty in small or big ways of the very same crimes.Conclusion;As I\'ve already alluded to, I\'m not writing this as some petty retort to my friend but rather because this whole topic, from loli to shota has been one of curiosity on my mind for some time now and this simply pushed me to finally write of it, mainly because it was bugging me to continue thinking about it. Is \'Super Lovers\' Peodifllia Pushing? No, while you can argue it\'s an element of the show, it does not promote it as a solely positive thing but instead takes a kind look at elements of it and asks you to form you own opinions and learn from it while also pandering to young women (And men) who wish to explore their peculiar kink. Is it grooming? Clearly not. Is it incest. Kinda, there is certainly an element of incest but it is clearly not a show about incest, making the use of the word, as with the other two, counter-productive and foolish.I\'m by no means a professional and while I try to do the best research and analysis I can, at the end of the day I\'m an amateur at literary study, non-the-less I\'m the sort that likes the think about and research a topic, I\'ve been working on a \'Shuffle!\' essay for months now, though progress is slow considering I only started actually writing it a few weeks ago. Shuffle! itself is well over a decade and a half old now and as far as I can tell no one gives a flying monkeys about it anymore safe me and my recently introduced to it brother, regardless its a show I\'m passionate about and so I\'m possibly writing the world\'s longest and mostly needless analysis of it. All this is to say I\'d rather devote my time and energy to thinking, writing and expressing myself about things I love rather then wasting brain power fighting a losing battle with those of a close minded disposition.And I think in their maybe a simpler point, one that ignores gender politics, or harsh thoughts like peodifllia, because what were actually talking about is a show which averages about a minute or two an episode on yaoi fanservice and spends the rest of its runtime being an above average slice of life show about found family, belonging and loneliness. So \'take it from me\' if you will and try divorce yourself from gender politics, the objectification of women and the grooming of children and just watch your Japanese cartoons for what they are; Wonderful, exciting, beautifully told and varied stories about every topic you can ever image, with so much passion and heart-filled effort put into even the cheapest of productions, not afraid to go where other country\'s would still cringe and more then happy to accept anyone, weather you be a casual weeb, a Shoen head, an idol simp, a basement dwelling degenerate, a Sakuga nerd, or just a plain old fashion closet otaku. Enjoy what you want to because there really is not just something for everyone but plenty of it too. Judge and criticize but do so in good faith, not with rhetoric or you western views, that through the careless use of words like peodifllia and grooming may lead to the devaluing of those but as what we all our underneath the politics and bureaucracy. Anime Fans.I\'d like to end this with a quote from a man more wise, more controversial and more nuanced then I can ever hope to be. A man far more debated and maligned then an anime like \'Super Lovers\' will ever be. its a kind reminder about the merits of judging others without talking into consideration their circumstance and the context surrounding them, as-well as a warning to look in on ourselves before looking outwards at others and its a quote, I think we could all do to heed more often, Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed;""Let no one look down on those honorable, well meaning men whose actions are chronicled in these pages, without searching his own heart, reviewing his own discharge of public duty and applying the lessons of the past to his future conduct.""', ""I'll start by saying I absolutely hate when people watch like 1 or 2 episodes and then think they have a full idea of what an anime is about then decide to write a review that honestly has no real value because how can u properly review something that you won't even give a chance. I really liked this anime and you can hate me all you want but for me there's a lot more to this anime than the the fact that it's BL. Anyways I start my review. May have some spoilers.Story: I really liked the story in this anime, it touches on...a few subjects that not much anime does. It's a BL anime but there is so much more if you give it a shot, its super funny once you get to know the characters and its about a young man named Haru who goes to Canada to visit his mother and meet his new brother Ren. At the end of summer Haru returns back to Japan, his father and step mother pick him up and the airport and on the way home they end up having a terrible accident that effects Haru then after 5 years apart, the younger brother Ren comes to Japan to fulfil a promise he made to the oldest brother before the accident. It's BL so I'm sure you can figure out what ends up happening but the way this anime handles the subject in my opinion is tastefully done and not way over the top.Art: the animation is really good and all the characters are well designed. During funny and different moments it used a more stylized animation style and it helped the comedic moments. Also all the on screen effects were done well and didn't mess with the actual visuals. No CGI is always a good thing in my books, hand drawn modern anime is what I prefer. Also the characters for the most part looked like actual people not just anime characters.Sound: the OP & ED were good, the OP is one of my personal favorites so I watched it on every episode lol. There wasn't much SFX but they were used well during funny moments and the source music really brought the tension to the more serious scenes. Especially when the characters were expressing their feelings it really helped with bringing depth to scenes that were already full of tension.Characters: the characters are the best part of this anime and the voice acting was so good. The four main characters are brothers, the youngest was adopted but they all seemed like brothers and the voice acting really helped with that. They were are similar but also very different from each other. Haru was working as a Host in a nightclub trying to save money for his twin brothers Shima & Aki to be able to move in with him and go to school. The twins are pretty funny, Shima is taller by a few inches and wears glasses and is usually calm, and Aki is the opposite, more talkative and doesn't hold back when it comes to his family. Ren is the quiet one who kinda acts like an old man. Ren and Haru have a special relationship and are the 2 MCs.Enjoyment: I enjoyed this anime a lot more than I expected I would, I recently started watching anime in the BL genre and at first I'm not gunna lie, I thought is was pretty effed up what was going on but the further I got the more I was laughing and really enjoying myself. At the end of the day anime is entertainment and you can't let things like what goes on in an anime ruin your time and for the people who didn't like it, that's fine, I'm sure there are plenty more anime on my list that will offend you.Overall: it's a BL anime about a family of four brothers and 2 of the brothers are more comfortable with each other than the rest, that's about all. It has a lot of funny moments and some more serious ones that might make you think about a few things. It's also about redemption and moving past your regrets and learning to live with the good and the bad. If you have an open mind and aren't scared of the subject matter then I'm sure you will find some enjoyment in watching this anime also. a few subjects that not much anime does.

I binged this show within two days because I was in denial about the fact that my confusion stemmed from how I saw the characters as opposed to the fandom of this show and manga. The story begins with a heartwarming tale of an older brother figure who essentially raises Ren, the little boy, and do to tragedy they are separated before they learn that they are now legally siblings. Yes, this means the show is about an incestuous relationship between a grown man and...a literal child.I read a review that claimed the age gap was the same as the gap in Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi (The World\'s Greatest First Love) and this was not the case at all. Even without their ages being explicitly stated until the second season, the older brother Haru, is four years older than his younger brothers (a pair of twins) who recently turned 18. This means he is at least 22 years old, and since he essentially raised them, and continues to be the legal guardian of Ren, he is a parental figure. Over the first season, he went from being a kind and caring older brother to a literal groomer and pedo.I don\'t know who needs to hear this but Ren is a victim and the other characters in the show know this. They just don\'t care because why else would this story exist. It was so jarring how the anime is well-animated and the character designs are nice. The other characters are normal people, and not everyone knows about Haru and Ren\'s ""relationship"". I wanted to see how their mother would react when she found out so I kept watching and it turns out that she was fine with it because everyone is treating Ren like a child when it\'s convenient and like an adult who can consent to a relationship with another adult when it\'s convenient. I think because I watched so many episodes at once that I had a hard time processing everything, and now I am certain, there are too many people who think child abuse is romantic. a literal child.I read a review that claimed the age gap was the same as the gap in Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi (The World\'s Greatest First Love) and this was not the case at all.

Haru and Ren didn\'t instantly fall in love to each other and even as Ren grew up as a teenager, their feeling is still ambiguous ; either it\'s platonic or romantic.THE MORE FORBIDDEN THE RELATIONSHIP IS, THE BETTER.This yaoi anime may prove too taboo for some. It illustrates a ""more-than-family"" relationship between Haru and his younger adopted brother, Ren. It begins as an innocent quest to bond as brothers and to accept...each other as family, but with Haru\'s doting ways and Ren\'s attachment, the bond between them begins to skew.Ren is desperately trying to understand what he means to Haru, and more importantly, what Haru means to him.

I had just watch two animes which were Junjou Romantica and Hitorijime My Hero and I wanted more, so I looked online for some good Yaoi recommendations...and this fuckery appeared. It look sus, it look weird, and there was a little child and a whole grown ass man in the cover but I though ""I am blind and I do not see anything wrong""For my surprise, all the chapters were on facebook and then my trip began...STORY9/10Putting aside the fact that yes, yes baby girl, this is incest and you have to admit it. They do not share blood but surprise, surprise, by law Ren is Haru\'s brother and they share a surname so they are brothers. AND THEY EVEN CALL EACH OTHER BROTHER WHICH IS SICK.Also, I didn\'t want to talk without knowing my facts so I investigated a little bit about Japanese laws an according to the penal code of Japan the age to have a consensual relationship is 13 years old but we have to keep in mind that this does not apply to every single type of relationship. As an example, a 13 year old can date a 20 year old and it will be legal, but if that 13 year old has a sexual relationship with his partner that is seemingly older than him it will now be illegal and it will be punish with 5 years of prison. But they can have sexual encounters except intercourse.So yes, I guess this is technically not pedophilia in Japanese culture but let\'s not play to be blind, this is fucked up. But a good fucked up and let me tell you why.Putting aside everything that I said before, this is a slice of life anime of a family which adopted a little kid that acts like a dog which is trying to adapt to society. It is funny, it has good characters, it has situations that will make you laugh a lot and you will have a good time. You will, be sitting there seeing this brothers fighting over something absurd and then BOOM a child groping his brother.Hey, it\'s a joke, but it is not a joke.ART8/10Pretty decent for Yaoi, but, not amazing, that is all.SOUND10/10Pretty goodCHARACTERNow the intersting part. If I could dive the characters a 10000/10 I would. And let me tell you why. I has some of the best supporting cast that I have ever witness in Yaoi.We have the Kaidou brother\'s which are Haru, Ren, Aki and Shima. We also have Haru\'s bestie Iku and Haru\'s high school friend, Kiyoka which is our trans icon, Juuzen which is Ren\'s bestie and other members which names I don\'t remember.But I found all the character pretty easy to like and enjoy the little moments that they had in the anime. But it did stress the hell out of me why no one called the fucking police on Haru. But well, I guess everybody makes mistakes.ENJOYMENT10/10Hella funny and I hate that I enjoy it this much because say no to incest and pedophilia but technically it is not pedophilia so I have decided that I will make a blind eye on the incest part and pretend that it is not happening, trust me, do the same, you will not regret it.OVERALLI give it an 8 out of 10 because I can not make a blind eye. This is illegal territory, but if you don\'t have a lot of limits and really little morals, you will really enjoy this.So I guess... give it a chance?Oh I don\'t know, can we just make a a jump in time and make Ren 18 please? Is the only thing I ask. Thank you all and have a nice day. and this fuckery appeared.

Totsuzen! Neko no Kuni Banipal Witt,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2715/Totsuzen_Neko_no_Kuni_Banipal_Witt,"[""Totsuzen! Neko no Kuni Banipal Witt, also known as Catnapped! The Movie, is an extremely charming children's movie about the secret world of cats. I was extremely fortunate to find this movie at Media Play (I've had this movie for THAT long...Media Play was still in business! xD) and I've been hooked ever since.This is definitely one to bring home to the kids. The storyline is simple and fun for kids, and the animation is simple but entertaining. There are plenty of humorous moments to cheer on the progress, and once you hear the ending theme song, Yume He No Tobira, I challenge you to...try to get it out of your head! :DIf you're a Miyazaki fan (though, who isn't?), though this isn't a Miyazaki creation, Catnapped! The Movie is a fantasy-based film centered around animals, which Miyazaki is well known for. It's also got the same sort of magical action sequences we've come to love and expect from Miyazaki's films. However, if you only seem to find yourself in the more dark, dramatic animes, this may not be the film for you; It is a film intended for children so it has cheerful elements.Don't forget to add Totsuzen! Neko no Kuni Banipal Witt to your Queue! This is a thoroughly enjoyable film I think you'll come to love.

Neko no Kuni Banipal Witt  is a 1995 film brought to us by our old friends at Studio Hibari, whom you may recall from their work on Kashimashi & Venus Versus Virus. So, how do these folks handle a children's film and is it going to be any better than their track record would indicate? Let's give it a shot and delve in.Story:Papadoll has gone missing. His smallest human, Meeko, is convinced that he's been kidnapped by aliens but her brother, Toriyasu, doesn't take her seriously. In fact, the little brat doesn't seem to care saying that Papadoll just lay about all...day anyway. That's when Meeko notices a strange cat observing them. That night, three strange cats burst into their room, wanting to take Toriyasu away. Meeko insists on going along.The big flaw with the film on a narrative level is that it's paced pretty awkwardly. You get a long, kind of boring scene where the characters plan their next move intermixed with scenes of what the antagonists are doing and ending with an action sequence that's welcome, at first, but just drags after a while And the film is barely an hour and a quarter long so the way the scenes still manage to drag, even if just a bit, is kind of a big deal.On the positive side, the concept behind this is fairly creative. I also do like that it makes a big theme of Toriyasu being forced to come to terms with his own behaviour and how it's contributed to the problem. There aren't many works of children's media that demand that level of self-reflection.Characters:The characters vary a bit as well. Some of the dynamics come across as contrived and don't work very well. The whole conflict turned into a kind of creepily close respect between Toriyasu & ChuChu being the prime example. A lot of the side characters are also pretty one-note. However, I do have to give the film some credit. Toriyasu's character arc works quite well. The antagonist, Buburina, is pretty terrible but she's not just the purely evil villain you get in a lot of children's media. She does have redeeming qualities. She may not be at the level of a Ghibli villain, but it does give her some dimension.Art:The art also varies. One the negative side, the character designs don't look very good. That being said, a lot of the backgrounds are creative and interesting. The whole world of Banipal Witt looks like a drug-induced hallucination. It's almost like Hibari took visual inspiration from Apple  Films' opus, Yellow Submarine. It's a very strange looking world, but one with a lot of atmosphere. The film's action scenes also work quite nicely.Sound:The cast is pretty decent. Hiroaki Hori, Sasaki Mirai & Hidaka Noriko all do quite well. Saegusa Shigeaki handles the music and it works nicely enough.Ho-yay:Don't expect any. To be fair, an emphasis on romance really wouldn't work for the film in general.Final Thoughts:Totsuzen! Neko no Kuni Banipal Witt was actually pretty enjoyable. Yes, it could have been better, particularly in some areas. However, it's also creative and interesting enough in its own right. My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Tomorrow I'll end this year's film festival week with a look at Mononoke Hime. day anyway. That's when Meeko notices a strange cat observing them.

My case with this movie is truly no exception, as I find it\'s a very cute and heartwarmingmovie that very few people know exists... and I didn\'t see it until I was a junior in high school.PREMISE:The film is about a brother and sister named Toriyasu and Meeko whose dog Papadoll has been missing for a long time. Itturns out that the dog has been taken to Banipal Witt, a strange world populated by anthropomorphic cats, where...the evilprincess Buburina and her henchman Doh-Doh plan to use it for world domination.Yes, this film has a weird premise and you might think ""seen it before"", but even if you end up watching it, skepticismnotwithstanding, you\'ll probably be surprised by all the creativity put into it. In fact, this film is a perfect example of a weirdmovie that actually has a coherent plot, and I\'ll get to why in a moment.WRITING:While some of the story ideas might be cliché, credit should be given where it\'s due. While many good works of fiction havea character you hate because of what they do or the way they are written comes off as annoying, not one character in thisfilm is unlikeable, even the bad guys! *SPOILER ALERT* For example, while Toriyasu starts off as moody and lazy, he getsbetter later on, not to mention his sister Meeko, despite the fate she ends up with, comes off as brave and smart and evenhelps the audience understand the villain.The villains, despite clearly posing a threat with Doh-Doh controlling Papadoll to abduct the residents of Banipal Witt andBuburina\'s curse to turn whatever living thing she touches into a balloon, are also impossible to truly hate. For one thing, aflashback showing how Buburina got the curse and even exposition stating how Doh-Doh ended up the way he did are givento the audience along with several other tidbits of information that help you understand the story. It\'s rare that villains in awork of fiction aimed at kids are ever written in a way that makes the audience sympathize with them or understand howthey turned as it\'s mostly just ""he or she\'s bad, therefore they must die!"" morality in these films, so it\'s no surprise this filmpasses in this respect.In short, the film takes its time revealing information to the audience by explaining some of its things with dialogue andothers with visuals and leaving some details out so that you can use what you see and hear or take the time to think aboutto put all the pieces together, something I find unusual for a children\'s story, let alone an anime.Also, it\'s worth noting that among the messages the film teaches its audience, it tells them that violence is not OK, it\'swrong to take your anger out on someone in a way that\'s harmful and that love, caring and selflessness are important in away that is subtle rather than hammering it in, something I found truly surprising in an anime, especially one aimed at kids.ART:The animation is, for the most part, very fluid and astounding for an anime production, although there is the occasionallow-framerate or repeated animation. The fluidity of the animation matches the zaniness and charm of Banipal Witt andnever fails to amaze with its sometimes frightening or creative imagery in a way that is reminiscent of Yellow Submarine andLittle Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland.The character designs, naturally, include cuteness. While the cats themselves are humanoid and some look more humanthan others (particularly Buburina and Chu-Chu), the two children look average for a children\'s anime but after they\'retransformed into cats, they may come off as irresistably cute (saw-toothed as they are). From a design standpoint, I likedMeeko, Chu-Chu, Suttoboke, Hoi-Hoi, Sandada and Buburina.Not only is the world bright and candy-colored to go along with the madness, but there is also a unique day-and-nightsystem with its own magic and even the use of old transportation, including hot-air balloons and blimps. By contrast, theparts with the children in Japan look more subdued, which helps make the zaniness all the more unavoidable.As far as animation is concerned, my favorite scenes are the ones with Lily Remlon\'s dance, the scene where Buburinaturns her prisoners into balloons and the escape from Buburina\'s castle and the subsequent air battle due to all the detailand effort put into each and every scene.The stop-motion in the opening and closing credits, while different from the film itself, earned a mention because they helpprepare the audience for fun and prompt them to wait until it\'s over before shutting off respectively, what with creativity andweirdness... and because I\'m a sucker for stop-motion, but I digress. However, it brings me to my next point...SOUND:The music in this film is mostly limited to the time spent in Banipal Witt, which helps make you enjoy the world it takesplace in a lot more, especially because it has awesome music that fits the scene it\'s in.The theme song ""Yume e No Tobira"" deserves a mention not only because it is very light-hearted and catchy but alsobecause of Mayumi Iizuka\'s beautiful singing voice. Plus, it mentions friendship, fun and imagination, making its placementin the film all the more perfect (as I\'m writing this, I\'m listening to it for the second time).As for the voice work, I\'ve seen both the subtitled and dubbed versions, and I have this to say. I actually like the dubbedversion better somewhat. While the voices for Meeko in both versions can be grating (to be fair, she is a small child), thedub actress at least doesn\'t scream, though it is more high-pitched.However, both versions have some things in common. Specifically, Noriko Hidaka and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn ham up theirperformances as Buburina (the former especially, even reaching Miranda Richardson levels of overacting at times), helpingmake her impossible to hate. Mayumi Iizuka and Lia Sargent both match the mild Tsundere personality of Chu-Chu bycoming off as initially stuck-up but later warming up. Those voices I just mentioned are probably the main things that preventme from hating the original version.OVERALL:I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, despite having found many spoilers online prior to watching, and it saddens methat it\'s not very well-known. Like some, I heard about it through a trailer on a Sailor Moon VHS and due to the weirdnessoften giving me bad dreams, it took years to gain the confidence to watch it and I don\'t regret it.On the surface, the film looks cutesy yet bizarre and nightmarish, but dig deeper and you\'ll find a heartwarming film withsomething to learn, likeable characters and brilliant animation.If you love cute things, children\'s films, anime and especially cats, I highly recommend it. the evilprincess Buburina and her henchman Doh-Doh plan to use it for world domination.Yes, this film has a weird premise and you might think ""seen it before"", but even if you end up watching it, skepticismnotwithstanding, you\'ll probably be surprised by all the creativity put into it.

Witch Craft Works: Takamiya-kun to Imouto no Warudakumi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/22117/Witch_Craft_Works__Takamiya-kun_to_Imouto_no_Warudakumi,"[""Well, for a moment there I thought the OVA will be just another fan service.Turns out the OVA of Witch Craft Works itself, in my opinion, generate more excitement for me than the actual series itself. It is very light-hearted and to be frank, the comedy is very refreshing.Bringing the bro-con topic of the main character's sister and WWE-ish featuring bear and penguin, the OVA is just an extension to the main series.The art and the sound are very much the same with the usual series. The character however, stole the spotlight in this OVA.I have to say that the OVA is...much more enjoyable and comedic compared to the main series.For overall resultt, this is one OVA that is good, if not, better than the main series in term of enjoyment. much more enjoyable and comedic compared to the main series.For overall resultt, this is one OVA that is good, if not, better than the main series in term of enjoyment."", ""Ill first state the other only person who reviewed this is SO wrong i personally enjoyed the anime more than the OVA otherwise this review will probably be a short oneStory: no real story too the OVA it just picks up the anime ends you really see more of the side characters than the main charactersArt: art was very good nothing bad about itSound: same as art everything about it was goodCharacter: like i said in the story part you mostly get the side characters with this one like Honoka's sister and some of his enemy'sEnjoyment: i did get good laughs out of this but...i did get WAY more of that from the anime and the action with the OVA is pretty goodOverall: giving this a 7 the comedy was good but not good enough for and the action as well too give this a 8 but almost hit that point but ill gladly give this a 7 as i did enjoy this anime i did get WAY more of that from the anime and the action with the OVA is pretty goodOverall: giving this a 7 the comedy was good but not good enough for and the action as well too give this a 8 but almost hit that point but ill gladly give this a 7 as i did enjoy this anime"", 'Was a super fun episode focusing on the sister instead of the main character.It is a ova so theres not much to it except fun!Art seemed a little worse than the rest of the show but its a ova so its to be somewhat expected.I would recommend this, and if you havent watched the main show its not much special but I would recommend it for a enjoyable anime.Im mainly writing this because i usually check the reviews for OVAs before watching them so I dont get dissapointed and there were only three so yup.and this part is to make the review long enough...to be submitted because there isnt much to say. to be submitted because there isnt much to say.', ""Really not much to say about this.An extra, self-contained episode focusing on Kasumi and tanpopo. It's nothing amazing, but it's enjoyable. It has all the quality of the main series, except it had a bit more humour and action(which makes sense considering it's a standalone episode) I disagree with the reviewer who said it's better than the main series. I'd say this episode was nice, but a bit lower quality than the main series ones. On that note, I was sort of disappointed it didn't tie into the story at all or add much characterisation.Anyways, if you liked WCW, I'd recommend watching this. "", 'Witch Craft Works: Takamiya-kun to Imouto no Warudakumi (2015)STORY:OVA about Kasumi gaining an alliance with Tanpopo to take down the Princess. They recruit other members of Tower Witches to achieve this goal. Ultimately it is based around Kasumi and her Bro-Con ways that is seen by all but her. They proceed with their plan and the expected results. The actual episode picks up directly from the end of the 12th episode. It also contains a funny fight scene with the cute mentor Rinon.ART:The art is the same as before just perhaps a little less polished off so the quality is slightly worse, but...it is far from bad however.SOUND:Same as the main series. All very good and to standard with the great ending song.CHARACTER:Get to know more about the other supporting Tower Witches and more about Kasumi which is really nice to see.ENJOYMENT:The episode is very enjoyable and brings some extra hilarity to the already great series.OVERALL:Absolutely worth a watch if you enjoyed the series. it is far from bad however.SOUND:Same as the main series.

Yaneura no Rudger,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50553/Yaneura_no_Rudger,"['Not much to say about it, I really enjoyed the movie, the animation was good, the characters were cute, not annoying at all, the artstyle very beautiful... All in all, I would give it a 7.5 as it was a nice, pure, sentsentimental, fantasy - adventure story of 1hr and 40mins long, that reminds me many other anime and movies. So I would recommend it for the whole family and I would say somehow similar to -When Marnie was here, A letter to Momo, Drifting home, Totoro, Weathering with you, Penguin highway, Children who chase lost voices, Mirai no mirai, A whisker away, Summer days...with Coo etc with Coo etc']"
Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion The Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36531/Shinkansen_Henkei_Robo_Shinkalion_The_Animation,"[""If you like mecha with good visuals and fun, also for people that want to start mecha, get to have a chance to learn more about Japan and the trains/RAILWAY,there too, you in for some badass knowledge XD, people MUST WATCH this one Shinkansen.This is like the Yu-Gi-Oh Arc-V of mecha. not your standard thing and more people need to watch both. Both are very FLASHY and has that SPIRIT AND ENERGY !!!!! The ANIMATION of Shinkansen is GODLY during transformation sequence of the Shinkansen trains (bullet trains/super high speed trains) to robots, BEST I'VE SEEN, dude I've seen a lot of robot anime....THIS IS GOOD. THEY ARE DIFFERENT SERIES/MODELS OF SHINKANSEN E5 E6 E7, etc. transform to BADASS ROBOTS. The robots can also combine, GATTAI , so this anime does not miss out on that traditional Classic part of mecha. The trains/robots also got BADASS NAMES like Hayabusa, Doctor Yellow for example, The Fantastic designs and names are BASED ON THE REAL THING IN REAL LIFE too. As you watch the anime you might start obsessing with the Shinkansen and Shinkansen knowledge too like the main character!!!Fights, the robots have feet equipped with wheels cause original part are wheels of the train so they can slide and ice skating around to fight in addition to running, REALLY COOL. ROBOT GOT GOOD WEAPONS, (Sword, guns, drill, charge blast, etc.) Characters are all really likable. Best part, the kids don't just sit and pilot the mecha using joysticks, they fighting as the mecha. MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING AS MECHA! Kinda like Wii sports where instead of pressing buttons on the controller to swing a bat, you actually swing the controller yourself.Character designs and personality excellent too, from the kids, to the aliens, to the commander officers. THE GIRLS ARE PRETTY CUTE !!! For all you that like anime BOTH Arc-V and Shinkansen are example of a PERFECT 10! THIS IS GOOD.

THE GIRLS ARE PRETTY CUTE !!! For all you that like anime BOTH Arc-V and Shinkansen are example of a PERFECT 10!"", 'I remember when the mecha genre used to be one of the most popular genres in the anime medium.Around the early 80s to the late  2000s anime studio’s used to produce and release a tone of mecha anime ranging from Gundam, Brave series, Gurren Lagann, Ideon, Macross, Patlabor, Evangelion, etc. A lot of anime fans that grew up around that period loved the mecha genre and the genre helped the industry from crashing down in the early 90s.Unfortunately, as time went on the mecha genre granted faded out to obscurity thanks to the rise of the isekai and ecchi genres in the 2010...era. It didn’t help that many of the popular mecha anime from the last decade weren’t that good or at the very least pale compare to the mecha animes from the 90s, 00s. Darling in the Franxx, Aldonah Zero fall into the bad category while SSSS Gridman and Gundam Iron-Blooded Orphans fall into the decent but pale other mecha anime from the past category.Excluding Gundam the Origin and Promare many of the great mecha anime were more on the obscure side such as Gundam Build Fighters (Season 1), Planet With, Gundam Unicorn, Little Battlers Experience Wars and my favourite of the bunch Shinkalion.A show that I never expected to good due to its kid’s label ended up being one of my favourite animes as being one of the best animes I have seen from the last decade.Shinkalion is at its core a celebration of the mecha genre. It homages every well-known mecha series out there from Gundam, Brave, Getter Robo and especially Evangelion, one of the most important anime ever made packed with the soundtrack and character appearances notably Shinji Ikari.Shinkalion also features Vocaloid Hatsune Miku, who’s a recurring character in the show, as a full-fleshed pilot.When the show is not homaging various mecha anime from the past it delivers and man what a plot this is.The story of Shinkalion may not be the most original thing ever but, the execution and story structure are what makes it stand out.Evolution is the key to Shinkalion’s successes. It starts as a simple monster of the week however as early as episode seven after the show establishes Hayato, Akita and Tsuraunki characters with their two-part introductory episodes the show break takes a spin of the monster of the week formula that we all use to seeing.Sure the Kitoralsus still ditch out monster of the week objects to fight the heroes, but from episode seven onward will you discover they are strategic and well-calculated villains that analysis our heroes every move, so much so that will start to gain an upper hand in various fights causing our heroes to think before they act.This alone really made the story engaging as I was always thrilled of what the Kitoralsus are going to do next. From reducing enemies numbers to summoning monsters that exploit various Shinkalions weaknesses the Kitoralsus are forced to be reckoned with. Speaking of Kitoralsus they are a fantastic group of villains.Not only they are an engaging threat from beginning to end they are also well written. They may appear as your typical black and white kids villains but again as episode 7, they grow out of the black and white villain status to a point they come just as human as the heroes, despite their race.When the show is not showcasing mecha fights the show spends its time at world-building and comedy and speaking of world-building. The world-building in Shinkalion is fantastic. If you want to learn about the Japan Railway System, and Japan lifestyle then you came to the right place. Though the 76 episodes run you will learn how trains operate in Japan, discovering different Japan city lifestyle that is different from Tokyo and certain places where people with certain interests would hang around.The world in Shinkalion feels accurate and alive and that aspect really strengths the writing in the series.On top of all that the show is simply self-aware of itself. Similar to Symphogear, Assassination Classroom and Martian Successor Nadesico the show pokes fun of its humour, for example, each character has a catchphrase that enhances the show self-awareness especially when certain characters would steal their owner character catchphrases.Oh, the show is simply funny. Many of the humour that the characters ditch outflows thanks to great comedic timing and chemistry.All of this was made possible by the show’s great pacing and writing. Toy/Card product shows tend to struggle in that aspect as their promoting Toys/Cards products rather than telling a meaningful story that kids can learn and while Shinkalion is certainly a toy product anime it has enough substance to make it stand out from its peers.Shinkalion moves at a consistent smooth pacing nether feeling rushed or dragged. Every single episode has a purpose wherever for character development, world-building, or story advancement. Themes of bonding, friendship, humanity, and communication are beautifully executed in the series.Shinkalion is a simple series that has focus. It doesn’t off rails just to meander to a certain target audience nor does it try to do something that is clearly not to a point it becomes incomprehensible gibberish. Shinkalion knows what it wants to do, and it achieves it with minimal hiccups.The beautifully crafted story won’t be effective if the characters weren’t not up to par. Thankfully the characters were not only fun to watch but they were nicely written.Let’s start with Hayato and man what a brilliant and lovable character he is.From the first two episodes of the series, I knew that he was going to be a compelling, interesting, and fun protagonist to follow. I love his fighting determination as well as his nerdy passion towards trains to a point where his friends have to speak rail language just to get his attention.Despite his rail obsession, Hayato is still human and character development and flaws showcase that from his naive drive that causes him to do reckless things at times, his fear of heights, to overall lack of psychical discipline, and he thankfully grows as a person through the influence from his friends that he encounters in the series that lead him to become a better leader.Lastly, I love how he influences various characters in the series to become better people, and his hobby reflects that as the true reason why he loves trains so much is he wants to protect everyone’s dreams by people’s using the Shinkansen as transportation.Hayato is the main component of Shinkalion successes and without him, the show wouldn’t be the same time. Easily my second favorite character in the show, as well is one of my favorite protagonists alongside Sana Kurata, Nagisa Shiota, Lelouch, Atsuko Kagari, Ciel Phantomive, Sena Arata and Iruma Suzuki.I liked Akita more than I should. He could have easily been the most boring character in the due to his distant personally that contracts Hayato and Tsuraunki happy personalities respectively, but the show proved me wrong thanks at his great character development.I also enjoyed his character growth throughout this series. He starts off a cold and less talkative individual, but he quickly starts to open up to others as the series progresses with the help of Hayato and the group. He’s has a catchphrase where he comments about where is the story is heading.Finally, I found his chemistry towards the other characters especially Tsuranuki and Shinbou to be impeccable.Tsuranuki is my favorite character in the series.From the minute he appears in the show I knew, he was going to my favorite character in the show. Hayato and Akita are strong characters in their own right Tsuraunki won my heart. I love his hot-headed and humorous personality. He also has the most sympathetic background out of the main cast coming from a family of engineers.What made him so special compared to the rest of the main cast for me is that his unpredictable mature. He’s still the hot-headed one of the team with his flashy catchphrase, but he’s more mature than his usual archetype. He doesn’t have a massive hot-headed egao nor does he think his superior to the other drivers. His a passionate friendly person who respects his friend’s strengths and weakness.He also a good exposer and roaster.Lastly, I adore his development as well as character chemistry towards the cast, especially to the Red, and Blue oni dynamic with Akita. They play off each other with their contrasting personalities to a point where they grew to respect each other as teammates and friends.His character development about the value of being a kid instead of jumping to become an adult was fascinating to watch as thanks to Hayato and his friend’s we see him enjoying the kid’s life as he rarely got to experience it since the passing of his dad.I’m honestly shocked by how much I liked Shinbou. I thought he would be the generic ninja kid character of the show, but I was shocked by how the show handled him as well his development.He starts off a skilled but quiet individual who rather work on their own but as the series progresses thanks to Akita and his peers he dramatically comes off from his shell becomes more talkative to his fellow peers.He’s increased screen time in the third fifths in the show is also a reflection to as he hardly presences for the slice of life bits in the first two-fifths of the show.Sadly I cannot talk about Sieryu without going into massive spoilers, but I can say he’s a wonderful character that receives the one of the best character development in the series, and I liked his interactions towards the cast.I also liked the other Shinkalion pilots. Sure, they aren’t as focused compared to the main four excluding Rei and especially Ryūji (My third favorite character in the show) who are just as well-developed as the main five but I still found the other Shinkalion pliots to be entertaining and likeable.When I first lead my eyes on Azusa, I thought she would be a useless character, but she ended up being one of the fun characters in the show. Even though she’s not a pilot, she provides great support, humour and chemistry towards the main pilots.The beauty of Shinkalion cast is they are human. Scriptwriter Kento Shimoyama has a clear understanding of how kids would behave and act in real life. They are not just a bunch loud kids who aimlessly worship the same hobby being mindless railgeeks just marking greed.Each kid has their own goal and ideals that they want to achieve in life and all the hobby that the kids have all tied to key elements in real life such as creating, surviving and discovering. It had been a long time since I watched a kid’s anime that feature characters that resemble human beings.Granted the whole kid’s characters resembling human beings thing has been before such as Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 and Digimon Tamers but the since then the majority directors that worked on kids anime have frankly played it too safe to a point where characters from their respective series feel like husks that only exist promote a certain toy/deck with no soul nor passion. Shinkalion doesn’t fall to those traps as the characters in Shinkalion are not only fun to watch but there were very well written.For a kid’s series that came out in 2018, I found the visuals to be polished. It may not be on par with stuff like Demon Slayer, My Hero Academia, March Comes in Like a Lion and Land Of The Lustrous, but it’s still one of the better-looking anime I have seen from the decade, especially for kids show when they usually have average production values.Character designs are distinctive from each other. The background scenery was well detailed due to the bright and smooth color palette and the actual animation is competent for what it is.The mechanical designs are beautifully designed. Each of them has their strength, weakness and gimmicks that make them distinctive from each other.For example, E5 Hayabusa is a balance type that can combine with various Shinkalion, E6 Komachi is a range type, E7 Kagayaki is a power type, E3 Tsubasa is the Speed type, N700A Nozomi is the close combat type, 800 Tsubame is the flight type, etc.My favourite’s mecha designs are the E5 MK II, Black Shinkalion especially its berserk mode form, E7 923 Doctor Yellow and N700A Nazomi.The stunning mecha designs were only better by the show’s good use of CGI. It fits well with the traditional animation. The CGI is smooth, nicely drawn, crisp and it rarely felt out of place with the 2D animation. Excluding the stable super robot transformation sequences as well as the finishing moves at times the anime doesn’t have much stock footage used.The soundtrack by Toshiyuki Watanabe is nothing short of outstanding. The soundtrack features a strong mix of upbeat, bright, sci-fi and orchestra tracks that fit the tone of the anime.Opening theme Evolution Theory is an upbeat catchy song that perfectly captures the spirit of the show.Shinkalion has 5 ending themes and all of them were fantastic in their right. My favorite ending of the bunch is Go Way by SILENT SIREN due to lighthearted and upbeat the song is.Voice acting is strong all across the board. Every Seiyuus did a fantastic capturing the spirit of their respective characters with strong line delivery.The best performance goes to Ayane Sakura as Hayato who also voiced Ochako from My Hero Academia, Nero from Black Clover, Tsubaki from Your Lie in April, and Yuzuki from Selector Wixoss. She perfectly nails the dorky railfan Hayato.Rie Murakawa, who beautifully portrayed the highly spirited Tsuraunki who also voiced Ram from Re: Zero, Anzu from Hinamatsuri and Constanze from Little Witch Academia.Kei Shindou perfectly captures the ambitious Seriyuu who also voiced Ranma from Buddyfight Ace, Kyouka Jirou from My Hero Academia and Wang Liu Mei from Gundam 00.Ryota Osaka superbly disciplined Ryuji who also voiced Sena Arata from Little Battlers Experience Wars and Ikki Kurogane from Chivalry of the Failed Knight.There’s currently no English dub for this show, but I am perfectly fine with the show not having a dub in this case, as this is one of the shows that wouldn’t work in English without completely butchering it.“No one who loves Shinkalion could be a bad person!”Hayato Hayasugi.Shinkalion is the end product of passion and ambition.It is a series that knew wanted to be and never abandoned its objective in favor of dumb pandering.Shinkalion is also one of those series that made an impact of me on how I view anime as a whole.Every single episode of Shinkalion has a purpose whatever it’s for characterization, story development, and world-building.I’ve learned the Japanese Natation Railway System as the people who live in cities that operate the system.It is a series that can be enjoyed for both kids and adults due to how simple and well written it is.Shinkalion is a series from beginning to end that made me laugh, cry and smile, and all of this was made possible due to the staff having ambition and passion of making a series that is worth something.With that said anime studios please, take notes. This is how you make a good modern mecha anime.Not that corporate greed nor that power fantasy crap. This how it’s done and I hope future mecha/kid’s anime will follow on Shinkalion’s footsteps. era.

The soundtrack features a strong mix of upbeat, bright, sci-fi and orchestra tracks that fit the tone of the anime.Opening theme Evolution Theory is an upbeat catchy song that perfectly captures the spirit of the show.Shinkalion has 5 ending themes and all of them were fantastic in their right. My favorite ending of the bunch is Go Way by SILENT SIREN due to lighthearted and upbeat the song is.Voice acting is strong all across the board. Every Seiyuus did a fantastic capturing the spirit of their respective characters with strong line delivery.The best performance goes to Ayane Sakura as Hayato who also voiced Ochako from My Hero Academia, Nero from Black Clover, Tsubaki from Your Lie in April, and Yuzuki from Selector Wixoss. She perfectly nails the dorky railfan Hayato.Rie Murakawa, who beautifully portrayed the highly spirited Tsuraunki who also voiced Ram from Re: Zero, Anzu from Hinamatsuri and Constanze from Little Witch Academia.Kei Shindou perfectly captures the ambitious Seriyuu who also voiced Ranma from Buddyfight Ace, Kyouka Jirou from My Hero Academia and Wang Liu Mei from Gundam 00.Ryota Osaka superbly disciplined Ryuji who also voiced Sena Arata from Little Battlers Experience Wars and Ikki Kurogane from Chivalry of the Failed Knight.There’s currently no English dub for this show, but I am perfectly fine with the show not having a dub in this case, as this is one of the shows that wouldn’t work in English without completely butchering it.“No one who loves Shinkalion could be a bad person!”Hayato Hayasugi.Shinkalion is the end product of passion and ambition.It is a series that knew wanted to be and never abandoned its objective in favor of dumb pandering.Shinkalion is also one of those series that made an impact of me on how I view anime as a whole.Every single episode of Shinkalion has a purpose whatever it’s for characterization, story development, and world-building.I’ve learned the Japanese Natation Railway System as the people who live in cities that operate the system.It is a series that can be enjoyed for both kids and adults due to how simple and well written it is.Shinkalion is a series from beginning to end that made me laugh, cry and smile, and all of this was made possible due to the staff having ambition and passion of making a series that is worth something.With that said anime studios please, take notes. This is how you make a good modern mecha anime.Not that corporate greed nor that power fantasy crap. This how it’s done and I hope future mecha/kid’s anime will follow on Shinkalion’s footsteps.', ""(Spoiler Warning)Okay, this needs to be addreased first. Kento Shinoyama can be a GOOD writer when it's not Toei's stupidity making him feel misrable.Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion The Animation is the example of how to make a good kid show once in a life time by having the writer be giving free will.If you're looking for anything deep, this would be it.But take notes I will make you understand why Kento can also screw up sometime when it comes to anime, but not all the time.Case and Point: Shuriken Sentai Ninninger and Kamen Rider Zi-OWith the Toei staff being beyound terrible from newcomers trying...to gain mentor wisdom is hard in a post deviant era that doesn't allow that. Toei over the last 10 years has been screwed up alot of good that are either Kamen Rider Or Super Sentai.It also really annoying to deal with Toei's idiot red ranger troupe for over 10 years in a row. That's right.I can go on hours of talking about this one, but i'll write it short.Shuriken Sentai Ninninger was a total disater of a show i'd say. It was sexist and nothing good or right ever came out of it. Mostly because it's leader Takaharu was played by a horoble actor who stole the screentime of his teamates. This was because Toei wanted to bring back the that troupe and kill whatever interest was good in the show. Also, Ninninger killed the franchise and thus making any new show after it get less viewers and toy sales not above avarage. In short. People with out asenior guiding hand to not mess up–ESPECIALLY for things part of a larger franchise. He wrote some of the worst episodes of Toei's Goseiger, Gokaiger and Go-Buster and few Spring films, but the guy who killed the Toei genre was Shoji Yonemura the Taisen writer who wrote the spring Kamen Rider X Super Sentai films back when i was still new to this. Well it has to do with their history on longrunning stuff…in that they’re better with adapting material than production of their own content, and if they’re writing their own original stories then they need a senior guiding hand to not mess up–ESPECIALLY for things part of a larger franchise. In example…believe it or not, as much as I’ve bashed Shoji Yonemura for the Taisen movies as it was clear he did no research and was writing what someone else wanted ad nauseum the entire time, I REALLY liked his work as the main writer for Kamen Rider Kabuto, as he gelled well with Toshiki Inoue’s works on it and for the most part both reigned each-other in, especially since Toei’s problem producer Shinichiro Shirakura (despite being credited on it) said himself he had no actual involvement with it which would have screwed it up. Normally though? Yonemura does not work well in writing original work that contains other people’s characters if he doesn’t grasp an understanding of them, and has gotten worse in writing original content over time. But beyond that Yonemura actually wrote a couple good Lupin TV specials in the late 90′s/early 00′s, and consistently does good work contributing to the Pokemon Anime from near its beginning up to this day–even doing Damage control for the godawful ending to The Kalos-related seasons. He Also did the adaptation for most of FAIRY TAIL, including writing its movie Dragon Cry. And now he’s involved in Adapting One Piece, and doing it well. As a proper adaptation? Yeah, involves reading/watching the prior content to get an understanding of them, thus it gets past one of his bigger achilles heels. But its clear to see he’s a writer that does better with guidance and training wheels on, than if you let him loose.Maekawa another Toei writer ends up much that same way. You know what else he did outside of Magiranger or Yugioh stuff? DIGIMON ADVENTURE 02 AND DRAGONBALL GT, much of what he wrote being the derailing stuff people disliked or content that didn’t treat past characters/events particularly well. His most well-received work was the first year of HunterXHunter(2011), but that’s about it. If a series is heavily producer mandated he’ll do what he’s told, but if its original writing it’ll end up in a way that the audience generally doesn’t like…with the bucking blame more likely to stop at the producer.Case in Point: Toei doesn't allow free will anymore, but only money making shill. Toei is just money 101 and never changees. WHen they a good show they get worse.Toei’s problem producer Shinichiro Shirakura since the 90's series that include Zyuranger has aways got over-barring at times who thinks Tokastsu is juvinale and doesn't give damn if its target demograhfics are either children or young adults.And back to the topic. Kento while having writing flaws in this show he alteast doesn't screw up important episodes plot points and one major thing he did was make the MC not open his god damn mouth.This show while having plots holes galore, filler and plot, deux ex machina and etc. Still made a good job in understading what trains are about and having your own family and team makes it far better than anything he wrote in Toei's trash days.I have nothing to say much to the show  because i love the cast, and mostly the villians.My point was to prove that Kento can be giving good material to work on it when it's sourced and not original like Toei's Kamen Rider and Super Sentai being writen by morons weekly basics. to gain mentor wisdom is hard in a post deviant era that doesn't allow that.

Wish they could include other shinkansen such as the e4 max 0-300 series too but it’s fine. Kids love this in Japan and maybe adults too and I enjoyed the story more than bleach filler lol.  The battle scenes were cg but didn’t mind cause it fit in. I love the sound design too with the transformation scenes and it was pretty good. Simple story but the gimics and plot makes...shinkalion really good shinkalion really good']"

Tales of Phantasia The Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/391/Tales_of_Phantasia_The_Animation,"['Game adaptations are rapidly becoming a dime a dozen in anime and, surprisingly, the Tales franchise is leading the charge. Like all adaptations though, they can be a bit hit and miss and, in the case of some of them, heavily dependent on first hand knowledge of the game itself.Tales of Phantasia should be a prime example of this. Should be ...The story is basically the same as that of the game, barring a few minor differences of course. A band of heroes must defeat the evil sorcerer Dhaos, with much in the way of fantasy action shenanigans along the way.Surprisingly, the whole anime...actually works rather well as the plot doesn\'t really let up at any point, and because of this, watching Tales of Phantasia is more like watching a good action fantasy movie. In essence, the series is nothing more than an abridged retelling of the game\'s story, and while there are some minor differences, the essential points remain the same. The show doesn\'t really try to portray itself as anything that claims to have a degree of substance, and to be perfectly frank, this works far better than a faithful 13 or 26 episode adaptation.Like many adaptations though, Tales of Phantasia looks and sounds better than it actually is, however unlike most others, the difference here is marginal. The designs are taken from the game, again with some minor alterations, so there\'s no real creative skill involved there. Where the show does shine though, is with the smoothness and fluidity of the animation. There is a lot of action in Tales of Phantasia, and the animation level never really drops in speed or quality throughout the show.As for the sound, the music is either taken from, or inspired by, the game itself. Once again, the fact that this is an adaptation places certain creative restrictions, however the choreography is very good, especially during the more frenetic scenes. In addition to this, the acting is actually pretty decent throughout. Since the original game didn\'t really feature any voice acting, there was a certain amount of freedom in choosing the right actors for the roles. While the are some minor niggles here and there, the seiyuu are generally good in their portrayals of Cless, Mint, and the rest of the gang.To be honest, I wasn\'t at all sure I would enjoy this the first time around as I hadn\'t played the game at that point (I have done so now though), however I found that this didn\'t really stop me enjoying the show as long as I didn\'t try to treat it as anything more than a decent action fantasy. In that respect, it works surprisingly well as entertainment, in particular because there\'s usually something interesting going on in the show, one of the advantages of the abridged format.While I know that there are numerous people out there who will decry Tales of Phantasia for ""not having enough plot"" or ""not developing the characters"", I should point out that if one is watching a show in order to be entertained, then such things are not always necessary. In the case of this OVA for example, the length of the series prohibits any serious development, yet the fact that the whole tale has been compacted into an easily watched anime means that the story is accessible to a far greater audience than before.Tales of Phantasia is a rarity in game adaptations, not simply because it really is entertaining, but also because it\'s easy to watch (there\'s a difference you know). Like any game adaptation though, the creative limitations sometimes leave one wishing for something with more bite. actually works rather well as the plot doesn\'t really let up at any point, and because of this, watching Tales of Phantasia is more like watching a good action fantasy movie.

Like any game adaptation though, the creative limitations sometimes leave one wishing for something with more bite.', 'To start off, I\'m going to clear some misconceptions.This OVA, in my opinion, is heavily targeted towards the audience who have played the game. For a 4 episode anime, it clearly does not cover many significant aspects of the actual story, as you would expect. Many reviews, including external resources out of MAL, disregard this important matter and criticize and how lacking the anime is.For fans who have played the game, such as myself, it is an extra treat. Tales of Phantasia could easily be seen as one of the best Tales series out there, but you won\'t get the appreciation out of it...through the OVAs, but through the game.The animation is great, especially the battle scenes. The theme songs, especially the ending theme, ""Prayer"" by Masami Suzuki, really gives you a very emotional feel that will leave you feeling mixed emotions of sadness, hope, and tragedy; at least that is what I felt. I really love the song.As I have played the game, I know the actual story, and I truly appreciate this story and animation.Some people say that the characters are typical cliche fantasy characters, but these characters are, undoubtedly, very well presented. As you may have guessed, do not expect to see much character development; you get all of that in the game.So in summary, if you have played the game, I greatly suggest you watch it, but do not watch it for the story, as the OVA is very slightly different than the game itself. Watch it for a recap and to appreciate the characters coming to life as it is very well illustrated and it creates a truly memorable ""Tales"" experience.For those who haven\'t played the game, but still wish to watch it, go ahead. This animation has the qualities of a great anime, but being only 4 episodes long, the plot is greatly reduced, and is heavily ignored/criticized by people who have not played the game. It is truly a shame.I give the ratings I give only because I have played the game, which makes my rating biased. But I also believe it is because I watched this anime expecting it to be a recap and only to see the characters coming to life, not as a series.If you have the time, I suggest you play the game. The Super Nintendo (SNES) version you can find is the Japanese version of the game with unofficial translations, but the translations are cleverly done and quite enjoyable. The GBA version of the game is just horrible,voice acting especially, although the graphics may be a little better. I suggest the SNES if you do wish to play. Do not underestimate this game just because it is old.1) For fans of the game = Must-watch2) For people who have not played the game = Highly recommended to appreciate the animation, but not the plot, as it is rushed. through the OVAs, but through the game.The animation is great, especially the battle scenes.

Every single installment I\'ve played has been, at the very least, good. Not surprisingly, a lot of the Tales games have received anime adaptations. So, where should you start when looking at these adaptations? How about with the original Tales game, Phantasia.The story in the OVA is close to the story in the game. A demon lord named Dhaos is revived at the expense of two villages and two young people, Cress and Mint, are sent back in time to find two magic users to bring back to...their time and defeat him. If you\'ve played the game then you can probably spot some difference there. That\'s why I said ""close to"" rather than ""exactly like."" The OVA does leave some stuff out, mainly for the sake of time, it\'s only four episodes. For those of you who are curious about the OVA but aren\'t interested in playing the game, as little sense as that seems to make, I\'ll talk about how it stands on its own. It\'s a really fast paced adventure. The story is a lot of fun and they manage to get quite a bit of complexity into it. Really, there are two issues. The first is that the pace is hectic. There\'s a lot of story in the game and they fit as much of it into the OVA as they possibly can. The result is that things progress really quickly without much time for things to wind down or the action to fall. The other issue is that there are some scenes that only make sense if you\'ve played the game. Without that background they seem to be kind of pointless. Now, these are pretty minor problems for anyone who\'s played the game, but they could bother you if you haven\'t.Tales of Phantasia has some spectacular characters. The OVA keeps their personalities intact. It also fits in the most important aspects of their backstories. The only real exception is Suzu who barely plays a role in the OVA, showing up in only a few scenes. One thing that the OVA does do better than the game is fleshing out Dhaos\'s character. In the game his motivations are barely touched on and he comes off as being randomly evil for the evils until the very end. In the OVA they actually make him a really sympathetic character which makes the conflict much more three dimensional and interesting.The art is pretty good. They manage to copy the monsters really well. The action scenes are exciting and have a grand scale. It looks similar to the cut scene art in Lunar 2. My only real complaint is that the noses look bizarre. They\'re barely there in most scenes, although they occasionally become more pronounced for no apparent reason. It\'s a minor complaint but it bothered me.The voice acting is really well done. Kusao Takeshi does really well in the hero\'s role, almost like he\'s played a similar role before. Which he has,several years before Tales of Phantasia he played the role of Adol Christin in the Book of Ys OVA, I may get to those eventually. Kanai Mika, Inoue Kazuhiko and Itou Kentarou also do really well. Morikawa Toshiyuki is well suited as a villain. In fact, I think I\'ve heard him do it before in a different video game based anime. Admit it, you looked it up. The background music is really similar to what you might find in a game, appropriately enough, and the theme music is... not particularly memorable, sorry to say.The yuri factor is a 1/10. I\'ve always thought that Phantasia would be a better game with some yuri, not that it isn\'t awesome anyway, but the OVA did not change that.My final rating for Tales of Phantasia is an 8/10. This is a great anime, especially for fans of the Tales games. You will probably like it better if you\'re a fan of the game, but it\'s still enjoyable if you just like a good fantasy story.

Either way, give it a try.', ""Based on the video game by the same name, Tales of Phantasia follows the journey of Cless, Mint, Klarth, Chester, and Arche as they try to defeat the demon king Dhaos, who is bent on annihilating the human race.Like most anime series based on video games, Tales of Phantasia lacks many essential storyline elements, preventing it from living up to its initial potential. While the premise promises a grand, fantastical adventure, Tales' limitation to 4 episodes makes this impossible. The storyline is rushed and unless you've played the game you won't understand some scenes (why, for instance, is Fujibayashi suddenly in a fight to the...death with her own father to prevent him from entering Dhaos' castle?).The series' brevity further results in a lack of any substantial character development, and moments that should have some build-up are forced and unrealistic (Chester and Arche go from disliking each other to cuddling up close after a 5 second apology). The story itself lacks depth and is cliche, and it may become hard to watch even all 4 episodes when there is nothing suspenseful or shocking.Weak storyline notwithstanding, Tales has exceptionally clear, attractive animation and lots of cool magic spells. Characters and scenery are sufficiently detailed but nothing special, and character designs are original. Both the Japanese and English voice casts are superb: in particular, Cless (in English) is voiced by the extremely popular Johnny Yong Bosch (see Ichigo in Bleach, Lelouch in Code Geass, and Kiba in Wolf's Rain). The OST is nothing spectacular but it gets the job done and sounds professional enough. Overall, aesthetic and audial elements make Tales of Phantasia a well presented package, but the storyline plays out too much like the video game on which it's based and cuts too many corners to be anything special.Animation: 7.8/10Audio: 7.4/10Storyline: 6.3/10Overall Score: 6.7/10 (Good)Find snapshots and downloadable episodes at my blog, http://animefiend.blogspot.com death with her own father to prevent him from entering Dhaos' castle?).The series' brevity further results in a lack of any substantial character development, and moments that should have some build-up are forced and unrealistic (Chester and Arche go from disliking each other to cuddling up close after a 5 second apology).

Overall, aesthetic and audial elements make Tales of Phantasia a well presented package, but the storyline plays out too much like the video game on which it's based and cuts too many corners to be anything special.Animation: 7.8/10Audio: 7.4/10Storyline: 6.3/10Overall Score: 6.7/10 (Good)Find snapshots and downloadable episodes at my blog, http://animefiend.blogspot.com"", ""Tales of Phantasia is a great game and the first of the series to be created.

The animation skips ALOT of things and it just makes you wish you were playing the game rather then wacthing this anime.Now you see where I'm going with this.

Tenshi ni Narumon!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/605/Tenshi_ni_Narumon,"[""Tenshi ni Narumon! is an anime series that doesn't really seem to know what it wants to be. It starts off with the premise of a clich&eacute;d shounen romance, (boy meets girl in a perverted way, she falls in love with him even though he is interested in another girl) but quickly falls into bizarre, almost childish humor (girl's family is essentially the anime version of The Munsters; an odd villain sends even odder minions [think giant darumas, toy houses, and rice cookers] to capture girl). The series also incorporates serious character drama, families being torn apart and pulled back together, and yaoi. Oh, and...the main character, Noelle, wants to be an angel.Yeah, it's all over the place. But oddly enough, it works rather well. The comedic episodes are funny, if only in a stupid way. The romantic aspects are well thought out, and the love triangle's resolution feels amazingly natural. When the serious plot comes in halfway through the series, it begins by being intriguing and only gets better until the end. Without spoiling too much, I&rsquo;ll say that it&rsquo;s all about identity &ndash; what does it mean to be an angel, to be a family, to do the right thing? In all honesty, the only complaint that I can raise about the plot is that many questions are left unanswered, questions that could have been addressed if the plotline had come more into play earlier in the series. Still, Tenshi ni Narumon! is a story of ambition and losses, and the ride is amazing.Tenshi ni Narumon! was animated via cells, but is still rather recent and, frankly, it's gorgeous. The character designs are a bit unusual, but fit the comedic nature of the show nicely; the way emotions come across on characters&rsquo; faces is especially impressive. Best of all, the color pallet used is vibrant and generally looks great, while darker scenes have their own sort of life. One warning, though: half of the series was released on region one DVD... the other half isn't. Unless you speak Japanese, the only way to watch episodes 14 through 26 is via VHS-rip fansubs. Even in super-low-quality, the show looks nice, but if you need your anime to be in DVD-quality, you'll want to avoid this show. Otherwise, though, it&rsquo;s a pleasure to look at.The music of this series is great from start to finish. &ldquo;Datte Daisuke,&rdquo; the opening theme song, is lively and peppy, starting every episode with a positive spin. It&rsquo;s one of those songs that can really perk up your mood no matter how you feel. The closing, &ldquo;Ai wa Umi&rdquo; is the complete opposite: slow and a bit sad yet hopeful; it&rsquo;s very pleasant to listen to. The BGM is also a pleasure to listen to and matches the series perfectly, and while it doesn&rsquo;t stand out much it really enhances many of the series&rsquo; scenes. The voice acting is overall very good, and the dub is surprisingly excellent, considering it&rsquo;s relatively old.Really, though, the part of Tenshi ni Narumon! that stands out the very most is the characters. The heroine, Noelle, is your standard annoyingly cheerful character, and your enjoyment of the series may depend partially on how much you like her; I personally find her to be cute most of the time. At the very least, she keeps the show&rsquo;s mood always optimistic. Her love interest, Yuusuke, is another character that&rsquo;s a bit of a stock personality, as a fairly typical wimpy harem lead. While he may not be very interesting, the rest of the characters certainly make up for it. Noelle&rsquo;s family, in particular, may be eccentric but they&rsquo;re all have very distinct personalities and are really very lovable; when their status as a family is eventually threatened you really want them to be able to stick together. Even more interesting are Michael and Raphael, the two men that quickly become Noelle&rsquo;s friends and teachers, and the many villains of the series. One character who eventually becomes the main obstacle is especially deep, and it&rsquo;s really interesting just to think about events from her point of view. It&rsquo;s a big cast, that&rsquo;s for sure, but one bursting with personality.In the end, though, Tenshi ni Narumon! is just plain fun. It&rsquo;s completely stupid at times, but in the way that you can&rsquo;t help but laugh at. And when the fun is done, there&rsquo;s a lot of really deep stuff hiding underneath. Don&rsquo;t give up on the series after watching just a few episodes; stick to it until the end and maybe you&rsquo;ll see why it&rsquo;s one of my favorite anime series ever. the main character, Noelle, wants to be an angel.Yeah, it's all over the place.

A typical romance comedy anime about ""girl meets boy"" and that is what you get, a cute MC who wants to become an angel for her beloved mixed with love triangles, shenanigans, flamboyant villains getting in the way. That\'s what it seems like really.It\'s not that. Tenshi ni Narumon! is an Utena-type anime. Without spoilers it\'s hard to explain, but it\'s not what you expect. It turns physiological very fast thanks to characters who aren\'t the protagonist, Noelle. It reuses...scenes which could be a product of a tight budget but it works somehow.Of course the anime isn\'t perfect and leaves much to be desired, unanswered questions and motives, etc. But it does excel in its strange way since it answers the question: Who wants to become an angel? Since the start you believe Noelle is the girl who wants to become an angel, she spends the first episodes doing everything possible to do it. But the twist comes when it isn\'t her. Or it is her but just a part of her.The twist comes from the fact that ""I\'m gonna be an angel!"" is not referring to Noelle, but to her mentor, a character who only appears in the last seconds of the anime. Mikael is the true star of the show and it\'s present in how he changes in Episode 13 upwards when his lover and mentor, Raphael visits him. Mikael was a boy always seen smiling and calm who wants to help Noelle become an angel. Boy, does he change. He turns out to do anything to want to be angel, and the only thing he can do to become one is force Noelle even when she wants to stop trying for fear of hurting her family. The best aspects of the show truly come with the interactions between Mikael and Rapahel and Eros and Silky. While Noelle is happy, her other parts of the angel soul are sad, crazed and desperate. Mikael would do anything to become an angel, and Silky would do anything to not become one. It seems the only one who didn\'t know they were all part of the same soul was Noelle.There are many characters that seem like comedy relief (Noelle\'s family) and including the most prevalent villain: Muse. Of course, your enjoyment of the show depends if you are fine with this characters, I was because they are exactly what makes this anime special, the characters. If you\'ve watched Utena you know that there is a certain character who seems to be only there for strange comedy relief and to be a ""villain who always fails"" and Tenshi ni Narumon! is no different.Still, the ending was disappointing. Huge build up only to find Silky disappears without a trace and everything is perfect and good. Many unanswered questions but then again, this was an anime made for enjoyment and not to over analyze. Though I would love to over analyze the complicated character of Mikael.This anime is about family, about being careful of what you wish for, of love in all its forms, of selfish desires that could hurt other people, what it means to be an ""angel"".It\'s a very cute, fun, entertaining but also strangely dark, physiological anime that deals with a variety of themes in each episode.

Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road,https://myanimelist.net/anime/47162/Shokei_Shoujo_no_Virgin_Road,"['Every season fans complain about getting the same generic isekai tropes over and over again. We finally get a show that breaks that mold and unfortunately still went under the radar because of not having an OP self insert male character and having a yuri ship.Shokei shoujo, is actually one of the most unique isekai we’ve seen in recent memory. No overpowered MC, no harem, none of the usual cliches that cause people to write isekai off as all the same. Instead, you get two strong, independent female protags along with a really interesting world, cool magic concepts and some legit scary bad guys....I really don’t know how this would have been a negative unless you A) didn’t read the synopsis of the show going into it or B) Wanted the same generic tropes that you complain about every season.For me, I will always prefer a female protagonist especially in fantasy stories as they tend to be better written, actually capable of holding their own on their own merits and generally apart of better stories as there’s not a reliance on fan service or high school level jokes to enhance their character.Story wise, Shokei Shoujo is peak isekai. The whole concept of Menou having to find a way to kill Akari while clearly gradually developing feelings for her is something I haven’t seen before. The characters are all unique and bring their own personalities to enhance the story, the world is very much alive and the lore of the universe is really well written. So many directions that this story can go in and as someone who just started reading the books, I can’t wait to find out.Pacing is solid, animation is solid, voice acting is great and I have a particular love for the colour palette as well as eyes in this series. Everything is so bright and I love that in an anime. The show also has what is without a doubt for me, the OP of the season. A really beautiful bop from Mili.Shokei shoujo was the show I looked most forward to every week, I fell in love with these characters and this world and generally had an awesome time watching. On to the LN’s. Shokei Shoujo gets 10 out of 10.

The art style is good and was enjoyable, it mixes a fantasy setting with semi modern influences in its world design.The sound design was alright, not anything particularly too special about it aside from a decent sound track.None of the characters are enjoyable enough to care for.

We’ll see about it. This review has spoilers mostly in the character section.The story seems your run-of-the-mil isekai series showing a male that is transported to another world, finding a cute girl and having an OP power, however that quickly changes showing us who the true MC is, and that one is the girl that we saw, Menou. We follow her in her travel to kill another girl named Akari, she...also comes from another world but her powers make her very difficult to kill forcing Menou to find a way to kill her.The series has some pretty good world building, the world in which the series occurs gets explored in multiple ways we are told the past and how the culture got to the point it is like why they all talk in Japanese, the reasons why they treat people from other world in the way they do, explanations of the locations they are in which helps in not everything looking the same. We get more than a superficial part of the world explained and there is even more that the anime didn’t get to cover.The animation is actually pretty good, JC Staff really put effort into this, there are multiple fight scenes which look really good, especially the ones from episode 10 and beyond. The animation and art are pretty consistent through the show, the only nitpick I could make is that in episode 8 there were some reused frames, however even there it still looked nice outside of that, and the purpose of those frames was mostly comedic so not much is lost in there.About the adaptation, it is actually a pretty faithful adaptation which makes sense since they were adapting only 2 volumes, some minor stuff and here were omitted. The only problem with things omitted is Momo’s backstory, it made her power look like it came almost out of nowhere for not having much information on it in the anime. Despite that, there is also something I liked about the added scenes, some of them give some more character interaction, however a scene in episode 7 where Manon is with the little girl and takes her to the Iron Maiden wasn’t there originally, it was a really good idea to add that scene to make a bigger surprise in a future episode than how it was in the novels.With the characters we have our protagonist, Menou, unlike most isekais the MC of the series is actually a girl from the world that isn’t Japan, she is pretty calm, she has a determination to kill Lost Ones after her town got destroyed and spending a lot of time her her teacher Flare, she tries her best to kill them for no one else to have to commit those actions she does, despite that she is still has a warm side to her like even after killing Mitsuki she is still buried him, and actually we get to see with Momo how she can treat other people nicely outside of her work. As she travels with Akari she gets to open herself to her and start caring for her, she protects Akari from outsiders at any cost and feels bad for having to kill her but it is still something she has to do to protect her world, it is a self-character conflict that she has that mainly drives the story. Akari is actually an interesting one, we first see her as a very happy person that is suddenly very attracted to Menou despite just meeting her, as if it was fate that connected them, she can be bothersome in some stuff since she is always excited about stuff and is always drooling over Menou, however in episode 6 everything makes sense, we get to see that the usual Akari we see is not her actual personality and that she has traveled multiple times to try to save Menou, the Akari with memories is far more collected than the normal one although still somewhat inexpert in some stuff, she comes off as much more normal than the other and it start to makes sense that the other Akari enjoys so much her time with Menou and the reason why she is so determined to get killed by her.  The interactions between Menou and Akari a lot of the time come from Akari being too excited over things or wanting to jump to what Menou is doing or calling her attention, it come with some funny moments, while it also can have some serious and nice moments about them, specially at their “dates” and in episode 6, stuff like that was pretty nice to see, their relationship actually seems more like a friendship.Momo is the one that probably come out the weakest of the characters, specially because of the omitted part of her past, the reason why she never stands anyone aside from Menou is because she is a misanthrope, her “senpai” is the most important thing in the world for her and that’s why she wants to make Akari disappear as fast as possible, she is always following Menou even if she cannot be at her side helping her to solve some of the stuff that she cannot do alone. Ashuna is an interesting kind of princess; she doesn’t behaves herself like a normal one since she is a warrior too. She has her own motives, that while we don’t see that much in the beginning we get a little grasp in her conversation with Momo in episode 5 when she talks about having a sister. The interactions between Ashuna and Momo are really fun, so the multiple times when they are together can be amusing. We get to see that Ashuna really cares about Momo even if Momo calls her names and tries to push her to the side.The opening is song is very good, a great work from Mili, I had to listen to add multiple times a day when it came out, the lyrics really fit with the series and the video tells you a lot of stuff that you would have some hard time guessing until you get there. The ending also is good, the song is nice and after a while I really started to like it, but the most important part to me is the video, I really like the video, it is artistic in the style and it makes you follow Akari understanding her travel.It’s actually funny how this show got under my radar until one day I found a meme about it after the first episode aired and got interested on it. So finally, Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road is a very good series with an interesting premise and it has many mysteries, that while some weren’t solved due to the anime adapting only 2 volumes it still manages to surprise and entertain. I’ll definitely be waiting for a second season of this great series.Thank you for reading. also comes from another world but her powers make her very difficult to kill forcing Menou to find a way to kill her.The series has some pretty good world building, the world in which the series occurs gets explored in multiple ways we are told the past and how the culture got to the point it is like why they all talk in Japanese, the reasons why they treat people from other world in the way they do, explanations of the locations they are in which helps in not everything looking the same.

Staff. Novelist Fujino Oomori\'s DanMachi is the label\'s acclaimed GA Bunko Grand Prix winner, the most recent up until today since its serialization in 2013. But that comes to a stop, for novelist Mato...Sato, together with illustrator Nilitsu, have created the next step of that evolution by creating this work that has earned its place as the proceeding GA Bunko Grand Prix winner in 2019, A FULL 6 YEARS where DanMachi has been claiming that title ever since its inception. And if you know anything about awards like these in Japan, they tend to be held in very high regard, and an anime adaptation is almost guaranteed when there\'s enough source material to go around. Come this season, courtesy of J.C. Staff (which doesn\'t miss when it comes to highly-prized works like these), Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road a.k.a The Executioner and Her Way of Life has finally bared its fangs towards the small screen, and to say that the experience was mind-blowing is just cutting it short of the overall feel of the source material.Isekai stories are a plentiful these days, so much so that this genre has already been awashed of the creativeness of many new authors trying to directly copy-paste other works that have been well established over the years, I\'d say more than a decade and a half since SAO\'s inception that truly gave Isekai the much maligned and cursed genre that its known today that\'s backed by immense, growing popularity with each passing year. But have you ever heard of an Isekai where the entire setting is basically a reverse-Isekai, plus themes and nuances added for effect? I know I have not, and Virgin Road basically opened my eyes to your stereotypical Isekai trope that\'s subverted in a much more deep and impactful way that\'s not just mere simple background glitches of illusion for shock value, and the magic itself is utilized in such a way that is a total breath of fresh air.The unimaginable power of Pure Concepts, and Isekai otherworlders called ""Lost Ones"" whom came from an alternate world known as Japan. These 2 ingredients make up the core premise of Virgin Road, where these Lost Ones would get Isekai-ed and build a new advanced civilization that brought forth Japanese influences into the fantasy world that prospered greatly. However, these Pure Concepts have a negating effect: with prolonged usage, the user will lose control of his/her powers, bringing disaster and calamity to the world, and this eventually gave rise to the fantasy world\'s legendary disasters, dubbed the Four Major Human Errors that resulted in the effect of these calamities: the Sword of Salt, which turned the whole Western continent into salt that is gradually melting into the sea; the Pandæmonium, a fog-like dead zone in the Southern archipelago where monsters regularly emerge from; the Mechanical Society, which controls the wild frontier in the East; and the Starhusk, which carved out the centre of the Northern continent and set it afloat. To prevent the disasters from raging another situation like these again, this causal effect has become the strictly forbidden taboo that\'s managed by the Faust (essentially the Church of the fantasy world), spawning Executioners that wield magical powers known as Ether and setting out to assassinate any Isekai otherworlders ""Lost Ones"" are still being summoned to this very day for fear of their uncontrolled powers. This is essentially Virgin Road\'s logical extension-cum-exaggerated approach to the Isekai genre, which other than coming off as a one-off shitpost, it\'s worldbuilding at its best and most finest.And the story goes of one such Executioner by the name of Menou: a young priestess who specializes in hunting down and assassinating Lost Ones before they can become liable threats, being fully aware that they are innocents who have done nothing wrong, but her Executioner training dictating that they cannot be allowed to live, as their Pure Concepts will ultimately corrupt them if they\'re kept alive for long periods of time. And her task has led to this otherworlder by the name of Akari Tokito: a Lost One with the Pure Concept of Time, summoned by the Grisarika Kingdom\'s King Grisarika of the noble class, Noblesse. Just like other people who\'ve been summoned from Japan, Akari is dumbfounded of her newly-known power, but isn\'t given enough time to experiment on her power because of Executioners like Menou having been trained to kill them within the first sighting of getting to know them, then to slowly invoke the assassination with none the wiser, no words questioned. But when Akari\'s Pure Concept of Time essentially reverses the ability to be physically assassinated, Menou fears for the worst, and has to find another way in order to be able to kill her, which Akari gladly agreed to, and thus, the duos\'s journey starts leaping through places and people to find an ideal place to commit the assassination, with both parties (Menou indefinitely, Akari definitely) conceding to the act.Viewing this entire scenario through Menou at first glance, nothing seems out of the ordinary: a knife-wielding magecraft with full mastery of her ether. That\'s until you get to see the nuance of how she thinks and acts through every situation: she\'s groomed from young to be an Executioner because of what she has faced in her past. Remember the Sword of Salt incident that arose from the Lost Ones\' Pure Concept powers bellowing out of control? Menou is a survivor of the harrowing incident, which left her soul ""bleached"" birthed that became the trauma to form the emotionless husk of a child ridden of her family, with no dream left to live by for a suicidal life. This trauma was relieved by none other than the legendary priestess by the name of Flare, known for her incredible skill in magecraft, as well as being the well-known top Executioner responsible for the assassinations of Lost Ones. Having seen the devastation of a lone child wandering across the vast space of a situation that Menou herself could\'ve not overcome, Flare took her in as her apprentice, and Menou even called herself as Flare\'s ""Flarette"", her successor in the current day and age where Flare is nowhere to be found. So think of Menou as like Nana Hiiragi from Talentless Nana, though pulling this gambit off is what essentially kicks off the show proper.The other question now raises to the Yuri aspect of the show, since Mato Sato\'s work is basically labelled as a Yuri (a.k.a girls\' love) work through and through. Raising the bar first to the Lost One Akari Tokito, it\'s pretty much self-explanatory of her power with the Pure Concept of Time, and if you stripping the power aspect away, Akari is initially portrayed as rather clumsy and air-headed, but also kind and trusting, that lead her to easily trust Menou upon their first meeting as she believed that their encounter was fate. In retrospect, Akari has already used her power to invoke the Regression of Time, saving Menou from countless death instances, which circumstances that their meeting in the fantasy world purely comes down to fate and not the first as we\'re initially led to believe on the surface level. But remember when I said that the more that the user uses his/her own Pure Concept, he/she will lose control of their powers? This is exactly what happened to Akari, and in this case, resulted in the loss of her memories every time she regresses and leaving traces of deja vu for nothing more than just a passing resemblance for mystery. But, you can\'t mistake that other than fate, and to even anticipate the killing moment, it may sound insane from Akari\'s POV, but her character shows that her love and attachment to Menou is genuine, and this may be the first time that I\'m hearing this that\'s similar to the ever-so-popular Christian jargon of ""dying to self"" for others\' gain.The next literate pink-haired Nana Hiiragi feel-alike is Momo, another Executioner priestess and Menou\'s personal aide to assist on missions ranging from reconnaissance to providing support in battles, wielding a wire saw as her weapon. Many may question the significance of the Yuri-ness from Momo to Menou, and this is supported by the fact that both were childhood friends, and the crush that sparked out of it from the hair ribbons that Menou gave to her. Yes, it may sound insignificant that something like a hair ribbon is all it takes for a hot-bodied love affection, but to Momo, this is all that she had of her memories with Menou, and I can definitely understand that this connection creates the reassurance that Menou will always be with her, even when they\'re physically apart. That, with Akari\'s inclusion in Menou\'s life, Momo\'s jealousy reaches far beyond the levels of the earth so much so to always grumble with Menou, that the latter always appreciates her presence, knowing fully well of the awfully close attachment. But just like a well-hidden enclosure of a yandere, Momo is a force to be reckoned with if she is unleashed of her powers, that love translates to a massive power draw that\'s equivalent to death unhinged, and you DO NOT want to anger this well-endowed girl, but pet her like an overly attached pet to calm her tits down.The other characters do make their appearances and create their own diversions based on their characteristics, from the likes of the Grisarika Kingdom\'s warrior princess Ashuna Grisarika whom disregards her position as a princess to look for worthy opponents for battle, to yet another Lost One: Manon Libelle leading a liberated social class all in the disguise that in private, she is but only one of the four main antagonists in the overall story (that\'s covered in the anime so far). Adding the Church aspect of the Faust and Noblesse being at loggerheads with one another, and you have character and worldbuilding that\'s larger than life as the series grows to expose more infodump that is cohesive and doesn\'t feel like it\'s a waste of time. It\'s very good and worthy of the Grand Prix position that it won by its inherent strength of making everything connected, that not one single instance is a throwaway feature just for show.Unsurprisingly, for such a valuable work like this, I\'d thought that J.C. Staff would penchant the DanMachi staff team to work on this since this unironically links to a high-quality production given its stature, but since we already know at this point that DanMachi would come back next season, an entirely new staff team must be helmed for this stop-gap show of sorts. And for the notables, bringing in Isekai Bookworm assistant director Yoshiki Kawasaki for his directorial debut, veteran series composer Shougo Yasukawa, Hataraku Saibou a.k.a Cells at Work! chief animation director and character designer Keiko Tamaki, it already sounds like there is a seasoned crew of people whom regardless if they knew the extent of the LN\'s status, would still produce the finest quality that matches the exuberance of the source material in its grandiose. Some nice scenes, especially the high-octane action battles that are a sight to behold, while making this a wholly J.C. Staff work that\'s definitely the quality that we\'ve come to know of the studio in shows (especially DanMachi), and this doesn\'t feel like the cheapness of other average shows that has recently been produced to mixed fanfare.On the musical side, Mili\'s ""Paper Bouquet"" for the OP, other than the fact that it is sung entirely in English (which you can easily find the lyrics in Spotify), it is an excellent OP that embraces its visual spectacle, but I can\'t help that feeling that it doesn\'t sound as good as say, Goblin Slayer\'s ridonclous gore-rape fest of an OP that I still remember to this very day. It has the Mili ""Seal of Quality"" that\'s for sure that some people can appreciate, but I just find the song to be decent at best. On the other hand, I freaking love ChouCho\'s songs with the rawness of her vocal range that is precedent in 2017\'s ""Imouto sae Ireba Ii."" and 2020\'s ""Majo no Tabitabi"", and of the 2 ending songs sung this season (this one and the Maou Gakuin-inspired shitfest that is Murabito A), ""Touka Serenade"" is the next acclimation of ChouCho\'s angelic voice, paired with the dignified visuals that are just shades of artistic symbolisms placed between Menou and Akari\'s relationship. No doubt that in my mind, this ED is low-key certainly one of the best of the season in both music and visuals combined.We should come to a consensus: since Japan has countless manga and novel awards like the Dengeki Novel Prize and GA Bunko Grand Prix, these works MUST be adapted into anime, and we SHOULD watch more of them to know of their individual acclaims in the Land of the Rising Sun. The only problem is that people like to profit off of no-name, average people pumping out average works just for quick bucks of cash cows, and this is the rare instance of getting works that have already won prestigious awards that\'s so great, in the same rhetoric that anime will spike up more sales of the source material. Hopefully this proves to be so, and if there is a Season 2 of this, I will gladly watch more of Virgin Road, because this is the lost art of creative and bold storytelling that so many new wannabe authors nowadays just miss the mark, or barely hung on to tried-and-true methods to try being different, when in actuality, they\'re one and the same.Watch Virgin Road, it\'s a show where your virginity will not be lost in this journey for a compelling experience.

Depending how well it hooks you, will be the bigger story.Story and characters: 7With a twist such as that, and details within, it makes it for a more interesting story then if it was a generic run of mill isekai. Thankfully its not. As with the sense of mystery and excitement the show offers with its complex story, will be enough to drive it...home. Laying the ground work from the start, and make you curious upon whats up coming. This is what a good story can do you.Focusing on the idea that those brought from another world aka Japan, will bring nothing but chaos, so its best to rid them. But what also backs the interest in this story up, is the line of cast members.From the first few moments, you're already hooked on their backgrounds, and story more and more.

It can be bright, it can be grim. It really does look spectacular in parts. Which really should be given more credit honestly. I'm always grateful, when shows do take the effort to look not only good, but stylish in parts. Well done there. Coming with that though, is the good sound effects and being fit for purpose in scenes, to really add to any tension that comes ahead as it progresses along. If you don't believe me, just take a look of how episode 3 goes along within it's early mid part.

Give it a go.,"", 'Idk why, but I think a lot of people (or at least people in the website I watch anime from) judges this just because it\'s not your typical OP mc isekai with harem anime.So I\'ll give you a warning now, if you expect a over-powered mc with harem and fanservice, then this anime is not for you. There\'s barely male characters here, and from what I\'ve seen so far, I think this will be a GL anime. So if you like this genre, then you mostly won\'t be disappointed.There will be a little bit of spoiler in this review, cuz I do want...to rant (and explain) over some things. You can skip to the end if you don\'t want to get spoiled.So where do I start?First thing first, I want to address the main problem people have with this anime: The mc and the first episode.The first episode consist of a young male that get summoned in another world by the king of that land. Seems very typical am I right? Then he met a girl (our mc, Menou) and was basically introduced into the world. Menou is a priestess, and long story short, Menou later brings Mitsuki into the church. There, Mitsuki discovered his power - a nullifying power. Basically the ability to nulls anything (similar to Gojo\'s hollow purple). But then Menou kills him.This what angers a lot of viewers, and they began to jump into conclusions. Somehow it\'s comedic to see that some of them still proceed to give the same comments in the next episodes (2 and 3).""So basically our \'mc\' loves to kill innocent people without thinking of another way. I want our real mc back.""I think mans turns off his brain after the scene where Menou kills ""the mc"". Because it\'s all explained in the (literally) next scene (in the same episode). So Menou here, is a ""priestess"". These priestess ain\'t actual priestesses. Safe to say that they are hunters, and have magic powers that revolves around priest and church powers. They hunts other world wanderers called the  ""Lost Ones"", or people that comes from the other world. Apparently, people from our world has been isekai\'d to theirs for a long time now, to the point where these people have adopts Japanese people language and little of their culture (yes Japanese only because the people who has been isekai\'d are only from Japan).And these innocent people is isekai\'d because of the king that summons them. Why? Because people from our world have this power called ""Pure Concept"". And this ""Pure Concept"" is a very strong power only the lost ones have (and every single individual power is different), thus why the nobles and the king want this power. But the lost ones have only cause trouble in their world. Not because that they are evil, but because of their own power, the pure concept messed with their mind. And this is inevitable, meaning that the longer the lost ones are left alive in that world, the more the pure concepts will mess their head. And so far, these lost ones have cause nothing but disasters. These are the  four known biggest disasters/genocide (taken from wiki):- Sword of Salt, which turned the whole western continent into salt which melted in the sea- The Pandemonium, which covers the southern archipelago- The Mechanical Society, which controls the Wild Frontier in the east- The Starhusk, which carved out the center of the northern continent and set it afloat.These disasters are called ""human errors"".Mind you, these disasters still impact their world after thousands of years. Our mc Menou also is a victim of these disaster that destroy her village, leaving her as the lone survivor (I forgot the name of the event, but basically the whole village is covered in ice). So you see, the lost ones will inevitably get corrupted by the pure concept powers. And I doubt that the church (and the executioners) haven\'t try to find another way rather than kill the innocents. But seeing that they only brings disasters, they could not risk their own world anymore. Mind you, the four major disasters that lost ones bring aren\'t the only one.

Btw, I want to add something about Menou, another thing people complains.Menou knows well that these lost ones are innocents, victims actually. They\'ve done nothing wrong. They are summoned into another world, then got their mind corrupted (inevitably) by a power they just introduced to. Menou is not happy with killing (obvi), but someone has to dirty their hand in order to save others, not wanting her past repeated into another individual.So yeah, I don\'t intend to actually make an explanation like this, but that pretty much explain most of the complains these people have, and can be an explanation for future viewers.

I won\'t be explaining much in order to not spoil it, but this anime has a lot of things going on.There is a hint of ""mystery"" in this anime. So Menou, a girl from the other world, has been getting dreams (?) of our world. While Akari, a girl from our world that got isekai\'d to the other world, also got dreams of the other world before getting transported. So the basic premise of the story is really interesting and have a lot of potential. I haven\'t read the light novel, but if they give a decent explanation for the two world connection, show the world politics (which is very crucial as that is the main enemy), and giving the mc a development, then no doubt this will be one of the best and most unique isekai anime I\'ve watched.----------------------------------------Ratings:(I will using normal anime standard instead of isekai standard)- Animation: 7.5/10- Fight scenes: 7.3/10 (decent enough)- Character: 6.9/10 (heavy potential)- Basic story foundation: 8/10- Overall (so far): 7.4/10Isekai standard:- Animation: 7.5/10- Fight scenes: 7.5/10- Character: 7/10- Basic story foundation: 9.5/10- Overral: 8/10Total: 8/10Is this a must see?

I have a lot of hope for this, I really hope it does not disappoint me. to rant (and explain) over some things. You can skip to the end if you don\'t want to get spoiled.So where do I start?First thing first, I want to address the main problem people have with this anime: The mc and the first episode.The first episode consist of a young male that get summoned in another world by the king of that land. Seems very typical am I right? Then he met a girl (our mc, Menou) and was basically introduced into the world. Menou is a priestess, and long story short, Menou later brings Mitsuki into the church. There, Mitsuki discovered his power - a nullifying power. Basically the ability to nulls anything (similar to Gojo\'s hollow purple). But then Menou kills him.This what angers a lot of viewers, and they began to jump into conclusions. Somehow it\'s comedic to see that some of them still proceed to give the same comments in the next episodes (2 and 3).""So basically our \'mc\' loves to kill innocent people without thinking of another way. I want our real mc back.""I think mans turns off his brain after the scene where Menou kills ""the mc"". Because it\'s all explained in the (literally) next scene (in the same episode). So Menou here, is a ""priestess"". These priestess ain\'t actual priestesses. Safe to say that they are hunters, and have magic powers that revolves around priest and church powers. They hunts other world wanderers called the  ""Lost Ones"", or people that comes from the other world. Apparently, people from our world has been isekai\'d to theirs for a long time now, to the point where these people have adopts Japanese people language and little of their culture (yes Japanese only because the people who has been isekai\'d are only from Japan).And these innocent people is isekai\'d because of the king that summons them. Why? Because people from our world have this power called ""Pure Concept"". And this ""Pure Concept"" is a very strong power only the lost ones have (and every single individual power is different), thus why the nobles and the king want this power. But the lost ones have only cause trouble in their world. Not because that they are evil, but because of their own power, the pure concept messed with their mind. And this is inevitable, meaning that the longer the lost ones are left alive in that world, the more the pure concepts will mess their head. And so far, these lost ones have cause nothing but disasters. These are the  four known biggest disasters/genocide (taken from wiki):- Sword of Salt, which turned the whole western continent into salt which melted in the sea- The Pandemonium, which covers the southern archipelago- The Mechanical Society, which controls the Wild Frontier in the east- The Starhusk, which carved out the center of the northern continent and set it afloat.These disasters are called ""human errors"".Mind you, these disasters still impact their world after thousands of years. Our mc Menou also is a victim of these disaster that destroy her village, leaving her as the lone survivor (I forgot the name of the event, but basically the whole village is covered in ice). So you see, the lost ones will inevitably get corrupted by the pure concept powers. And I doubt that the church (and the executioners) haven\'t try to find another way rather than kill the innocents. But seeing that they only brings disasters, they could not risk their own world anymore. Mind you, the four major disasters that lost ones bring aren\'t the only one. They are the biggest, most impactful, but from Menou\'s past, we know that there has been more ""small"" (by small I mean destroying an entire village) disasters happening.And yeah, that\'s it I guess.

Tried 2nd and 3rd episodes to see where it is headed but I don't feel any interest.In short, I hated it.The animation is nice, well put together.The characters are decent in terms of personality (Design is awesome). I don't hate the main character at all. I wouldn't mind having a female protagonist. But the story ruins it. The worst part for me is that it justifies murder. They kill innocent people...who were summoned without a choice, and justify it by saying its to protect the world. If you HAVE to kill some people then kill all those who are summoning these isekai people. One redeeming quality is that the character themselves accept they are evil and don't justify it.I felt that it tries too hard to deceive the viewer, deliver the unexpected and stand apart from other isekai. I was honestly baited and this feels like a clickbait with 'isekai' genre. When I watch an anime, I expect entertainment of some kind. This is definitely not for me so I am dropping this. who were summoned without a choice, and justify it by saying its to protect the world.

They have unique character development as the show goes on and some really interesting stories.The animation and art by JC Staff has been their best since Railgun season 3 but there are a few episodes with weak animation and art. The ost and both the Op and Ed song are amazing. This is among the new isekai of this season is the best and is going to be one of the best ones of the year too.Overall it is a 10/10 for me and if you are a person not watching this because of low score and Isekai then you are missing out on a great anime.

The flow of the plot was well-paced unlike any other LN-anime adaptation. The art and soundtrack was superb. It was as if I am watching a mainstream anime vibes types of art and soundtrack.

Every character has their own purpose and does not feel out of place like most side characters that were stowaway during the later part of the story of other animes.

Also, I like how they portray that the strength of a character relies on how the plot builds them and not because of some generic power of “friendship” or “talk-no-jutsu” or just by being unreasonably overpowered.

The world is also not your average medieval fantasy world but is rather a mishmash of both modern and ancient elements where both guns, trains and old style architecture persist .The magic system is also one of the more unique and complex ones ive seen, it consists of separate magic systems for the fantasy guys and the isekaied guys. It isn't your standard just shout the magic spell type of system but has a lot more thought put...into it. The worldbuilding is great but a tad too subtle for the casual viewer. The characters are also morally grey and talk like real humans. In the first 2 episodes they seem a bit tropey and I recommend you stick to 4 episodes where they flesh out a little bit, there is also a character which seems a bit annoying at first but gets better. A lot of the plot points are really subtle so it may not be for those who want to turn off their brains and not really think about the plot. Now to my main point, the sound design in this anime is fantastic, it may even be the best of the season. The animation is solid but not outstanding but it is good enough where it wont bother anyone.

While I have enjoyed a few in the past (Kono Suba and No Game No Life come to mind), I find many works in the genre to be little more than tacky wish fulfillment. Of particular note, in my opinion, are the characters who are overpowered simply because they\'re the main character, inexplicable harems, and being adored by the denizens of the new world the main character finds themselves in, it tends not to be something I particularly enjoy.Virgin Road takes these conventions and flips them on their head not for comedy, but for...drama. Every summoned individual - known in this story as a ""Lost One"" - has, by virtue of being transported to their world, an ability known as a Pure Concept. These Pure Concepts are incredibly powerful and as a result, incredibly dangerous. In addition to this, the more a Lost One uses their Pure Concept, the more they lose of their sanity, until eventually it goes out of control and causes a terrible catastrophe - something could potentially destroy the entire world.Thus, we have Menou - our main character, and a young woman who belongs to a class of executioners whose job it is to kill any and all Lost Ones before their powers have a chance to go berserk and cause damage to the world. She knows she\'s the ""villain"" of the story and laments that she is forced to kill these teenagers who were summoned against their will.And then she meets a Lost One that she cannot kill: a girl by the name of Akari. Akari\'s Pure Concept - that of Time - makes it impossible for her to be killed, as anything that would kill her is completely rewound. This makes her a ticking time bomb, as once her Pure Concept goes berserk, she could potentially cause repeats of the most horrific events in history (referred to as the Four Human Errors) or she could cause a disaster even worse than that.Menou knows that for the safety of the entire world, she must find a way to kill Akari. All the while, kind and gentle Akari is blissfully unaware that the girl she\'s trusting with her life is planning to kill her. Couple this with Menou\'s execution partner Momo (who is absolutely head over heels in love with Menou) showing great concern for Menou\'s wellbeing and loyalty to her, and you have a tragically dramatic show in the making.As far as animation quality goes, it\'s not the most visually impressive or unique show ever, but it looks good enough. Each character design is unique enough that I\'m confident I could tell them apart by silhouette alone, not to mention that they look good. Backgrounds are nicely detailed and pleasing to the eye, but they can be a little bit generic at times.Although I know absolutely nothing about the show beyond what is covered in the first four episodes, it has already become a favorite of mine and I\'m eager to see where the story of Menou and Akari goes. drama.

Please try to keep that in mind when reading.Sound: 9/10, great.The opening is great. Several singers. Good melodies. Stereo effect to tingle your ears in all places.The sound effects undeniably go above and beyond, just like in Jojo. There\'s a deep, rumbling layer to some of them.The voice acting, while not jaw-dropping, is nothing to be ashamed of. It\'s good.The background music could use some improvement. Not that there is anything wrong with them, it\'s just that I\'ve heard better. They\'re...good enough, but didn\'t help hype me up.Art: 9/10. Honestly, I initially rated sound and art 10/10 as there\'s nothing wrong with it but ultimately decided against it to separate it from the character and story, which both go above and beyond.Only in one episode can you see J.C. Staff (the studio) trying to save a little bit on the budget by reusing 2 or 3 animated shots.The CGI was used sparely. It was in only one episode that I can remember. And I\'m not even actually sure it was CGI in the first place. Anyway, it fit seemlessy.The character designs are gorgeous, the clothes and the hair are well animated.The fight scenes don\'t use any cheap trick, like hiding everything behind a cloud of smoke or only showing shockwaves because ""the characters move too fast for the human eye to see"" (you know what I\'m talking about if you\'ve seen Dragon Ball, for instance). Here, you actually see the characters and there\'s no freeze-frame either.Character: 10/10, outstanding and fully deserving of this perfect rating.An interesting choice for sure, the main cast is pretty much exclusively female. Personally, I liked it a lot! It was very refreshing! It makes for new or different interactions.Each character comes with their lot of background, mystery, strengths, weaknesses and quirkyness.Their psyche is explored as well. And it evolves.Their chemistry works wonderfully. It makes it easy to get attached to the cast. The characters\' actions aren\'t purposefully frustrating, nor involuntarily so either.Story: 10/10 and I couldn\'t possibly go any lower as there are too many reasons it\'s as good as it gets.As mentioned above, each character brings their lot of background and mystery. But not only that, the world itself also has a rich history. And this anime is not shy when it comes to giving away revelations.The powers of the characters are not bland. They are well thought out.

There is no forced diversion delaying the progression or anything of the sort that would drop the rating.It\'s surprisingly hard to guess who\'s the antagonist of any given arc!None of the factions at play are manichaean either!Enjoyment: 10/10.Earlier I mentioned the soundtracks weren\'t epic enough to elevate the hype. But it was well compensated by the art, the story and the characters. So in the end, even during the fights the hype was there. The anime did pump me up, just not at full potential.Outside of fighting, I\'m eager to learn more about the world and our characters! At the same time, the season gave me a satisfying ending.

It leads people to think it\'s a story about a girl who works as a church assassin who kills people who get Isekai\'d because they\'re a threat to their world which I mean they are don\'t get me wrong.  The reality...of the story is of two flawed girls walking down the path of tragedy if nothing changes.  One is going to lose something she doesn\'t realize she has yet and the other of a girl who just wants the other to be happy but knows what that means in the end.  The story so far has been more or less about the same as the novels and I thoroughly enjoy them.Art: I really enjoy the character designs for the characters.  I also like how they depict both the guiding force and pure concepts being activated with the text appearing above them/on their books.  This next part is a bit sad but telling in terms of other shows budgets...I appreciate the fact the bigger enemies are still 2D and not some runescape level of 3DCG.  Many shows in the isekai genre tend to just skimp out and do lazy 3DCG for the big enemies like dragons and demons, here they stick to having them be 2D.Characters: All feel like they were in the novels with an exception at least in my books for the most part.Menou has clearly gone through stuff as we see in Ep1 from a person who had their pure concept go out of control and clearly from what we\'ve seen has altered her in a way.  She wants to prevent things like that from happening to others so she becomes an assassin for the church and plays ""friendly"" with her targets who are of her age just to kill them.  She clearly feels bad for it even if it\'s something that must be done.The other characters have their own issues they\'re going through and in a messed up world where 4 past calamities have happened the world is in a warped spot that doesn\'t make it kind for them either.  The only one who seems relaxed about the world is Ashuna who even when her own family is implicated in a taboo she\'s just like ""their problem, not mine.""Overall very happy with the show so far and can\'t wait wait to see how they go about the 2nd arc.  Reading the other reviews in regards to the lower ones at least I can understand that they initially probably came for one thing but in the end got something else will end up poisoning the well to some people and not want to change their mind about it.  For those who are still a bit on the fence about the show I highly encourage you to continue to watch as it\'s where the story starts to really flesh out. of the story is of two flawed girls walking down the path of tragedy if nothing changes.

The only one who seems relaxed about the world is Ashuna who even when her own family is implicated in a taboo she\'s just like ""their problem, not mine.""Overall very happy with the show so far and can\'t wait wait to see how they go about the 2nd arc.  Reading the other reviews in regards to the lower ones at least I can understand that they initially probably came for one thing but in the end got something else will end up poisoning the well to some people and not want to change their mind about it.  For those who are still a bit on the fence about the show I highly encourage you to continue to watch as it\'s where the story starts to really flesh out.', ""An excellent show that's absolutely worth a watch especially if you enjoy the isekai genre but want a twist on it. It's definitely an underrated classic you shouldn't sleep on while it's still airing. I'm hooked & ready to watch more.To get more detailed the story has dark lows and bright highs that make it a delight to watch without being overbearing like some other drama. The art is excellent, especially in the later episodes where they really hammer home some great expressions.The opening by the band Mili is fantastic as always. Mili being probably most well-known in this space for the opening of Goblin...Slayer.With characters there was one character, Momo, that came across as overbearing at first, but she grew on me. Especially when she interacted with people other than our protagonist.If you don't mind some brutal deaths, blood and things like that I think this show is worth a watch.

Especially when she interacted with people other than our protagonist.If you don't mind some brutal deaths, blood and things like that I think this show is worth a watch."", 'Guys, guys, guys! I figured it out! I know what\'s wrong with this anime!If you\'re gonna tl;dr this review than please just know that Shokei Shoujo is a criminally underrated show on MAL because it missed its international audience target by a long shot and I don\'t mean just the first episode twist that everyone who bothers to know his isekai is aware of.Let me elaborate.This show comes in a season packed with quality content and in an almost post-post-isekai era. It can\'t create anything new in the concept, we already have had self-aware isekais for years. It can\'t compete with hype for Kaguya-sama...or SPYxFAMILY and it failed to capture hearts of most people invested in regular isekai genre. I mean, I rated it highly but I don\'t think it comes close to the likes of Re:Zero or Mushoku Tensei and there is abundance, A B U N D A N C E of mid-to-relatively-good shows in the genre. You may ask yourself than - why should I watch it? Who cares if just another guy got transported and struggles to be the hero (or one-shots everything in his way)? The answer lays in subversion of tropes. And before you say ""Ha! But it has been done a million of times already. Basically every isekai needs to come up with something new."" I will say ""Yes, yes of course. Who are you and why do you watch those shows?"". And I mean it. Ask yourself those two simple questions because if your answer is along the lines of ""because I enjoy seeing my unrealized fantasy in a cartoon form"" or ""I see myself as guy who starts with nothing but than BAM BAM PEW PEW latent (or developed) super powers and a harem"" than Shokei Shoujo is not for you.Hey look, it\'s even in the title. It says shoujo, doesn\'t it? Oh, so you might think because it was marketed as a yuri it may perhaps appeal to or target audience who likes to see relationships and love bloom between people of the same sex with all the emotional twists and turns? You\'re wrong. And if you came looking for this kind of action, this is not an anime for you. Although I have to admit, it\'s possibly the greatest shortcoming of the entire series - it fails to realistically capture female x female dynamics in any emotionally impactful way.Fanservice than? Maybe it has some  o t h e r  kind of rabu rabu action? Again, wrong. You will 100% see many more panty shots in horror/mystery series like Summertime Render airing at the same time. Shokei Shoujo (in my opinion) is not even close to ecchi. Again, not for you ;(Who is it for than? It\'s for you, dear daydreamer. You, the person who enjoys your properly established fantasy world with some thought being put into how power levels work. You, the viewer who prefers their anime with a seasoning of genre and trope awareness. You, the chuunibyou enjoyer of made-up class systems and magical explosions.But beware! If you also fall into previous ""not for you"" categories, Shokei Shoujo is going to be mid at best. I can\'t stress it enough. This show\'s Original Sin is invoking fantasies to literally kill them first chance it has. It is the core of the entire plot as well. It\'s about coming to terms with not wanting to erase your dreams but having to live in a world where you have to submit to killing them.So if you don\'t mind sitting through a show that has literally no self-insert material*, no emotional kick, little to no ecchi, but talks to your childish-yet-aware brain, be my guest. Watch it and you will be rewarded.On a sidenote, if you need more of a hook:+fights are not that predictive in terms of how they develop;+music, especially the OP by Mili, is great;+story is thought-through and centered around heavy world building;+usage of known tropes (talking to you, Re:Zero and time travelling shows) has a unique twist to it;+for once ""going home"" is the opposite of an end goal for characters;+the apparent MC is not Saitama overpowered and needs to find creative ways to deal with opponents far stronger than herself.Hope that now you are aware of how this show works and why people seem to rate it as they do. Give it a chance if you will. Maybe you\'re in the right headspace for the Executioner and her way of dealing with life.* MINOR SPOILERS. Shokei Shoujo deals hard blow to male-centered ego not only in the first episode where a typical sigma-to-alfa protagonist is killed of. It goes great lengths to show there are literally no males in this fantasy world of any significance.

Unable to take things seriously and acting like a jealous girlfriend is alright in a daily life anime, because like...yeah, people in real life do that for a bit, and it\'s fun, and it\'s cute, and it\'s enjoyable to exaggerate it.But a girl escaping from nobility acting annoying and pampered about a girl who she barely knows and to her knowledge...will never see again in the next few hours is UNFATHOMABLY unlikable. A girl who looks 12 being clingy and controlling and desperate for a crumb of senpai\'s attention isn\'t a good foil, because it\'s the exact same thing except she\'s younger and meaner. These characters the plot revolves around sound like a bad writer trying to convey toxic people with BPD instead of like, a cute romantic psuedo-love-triangle. Absolutely deranged.And that\'s the thing; serious, life-threatening events in this show happen yet these characters are not giving the world stakes, they\'re braindead love interests cuddling up to Menou, who is politely indulging them. The author doesn\'t seem to understand how to convey women having a relationship besides Bitches Be Shopping and random declarations of love. It\'s unbearably saccharine and shallow in a way that feels like it doesn\'t believe women are people.But it does. They may not have complex inner worlds, but they have interesting character motivations, compelling ways of presenting themselves in the world. It\'s just when they interact.Which leads me to assume that it doesn\'t believe lesbians are people.5/10 for individual components that lead to a trainwreck overall.

I wish for the end of all moe', 'Everything about Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road screams comically bad pseudo-deep isekai to me. An anime that aired last year even did the so-called first episode twist better. Yet, the overall reaction kept saying subversive thriller. It\'s like Re:Zero, if Re:Zero was cheaper, blander, and lacking any depth.The English title, The Executioner and Her Way of Life, refers to Menou, the female assassin protagonist, who speaks every line like she\'s a caricature of a lone wolf killer. Her introduction is agonizingly cliche: A mysterious organization recruits a child to assassinate superpowered teenagers. After witnessing the traumatizing impacts of their powers, she vows to prevent history...from repeating itself and becomes a ruthless murderer. Her goal is to murder teenagers who\'ve been mysteriously summoned into her fantasy world from modern-day Japan, known as ""Lost Ones."" The Lost Ones arrive with a random superpower called a ""pure concept"" that supposedly could lead to catastrophe if used in the wrong hands. The plot, such as it is, revolves around Menou\'s desperate efforts to find a way to kill Akari, a seemingly immortal Lost One with the pure concept of time, who she is convinced will be the downfall of humanity. Their chemistry is light-hearted, even though Menou hides the fact that she wants this girl dead. All the show has in terms of levity is their banter, mostly because Akari mistakes their companionship for mutual attraction. The rest of the show is pure edge, the painfully serious kind, not the trashy-fun kind.From the beginning, Menou is a mouthpiece to dump exposition on the unfortunate viewer. The writer arbitrarily added a generic character with the appearance of a standard male isekai hero, but only for her to spout world-building at him in the most unnatural way possible. Menou\'s role is to speak lines that insert what the writer wants the audience to think before being an actual character. She delivers these lines so seriously that it\'s funny. Everyone talks like this except for a few selective oddities.Menou develops gradually as she struggles to overcome her need to murder Lost Ones and reconcile with the assassin who conditioned her. The rare times she broke her serious persona to have banter with Akari was actually pleasant. Akari\'s tongue-in-cheek sense of humor plays off Menou\'s straight man act because the writers know how to place jokes appropriately. Akari flirts with Menou, vies for her affection, and asks to go on dates, usually for humor rather than a sincere relationship. The show is undoubtedly at its worst when it separates Menou and Akari.Although Akari comes off as a shallow comic relief character at first, developments in the show\'s second half add depth to her personality. After a few convoluted twists, you find more to her than meets the eyes. Ultimately, she is a shallow husk of a protagonist used as a plot device when needed, with little space to grow. The excitement of her time-reversal power wears off when you realize it was done exponentially better Steins;Gate. Even Re: Zero\'s first cour utilized its time travel mechanic much better. She is characterized by laughably melodramatic and overwrought flashbacks. You would have a more enjoyable time finding another anime to watch than piecing together her lore. This is an extension of the show\'s larger issue, mistaking poor storytelling with foreshadowing. Rather than hint at mysteries, they deliver the twist first and expect you to be impressed when they reveal the build-up. It\'s like telling a joke by saying the punchline first; you haven\'t achieved anything. You\'ve just made your story needlessly confusing.Menou\'s assassin companion, Momo, is a caricature of a psychotic lesbian—two words I despise putting beside one another. She is introduced with laser red eyes, only to speak as in a moe voice and motorboat Menou. Cute-but-unhinged archetypes like Momo are so played out in Executioner. After the third secretly evil moe character it’s clear the author either ran out of ideas or has an obsession with the trope. For most of Momo’s screentime, she clings to Menou, hiding in the shadows to tie loose ends. Momo\'s rival, a rather unconvincing tough-as-nails swordswoman, gives her other things to do, thankfully.There are no thrills to the action unless you count gratuitous viscera for the sake of it entertaining. Blood, gore, children getting diced up, but there\'s no impact. It\'s all faux darkness to seem more mature than it is. The creators were seemingly trying to one-up other isekai anime labelled as ""mature"" with its outlandish blood and gore.I would be remiss if I did not mention the remarkable quality of the visuals and audio. In terms of J.C. Staff productions, it\'s comparable to One Punch Man\'s second season; frequently reused animation loops, low-detail character designs, and janky CGI monsters. Sakuga cuts are used sparingly, but admittedly the bombastic fight scenes look exhilarating when they try. However, the sound design is exceptionally bad. What little sound effects they include are pleasing, but it\'s as though their audio team ran out of time frequently. I especially loved how Menou could perfectly hear Momo talking outside of a moving train from the inside because they forgot to add wind or distortion. Visual effects such as the sparkling Ether dust, and the show\'s magic system, have no sound whatsoever. Part of what makes the final episode so anticlimactic is the janky CGI that undermines its attempts at grotesque body horror.For all of the exposition dumps, the show offers little explanation for the magic system and power scaling. They mention different tiers of assassins offhand but never show how that status affects their powers. Fighters wield giant swords made of light, launch explosions, and throw magic circles every which way. I\'d be lying if I said it didn\'t have exciting moments, but ultimately the fights are tensionless. Seconds before death, one of the heroes will inevitably reveal a cheap gimmick magic ability to save themself. It\'s repetitive, predictable, and never as shocking as the author intended. This might feel original if there weren\'t already a hundred violent isekai anime. Instead, it is derivative of the same story it\'s attempting to tell.The early 20th-century attire juxtaposed with modern technology sets the show apart from a production design standpoint. The Lost Ones influenced architecture, design, and technology powered by magic rather than electricity. Don\'t think too hard about it. Obviously, the writers didn\'t because the more you do, the less it makes sense. If you\'re interested in the people inhabiting the fantasy world… well, you\'d be better off reading the light novels because backstories, politics, and lore are sparse.Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road is so heavy-handed and awkward it comes across as a parody. It feels like you\'re watching the script\'s first draft because of how the story is told in such an ass-backwards way. There are some redeeming qualities, such as the relatively ambitious production and hints at queer romance. But, ultimately, they are overshadowed by a shitload of problems. The characters talk in cliches and tedious explanations instead of dialogue. It is so self-serious in the face of utterly idiotic writing that it leads to plenty of unintentionally funny scenes. All of the plot twists and gratuitous violence were the show\'s attempt to shock us. The shock factor is what the story was built upon, truly.

It's refreshing in the sense that the characters aren't obnoxiously objectified/sexualized while fighting. The plot alone doesn't keep me hungry for more even as an isekai. It isn't ground-breaking but it does set itself aside from most isekai's in that the other world is heavily influenced by our world's modern-day Japan. Regardless of its mild story, it is a decent watch. The characters aren't super dimensional, but the dynamics between the characters kept me invested enough. Each character is written with a typical troupe that can make the interactions feel emptier than...they should be. But if you like that then you'll enjoy it far more than me. The animation/art isn't iconic or forgettable; I did like it nonetheless. The protagonist is not perfect and frequently acknowledges it, leaving room to wonder what may happen and if their faith will waver. they should be.

It\'s a Yuri action romance, and a ""travel to another world"" type, (not reincarnation), Isekai.  And it has seriously good story. Be warned, I\'ve seen some people who gave it negative reviews that only watched the first 3 episodes. This has some major story twists after those episodes and towards the end of the first arc had me like, ""What?? Whah!"" You find out that this story goes a lot deeper...than you think it does. It\'s still airing so I wouldn\'t quite compare it to Madoka Magica, but lets just say if you\'ve seen Madoka Magica then you understand what I mean when I say it has some pretty interesting plot twists.

It really has nothing to do with the MC and a boy: in fact, there are no male main characters in this anime at all.  This is a straight-up Yuri action romance. The MC is an assassin who executes Japanese people who\'ve been summoned to her world. ""Why?"" do you ask? Well it turns out Japanese people summoned to their world, don\'t bind well with the magical energy of their world, making them so powerful that their magic can quickly get out of control and destroy the world. There have been several major calamities in the past and so our MC\'s job is to destroy them before that happens. There\'s a caste system in this world similar to Hinduism with the priests on top, and the warrior/leaders below them.

I must say when this anime caught my eye I thought it might just be normal seasonal isekai trash. But as you can tell it is not. It has an interesting story with an interesting concept. The idea of other Lost ones (which are people that got isekaid) having too much power to the point where if they use it too much there minds just get fucked and they wreak havoc and how their are executioners placed to kill them is something I find quite intriguing for the isekai genre. The first episode did made me say...¨WHAT THE FUCK MAN"" but after that episode it was a good watch. The animation is not great but good. The battle choreography was a bliss to look at as well. Characters are not that bad either. The conversation between them seems somewhat bland but hey, at least they got personality. I enjoyed this anime quite a bit, with its massive depth of a plot and I am hoping for a season 2.Overall: 8/10 ¨WHAT THE FUCK MAN"" but after that episode it was a good watch.

I enjoyed this anime quite a bit, with its massive depth of a plot and I am hoping for a season 2.Overall: 8/10', 'Everyone is praising the anime The Executioner and her way of life for a long time, but I have a differing opinion.First, a few aspects of the anime have already been featured in previous anime. For example, corrupt nobles are also in Akame ga Kill and Tales of Arise, Ashuna wears clothes that show lots of skin, the soundtrack is generic, and the Mechanical society, one of the Four Human Errors, is nothing but anime cliches and tropes, including a swimsuit episode.After all, the anime is an adaptation of the light novel that Mato Sato happens to be author of, but he also wrote stories...like Liar heroine and My Sister the Heroine and I the Villainess, both of them being more generic fantasy stories.The OP and ED are both good, the characters are good, and the story is the best, but a reviewer has to be aware of any underwhelming aspects of an anime, not just the good ones. like Liar heroine and My Sister the Heroine and I the Villainess, both of them being more generic fantasy stories.The OP and ED are both good, the characters are good, and the story is the best, but a reviewer has to be aware of any underwhelming aspects of an anime, not just the good ones.', 'The story of the series is great, being capable to include two creative ideas in the isekai genre: 1) A interesting ""another world"" setting with a ""sword and magic"" society mixed with ""our world"" culture and technology; 2) A story focused in the point of view of the people of the ""another world"".So much that the first episode has a surprise twist, where the main character position was ""switched"" from the typical summoned boy with cheat power to the ""another world"" assassin lady, Menou.From this point, the story follow Menou, a priestess with the task to kill the summoned people before they lose control of...their cheat powers (situation that already caused the destruction of continents in her world).And the main story is about the journey Menou is forced to go together with her next target, Akari, a summoned girl with a power which makes impossible to kill her. A journey with several twists, actions scenes and yuri (lesbian) subtext/romance.The production and art of this anime is top class. Some battle scenes are too short, but they are well placed in the story and have a good conduction.But another aspect around this series is the hate campaign against it, conducted mainly by people revolted with the first episode because they wanted another series with your typical boy with cheat power as main character, surrounded by his harem of beautiful girls at his foot.And the curious is that their frustrations can be easily cured by going to the several other series with their desired harem isekai trope (and some of them are actually good). As example, in the same season we have the 2nd series of ""The Rising of the Shield Hero"", where in the first episode we already have another beautiful girl begging to join the slave harem of the main character.However, these people make efforts to fill all the spaces in internet with dishonest critics with the lowest scores possible. An effort that is not viewed from the same people in several other genres or series that go against their desired trope.So, ""Shokei Shoujo no Ikirumichi"" can be viewed as a hidden gem, with a great story, art and production. But that could be elevated to the level of masterpiece by the polemic that the series created, revealing how some people can be petty by the most ridiculous reasons. their cheat powers (situation that already caused the destruction of continents in her world).And the main story is about the journey Menou is forced to go together with her next target, Akari, a summoned girl with a power which makes impossible to kill her.

On HiDive where I watch it it's currently sitting at 4.54/5 so just above a 9.This story is a bit like ReZero x Plastic Memories. If that sounds awesome to you, watch it.In my career I am very familiar with death. People that I know, that I care for die. I help them stay comfortable through the process and ensure that their families know they are well cared for. Sometimes it's hard.I consider Plastic Memories as a masterpiece, it's about a team professionally giving care to both people who are going to die and the people...they will leave behind. And it's also about bravely facing death with a full heart and no regrets.ReZero of course is likely more well known and is enjoyed for different reasons. The protagonist is going to try, die and repeat as many times as it takes to reach their happy ending. It also has this interesting fantasy world with some magic, some monsters, and some unbelievably powerful entities.So again, this is a very interesting mix of the two. The OP is awesome, it suggests the themes of the show. The music, sound effects and action are cool. The basics of the magic system are sort of explained for Akari's benefit but most of it is currently mysterious. The information about the lost ones, the power structures of the world and past events are explained well. There aren't long exposition dumps because Menou lives in this world and she is the main character, she already knows this stuff. While we are an outsider looking in, Menou kind of wants the other outsider, Akari to stay mostly in the dark.Menou's purpose is to kill Akari, not because she wants to, not because Akari deserves it, but because Akari and people like her are inherently dangerous. It's like having a disease that turns a person into a ticking time bomb. This is a world that has prospered because of people like Akari, but has also nearly been entirely wiped out by them multiple times. Not in something simple and evil like a war, but because these people could in any moment metaphorically (or literally) explode.She's a professional. It's a difficult, dangerous, physically and psychologically challenging and vastly underappreciated job and she has dedicated her life to doing it well so that others don't have to.Menou takes great care in her work, she always keeps in mind these dual truths. She is a priestess, pure, just and strong and that she is a villain. That the lost ones as they are called, are monsters that cannot live but are also innocent and more normal than she could ever hope to be.She is not cruel, she does not enjoy killing. She needs to kill Akari but she does not want her to suffer, she does not want her to feel pain, fear or betrayal. Other characters may suggest ways to do the deed. But she wants Akari to die with dignity. And she genuinely wants to keep Akari out of harm's way until she chooses a method to try. I can understand why Akari could truly fall in love with Menou given Akari's unique perspective of the events.I'm not going to spoil the interesting things going on with Akari so far. But this is set up to be a cool adventure that I expect and hope will be cathartic for me like Plastic Memories is.On the surface she is an executioner but her way of life shows that she is a caring, gentle soul and that she wants to help someone to die comfortably, with dignity and with love.I didn't put thought into the number ratings, I wrote what I think.

With a near identical first episode designed to shift both the genre and focus of the show for the sake of subversion, the problem is that what you\'re left with after having the show subvert you once is it\'s just generic fantasy slop.The show\'s setting is so eager to pretend it has this great idea of ""What if lots of people got isekai\'d?"" that it doesn\'t have a single original idea outside of that. Will a cold murderer with a tragic backstory have their hard shell cracked over time by the sweetest, dumbest ray...of sunshine that could exist? Will we spend an episode as the executioner fumbles with her feelings after she instinctively protects that smile despite her orders? Will the executioner learn that goody goody actually has an equally tragic backstory but chooses to keep being happy because friendship? Only time will tell!Nah but genre fatigue aside, the show looks and sounds fine, it\'s paced decently, and assuming it wraps itself up it\'ll at least make for a nice sweet one and done. But it won\'t be because it\'s a light novel adaptation, so expect a soft unsatisfying ending with light yuri overtones after defeating a mildly interesting bad person who probably works for the same institution the protagonist does because something something corruption. of sunshine that could exist?

Do not read the LN. (wont spoil)So, I am probably writing because this anime has too low score. It has (6,80) at the moment and people are mostly complaining that it is nothing special for isekai. While at the same time ""Skeleton Knight in Another World"" has (7,30) and ""Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs"" has (7,27). Seriously people, what a fudge? This anime might not be worth the hipe, but it is miles ahead of those two. I feel that what this anime lacks and others have is a male protagonist and...if this is the case ... it makes me sad.Now back to the content ... this anime is very well made. It has ""care"" written all over it and animation is great, its music just won\'t go out of my head and I do not mind if it stays there and I quite like thinking how I would live in the world if I were to live there. It has a potential (ep 7 right now). There are also 4 LN out there and anime has 2 of them, so there could be more to come.Now for when things go south for me and where I lost quite a lot of my faith in it ... its source material is not that great. It is not bad, there was clearly a lot of care put into it, it is enjoyable, but it is like someone at 25 wrote it as his 1. or 2. project, you can clearly read how author is still not sure of himself and is trying to navigate his not at all bad story with his sloppy skills. This is BDW also confirmed in ""authors words"" at the end of LN, he never expected to win the first place on the competition to which he submitted his (or ""her"", but it feels ""his"") manuscript. This was also quite a surprise to me, because someone with way more skill left the story intact but managed to correct most of those quirks, like how Akari just can\'t stop talking about sex in the middle of the main battle (it is bizarre) or how Ashuna has no introduction before it becomes one of the main characters. This is why I am saying ""do not read the LN"". This anime is better.Now for some SPOILERS (how to recognise a sloppy writing).------Story has more than ""stile"" problems that are not unusual, but I just do not like them. The main problem is ""the genius sindrome"". For some reason all of the mains feel OP and this is not bad on itself, it is just that they have a hard time fitting in the world, their presentation could be way better. Take similar story with similar problems, Re:Zero (my guess is, that it was an inspiration for this one). Reinhard is such a character, but there you have so many of those that world feels balanced and the moment it steps out of balance everyone ""expects"" that cities will be annihilated (in fact world does end a few times), they do not because exceptionals concentrate around the top to protect the status quo. Now what do we have here? There are 3 exceptionals in the main cast, one is a worldbreaker and it makes sense, she has to go, the entire story is around ""how the fudge to kill her"", there is also very capable antagonist, her executioner, that specialises in killing people like her. The problem is ... she IS exceptional. How are others managing it? Or would they have no need to be exceptional, because they are basically spy-agents-undercover, so you do not need that much to kill someone? In short, you do not want someone capable of annihilating cities running around without supervision and here you have 2 of them, one of them very mentally unstable and very willing to destroy everything if she has an excuse, like her holy ribbons were burned. To me it sounds like someone should ""kill them for the good of many?"". This is kind of their entire job. This shows when Momo (crazy) manages to destroy the most well protected parts of the city and both centers of power. Ashuna (not crazy) then slashes at the castle in diagonal ... when she could just use a vertical slash and avoid 99% of the damage she causes. Also, somehow that doesnt kill everyone inside, it kills no one. Kill them at the first opportunity you get, if you can not, exile them, if you can not, give them a nation, stabilise them! Make them stop destroying historical sites! The other problem is as mentioned ... why didn\'t bystanders stop them? Do they have no capable people in charge of the defence? Menou had a chance to lose against 4, do they not have hundreds of capable knights? And they had such a hard time killing a demon ... that are summoned every now and then with just a few human bodies as an offering or even less (no bodies for Envy).

It did drop in quality by the third episode but that was kinda to be expected.I initially watched the first 2 episodes before dropping the series, but then I saw the ratings drop even further and decided to pick it up again, just to see if it had really gone to shit.

It's still pretty much the same with the lore, world building and story being above the comedy.People are honestly doing this show a huge disservice.It's not nearly as bad as it's made out to be... at least not yet.

The magical system is one of the most innovative I’ve seen in recent shows; instead of more classic “elements”, it relies on abstract concepts as specializations which enable a range of unique abilities. The “isekaied” people in this world have certain attributes which make it advantageous for various factions with diverging goals to attempt to summon them and over millennia, they have fundamentally altered the isekai world’s society and the mix of magic and technology which permeates the isekai world is something that is...worth seeing. The world follows a hierarchical power structure with three states, the Church, the nobility and the common people, which are a natural extension of the inequality in power which results from the world being one of extravagant and extremely powerful magic and magic technology; the Hobbesian idea that all men are equal as even the weakest man can kill the strongest man is no longer necessarily true in this world.Unfortunately, as a whole, the show does not live up to the potential which this fascinating setup gives it. The production quality is generally mediocre which unfortunately means that the world and the various magical battles, creatures, abominations and artifacts scattered throughout it are rather uninspiring. The final product on screen does not live up to the quality of the concept. The characters are average at best. None of them are particularly bad conceptually, but their final execution does not make any of them particularly memorable. The show could probably have also been directed better; while the show balances showing and telling well, most of the character-centric and “slice-of-lifey” filler scenes don’t do enough to build up the character’s central to the story.Hence, at the end of the day, Shokei Shoujo ends up as a 7- good, but not great. It really has some solid elements (especially in its world-building) and the main plot is quite interesting. However, as a whole, the show certainly isn’t exceptional.  I can’t help but feel that if this anime had a better production team behind it and a better sense of direction, the characters could have been made stronger and both the action scenes and the magic of the world could have really popped.

They didnt toned down the gore, i give them positive score about that. 10/10 The true action always involve blood and goreEnjoyment ; I really enjoy watch this anime every goddamn Saturday. I totally want S2 to know what happened next.Overall : 10/10 I dont want be like hardcore fans but this anime is absolutely good, from action and adventure theme also Fantasy, They hit it to the point even they are use same method like other generic anime but this anime didnt fail me. Really sad its going to the end. This story also take different opening when u see blood on screen at very first episode which catch me by surprisedDo you recommended this? Yes totally especially you like ActionDo you want Season 2 for this? Yes absolutely because they reveal next villainThats should be all, Adios!', '""Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road"" is a action based isekai, were a youg girl is incumbered of killing gifted people who were isekaied into her world, before they could possibly do something that would destroy the world.

It starts off interesting but takes a few episodes to really dig into the world and develop, at that point it becomes excellent. This is a journey through a dark fantasy world and deconstruction of the Isekai genre. Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road, which I would translate more directly as The Executioner Girl's Pure Way of Life, is a journey through one of the richest and most interesting worlds I've seen in a long time. A world still reeling...from major disasters that took place around 1000 years ago, called the four human errors. The human errors are some of the most creative and interesting world disasters I have ever seen in a plotline and I hope they will be explored more in the future. The details given in this anime make one want to see more of the world.The story centers around a priestess who carries a dark burden, a tradition ever since the four human errors, to ensure they never happen again. The characters in this show are fantastic and varied greatly. The main characters are awesome and play off eachother so well, it is super fun to see them interact.Overall I'd highly recommend this show if like my first line, a dark storyline in a dark fantasy world filled with strong women sounds awesome to you. The only reason I haven't rated it higher is that the ending leaves much more to be desired, I hope one day it'll be fulfilled. from major disasters that took place around 1000 years ago, called the four human errors.

I said to myself “I’ll probably drop this after the 3 episodes.” However, my interest in this anime immediately took a u-turn after Menou, the fake out isekai love interest turned out to be the main protagonist and stabbed the twat in the fucking cranium. For she is...a priestess, pure and just, and also a murder wafiu.If you’re looking for a isekai with interesting concepts which are actually well written and executed then The Executioner and Her Way of Life is certainly one of the most unique isekai I’ve watched in recent memory.Although the realm/world Menou belongs to is honestly a bit bland and lacking in any real identity,  it’s politics and society is solid and interesting. An isekai world in which assassins for the church are responsible for taking out the overpowered teen high schoolers known as “Lost Ones” summoned to the world by the kingdoms royalty so they can essentially use them as weapons to overpower said church is really cool. Topped off with a magic system which is not only beautiful to look at but, mechanically deep and flexible makes the shows combat engaging and exciting.The main story is solid as well. After Menou tries and fails to assassinate the ganki Lost One and political tool Akari she has to travel with her target and figure out how to assassinate someone who can just turn back time with her “pure concept” after getting stabbed in the neck as if nothing ever happened. Menou is on a timer as Akari could potentially lose control of her pure concept and become what the world knows as a “Human Error” with the potential to seriously damage or even destroy the world. Although Akari may come of a clumsy, busty, possibly yuri moè blob who is very charming she does over do it to the point where her personality can get a bit grating. She has her own goals (which I won’t spoil here) and her involvement in the stories main twist is genuinely cool.There are two supporting side characters who tail the duo behind the scenes. Momo is Menou’s apprentice and operates for her behind the scenes, but she comes off and is a weird sex pest towards Menou in most of their interactions and it’s not endearing. Princess Ashuna who is trying to wipe out her families corruption is the equivalent of the Goron from “Breath of the Wild.” Y’know, “ME STRONG, YOU WEAK, ME HIT ROCK WITH SWORD, IT BREAK.”, that sort of personality.The two main villains are also a bit generic in their goals, but in an engaging way and the second feels like *insert gender* came straight out of a horror movie.It is refreshing to see a show made by J.C Staff which doesn’t look like shit and has premium animation. Suspiciously premium even. Seriously, this anime is gorgeous. Considering the studios recent out puts and how amateur or rushed most the art and animation looks it makes me wonder if they’re trying to push The Executioner and Her Way of Life as one of their “main series” like Danmachi. If that’s the plan then I’m totally on board for more.8/10 Great a priestess, pure and just, and also a murder wafiu.If you’re looking for a isekai with interesting concepts which are actually well written and executed then The Executioner and Her Way of Life is certainly one of the most unique isekai I’ve watched in recent memory.Although the realm/world Menou belongs to is honestly a bit bland and lacking in any real identity,  it’s politics and society is solid and interesting.

Menou herself is a very interesting character, deeply influenced in...her way of thinking by her upbringing, but brought to question her way of life over the course of her journey with Akari, the girl she has to kill. All supporting characters are intriguing and the villains are well developed.The production quality isn't stellar, but it's definitely above average.Overall, the anime is a breath of fresh air for both the isekai and fantasy genre, and I'll be first in line on the wait for a sequel. her way of thinking by her upbringing, but brought to question her way of life over the course of her journey with Akari, the girl she has to kill.

It sounds like a painfully meta, gimmicky concept, and it does come across that way in its bait-and-switch first episode, but once you get past that shaky start the show manages to overcome the hurdles it's set for itself.It makes this needlessly difficult for itself in the early episodes, and risks alienating viewers. Part of this is because the Japanese high school kids are all whisked away to this...world against their will by people who want to manipulate their powers, only for them to be brutally executed shortly thereafter. The other problem is the priestesses (ie. assassins). Protagonist Menou is the executioner of the title and comes across as ruthlessly efficient, making her difficult to engage with at first. Her giddy, bubblegum-haired sidekick Momo, meanwhile, is a flat-out psychopath who merrily tortures and kills people at the drop of a hat. All other priestesses seem to fall somewhere between those two personality types, and they all just come across as villains.This is exacerbated when Akari enters the picture. This cheerful Japanese girl immediately becomes attached to Menou, blissfully unaware that she's next on the hitlist. Menou kills her with typical efficiency... and then Akari gets back up, uninjured, and unaware of what just happened. So begins Menou's quest to kill a seemingly immortal girl who adores her.It all sounds like a mess in synopsis form, but to the show's credit it managed to win me over. First, it does eventually make an effective case for why the Lost Ones can't be spared. In classic Wheel of Time or Claymore fashion, the more a Lost One uses their powers, the more they lose their mind. We're soon shown evidence that Lost Ones inevitably become walking natural disasters of apocalyptic proportions. It doesn't make the unfeeling priestesses any more sympathetic, but it does explain why their role is a necessary evil.Then there's the world-building. This story's world and magic have had a lot more thought put into them than typical off-the-peg isekai. The long-term presence of people from Earth has had a visible impact on life in this world in many different ways. Meanwhile the various magic abilities make for some interesting battle scenes, since it's rarely a case of people just flinging energy blasts around.Finally, there are the twists. Practically every episode or two we get a new twist that presents interesting new possibilities, makes us reassess a character, or throws a spanner in the works. If you can get past the cold brutality of the first couple of episodes, the story really starts to escalate nicely.The only problem after that is that this is the usual partial adaptation of a longer work. The stopping point isn't particularly satisfying, but the fact that it's an isekai hopefully means there's a relatively good chance of it getting a second season. world against their will by people who want to manipulate their powers, only for them to be brutally executed shortly thereafter.

Akari and her backup priestess have their primary character trait being obsessive and overly flirt with the MC and it\'s just not very believable or enjoyable.

Thinking of it as a regular, run-of-the-mill Isekai will just make you hate the show. At its core, it answers the question that we all secretly wonder: how would other worlds deal with overpowered people from another world, and what would you do if there was one that was unkillable?The show isn't perfect but does an excellent job of establishing the characters it uses. At no point does it try to reach into random dramatic character arcs, it focuses on its story and is straightforward. The synopsis doesn't lie, and while...it isn't quite as good, the story plays out like a hybrid of Madoka and Re:Zero.It's definitely worth the time to watch and even if you don't end up loving it, it doesn't waste your time. Would love a Season 2. it isn't quite as good, the story plays out like a hybrid of Madoka and Re:Zero.It's definitely worth the time to watch and even if you don't end up loving it, it doesn't waste your time.

I'd normally rate this show an eight or nine, but due to the staggering number of people butt-hurt because the main protagonist isn't an isekai'd blank slate guy, I am obligated to rate it higher.Shokei Shouko no Virgin Road carries itself with a calm, detailed confidence of writing I haven't seen in quite some while; while this show doesn't reach the highs of, say, Re:Zero, it has moments that evoke that tall legacy, for certain.Also, a personal aside for the villains.

There are no super powered MCs, no harems and none of the usual clichés that I see people complain about that cause them to 'Drop' from Isekais, instead we have 2 amazing, strong, independent female leads who try to stand their ground together along their journeys, we also have some super interesting magical concepts, some legitimately scary and maybe disgusting villains?!I really don't see how anyone can not like this Work, unless the person hasn't even read the Synopsis of the Work, or else they were expecting something Generic and Cliché like most other Isekais with super male protagonists. powerful and completely dull that they complain about every season... ZzzzzIn terms of the story itself, Shokei Shoujo has a great premise and is developed very well throughout the events, the fact that Menou has to find a way to kill Akari while she clearly develops strong feelings for Akari is something I at least I don't remember seeing it in another Isekai, even less in such a well done way and that you really feel like they're both creating a connection and Menou constantly has to hesitate with her own feelings because she ''has'' to kill Akari. The Characters are very unique and some of them bring incredible personalities to further enhance the story and get you involved in it.One of the things I loved most about Shokei Shoujo is that the Eyes are incredibly well done (I really love it), the voice acting is very good and the animations are very solid and lovingly done by the J.C Staff who always makes a great job. Anime also has a completely wonderful OP and a very good ED, with decent OSTs.That's it, Shokei Shoujo was for me one of the best Works of the Spring 2022 season, I certainly fell in love with this Work and its amazing characters, being one of the most unique Isekais I've ever been able to follow and I had a lot of fun over the weeks accompanying this Masterpiece.

Those who reviewed it negatively simply point out that there is a lot of gore, the CGI didn't blend well, a specific character was not enjoyable, and the over-obsessiveness of another character created awkwardly comedic moments. This anime simply wasn't an anime that suited their taste and they shouldn't have continued giving themselves a negative experience. To those who ended early, it is because they've watched Re:Zero and found that the show was unoriginal. While the beginning plot twist may...have been reused, the anime in itself is actually very original.In this anime, if the second half of Episode 7 and all of Episode 8 were excluded or better done, then the anime would be an obvious masterpiece to anyone who finished it. Those sections of the anime were the only negative things about it. It was all just pure fan-service, over-bearing sides of characters, repeated bad attempts at comedy, and exposition dumps (which were, in the end, misleading). Many people were probably disappointed and lost interest after those episodes and glanced through the last episodes and left with a bad impression.Outside of those two episodes, this anime is amazing. The fight scenes (excluding the final fight scene) were incredibly well done. The story is very unique and has several interesting and unexpected plot twists. The music fits so well throughout and the voice acting in most sections (except the final fight scene) was really well done. The characters are original, and while it seems that women were forced into this anime, they actually work really well for the story. Overall, if you sit back and just let yourself watch the anime (like most fictional stories should be interpreted) it is most definitely enjoyable. That's my short review. Below I will go into further detail.Story 10/10:I have never watched Re:Zero. So, this start with an unexpected plot twist from the get-go for an isekai wowed me. If you did watch Re:Zero, it serves neither as a unique interest nor an effective hook. But, if you continue watching through the first half of the season, things get really interesting. It could've easily gone to a mc + sidekick vs the world type of deal or even a mc + best friend happy stop and start type of deal, but it didn't. The plot twists and the plot reveals were all super interesting and excellently used. While a lot of exposition dumps happen in the beginning and at Episodes 7 & 8, the rest of it is presented in manner similar to flashbacks or mystery-story leads. This creates a perfect air of mystery and leaves a lot of loose ends once old loose ends are tied up. The first half of the season was amazing. As for the second half, it was even better. We learn a tiny bit about what the world actually is like and what the real big story going on is. It definitely is a great set-up to continue off of.Art 9/10:The character designs are really impressive. Aside from that, the fight scenes (aside from the final fight scene) are actually really well blended and choreographed. They also have great animation and detail for those fight scenes. The final fight scene had moments where it was obviously bad, but during the actual action bits (not the still-bits where dialogue occurs) it was blended really well and looked nice. While it was by no means the best it could be, considering it wasn't Demon Slayer level budgeting, it was great.Sound 8/10:The voice acting for the most part really did a great job of conveying emotion when it was needed (or not conveying emotion for characters that shouldn't've). Aside from that, the sound effects were timed correctly and helped engross the viewer into the scene. Definitely one you should watch with headphones or surround sound for a much better experience. Not to mention the intro and outro songs were really good and the music throughout really helped dial into certain scenes. The sound overall was very good.Characters 9/10:The character developments, reveals, and flipsides that were shown were great for all except one character. Momo's two sides to her character (which are in essence two different forms of the same personality trait) are almost overbearing. One side of her is over the top and the other side is too edgy. However, her fight scenes and character design were really good. As for the other characters, to highlight a few, Menou's internal conflict and push and pull of her heart strings throughout combined with her no-emotion executioner side create a perfect contrasting duet for the story. The Princess's recklessness paired with her surprising intuition creates a character that has most likely has more depth and past than what has been revealed. Pandemonium has a great character for what she needs to portray as well as quite an interconnected and emotional backstory that is very well revealed and somewhat unexpected despite the obvious clues for it. Overall, all the revealed characters aside from Momo were given great depth, personalities, and backstories.Enjoyment 10/10:I truly enjoyed this show from start to finish. My bias says this is probably the best isekai I've watched. If you take out my bias, this show at the very least deserves a better rating. It is underrated.

It could've easily gone to a mc + sidekick vs the world type of deal or even a mc + best friend happy stop and start type of deal, but it didn't. The plot twists and the plot reveals were all super interesting and excellently used. While a lot of exposition dumps happen in the beginning and at Episodes 7 & 8, the rest of it is presented in manner similar to flashbacks or mystery-story leads. This creates a perfect air of mystery and leaves a lot of loose ends once old loose ends are tied up. The first half of the season was amazing. As for the second half, it was even better. We learn a tiny bit about what the world actually is like and what the real big story going on is. It definitely is a great set-up to continue off of.Art 9/10:The character designs are really impressive. Aside from that, the fight scenes (aside from the final fight scene) are actually really well blended and choreographed. They also have great animation and detail for those fight scenes. The final fight scene had moments where it was obviously bad, but during the actual action bits (not the still-bits where dialogue occurs) it was blended really well and looked nice. While it was by no means the best it could be, considering it wasn't Demon Slayer level budgeting, it was great.Sound 8/10:The voice acting for the most part really did a great job of conveying emotion when it was needed (or not conveying emotion for characters that shouldn't've). Aside from that, the sound effects were timed correctly and helped engross the viewer into the scene. Definitely one you should watch with headphones or surround sound for a much better experience. Not to mention the intro and outro songs were really good and the music throughout really helped dial into certain scenes. The sound overall was very good.Characters 9/10:The character developments, reveals, and flipsides that were shown were great for all except one character. Momo's two sides to her character (which are in essence two different forms of the same personality trait) are almost overbearing. One side of her is over the top and the other side is too edgy. However, her fight scenes and character design were really good. As for the other characters, to highlight a few, Menou's internal conflict and push and pull of her heart strings throughout combined with her no-emotion executioner side create a perfect contrasting duet for the story. The Princess's recklessness paired with her surprising intuition creates a character that has most likely has more depth and past than what has been revealed. Pandemonium has a great character for what she needs to portray as well as quite an interconnected and emotional backstory that is very well revealed and somewhat unexpected despite the obvious clues for it. Overall, all the revealed characters aside from Momo were given great depth, personalities, and backstories.Enjoyment 10/10:I truly enjoyed this show from start to finish. My bias says this is probably the best isekai I've watched. If you take out my bias, this show at the very least deserves a better rating. It is underrated. (At time of writing this 6.89 is the rating)"", ""First, the superficial: Art, great; Sound, fair; Enjoyment, very good; and Overall, great. This anime is, hands down, the most consistently good isekai of the Summer 2022 season. Many others tag this as being bad because of its edginess and pseudo-philosophizing, but in my opinion those aspects are as well handled as the pseudo-philosophy of Evangelion 1995. Spoilers ahead for why.. . .Spoilers:The MC is female. This is a direct departure from the norm, and unlike in other anime, I as a female can relate to this female character. So much to say that both female MC's of this anime feel human and do not...suffer from any of the uncanny valley, trope filled, or character foil faults of female characters in other animes. For as much thought and effort as was put into the two MC's, as much thought was put into most of the NPC's. Although many of the NPC's were foils to more plot-centric characters, they were minimal and their placement was well organized. That is, they did not feel out of place and were in character. It even took me a few minutes to realize the 'blatant bad guy' trope in the only instance(s) it occurred.As for the story, the story was fantastic. I'll not spoil it except to say that the pacing is good, save for a minor pacing issue around episode 7/8, and an overly brief denouement. suffer from any of the uncanny valley, trope filled, or character foil faults of female characters in other animes.

I know most of them are bad, but sometimes I get an urge that wins-out against my self-control. Despite this season being stacked, I found myself caught up with everything else and still lacking something to watch, so I gave this a shot. Maybe in my younger years I could've powered through this one, but not anymore. I could actively feel the youth being drained from my body; time better spent staring at my ceiling, or crying to myself.The production quality for the show is better than most seasonal isekai, but the writing is abysmal. There aren't any...characters, just character templates being smashed together like an 8-year-old playing with toys. I don't even think the show is capable of paying attention to more than two characters at once, because none of the side-characters are allowed to talk to each other, nor be on-screen at the same time as anyone other than the main heroine. Every character is also assigned a single personality trait, which they will never deviate from. So if you, like me, find yourself hating most of the cast, you don't need to worry about the show changing your mind.It is INCREDIBLY EASY to create an interesting premise and catch the attention of new viewers. However, it's much more difficult to expand on that premise, and keep viewers engaged. This show spends ALL of its creative energy in the first episode, just hoping that the initial premise is enough to hook people. Unfortunately, even if you enjoy the first episode, almost none of it is reflected in the rest of the show. Using other shows as reference, imagine if you had the first episode of Re:Zero, but the rest of the show was Isekai Cheat Magician.Honestly, watching this show felt like listening to a story that your younger cousin is making up on-the-spot. The author doesn't seem to have had any foresight about where he actually wanted this story to go, so as soon as it gets boring, they'll whip out some generic anime super-attacks or a cheesy betrayal, and expect viewers to act like it was cool/surprising. characters, just character templates being smashed together like an 8-year-old playing with toys.

Big deal. I actually personally like it, when people are creative. I assume that a lot of people who rated it so low expected one thing and got another.Anyway, to review:Story is great (9). Or at least story potential is 10/10, but execution while good, does miss sometimes. f you can avoid watching OP - it basically spoils the whole Season and the next one. Yes - my only major complaint is that this series is too short and we\'re forced to wait...for another Season - if it will ever come. Though at least story ends in a decent place to stop for a while. Imperfect, but I wouldn\'t call it cliffhanger. We learn some things, we get a double twist in the last scene. Because it will act differently on people who haven\'t seen OP and those who had and thought they knew everything. Generally twists mostly got me. Except for one time, which we will discuss in Character section.World building is fantastic, though because of the plot we don\'t get to explore it as much as one would like. Again great potential, but not wasted, rather not explored yet fully and at least partially it is on purpose.Art gets a solid (7). It is good. However you can clearly see the difference between Sakuga and normal panels. What is worse from time to time we even get subpar quality panels or 1 minute montages of slides where music plays. That screams production issues, but honestly I only noticed it and it annoyed me when I re-watched the series. Then again this subpar thing happens only couple of times and mostly in places where visual quality is not the most needed. Sadly it also affects characters look.Sound is very good (8). OP has a song that works for me. Though the music is non-intrusive. Which for BGM is actually good, unless there is some masterpiece. Sound design is actually decent and the wide range of setting we see allow the to flex a bit and show off. It\'s not exceptional, but it is exceptionally done ""stock"" sound design with couple gems.Characters: Where do I begin? Goodish main character design, but quite simplistic. 1 Curvy Japanese girl, 1 blonde model, 1 pink haired girl that will be a model soon and 1 blonde model with some additional muscles and curves. They are all designed in a way to be basically as easy to draw as fast as possible - it\'s another compass pointing at production issues. Secondary/Tertiary characters aren\'t better design wise. Crowd is made of look-a-likes, so are a lot of Tertiary characters.When it comes to their personalities they are for the most part 1 dimensional with exception of 1 blonde model. But all other main characters exhibit from time to time surprising amount of depth - making them 2 dimensional characters, who just happen to fit into 1 dimensional mold 90-95% of the time. At the beginning our MC seems the most bland of them all, but plot-twist that was on purpose. We get enough glimpses into our main 4 and secondary/tertiary characters back stories that it makes at least some of them interesting.Interactions between characters are fun and initially I liked the Yuri aspect of it. Sadly the blonde model cannot catch a break and is fawned over by 2 very clingy characters who ""can\'t live without her"". Cute in a way, Creepy in a different way. Overall there is too much of it and the fact that a lot of it is for comedic effect doesn\'t help. If it wasn\'t for the fact that blonde model knows how to handle herself and dish out sarcasm it would be unbearable. Interactions between characters who don\'t ""like, like"" each other are far more interesting. Sadly there isn\'t as much of it to balance out the clingy moments. Background characters hide their personalities very well, since you can\'t observe them in any way ;)Sadly while villains have motivations as well, they are either supposed to be twists, but are obvious or are cackling crazies from the start. It\'s just that their motivations are ""twisty"" enough that it salvages some of it. But honestly the surprise in that could come from the fact that you\'d never believe people would actually write that stuff and think of it as good.Enjoyment (9) - despite all of the flaws I listed above, I had an absolute blast watching each episode (only episode 1 doesn\'t have a good re-watch value). You don\'t notice most of the flaws, because they are just below the threshold for noticeability when you\'re invested in the story. Which I very much was. As soon as in episode 2 our blonde model realizes that this might be tougher than expected, there is a constant action or drama happening. Later it goes more into thriller/Horror territory, but that\'s fine.Honestly if it wasn\'t for villains being basic and rare but noticeable drops in quality and the character design being simplistic (though quite interesting, main girls look really good, but that\'s not the point) where last 2 things, and maybe even all 3 can be attributed to production problems (plural on purpose. Some of it is financial, some of it is time, some of that might be lack of competent people) - I would give it in a review the same 10/10 that I gave it after watching 4 episodes.But as it stands overall it is 8/10 anime. Worth watching if you have a spare time, like different worlds (this one is slightly more advanced than usual medieval setting, though disparity between places is great), but are little bored of standard ""MC is transported to another world and though normally a loser now they have a harem"" - this might be an anime for you. But only if you don\'t expect earth shattering philosophical questions etc. There are some philosophical questions sprinkled here and there, but it isn\'t a treatise on humanity - yet. I feel like Season 2, whenever and if it happens might be more of that. For now there are some personal problems and societal/hierarchical ones shown, but not yet explored. I hope they will be in the feature.Apologies for using the name ""blonde model"", but that was to emphasize how simple character design is. And it really looks great, but it is still very simple and efficient.And honestly I wanted more. The sad part was that if it wasn\'t an objectively good place to stop, second half of last episode would feel like a trailer for Season 2. And the story is not complete by any means. It\'s just that certain point has been reached and certain arcs had been finished. This seriously needed 24 episode Season. Though given the very obvious problems with production, it might have made thing even worse. And yes, this teasing - that almost feels like a cliffhanger at the end of last episode - that is an obvious production issue as well. They know they didn\'t utilize the possibilities that the adapted work has given them and that might make people ambivalent towards Season 2, so they want you to demand Season 2 from the company.OK. I rambled for half of this review. Enough. Have a good day/night and I hope you all stay safe. If you decide to watch this anime after reading this - try contacting me if it\'s possible.

The setting is almost always a fantasy world with a video game- like magic system, the MC is almost always male and gets a harem of extremely attractive girls with unconditional love for him within the first few episodes. However, the thing bothering me most about those stories is them ignoring their main concept. The reincarnation part is often just a excuse to get the plot going and the MC just may as well come from that world as he appears to have forgotten all his knowledge, morale, background and...social concepts from his original world. Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road is not one of those Anime. The whole concept of it\'s world seems to be the authors complicated answer to ""What would actually happen, if there was a constant stream of overpowered citizens of our world to a fantasy world?"". The huge amount of detail and thought put in those aspects is the main appeal of Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road in my opinion. The magical-industrial society, that developed. Otherworlders not having their immense powers under control and the catastrophic effects that has on the world. The way the inhabitants of the fantasy world take actions against those problematic individuals. But not just with the world building the author tries to set apart their work from all the other common isekai tropes. We get the stereotypical opening with a generic isekai protagonist walking his first steps only for him to get tricked and killed by our real protagonist Menou -a priest with strong magical power and knowledge, who is hunting those otherworlders together with her apprentice Momo. Instead of the usual harem main cast we get a lesbian love triangle between the stoic Menou, Momo, who has loved her since her childhood and Akari- a otherworlder Menou failed to kill due to her isekai power of time control automatically saving her from death. While Akari blindly trusting and loving on the spot may come off as weird at first we get a more intricate understanding of why that is ""over time"". The storyline is captivating, misterious and full of twists and turns. We get elaborate insights into the backstory of many characters, showing us their unique motivations behind their, often hard to understand at first, actions. We learn more and more about the ""true concepts"" - the superpowers given to people summoned from our world. How they shaped the world, influence the actions of the characters in our story and why they are so dangerous. The art is great, especially in the fight scenes (there are rare occasions of CGI, but even those look good). All the characters look unique and we even get some backstory on why they dress like they do. The soundeffects do their job pretty well and the OST is nothing special, but fitting. OP and ED don\'t stand out. They are meant to be more of a moodsetter for the show and are sufficient in doing so.  As a huge isekai fan I was exited when I read about this new and fresh isekai with all it\'s cool and unique ideas. I was really surprised, when I had way less fun than expected when watching it, because on paper this was the perfect show for me. Over the course of Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Roads runtime I got less and less excited about watching it. Having to drag myself to watch the missed episodes times and times again. I have no idea why I did not enjoy this show. Maybe it\'s the lack of explanation regarding their magic system (especially why you can\'t just connect yourself to one of earths magic veins and go ham all the time). Maybe the all female cast was harder to connect to as a male. Maybe it was hard for me to emotionally connect to an stoic killer manipulating a naive little girl in love with her. I still believe my lack of enjoyment with this Anime to be a me problem and still highly recommend this work, especially if you are a fan of the isekai genre. social concepts from his original world.

Since I don't think it can get any worse from there.A heads-up before I continue to ramble, this show contains some light ecchi (and gore) scenes. You might say it's fanservice, but either way, the VAs manages to deliver it tastefully, just like every other scene in the show.People can...say whatever they want, but it's an undeniable fact that this show had good world-building. True to the title of this show, the whole execution theme is a point that the show faithfully refers back to every time. It is all tied back to how the show juxtaposed the pure and innocent girls with reality.Still not sure what was the OP lyrics supposed to be, but it's so catchy that I think I happily considered it worth the time to listen to.I did say that I considered the characters to be the most enjoyable part of this show. They were enjoyable. It had the advantage of surprising viewers with the unorthodox take on this genre.

I don't expect much out of isekai. Make it fun if you don't have the skill to properly animate it. Oh right this is JC Staff so make the characters work I guess? Yeah not gonna happen when your entire cast is unlikeable and the main character's power makes this come off as a very bad rezero. Or rather a worse rezero. Except this is yuri. (implied) The worst kind of yuri behind the soulless smut that is. Anyway, the story focuses on 2 girls and 2 tag alongs and is about how Japanese people get transported over and gain powers because the japanese...soul is ichiban or some stupid shit.

Do not waste your time on this unless you really like yuri and are starving for (implied) yuri."", '*short honest review*the story is good; the premise is unique and new. the people shitting on the anime are mostly guys because the genre of this anime is not the most appealing. although it\'s been portrayed as an isekai to be honest it\'s not. its a josei anime with a lot yuri and this type of anime aren\'t very likeable in the male side of anime fans (idk about female fans). i , myself, fon\'t particularly don\'t like the show but the fact that ive watched 9 episode and am still interested says a lot.the characters are annoying as fuck, they act as if they...are brain dead idiots. nothing else to it.the art is good . i dont look into every pixel of every frame but through out every episode the the art is flawless and the transitions and the sounds are very well done.tbh, you aren\'t going to enjoy this if you are a huge shounen fan (which most of the anime fans are) and that\'s fair because this show was never meant to be for you its expected audience is adult women. however if you are still going to watch it regardless then that brings me to my last point.like all anime, the entire system and concept of this anime aswell is set to favour the main female leads as they face no consequences ,  no set backs, no failures for their actions is particularly frustrating. the writer in an effort to create a fantasy world that is built on aspects of real life created a load of bullshit where nothing makes sense.in short the entire world where  ""the executioner and her way of life"" is set feels loosely built.P.S first review every so forgive me for any mistakes that i have made, are brain dead idiots. nothing else to it.the art is good . i dont look into every pixel of every frame but through out every episode the the art is flawless and the transitions and the sounds are very well done.tbh, you aren\'t going to enjoy this if you are a huge shounen fan (which most of the anime fans are) and that\'s fair because this show was never meant to be for you its expected audience is adult women. however if you are still going to watch it regardless then that brings me to my last point.like all anime, the entire system and concept of this anime aswell is set to favour the main female leads as they face no consequences ,  no set backs, no failures for their actions is particularly frustrating. the writer in an effort to create a fantasy world that is built on aspects of real life created a load of bullshit where nothing makes sense.in short the entire world where  ""the executioner and her way of life"" is set feels loosely built.P.S first review every so forgive me for any mistakes that i have made,', 'I got curious about this show once I heard about the premise, and opening episodes promised an interesting build up, however it falls apart pretty fast. Let\'s get dive into it. Without spoilers.It starts off with an idea of a world that has been ""invaded"" by Isekai protagonists for a long time so much so, that it became a nuisance for those living in it and led to some catastrophic moments. What was nice about the beginning is that it sort of starts as a typical Isekai only to turn it on it\'s head. And that was enjoyable to watch.I enjoy the design of MC...and the idea of them using Ether or whatever it was as ""magic"" for both combat and appliances, they way it\'s used and designed is rather pleasant. But since story revolves around two main and two sidekick characters and their interactions, your overall satisfaction depends on whether you find those interactions interesting/funny/cute enough to keep watching or not. I wasn\'t all that amused by it so it was rather bland to watch.Action scenes are fine, but as there is not enough connection between me as a viewer and characters involved, since I\'m barely acquainted with them, it lacks impact for me. Ok, so character X died, I know this character from a 1.5 minute flashback and 2 interactions, why should I care whatsoever? They didn\'t even try to show how it impacted the character involved with said character.By the end of Episode 7, while watching an additional portion of hugs, bathtub fan service (again) I understood that I feel bored watching this and started skipping such useless parts to get to anything more interesting. While doing so turned out only about 3-4 minutes had anything meaningful happening.With that said I have to drop it for been boring and it\'s sad, as there was potential. and the idea of them using Ether or whatever it was as ""magic"" for both combat and appliances, they way it\'s used and designed is rather pleasant.

I enjoyed the art and sound during the action scenes, but the story/char was really bad.Understand, this is straight up yuri and the hate for men characters is there.  The story was terrible as it felt like an loose adaption of Minority Report where the innocent are judged and executed based on assumptions which the movie later showed that those assumptions were just one path taken.In Virgin Road, innocent isekai are summoned and summarily executed for just existing based on what they may or may not do.  The...main char has no development and the world building is mediocre at best.Just another man hating show trying way to hard to be something different. main char has no development and the world building is mediocre at best.Just another man hating show trying way to hard to be something different.', ""Something like Mitsuki being revived to take revenge on those who summoned him and seeking vengeance against Menou would make the story more interesting. However, the narrative only explores how the executioner goes about their tasks, or something like that. Mitsuki should be the main character who not only brings about the destruction of the world but also initiates a transformation, ensuring that executioners and nobles cease to exist. I'm disappointed that Mitsuki is more or less like Nanao Nakajima, who was unable to do anything with his life taken away without his understanding. Some people will say he's not the main character in the...first place, but he'd be cooler if given a chance for revenge and to change the world so that no one will experience the absurdity that he encountered. If you liked Talentless Nana, then watch this. But if you're not into yuri-ish types of anime, then I don't recommend it. first place, but he'd be cooler if given a chance for revenge and to change the world so that no one will experience the absurdity that he encountered.

It definitely needs a second season in order to see if I like it or not, but it definitely looks promising.Story 7/10I really like the premise and thought it was an interesting twist on the isekai genre. The first episode was amazing and really sucked me in, but it kinda went downhill after that. The last arc in the season is what brought up the score. The ending of the season was really well done and makes me excited for season 2.Art 5/10Very average, cheap anime art style. I noticed that they reused...a lot of frames, especially toward the end.Characters 7/10I like the main characters, but they do fall into basic archetypes of the isekai genre. Some red flags for me were the constant use of ""friends"" between the two female leads, and I swear if they queer bait I will be rioting. Overall, I just want to see some good sapphic love, and that is kinda what I got. I just hope they make it more romantic in future seasons.Overall 7/10Pretty average isekai/fantasy overall, but added points for the gl.

Y\'all know what I mean; it\'s when you have cool characters in a great story that run smack into a cliffhanger that may not ever be resolved with another season, which means that your only options are to seek out the books (and that\'s if you\'re lucky enough to have localized versions of the books to turn to). All of this is to say that I never expected the ending of The...Executioner and Her Way of Life to feel especially conclusive, but I sure was preparing myself to at least be underwhelmed. Thankfully, ""The Duo\'s Journey"" does a great job of wrapping up the current storyline while still leaving room for lots more intrigue and tragedy down the road, which is basically everything you could ask for in a finale for a season that may or may not ever get a proper follow up.Granted, the last episode did so much work escalating the Pandaemonium conflict that the only thing that this finale really had to do was dispatch the giant centipede monster and give each of our heroines something to do in the meantime. The action scenes have been hit-or-miss in this second half of the season, though, so I\'m happy to report that Executioner doesn\'t fumble it in the endzone. The CGI model that is used for almost any of the non-close-up shots of Pandaemonium doesn\'t look amazing, but it\'s good enough, and I\'ve warmed up to the design since last time. Bug!Pandaemonium has a mouth that is a little too Muppety to be threatening (and that\'s coming from a Muppet superfan), but it\'s still a fun fight. Ashuna gets to hit stuff really good, Akari gets to shoot stuff with her vague time powers, and Menou gets to use Ashuna\'s sword and the power of Akari\'s love to turn Pandaemonium into mush. Fun stuff.Then there\'s the half of the episode that exists to wrap up loose ends and remind us that this was just the second story in a multi-volume light novel series, and that there\'s plenty more to come in the future. Not every beat works; I\'m especially puzzled at the interaction between Menou and Sicilia about Flare. I don\'t know if Sicilia had more to do in the books, but she\'s barely registered as a character in the show, so the scene mostly felt like a ham-fisted reminder that Flare does indeed exist, and that she may even do something relevant to the plot someday. I also wish we\'d gotten more than a throwaway scene when it comes to Menou trying to figure out what the hell was up with Akari\'s sudden shift in personality and power level that has just as suddenly disappeared now that Pandaemonium is gone. It comes across as the author writing themselves into a corner with the True Akari reveal and handwaving an easy solution so they can save the better scenes for later.Still, I\'d say more about the finale worked than did not. I loved the final interaction between Menou and Pandaemonium, and not just for the excellently creepy sound design on Pandaemonium\'s voice. The reveal that the Sword of Salt might be the one way for Menou to kill Akari gives the next phase of the plot a much more concrete goal. It also gives Momo a great moment to end the season on, since she got very little to do in these last few episodes; I\'m very much looking forward to seeing how her own relationship with Akari evolves in the future. Also, can I just say how much I appreciate the little coda we got between Pandaemonium and Manon? The reveal that they are siblings is fine, yeah, but what I really dig is that Manon didn\'t just get unceremoniously chest exploded for good. It makes me a lot more forgiving of how the story handled her backstory info-dump knowing that she and her little sis have both survived to wreak more chaos together.I\'ll be honest: I have a really hard time getting into light novels, since I\'ve never been impressed with the writing in any of the ones that I\'ve read before, and I haven\'t heard great things about the quality of Executioner\'s prose, specifically. Still, it says something that I liked the anime version of The Executioner and Her Way of Life enough that I\'m halfway considering giving the novels a shot anyways. It wasn\'t a perfect series, but it\'s fascinating characters and world were wrapped up in a genuinely compelling story, and that\'s more than enough to earn my seal of approval. All we can do now is pray that there is just a little bit of justice in this world.

The trailer looked fresh and promising: Isekai that doesn’t have a reincarnated weeb as MC? Badass-looking, all-female cast with understated romance? Let's go!!I was blown away by the twist in the first episode and the overall dynamics until the third. The action was good and the flashbacks had this...awesome lore vibe to them so I was just hyped, like “this is the anime of the season!” kind of hype.Then I got the third episode where they take the train ride, and it all went down the drain. The pacing got slow and stayed like that until the end of the season, the dialogues never took off and stayed tropey and empty and the action sequences got suddenly limp and watered down, as if they were trying to stretch the story inside one episode where half of it would have been enough. When I thought a climax was approaching they’d just speak their lines slower to fill up some more minutes and let things take the most obvious route.Maybe it’s the restricted cast that makes it difficult to keep things dynamic action-wise? Then a good writer would focus on the interaction between characters, with real dialogues and exposition. But, nah, let’s go shopping and bitch over why you are buying that ribbon for your long time friend and not for me, a random girl you’ve just met and you’re secretly supposed to kill!Akari starts out like a harmless airhead but increasingly turns into a needy spoiled brat that likes to hog Menou’s attention and cause drama for no reason at all. We are given a glimpse of her redeeming backstory far too late in the show, and even with that knowledge it’s hard to justify her childish codependent behaviour.Paradoxically, Momo ends up on the better side, because even as a love-addicted psycho she still shows more sense than Akari and many times comes to take the role of the straight man.Menou on the other hand is almost funny in her sheltered naivety and how she works as a magnet-pacifier of the triangle. Her lack of personality and ductility is what defines her and it works, but what happens after the midseason climax with the archbishop incident makes it pretty clear her character is not handled properly. You receive massive revelations about this girl whom you’re somehow connected with by fate but instead of talking it out or having a change in your interactions with her, well, you just carry on as if nothing happened, because you just gotta complete your mission, right? Right. What mission again?Too little info is given about whatever else is going on in the world or simply how the Church reacted to ahem, the Archbishop blowing up. Ashuna also stays in the backburner and there’s not one glimpse of a reason provided for why she keeps showing up other than, well, because she just damn feels like it. The focus seems to be just on the love cocoon between Dumb and Dumber, but even that is not convincing.Akari is outrageously flirty out of the blue, which could work as a love-comedy expedient sometimes, but she’s always blown off by Menou’s icy cluelessness as if it was a children's tantrum. Thankfully Momo at least is able to see what could be happening but yeah, in twelve episodes nothing remotely yuri ever happens, just a set of cliche suggestive moments that resolve in goofy comedy. Not a single proper blushing face, no tension, just a lot of head pats from Menou as her seal of sisterly camaraderie. Towards the end it becomes almost heartwarming as Menou relaxes a bit but the romance tag is totally a bait, which is disappointing, especially given the massive shipping potential of those beautiful OP and ED. Hopefully something substantial will come up in later seasons.Speaking of OP, I love how good the animation is and how sometimes that is reflected in the episodes as well, with good photography and even sakuga in some battles and critical moments like the flashbacks. Unfortunately many other times the quality slips towards the lower end and I remember witnessing a whole episode made up of basically just four frames and looping animation for entire minutes. Heartbreaking.Sound-wise the BGM is good in that it mostly complements the situations nicely whether they be ambiguous and sneaky or fiery and dramatic, although there was not a wide range of different themes. Sound effects are juicy and materialise well the power of magic and enchantments.Overall, it feels like I was tricked into buying a cosmetic product with awesome sensual packaging but zero actual effectiveness, that I nevertheless keep on putting on every morning because I want to hope one day it’ll magically start working.Weird analogy aside, this is a show that could have been great with its original, enticing premises, but ended up average and unsatisfying due to poor writing and lack of depth.Maybe it’s just very very slow?I want to hope so. awesome lore vibe to them so I was just hyped, like “this is the anime of the season!” kind of hype.Then I got the third episode where they take the train ride, and it all went down the drain.

Staff has ever done. I remember finishing the first episode of this, going to MAL to add it to watch, and then having an open mouth like that one pikachu meme when I saw they animated this. But to dive into the anime itself, it loses people really fast. It's an isekai that tries desperately to come off as being different but falls right back into the same basic formula. This is pretty much an isekai yuri but the people being isekai'd are actually detrimental to this society due to their destructive powers. Once...you realize that the plot revolves around this one character having to eventually die, it gets boring. I often don't understand the motives of any of the characters, and when I do I'm just like this is stupid. Oh well, I hope JC Staff can keep up this animation quality in future projects. you realize that the plot revolves around this one character having to eventually die, it gets boring.

Oh well, I hope JC Staff can keep up this animation quality in future projects."", ""The Executioner and Her Way of Life is the logical conclusion of the isekai genre. There is nothing subversive about it. It is simply a story about what might truly happen if socially malformed Japanese teenagers were given godlike powers and sent to a world that does not want them. At the heart of that story is a girl who has been put in the position of needing to deal with the problems that these otherworlders cause. She is a hard motherfucker by necessity, because who would want the job of killing innocent children who haven't had the chance to abuse their powers yet? No...one except the psychopathic, and she is one of the more sane characters in the series. She is a troubled character that faces many compelling choices that test the fabric of who she is as a person. You cannot ask for a better protagonist.But Executioner is more than just an interesting concept with a compelling main character. It is also a fully realized fantasy world with rules and history that are unique to its story. Most isekai fall back on the well-known rules and world of Dungeons and Dragons. You might even say they wholly copy the work J. R. R. Tolkien has already done. It means the storyteller doesn't have to spend as much time on exposition, but it also makes all isekai look the same and fills them with similar creatures, systems of magic, and plot points.It is encouraging to see that almost everything within Executioner is its own. There are no elves or goblins thrown in the viewer's face (though whether these typical fantasy creatures and their familiar counterparts exist in this world is not yet clear). The magic system goes beyond simple magic circles that sprout easily from the character's hands. Magic is bound to the level of etheric power in a person, their ability to control it, and their understanding of the scriptural tool that can harness that power. Even better, the magic within Executioner is not limited to a single system. The otherworlders come to this new world with powers of their own that have different rules and dangers. Lastly, there is no tired and omnipresent demon lord waiting to be killed at the end of the series. Instead, there are morally gray human organizations with members and leaders who alternatively strive for a better world or to better their own circumstances. There are terrifying and unknowable monsters lurking in the background which could only exist in this story.And of course, what would any anime be without a full cast of interesting and fun characters. Menou is more than just a child murderer that murders children. Akari is more than just a bumbling foreigner with powers that could destroy the world. Momo is more than just a yandere lesbian that wants to jump Menou's bones. Ashuna is more than just a spoiled princess, looking to escape her privileged status. The villains are numerous and manage to get by without twirling their mustaches. All of them, even the near-mindless monsters, have unique and understandable motivations. Everyone comes with layers that go deep, and it is exciting to see those layers peeled back.As for the production side of the story, the art and sound are mostly serviceable and never subpar. The visuals never drop below the quality line that would distract you from the story, but they also do not rise to the glistening heights of some high-production quality anime. The music is likely to go largely unnoticed except for a few standout moments where it can swell into something special.All-in-all, The Executioner and Her Way of Life deserves to stand with the greats of isekai like Re: Zero, Ascendance of a Bookworm, or Mushoku Tensai. The tellers behind this story understand the genre and what makes it interesting and they are willing to experiment to make something unique and compelling. one except the psychopathic, and she is one of the more sane characters in the series.

The music is likely to go largely unnoticed except for a few standout moments where it can swell into something special.All-in-all, The Executioner and Her Way of Life deserves to stand with the greats of isekai like Re: Zero, Ascendance of a Bookworm, or Mushoku Tensai. The tellers behind this story understand the genre and what makes it interesting and they are willing to experiment to make something unique and compelling."", 'When the Girls Love community got word that The Executioner and Her Way of Life was going to get animated, there seemed be pretty subtle cheers, due to the fact that the source material didn\'t really lean into much in the way of the romantic feelings.  And it\'s true.  So you kind of have to watch this series with that mindset, otherwise I feel like you\'ll be left disappointed.Story: The Executioner and Her Way of Life sets place in a fantasy world where multiple citizens from Japan are summoned by the current world\'s king.  These individuals have special powers after they are...summoned, known as Special Concepts, but if the king deems them useless for his purposes, he basically abandons them and throws them into the open world.  Those people are known as the Lost Ones.  However, since they enter the world and are essentially left to fend for themselves, they have no real knowledge of the world, or the powers they have just obtained.  This ends up having dire consequences on the world.  Enter Menou, who is tasked to lead the Lost Ones to one of the churches, where she then executes them before their powers can run haywire on her world.  The one problem that she runs into is that a Lost One known as Akari Tokitou enters the world, and Menou literally cannot kill her, due to her unique ability.Right off the bat, I really like the world that The Executioner and Her Way of Life has set up here.  Menou and a few other characters wield scriptures, special books that enhance their magical abilities.  This gives our characters access to spells with unpredictable results to assist them in battle.  One of my favourites is when Menou throws her dagger and uses a Gale spell to literally create large wind pressures within the target she stabbed.  She uses this a few times and the result leaves behind a pretty bloody mess.  This all leads to some pretty fantastic fights and I am all here for it.That being said, this show does have some holes within it\'s story.  Generally, the story does a decent job at explaining things that happen in the world via Menou, but for the things that she doesn\'t know, the show really leaves it up to us to figure out.  Sometimes it\'s shown, and sometimes it just leaves it hidden to us.  One part in particular that I didn\'t love is what specifically the king does with the people he summons that he wants to keep around.  They really didn\'t go into it at all and that\'s really the basis of the show.  They also revealed to us a pretty interesting bit of story at the end that leaves the show open to return.  I hope it does because that\'s a pretty neat teaser of what\'s to come.  (8/10)Characters: Characters are generally strong throughout the runtime, with no real weak spots that I can think of.Menou is devoted to her job as an executioner and has a pretty good handle on her spells.  She was rescued from a pretty dire situation from Flare, another executioner, and under her study, earned herself the nickname, Flarette.  We aren\'t given much on Flare, but I could see her having a larger role in the story should it continue.  Like Flare, she can unleash some pretty devastating spells, but it\'s mentioned a few times that Menou\'s ether capacity, the fuel for her spells, is rather low.  I actually really like this from both an entertainment and story perspective.  The former, because it keeps fights short and to the point, and the latter because it keeps our expectations fairly leveled.  Menou isn\'t some overpowered being and this limits what she can do.  We\'re given small snippets about Menou\'s past, but not a ton of her inner feelings towards both her situation, and Akari, which would have added a lot.Akari is summoned from Japan and has a power that seems to have pretty devastating effects, should it be used correctly.  She\'s a bit of an airhead, but never gets annoying enough that it gets on my nerves.  She seems to have a different persona going on, but it\'s not touched on too heavily, and is yet another plot point that I would like to see further expanded on in the future.  Momo is Menou\'s devoted retainer who packs quite a punch on her own.  Interestingly, she uses wire as her main weapon and seems to be very good at adapting to the fights in front of her.  Ashuna is a princess to the kingdom of Grisarika, if memory serves, and has a very outward and bold personality.  She isn\'t your typical princess though, and she prefer to fight things head on with her large blade and solid magical prowess - though most seem to revolved around the fire element.  I loved her inclusion, as she\'s committed to her duties and refuses to stand back.Villains in the series mostly come out of nowhere, but I actually liked them because it wasn\'t the typical ""take over the world"" storyline.  They have clear goals in mind and will do what they need to in order to get there.  They aren\'t the deepest, but their desires do conflict with Menou, and I enjoyed watching as she attempted to stop them.  (8/10)Art: I was very impressed with the animation.  J.C. Staff have put out some decent works and this one doesn\'t falter.  The fights were really solid and the spells always looked fantastic.  The CG is a bit hit or miss, but was generally not an eyesore, which is all you can ask sometimes.  I also like that they don\'t really shy away from the violence either, as we\'ve seen some series try and hide it, and it simply looks unnatural.  (9/10)Sound: I had no real problems with any of the tracks, though the OP, Paper Bouquet by Mili, was a strong inclusion.  VAs were solid, as always, so no problems there either.  (8/10)Overall Enjoyment: The Executioner and Her Way of Life was a solid entry in this completely bonkers anime season that includes a lot of real winners, and I feel like this one doesn\'t get the attention it deserves because of certain people\'s expectations, as well as the other big names airing right now.  You\'re not viewing this as a girls\' love series.  It\'s just a fun, fantasy series with magic and plenty of action.  Keep that in mind, and I think this series would appear to anyone looking for scratch that fantasy itch.

(8/10)', 'TL;DR Shit is kinda boring until episode 6, then it gets real ham to make up for all of that. Some parts are cringy or boring, fine. But it makes up for it with good moments in between and a lot of s2 potential.The first half of the show admittedly is very weak. I\'m not surprised people dismissed this as edgy yuri or whatever. We\'ve seen many twists on the isekai/fantasy genre for years now, so yes, I was also one of the skeptical people just doubting whether or not this was just capitalizing on edgy shock value. On episode 5, when they revealed Orwell...was behind all the shenanigans, I was like, ""I\'m literally gonna drop it after this episode if nothing good happens"".But the wait was worth it, since shit goes DOWN in episode 6, and only keeps getting better from there, mainly because we become aware of the extent that Akari is manipulating the world. I was hooked from there - a lot of mystery about the world, what Flare is up to, how events are changing, the Astral Archive, where pure concepts are, how that connects back to Japan, etc.I\'m expecting the author to capitalize heavily on all of it. There\'s a lot of interesting material here.The writing could definitely use more work - if there weren\'t so many interesting plot threads hanging by the end, I\'d give it like a 6 - not generic trash, but not good. Some of it was too cheesy, too predictable, too edgy, etc. but whatever, writers aren\'t perfect. I\'m surprised an idea this thoughtful was executed in the first place and didn\'t turn into a convoluted train wreck, unlike some other shows...The art could use some work in some places - for example, episode 8 was a ??? moment for me, and the CGI looked kinda ridiculous. I get it though - animation is hard, and this isn\'t a well known show yet so the funding was limited. In other parts though, it was quite amazing, which I\'ll discuss in the Enjoyment section. 7/10 overall.I really liked the OP and some of the OST\'s, so sound gets an 8 for me.The characters were alright - 7/10. Everyone is kind of generic but it\'s whatever - they were fun to watch, but predictable. The two people that stood out the most were Akari and PandemoniumAkari definitely is carrying here, which makes sense since she\'s kind of like the world\'s god ATM - I\'m interested to see just how more twisted the real Akari is, although it\'s clear she\'s fucked herself up badly already to get away from her memories in Japan.Pandemonium though, holy shit. She acted damn near perfect for her role as a chaos god of sorts. It\'s clear she doesn\'t give a shit about killing or being killed, both because she\'s confident that no one CAN kill her and that she only has limited time to cause havoc anyways.Normally in anime, you see these kinds of gods propped up only to be beaten by the mortals and then the lesson is that humans can subdue god and they should be nicer or something. Nope, not here. Completely reinforces the fear of Pure Concepts and Human Errors, if they couldn\'t even kill a tiny sliver of her. She isn\'t even afraid of Akari\'s time travel abilities, is how powerful and confident she is. Really sets the tone for s2.Enjoyment was 9/10. I think this was what really kept me going, because even if I feel like the show has a lot of potential, it wouldn\'t help if everything else was kinda bog standard. But there\'s just so many cool moments in between - for example:- Menou jumping back from Orwell and immidiately churching her, like damn bro.- Menou\'s dagger and bubble tricks vs Ashuka- Menou stopping Manon from killing Akari by throwing the dagger then jumping out the windowOverall, was 8/10. It was a very solid show with weak writing at times, but a lot of potential and memorable highlights outweigh the negatives IMO. I felt guilty about giving it this high of a score, but then I look at Rikekoi and see that it\'s still sitting at 7.5... yeah, this is at least 8/10 if fucking rikekoi is 7.5. was behind all the shenanigans, I was like, ""I\'m literally gonna drop it after this episode if nothing good happens"".But the wait was worth it, since shit goes DOWN in episode 6, and only keeps getting better from there, mainly because we become aware of the extent that Akari is manipulating the world.

I\'d like to say I wanna finish it but I really don\'t as the show plays all its cards early, like someone who thinks they\'re good at uno but drops every wildcard and +2/+4 they have as soon as they draw them. The twists are foreshadowed with the subtlety of a brick through your kitchen window.As far as Isekai shows go, its not the worst thing ever and its at least...got interesting ideas and premises unlike most of the generic garbage that the genre has to offer, but it treads similar paths, almost like instead of walking directly in the footprints of its forefathers it rides a sick 8 speed bike with flames painted on the side through the already blazed trails, while other good shows drive by in their dodge chargers. It\'s just not dark enough to satisfy and not nearly as cool as it thinks it is. got interesting ideas and premises unlike most of the generic garbage that the genre has to offer, but it treads similar paths, almost like instead of walking directly in the footprints of its forefathers it rides a sick 8 speed bike with flames painted on the side through the already blazed trails, while other good shows drive by in their dodge chargers. It\'s just not dark enough to satisfy and not nearly as cool as it thinks it is.', 'Despite being an Isekai, you gotta give credit to Shokei Shoujo for its originality. Having what seems to be a standard Isekai suddenly turn into a yuri romance-adventure tale not 10 minutes into the first episode certainly is surprising...that is if you didn\'t read the description, watched any of the trailers, or even took a look at the key visual. But I am getting ahead of myself. Shokei Shoujo is still ultimately a fine show, and that much I am willing to say, but I wished it was much more than this.Part of this stems from being an incomplete adaptation of an ongoing light novel....The difference between a good LN adaptation and a bad one is knowing where to stop. I understand it\'s rare for a complete adaptation of something several volumes long, but Shokei Shoujo just ends on a sequel hook that left a sour note on my viewing experience once all is said and done. All these plot points they brought up certainly were interesting, but the show went nowhere close to resolving either of them nor is the final episode a good enough cap off to the series. I suppose as an ad for the LN it did work, I went ahead and bought the damn books so I can continue reading more on Menou and Akari\'s yuri adventures.As an adaptation it does its job. JC really needs to stop taking so many projects per season. Shokei Shoujo is mostly dialogue so the animation quality is mostly fine, but the action scenes are all fairly flaccid with a few exceptions here and there, most notably Momo punching that monster somewhere in the middle of the series. One would think most of their budget/manpower went to Shamiko\'s show instead. Credit where credit is due though, the anime\'s interpretation of the spell casting sequence from the LNs is presented incredibly well; it\'s just so slick and it really made me wish the same attention was paid for the main bulk of the action sequences as well.Really everything else about this anime is just that. Fine. The music is fine, I love the OP and ED, and the OST does use some rare instruments here and there to spice things up, but all in all it\'s there and it\'s just fine. The characters are fine, Akari and Momo are really fun to follow, but Menou is a tad too dull for my tastes. And then there is the story. For all of its successes in building a believable, original world, the ultimate story that is conveyed in the anime is ""Menou brings Akari somewhere to kill her"". Nothing too important happens outside of the main duo, and the viewer,  learning more about the world and themselves. And again, there are interesting elements being teased, but at this point it\'s just like dangling a shiny object in front of the viewers when the payoff is all in the LNs.For a time in my life I generally avoided LN adaptations because I don\'t like the feeling of watching an incomplete story only for the outcome to be in a novel in a language I don\'t understand, but these days I\'ve started to enjoy quite a few of them, but the ones I do enjoy generally have low stakes plot that are fine without a total and complete resolution. Not so in this case. After the end of the series I just feel empty inside, and I\'m not sure if that\'s a problem with the modern climate these shows are made in, where it\'s a struggle to even get more than a single cour, or the way the show was structured in the first place. In any case, perhaps it\'s time for me to start reading Shokei Shoujo. At least the translations seem to be relatively punctual...6/10 The difference between a good LN adaptation and a bad one is knowing where to stop.

What I really mean is that the story boils down to a generic assassin girl with a tragic backstory that’s been trained since she was little, starts to develop feelings for her target, one way or the other, and the entire story is the romance/friendship that emerges from this what used to be a target. I imagine this type of story is familiar, or...rings some bells?For all of the people that say this show is different because it’s “dark” and edgy. You’re kidding me right? The entire narrative of the story, from Menou’s backstory, to her monologues, her dialogue and relationship with Akari, and the story arcs that the show shoves you into is meant to frame Menou as a tragic hero that’s doing what’s only right to save humanity. In the end, the show isn’t even edgy.Don’t worry, you’re on the good side still, the story makes sure to have that happen. I’m not going to go super philosophical on this show. There’s not much reason to. Is Menou an actual good person, even though she kills innocent people? Well, with all of the entire show’s premise, setting, and story coming together to support Menou being a “good person,'' then she probably is a good person. The entire show intentionally gives you shock value, edginess, a tragic backstory, and an act of murder to paint a morally diametric character to give some depth, but this theme is so underdeveloped and later on, just forgotten in favor of redundant plot points.This show really makes me appreciate a well done edgy show, like Attack on Titan. Before you stop reading my review because you hate Attack on Titan or something: hear me out. Attack on Titan has similar edgy themes, in which there are moral decisions that people need to make in the show that are diametrically opposed. The difference between this show and AoT is that it doesn’t shove into your face that the MC is good. In fact, it does kind of the opposite. The story sides against the MC. No, you’re really supposed to explore the reasons for both sides of the conflict. AoT does a brilliant job of that compared to any other edgy show, including this one. Instead of BS like “the friends we made along the way” trumps the actual goal, the show actually makes the moral conflict the main focus of the entire story.This show merely dabbles in its moral themes and as a result, feels extremely shallow and hollow. Let’s just disparage any sort of themes that the show may have, and instead, let’s just have Menou and Akari have fun! Or how about fan-service? Of course a good story has to have that. LMAO, after brutally killing someone, Momo’s like, “I’m so jealous of boob-woman!!!! :(((“. Wow, I’m really getting drawn into the story when every other scene is something cringe right out of a harem rom-com. Or how about the pathetic attempts at trying to make Menou a good person? Oh, look, she’s saving the people in the train, and she’s also beating the corrupt organization. Gee, thanks, I’m so glad you’re giving her scenarios in which she’s undisputedly the good person.No, despite the “heavy” and edgy themes in play, most of the show is just mindless conflict, dialogue and “CRAZY PLOT REVEALS” all the way to episode 12 that just drag the story in muddy waters. It’s like the only thing this show is trying to do is make drag on your attention span that much longer. The more explaining that this show does of random plot points that become essential to the main story like “oh yeah, being X is at play here, you’re not going to win,” the more the show gets dragged away from it’s initial premise. With the introduction of new, shiny characters and plot points, it’s just begging the viewer to keep watching so you figure out what is actually happening. The show is edgy, shock value, and eventually devolves into the most typical shounen imaginable. rings some bells?For all of the people that say this show is different because it’s “dark” and edgy.

Gee, thanks, I’m so glad you’re giving her scenarios in which she’s undisputedly the good person.No, despite the “heavy” and edgy themes in play, most of the show is just mindless conflict, dialogue and “CRAZY PLOT REVEALS” all the way to episode 12 that just drag the story in muddy waters. It’s like the only thing this show is trying to do is make drag on your attention span that much longer. The more explaining that this show does of random plot points that become essential to the main story like “oh yeah, being X is at play here, you’re not going to win,” the more the show gets dragged away from it’s initial premise. With the introduction of new, shiny characters and plot points, it’s just begging the viewer to keep watching so you figure out what is actually happening. The show is edgy, shock value, and eventually devolves into the most typical shounen imaginable."", 'So I gave this a 7/10 review... Also this review is for the DUB version. Please note, many of us are dyslexic, can have issues reading sub while trying to appreciate the art of the shows.So, Sadly I had to downgraded it by 2 points.  This would be due the absolute dismal voice acting, I had flashbacks of most the Netflix Dubs.  Brittany is a S Tier VA, so what happened here.  She was almost nauseating to listen to. Her gasping for air every time she spoke drove me nuts. Momo was a really good character, and if not for...her compulsive stalker mentality, easy would have been a fan favorite.So, how did I even give it 7 stars... STORY STROY STORY.  Very well done and creative story and I would love to see the direction we are heading.  I encourage you to watch this, sub if you can, dub if like me you must.There are other reviews that are very off base of why this anime is not more popular.  Simply put, Hidive is a terrible platform. I join for 1 month ever 2-3 years, Catch up on Dubs and move on.  Their Dubs are often poorly directed and converted. her compulsive stalker mentality, easy would have been a fan favorite.So, how did I even give it 7 stars... STORY STROY STORY.

I found this series rather enjoyable to watch. Also, it is definitely worth watching just for the fact that it presents an alternate viewpoint to the common shounen troupes like ""I can do it if I try hard enough"" or ""there is always a way to save everyone"". While I won\'t claim that this is the only series that contests that, it does it an extremely elegant way in my opinion. Having said that there are some issues (especially with characters) that don\'t allow this series...to reach its full potential.Story (8/10): Intriguing and engaging to summarize. There is much information that is not revealed to the watcher, which can be a good plot device at times, but I found it to be frustrating at times too.Characters (6/10): There is only 1 main character, (at least in my opinion, MAL seems to disagree haha) Menou. Her character is interesting and thought provoking. However, the development of her character is done rather strangely. It feels as if her character from when she was in training to the present has changed drastically without an obvious trigger (though some educated guesses can be made too much info is missing). The rest of the characters are subpar at best. Akari\'s motivations are not fleshed out properly, which is a shame because she could have been a great character. Momo falls into all the shounen tropes (only that she is a girl). Her dialogue writing seems rather lazy to be honest. She seems to exist only to worship Menou. Most of the other characters are quite single dimensional as well.Art (8/10): The art is nice but nothing special.Overall rating: 7 + 1 (for a unique perspective).

That's probably the most important part.The whole thing seemed like a really washed out soap opera to me, just with magic.

It’s become so common that it has a few formulas and even some prejudice about how it can be a little generic.The story follows Menou, an Executioner working for The Faust (the church of this world) who is tasked with killing ‘Otherworlders’. Her world has suffered many disasters thanks to Otherworlders, humans who have been summoned from Japan and gained powerful abilities upon reaching this new world. Now The Faust have taken it upon themselves to kill any Otherworlders who are summoned before their powers fully manifest.The trouble is the nobles of this...world are obsessed with power and see the Otherworlders as a way for them to become stronger than their neighboring countries. Before killing her target, Menou first attempts to make them trust her to find out if their power will be any hindrance to the assassination. This gives her the ability to carry out her task without getting into chaotic battles, but it also ends up being a big benefit in her next mission… Menou’s latest task is to kill a girl called Akari, but while Menou thinks Akari’s power is simply to heal, she quickly discovers that Akari actually has the power to turn back time if she’s fatally wounded. Luckily for Menou, Akari retains no memory of having been killed so Menou can at least pretend to be her friend while working out how to get rid of her once and for all.Outside of Menou killing one Otherworlder, the majority of the story is taken up by her dealing with Akari. Because Menou’s assassination attempts fail, she’s invited back to one of the headquarters for The Faust where they’re said to have more powerful magic that can be used to kill Otherworlders. This means that Menou and Akari will now be traveling together for a short while, which Akari is excited about. Menou has told her that they’re going to The Faust to send her back to Japan, so for now, she doesn’t suspect a thing. Meanwhile, Menou is starting to grow attached to the girl, which may pose problems later when it comes to saying goodbye… The Executioner and Her Way of Life certainly has an interesting premise with the idea of a world so torn apart from Otherworlders that they need to start killing them upon arrival.Menou also makes for a compelling protagonist. She’s been through a disaster all of her own which left her orphaned, resulting in her being taken in by the church, but she’s also not weak. She’s very serious by nature but there is a kind personality here, which is brought out by having Akari around. We also get to see her dote on her subordinate Momo plenty, which adds to the depth of her character. Akari for her part is more stereotypical in terms of being a happy-go-lucky Japanese high-school student who is fascinated by the new world she’s found herself in.It’s also interesting that the series leans into being a Yuri in places, with both Akari and Momo clearly being very attached to Menou, and it will be interesting to see if the author does anything with that in future volumes. The illustrations (handled by nilitsu) certainly lean into the idea of the series being a Girls’ Love of some description, so that element is likely here to stay.Overall, The Executioner and Her Way of Life is an extremely likable anime.

Menou, the PoV character, is one of these members, and the plot details her journey in order to kill the isekai'd Akari, who has the power to reverse time. The plot that comes after this is sort of boring, both of the 'arcs' feel both too slow and resolve to quickly.The actual world is... confusing. The dialogue is written like the author (and whoever wrote the script) didn't actually know how to properly introduce the world through the narrative, so characters will constantly just spit out exposition during dialogue. Every single character will randomly add expository summaries of the world even though the character they are talking to obviously knows what it is so they can tell the aduience. It's like some steampunk-magic-ether type bullshit that doesn't really make any sense under scrutiny and really feels like a combination of shit the LN author thought was cool. The actual line to dialogue is just banal too. The world has more to it then the average isekai show, but for me that makes it more disappointing when it fails to deliver.Speaking of disappointment, the animation is godawful. The direction is extremely flat and boring. Like a lot of low budget shows of this ilk, most of the show is still/panning shots of characters standing around and talking. When the characters have to move, they do so sparingly, and when they move for more than five seconds it breaks down. The animators clearly had no time to storyboard the fight scenes, so the choreography is weird and fights are usually just a giant mess of janky animation, random events that don't flow together, and characters standing around and talking all with shitty cgi ether lighting effects over everything. And like every other anime in this genre, it does indeed feature a poorly done giant cgi monster.For the good... The background art is half decent? The soundtrack is also above average for an anime; its not something I would go out of my way to listen to but it makes some scenes better, which is a rarity in this industry. The OP is also great, but thats because Mili is a good artist.These types of shows really frustrate me because it's clear that the source material has some interesting ideas, but because its one of hundreds of LN adaptation isekai shows released yearly, its stuck with an awful production quality due to it's shoestring budget and extreme time constrictions.Can people either stop making these shows or put actual money and talent into them? of the church (Faust) to kill them before this happens.

I say notable because Shokei Shoujo makes it painfully obvious from episode one that it's supposed to be a mature anime, for perhaps a relatively older audience than most isekais, and that it's supposed to introduce some interesting food for thought. Yet having spent four hours of my life viewing this anime, I don't feel like I've gained anything other than a minor headache and a slightly better understanding of kanji.The show really throws you into the thick of it from episode one...and for the first couple episodes the pacing and story is great. It looks like the viewer is going to be set up for a strong season with conflict within the main character, Menou, as well as conflict without as she and her companions are constantly pitted against the relentless forces of corruption, avarice, and plain pure evil.Skip this next paragraph if you don't want minor spoilers.However, I can tell you the exact moment where the show loses steam though in the interest of minimizing spoilage I will only say that the foreshadowing is too strong and what I think should have been the real climax between Menou's wishes and personality and her church-bound training came far, far too soon and thus set up what felt to me like a falling action throughout the rest of the season.Resume non-spoilage.Side character development is non-existant. Main character too for that matter. Menou is too strongly rooted in her beliefs that what she is doing is right and she has somehow justified it to herself that it is the only way forward. The question about if what she's doing is right isn't seriously asked; the answer is always yes invariably. None of the side characters get in any pinches with hard questions either. Akari almost does but she really just gives a cop-out answer and the show leaves it at that since timing I guess.One plus was the lines and lines of invoke magic we got. I really liked those visuals and seeing the magic as kanji script so that was a plus for me. Unfortunately the actual character animation was a bit... simplistic? And I personally didn't like either the OP or ED.I guess to summarize, Shokei Shoujo stormed out the gate and proceeded to lose all that steam, becoming a worse-than-average voyage/journey anime with few difficult moments and challenging propositions to back up what the first couple episodes laid down.

Its world is one that is so used to the isekai phenomenon that the reincarnated Japanese people have already influenced the culture and way of life of those in the isekai world. So much so that they even have historically significant encounters with certain otherworlders that has led to catastrophic events at times. These dangers has sprung the need for executioners that eliminate otherworlders in order to prevent more future disasters.Shokei Shoujo focuses on the executioner Menou and her encounter with Akari, an otherworlder reincarnated with an extremely powerful time manipulating True Concept (this...world\'s name for their powers). Along with her time powers came the complication that she is unable to be killed with traditional methods. This leads to their journey together to find a way to kill Akari before her powers get out of control.STORY - 9/10As someone who is not a big fan of isekai, I enjoyed this one very much. It seemed fresh and unique compared to the usual OP male isekai protagonist as the main cast are mostly female members. With Menou serving as an executioner looking to find a way to eliminate her target, Akari, they embark on their journey together where their relationship develops and secrets are unfolded.The lore and world of Shokei Shoujo is quite impressive. With the history imbedded into its story and the various land and city scapes, one can definitely feel the immersion. The magic system is also extremely interesting and something that you just want to see and know more of. My favorite thing about the story would probably be the pacing. For a 12-episode season, Shokei Shojou was able to effectively have 2 major arcs concluding with 2 major showdowns all without feeling too rushed or too slow. Along with the excellent pacing is the slow yet fulfilling unraveling of the secrets of this world and of Akari\'s powers.ART & SOUND - 7.5/10The art of Shokei Shojou is generally okay. Aside from the cool magic effects and fighting animation, character design isn\'t anything too special or unique. I love the casting animations of spells, though. I think they are super cool. Add to that the mechanical-like sound effects when casting, it makes for a very badass and satisfying feeling when watching characters cast their spells. Why it gets a mediocre 7.5 would be the animation of the final ""boss"". The CGI-esque (I\'m not sure if it actually is CGI animated) look of the centipede version of Pandemonium just left an extremely bitter taste in my mouth. It looked out of place and ruined what could have been an epic conclusion in my opinion.CHARACTERS - 8/10The characters are all very lovable and enjoyable. Their varied traits all complement each other for a fun dynamic with their relationships. Menou\'s calculated and cold aura, Akari\'s carefree nature, and Momo\'s loyalty make for an interesting dynamic between the 3 main heroines. Add to that the Princess\' fiery bloodlust and you have a fun cast of characters. The villains are also noteworthy as they have understandable motives, especially Manon who you can\'t help but actually feel bad for.ENJOYMENT - 8/10Overall, a very solid, fresh, and unique isekai fantasy with interesting characters and an intriguing overarching story and mystery. Engaging and dynamic fight scenes paired with a very cool magic system keeps the action pumping and the viewers entertained. Mix it up with some fun and charming banter between the characters and you have yourself a fun watch.OVERALL - 7.5/10This would have easily been a very solid 8 if it weren\'t for the CGI centipede for the finale.

I strongly recommend this aniime, i really enjoyed it and I hope and cant wait for second season because the first one was amazing, ofc there were some things that could have been written better but it doesnt mean its bad because theres no anime in the world thats flawless thats why il still give this...a 10! a 10!', ""The art in this anime is pleasing to the eyes and its characters are interesting enough (personalitywise) but the problem for me at least is the story. I felt like it was trying too hard to be an isekai different from other isekai and in doing so the story itself ended up with sloppy loose ends.Tbh the first episode of this series shouldn't exist and by that I mean it was a waste of time. It didn't do anything to the story except show what Menou does as her job and what it entails but I could've learned that through normal means like dialog. The...point was for viewers to understand what Menou does as an Executioner. The problem is that at least for me all it did was leave me with a bad taste in my mouth that I couldn't get rid of and it ended up ruining most of my experience watching the show.Let me explain in the first episode you're introduced to Mutou Mitsuki who's just an average student summoned to another world your typical isekai plot. I'm sure you already guess what happens to him from reading the synopsis of the anime. The point is I felt like I didn't need them to build up a fake mc like this it wasted my time investing into his character just to show me what Menou does as an Executioner because I would've figured out anyway by watching the rest of the episode.

My biggest flaw is how most of the plot is structured over Menou and Akari.I like Menou a lot as a character and the backstory is pretty cool and super enjoyable. I like seeing how other Wolders changed the world too and how she feels guilty and relieved with her job as an executioner. I also liked how they showed the other students at the training session for being a priestess/executioner. And the other options Menou could have taken. I like her and Momo (in the beginning I didn\'t like Momo but...seeing the backstory that wasn\'t too informative, but made me feel something about Momo and Memou, I just wish there was more)I don\'t like how she keeps using Momo for other jobs that don\'t involve Akari. true there isn\'t a real way to get Momo involved (yet) but it\'s still sad seeing her only asking Momo for help and not hanging out with her. If we had a few chill episodes maybe I\'d feel attached to the characters more.Now let\'s talk Akari. I hate her. true there\'s a reason why she\'s so annoying, obnoxious, and over affectionate, but it still doesn\'t change how a friendship works. I wish we got to see them warming up more, but Akari pushes straight through the boundaries. I don\'t know how Akaris past life in Japan was, but it\'s still very weird that Shes so affectionate. Which is better than just having a normal friendship right? If you\'re looking for something different than this is the anime, if not than you probably won\'t like it. Akari annoyed me, but she was just trying to make memories with her new friend. I wish she had other motives than just helping my friend and getting out of this world thanks to her. She literally feels like a harem character. With her and Momo.Let\'s talk about Akaris future self. I kind of like her way more than the annoying Newly transported Akari, but still, What the fuck. the plot is completely centered around Akari and Menou so they can\'t explain why Akari really loves Menou (which she actually does) which just makes this feel awkward. She just plainly loves Menou. It feels weird and unsatisfying that I don\'t know a main core of the series, but it\'s a huge part of the plot so it can\'t just be explained early on. I hope there\'s a side series or a flashback that shows Akaris first time in this world and how she experienced it. This would mainly be a sequel to that; although it would add a ton more depth, but that wouldn\'t be the way the author intended this series to be seen. It just feels weird. In terms of ""returning by death"" I liked Subaru way more than Akari. Future Akari doesn\'t have a certain charm I expected her to have. And I wish she would actually talk with Menou and try finding a solution that way (but I\'m sure she has before) For now she\'s just going with the flow until something goes wrong. What is she going to do if the same thing happens like the other loops? Shes just watching from afar.Which brings me to the plot. I hate how the main plot is just completely centered around Akari and Menou. It would be way better if it focused on the main scale things and showed Akari and Menous friendship slowly. This is why Momo and Ashuna\'s plot points are way more enjoyable and usually better. There\'s no useless dialogue, no over affectionate moments, no awkwardness. And guess what? We get to see them warm up to each other and care about each other. I like the side plots way more.Also, with the plots it feels like they\'re bringing out the mystery way too early. This anime had so many golden opportunities to fool the audience, but they just tell you everything an episode or 2 later. Without ever making u think hard about it.Another complaint i have is with the world building. So much has been unexplained that we don\'t really understand the powers. In a fight Menou could easily just use a whole unexplained ability or common knowledge about the ability to win and we the audience wouldn\'t know what happened or is going on.This could be farfetched, but when I watched Mushoku Tensei, or Re zero I at least had a pretty decent idea of the powers and abilities and the lore behind them. Sure, we know the lore behind the powers in this anime, but we need more of a idea. Are these powers special to Menou? Are these powers even hers? Is it her knife?What we really know is that Shes an assassin/executioner that\'s skilled with many assassin things and that magic is a huge factor.To conclude this anime was pretty enjoyable I can see why people like this, I even liked it, but it has a ton of pacing and noticeable flaws that makes it feel way worse than it probably is? Maybe the manga is better. Pacing wise the manga could have more and maybe more moments because this feels a bit rushed.I\'m pretty interested in the plot, and I love the foreshadowing of Momo trying to kill Akari for Menou, but I hope season 2 is better content wise.

This will be a short review about what the show does right and what it does wrong.So lets start wit the good. As with many isekai this show has an awesome concept. Instead of a super generic show about an OP protagonist having fun adventuring in a new world, it\'s about an assassin who\'se job it is to kill said OP protagonists. Awesome way to break the mold. The world is wonderful, they actually have a decent explanation for why eveeryone...speaks japanese, and eats japanese like foods. It\'s not just lazy mash up of mideval european architecture with japanese culture. The animation is pretty decent I would only have one complaint and it\'s not a bad one, the ""big bad"" of the first season has some decent 3D animation but it clashes with everything else up to this point.The bad. As with other isekai they took an awesome concept and threw it out the window. Instead of focusing on an assasin and their struggle to kill OP protagonists from another world. This story instead focuses on a not OP but actually secretly OP protagonist and their growing harem as they continue their adventure. Sound familiar? The difference you might ask? It\'s Yuri, you heard me right, the protagonist is a cute girl. And she likes to flaunt it all the time. She has not one, but two annoying sidekicks. One of whish she is trying to kill but secretly starts to fall in love with them, again totally not generic in the least. Basically what could have been a wonderful show falling victim to generic isekai tropes just re-skinned to make it look different enough to hopefully trick people into thinking it\'s actually not a generic copy x paste story.Brief summary TLDR: If you want an interesting world with some great worldbuilding this is it pretty good. If you want something new and entertaining, not a generic isekai then this isn\'t what you want it\'s re-skinned enough to make it watcheable, but that\'s about it. The characters try to be supper edgy and complately fail and it just ends up being Meh. It\'s worth a watch in my opinion though. speaks japanese, and eats japanese like foods.

The show starts to drag quite a bit at like ep 7; but ep 10 and 11 do make...up for the previous episodes being bad. Art is amazing minus the CGI monsters.

However, the problem is that there was just no real satisfying journey of how the viewer is supposed to view the main character and her struggle. Is she supposed to be a sympathetic villain, a...misguided hero, etc. Yes they do explain the reasoning behind her actions, but her thoughts and personality don't really match her actions which make it a bit painful to watch and very hard to get behind. If she automatically hated people that were summoned to her world because of what had happened to her and had no sorrow over killing them it would have worked and been interesting.

I watched the whole thing just because I happened have all episodes...downloaded. downloaded."", 'I wrote pretty A4 with spoils and whole plot but then i told myself meeeh lets make it easy and short...Soooo....Main character is without soul or personality its just ""doll"" that doing what she is told no matter what which made me pretty hate her.Whole plot is about killing summoned ppl. as they are dangerous but when MC find out that tragedy what happened when she was young was caused by tests and experiments of her superior she will change nothing it has no impact on her like it would never happened.Then we have some event about idfk what it even was when we find...out that our MC2 is not what it seems and when we will see some promise of plot that gives some logic its ep12 and end.You maybe will like it and find logic in it but i dont and thats all for me... out that our MC2 is not what it seems and when we will see some promise of plot that gives some logic its ep12 and end.You maybe will like it and find logic in it but i dont and thats all for me...', 'It\'s a real shame this show took the road it did because it most certainly could have been a winner. Realistically though, it just managed to put me to sleep. It\'s pretty clear what went wrong, but it\'s less clear what the original intent was. I\'d like to state that the show does have an intriguing pilot episode, with a somewhat surprising and unsettling event that occurs that succeeded in somewhat subverting my expectations. Regardless of that, it wasn\'t enough to carry the episodes I did watch up to.To me, there is a foundation that needs to be built before you surprise the audience....This is where I go into spoiler territory so please turn away if you don\'t want to be spoiled. Continuing, the episode just kind of jumps into it where a boy is transported to a new world, like every other isekai, but, unlike every other isekai, is thrown out considering his abilities are of no use to the summoners. Long story short, he meets a girl, the protagonist of the series, that is an executioner for summoned individuals that generally pose a threat (although she\'s 2 for 2 so far, so I think she kills all of them). The episode ends abruptly with the summoned boy getting a knife to the head and the executioner\'s journey thus begins.Now this plot is pretty unique but is completely surface level. Once you get adjusted to the current state of the world there\'s not much to hold you captive. Typically the characters and their dynamic would take over to make up for a vapid storyline, but unfortunately for this series, the characters are absolute trash. There are only two characters that stood out as anything special: Momo (the Executioner Menou\'s sidekick/assistant) and Princess Ashuna. Unfortunately their roles are sidelined for the awful dialogue between Menou and her target for execution Akari.If there\'s anything you take away from my review, just know, Akari is one of the worst and superficial characters ever written in an anime. I honestly thought her character was made to be dull, stupid, and impulsive so we the audience would feel less bad about her death, which unfortunately never came during my viewing. Second worse character is none other Menou whose dialogue can be compared to a car engine idling. She drones on with a somewhat respectable ideology in the most monotonous and lethargic energy. I\'m not sure what the creators were thinking in making the main character so dull, and her ""love interest"" so annoying and incompetent.I\'d like to address the relationship between Menou and Akari as well. Akari is literally the most unattractive character ever made...a very ugly design, annoying personality, and no semblance of any redeemable traits (literally one of the most pointless characters I\'ve ever seen). Menou is not much better but at least has a cool design and serves at least some sort of purpose. Regardless, Akari ""falls in love"" with Menou just after one instance of being held in her arms as they escape the castle, which would be okay for a start to a relationship, but Akari, in her sea of stupidity, fantasizes about the potential love they could have. Menou couldn\'t be any less interested aside from Akari looking like a girl from a reoccurring dream she has. My point is there is little here to root for. And to clarify, it\'s not because it is yuri content. I actually enjoy some Yuri content, however this show falls into the same trap many other shows like it. Just because the ""mold is being broken"" so to speak does not excuse poor writing. If you want examples of where it\'s done well, just look to shows like Legend of Korra or Sailor Moon. Shows where a relationship is built upon a solid foundation, and where both characters carry the appeal and not just one. You can\'t throw two opposing personalities and just say opposites attract. Whats even worse is Momo exists in the series and also already loves Menou. The princess is also a very cool character, and a viable yuri alternative love interest. Why did it have to be Akari?Moving on to what I personally liked about the series, which there are quite a few elements. The animation, in my opinion, is done pretty well. The action/fight scenes along with character designs, besides Akari, are done very well. And there are additionally some very cool moments. When the summoned boy from the first episode takes a knife to the head, it was done very well! Specifically, the visual energy that forms around summoned people looks unique and intriguing. In the second episode, we see where Menou used to live get annihilated and turned to what appears to be salt, and the executioners come in to resolve the issue with their own unique abilities. In another scene, we\'re able to see just how magic can be used with infused devices during a fight scene between Momo and the Princess, where Momo\'s weapon, a chain blade, is turned into a chainsaw type sword. It\'s scenes like these where I appreciated what the show had to offer and that was only in a few episodes.There are other elements like world design, lore, and sound that I found really impressive. In these instances, the show comes off very well, however, there is too much that is done wrong in between these worthwhile moments. Specifically in the character dialogue as previously mentioned. It\'s really that dull and annoying, and was definitely enough for me to drop the series. I don\'t know if I plan to continue with it or not. Just hearing Akari and Menou interact is enough to drive the most patient individual to tears, it\'s just that terrible. Tack onto it Akari\'s horrid design and useless maneuvering along with Menou\'s one track thought process and monotonous tone, it\'s honestly not worth the effort for the few scenes characters that were done well.

The main character through this anime is dealing with the realities of her work as well as trying to develop as a person herself. There were several points where I thought I knew where the story was going...only for it to be derailed rather suddenly.The story as a whole is a pretty slow burn, the few focus characters are revealed over the course of the show, rather than all at once and it's a nice change from the info dump episodes I'm used to getting these days. However, with there only being one season and the story not being fully told, we do not get a real conclusion or full picture on anything. This is could be taken as a blessing or a curse for the show, depending on the viewer. Personally, I like when a show doesn't give me everything and I feel instead like I'm just viewing a fragment of a character's life, but I know that is not a style for everyone.The tropes that are assigned to the supporting cast are really why this isn't a 10/10 show to me. There is a hard lean into obsession over the main character that at no point feels natural nor necessary. One character that isn't fawning over the MC is instead after the character that is obsessed with the MC making for awkward moments, that I'm sure are supposed to be funny, but feel like they miss the mark by a lot.The show has a feeling somewhere between .hack//SIGN and Puella Magi Madoka Magica, and the story overall seems like it may trend toward the latter. I felt like I was reading chapters of a good book while watching this show, with each episode leaving me wanting to watch more, but also satisfied with each viewing block. only for it to be derailed rather suddenly.The story as a whole is a pretty slow burn, the few focus characters are revealed over the course of the show, rather than all at once and it's a nice change from the info dump episodes I'm used to getting these days.

Just a pure garbage.The story is very predictable.The art style was very mid.The characters were too rushed with absolutely zero development.I can\'t believe anyone who is not a hardcore yuri addict...can like this series can like this series']"
Shin Koihime†Musou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6112/Shin_Koihime†Musou,"['Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time. I end up watching most of the episodes while chatting on msn/irc. The ""score"" 5 doesn\'t mean it\'s total crap, it means it\'s an average show with nothing really special. season.

The ""score"" 5 doesn\'t mean it\'s total crap, it means it\'s an average show with nothing really special.', ""The sequel to the equally ecchi, cute and entertaining Koihime Musou. And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started. Hey, it's only 12 episodes, so about 4 hours. If I don't enjoy it, that's part of life.Thanks for reading. didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them.

Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here.

They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them.

For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war...

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

For good reason.Shin Koihime Musou is more of the same; a ""pink bishoujo ghetto"" where anyone who DARES to be a guy who\'s voice-acted by a guy gets his ass kicked for no reason. This series\' only reason it stays afloat is the vast amounts of titty nipples, upskirt panty shots, and bathing scenes.It also adds more characters. The most notable are Ryuubi Gentoku (who\'s a goofball like the Gentoku of Ikki Tousen fame, but for a different fetish) and Genka Kada (a traveling doctor who can use magic).On the...real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better. Wapan\'s animu industry should REALLY do something about their pedophilic love for lolies and their vehement disgust for any guy who looks and does better than their male audience. real, though; the Ikki Tousen series was (a little) better.

It kinda dissapointed :( ', 'Finally a sequel to the first season of Koihime Musou. To be honest, I was expecting more from the second season but it turned out to be a below average show.Story:Here\'s the main issue about the second season. The story of this show is pretty low to none in my opinion. It\'s about a team of female warriors traveling through different kingdoms without any real objectives. In my opinion they did try to make some kind of story but it wasn\'t any good at all. They just kept traveling back and forth helping old friends with the weirdiest issues.Art:The art is just as the first...season. Nothing was really well drawn or crappy drawn. It\'s just your typical harem female warriors animation quality.Sound:Compared to the first season, the sound wasn\'t as good as the first season. The OP/ED song were decent. During the 12 episodes there were different songs being song, and a few of them were actually good in my opinion. I end up skipping the OP/ED on every episode.Character:Same as first season. There aren\'t any new main characters in season two. Nobody changed compared to the first season. All their personality remained the same.Enjoyment:I felt I didn\'t enjoyed the second season as much as the first season. The jokes weren\'t as good as the first season, and at some point you will get tired of the same echiness.Overall:If you want to kill some time or you\'re bored or a big fan of echi/comedy/random story anime, feel free to watch it, otherwise there are better animes out there to spend your time.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.Story:The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one.Art:Probably...not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.Sound:A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in.Character:There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.Enjoyment:Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season.Overall:A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters. not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing.

As it said not to reveal spoilers, I will try my very best not to reveal any to you. :)Enjoyment - 10To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself!Storyline - 4.9/5.I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is...fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put.Setting - 9.7/10.The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters.

I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5.Art - 10/10Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time!Sound - 5/10Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess.Character(s) - 10.I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros!Overall - 10I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you! fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me.

Thank you!"", ""This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full.Story: 5The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it...didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.Art: 7I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.Sound: 8I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.Character: 7The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.Enjoyment: 5I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.Overall: 65+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started.

Silent Möbius,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1517/Silent_Möbius,"[""Silent Mobius is a mish-mash of a lot of different things. It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius.

To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character.

I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired.', '(no spoilers but mentions of episode plots)Silent Mobius is an anime that creeps up on you and sucks you in. I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice.

It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice.

How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub"", ""This TV adaptation of Silent Mobius was a great improvement over the two subpar movie adaptations released earlier in the 1990s that I seen before watching the TV series. Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice.

A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending."", 'Many years ago in my teens, I collected magazine about anime, a group of girls dressed in police uniform got my attention (as I love police series and logically also love the anime). The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly.', 'Silent Mobius is what I would categorize as a josei cyberpunk police anime that mixes everything with a bit of success and failure.The characters more or less carried the show for me. What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character.

IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode.

For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about.

The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub"", ""This TV adaptation of Silent Mobius was a great improvement over the two subpar movie adaptations released earlier in the 1990s that I seen before watching the TV series. Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn.

These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe.

The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"".

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character.

The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired.', '(no spoilers but mentions of episode plots)Silent Mobius is an anime that creeps up on you and sucks you in. I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice.

It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice.

How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub"", ""This TV adaptation of Silent Mobius was a great improvement over the two subpar movie adaptations released earlier in the 1990s that I seen before watching the TV series. Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice.

A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending."", 'Many years ago in my teens, I collected magazine about anime, a group of girls dressed in police uniform got my attention (as I love police series and logically also love the anime). The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly.', 'Silent Mobius is what I would categorize as a josei cyberpunk police anime that mixes everything with a bit of success and failure.The characters more or less carried the show for me. What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character.

IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode.

For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about.

The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub"", ""This TV adaptation of Silent Mobius was a great improvement over the two subpar movie adaptations released earlier in the 1990s that I seen before watching the TV series. Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn.

These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe.

The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"".

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character.

The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired.', '(no spoilers but mentions of episode plots)Silent Mobius is an anime that creeps up on you and sucks you in. I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice.

It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice. I don�t know who his voice coach was, but he had this horrible habit of putting a period after every word he said (so.he.talked.like.this.), which got annoying quick. And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt.

Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice.

How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them.

And don�t even get me started on his weak display of emotions. Every time there was an emotional scene with Roy (especially a crying scene) I wanted to close my eyes and pretend it wasn�t happening. How this guy gets to play alongside Matthew Perry in an upcoming movie is beyond me, but since Silent Mobius came out nearly ten years ago I�ll give him the benefit of the doubt. If all you have to do to escape Barry Levy�s voice (although granted he�s not the only crappy voice actor here, just my pick for bad tomato) is put up with reading subtitles I�d say it�s well worth it. Japanese audio is the way to go with this series, trust me.One thing I found rather interesting was how the setting of the series was like a character all on it�s own. It�s very distinct and memorable. It�s almost like a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Gotham, where governments have pretty much turned their heads away from the state of the city and have essentially helped in making it the mess that it is. Also much like Gotham the city has two sides to itself. It has its rather nice residential areas where people of higher class can live respectably, and then it has the broke down and poor parts where nobody (especially cops and AMP members) should ever go. One of the early episodes had our heroine-in-training Katsumi Liqueur and her soon to be boyfriend and fellow police officer Roy get trapped in the worst part of town after their vehicle crashes (with the help of a little sabotage, of course), and they had to make their way around without drawing attention to themselves, which meant they needed to change into something a little less �cop-like�. This is probably the first episode that really pulled me in because it gave so much life to the city depicted in the series. Later episodes further expand upon this, but they don�t forget about the cast members either.Each of the characters of Silent Mobius have at least one episode almost entirely devoted to them, which is always a welcomed aspect when in need of a little character development. When the series first started it felt a lot like my first day of school. I didn�t know any of the characters, and certainly wasn�t able to remember any of their names, but by the end of the series, much like the end of the school year, I knew all of the characters by name and face alike. This is all thanks to some great character development and nicely spread screen time between them. The progress of the series is nicely paced as well, and just when you think you�ve got it pegged it throws at you an Alice in Wonderland tie-in and an episode about time travel to grab your attention incase its lost it. It�s true that Silent Mobius can be very predictable at times and some episodes do feel as though they�re dragging along, but for the most part it knows when to change it up by tossing in a couple of huge plot twists and killing off a character here and there that you probably didn�t expect to die.The audio and animation quality of Silent Mobius are both equally as good. Not all of the music is something I would have on my MP3 player anytime soon, but the OP and ED themes (aside from the second ED, which I�m not a big fan of) both do their part respectively. The animation was overall very good but there are some recycled scenes here and there, and for an action anime I guess it would have been nice for things to be a bit more fluid, but it�s not something to complain too much about. One thing is for certain though: if you�re looking for blood and guts and/or sex this isn�t the anime for you. There is a little bit of mild violence sprinkled around throughout the series but nothing even close to excessive. And I think I can recall one sex scene with possibly some brief nudity, but nothing gratuitous at all. I also don't remember hearing much profanity. Also, if you're looking for a Sci-Fi anime with one of those deep philosophical and extremely technical plots I suggest avoiding this one and turning to something along the lines of Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. Silent Mobius is for younger teens and above, with an interesting Sci-Fi storyline that doesn�t go over viewers heads for a change, and has a nice dosage of romance, comedy, and mystery on the side. If you�re in the mood for a little Sci-Fi action that doesn�t require you to dust off the old Webster�s Dictionary, then I suggest giving Silent Mobius a try.My Score: 8.5Version Watched: English Dub"", ""This TV adaptation of Silent Mobius was a great improvement over the two subpar movie adaptations released earlier in the 1990s that I seen before watching the TV series. Being at 26 episodes, the series has more time to focus on exploring the major events that led to the threat of Lucifer Hawks coming upon our world and fleshing out other prominent members of AMP. The girls that make up the group are a likeable bunch having different personalities and backgrounds that led them to form or join AMP. A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

It has magic, cyborgs, aliens, hackers, and that�s just when you scratch the surface. Usually when an anime tries to mix this many things together the result is pretty poor, but in the case of Silent Mobius it�s a complete success. One of the first things I noticed when watching Silent Mobius was how familiar it all felt. You have your �science project gone wrong� doomsday scenario followed by what can only be described as hell on Earth, and then we pan out to about 30 years later where a special organization (the AMP)...exists to battle the threat and protect what�s left of the world around them. For some reason I felt like I�ve been here before. The second thing I noticed about the show? How badly some of the names translated into English. Katsumi Liqueur; Yuki Saiko; Lebia Maverick. The nice girl of the anime ironically has a last name that says otherwise, and the computer whiz of the show has a name that resembles a certain part of the female anatomy that male readers under the age of thirteen probably shouldn�t know about. It�s times like this when I can understand why some studios change the names of characters in the dubbing process.Speaking of dubbing, Silent Mobius has one of the worst dubs I�ve heard in a while. Some of the characters are alright (not great, but alright) such as Kiddy and Katsumi, but other characters are so painful to listen to that it almost temps me to drop my final score of this anime down a few notches. The one voice actor who got on my nerves the most was Barry W. Levy who provided the voice for Robert (Roy) DeVice.

A number of these characters get development throughout the series as they deal with the Lucifer...Hawks and personal relationships, particularly Katsumi as she comes to grips with joining AMP and dealing with her family legacy.The conflict between AMP and the Lucifer Hawks proves to be an engaging one, especially towards the second half of Silent Mobius. Enough plot twists are tossed out where certain AMP characters are revealed to have past connections to what led the Hawks to our world, the series isn't afraid to toss its characters into deadly and depressing situations (even tossing in a character death that shakes the resolve of one prominent character) and the major antagonist of the series hatches a clever plan that pushes AMP to its breaking point in the final episodes of the series. These shocking developments kept me hooked on the series from start to finish.Silent Mobius also has enough time in exploring and giving enough details as to how society functions in the wake of the problems that humanity faced by Lucifer Hawks to give the series somewhat of a cyberpunk vibe. Corporations in charge of the day-to-day operations of major areas of society, entire areas of a city being slums for criminals due to no land redevelopment to them, malfunctioning robots running amuck, people coming to grips over loss of human identity with becoming a cyborg (big subject with Kiddy's character). The fact the series could give enough of these elements while retaining focus on its characters and the continued conflict with Lucifer Hawks did well at catching my interest.The show's not without its imperfections. Some characters seem a bit underdeveloped compared to others (Lum and Lebia) and the Lucifer Hawks don't get much in the way of fleshing out. In addition, the show lacks a proper resolution as Silent Mobius concluded during the middle of some major plot developments revealed in the show's final episode.The visuals to Silent Mobius are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting bright colors and defined details with scenery and character designs, the style of animation tends to get inconsistent on occasion, particularly with how character faces are drawn. The series does make use of CG animation in its rendering of magical effects and a later scene involving a Lucifer Hawk which stick out from the regular animation. And for an action series, the animation is rather lackluster as shortcuts are apparent on a number of occasions with still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack to the series, on the other hand, was high quality throughout as the tracks matched well with the moods of the various situations faced by the characters consisting of selections such as dramatic ballads and intense insert music.Overall, Silent Mobius made for an engaging paranormal/ sci-fi action series which expands upon the content from the two earlier movie adaptations by further exploring its world and characters with some engaging plot twists to boot making it a better adaptation of its manga source material despite its lack of a proper ending.

The name of this anime, Silent Mobius, never left my mind until they decide to enter the world of these young police girls in last month. Silent Mobius has a history somewhat apocalyptic, and as I had just watched Neo Genesis Evangelion, felt that the two stories were similar in some points, as the Earth is attacked by unknown creatures.Yes, there in 2023 things are no longer as we know, abominable creatures...known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city. To combat these creatures a special police department was created, the Department 00, also known as AMP (Attacked Mystification Police Force) which is formed only by women!The story has everything I really love when it comes to an anime with women! They are in charge, are strong and powerful, and we still have a hint of romance. I really love the romance of Kiddy and Ralph. At first they were like rivals, Kiddy being as tough as Ralph, and both live fighting, until fall in love. No doubt a classic love story!Many times the story becomes confusing when trying to explain how was the appearance of the Lucifer Hawk, and especially who opened the Nemesis gates. It is insinuated that who does it is the father Katsumi, Gigelf Liqueur, however, in all episodes have something about him, I always had the impression that he tried to prevent the opening of the gates. However, it is not explicit who actually caused all the current decline of the planet. They are sometimes cited secret projects like Gaea Project that are secret even to us, their details are not clear.An interesting point of Silent Mobius is that taking out the soundtracks of background, most of the songs are in English, fleeing rather than we see in anime in general. Both ending are sung in English, delicate and soothing ""Silently"" and the romantic ""Till The End Of Time"". One exception is opening “Forbidden Pensee”, an exciting music with subtle touch of mystery. The background music are also not to throw away bring orchestral atmosphere that perfectly blends the mysterious and dark side of Silent Mobius. The character designs was something that take long to get used to, at first things seemed a little strange, such as Katsumi\'s face it, depending on your perspective seemed higher, which left her with a look of older than she really was .At first I thought that 26 episodes would not be enough for addressing every story that was to come, as we got to the 11th episode, and was even introduced the story of some character. Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly. known as Lucifer Hawk (a name that to me makes no sense), terrorizing people, more precisely in the Tokyo city.

Maybe that\'s why some important explanations end up getting out and everything seems to happen disorderly.', 'Silent Mobius is what I would categorize as a josei cyberpunk police anime that mixes everything with a bit of success and failure.The characters more or less carried the show for me. What I especially liked were the strong focus on the young women\'s lives such as their love life and family bonds. The show has individual episode(s) that go very deep into their past and conflict and tries to connect that to the main storyline. This is a nice touch as to the usual action-capture the bad guys police anime and shows the human side of the charactersHowever some characters like Nami don\'t...have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change. Characters like Kiddy (my fav) could have been promoted to main character. The voice acting were very strong in the original. I found out Kiddy is voiced by none other than Bulma\'s VA, a veteran in the industry. Hence no surprise there.The soundtrack for the series were actually very appropriate for the genre. The (first) ending song ""Silently"" was sang by Karen Mok. I had to look this up because I didn\'t think her name would come up in a Japanese anime. The lyrics had very strong ties to the main show and gives a melancholy feeling.The little tune that shows the preview of the next episode was also a reoccuring song that gives a longing and yearning feeling (the OST is called ""The Perplexity"").  I guess that\'s why both are placed towards the end as that is what the director wanted to communicate to us.The art was I believe hand-drawn which I can always appreciate. Most of the show is filmed in the dark as that is often where battles take place. Finally if you have trouble understanding the show, someone wrote great summaries on the wikipedia page for each episode. I had to go read it myself because the storytelling for the main plot wasn\'t very clear. The final episode also was a bit ambiguous, but I have been told that the manga wasn\'t finished when the final episode aired. have a big influence in the show and could have been removed and nothing would change.

I was apprehensive to the series at the beginning, cop dramas really not being up my alley; and the first episode was a poor representation of how this story really shines.each episode progressively gets better and better, the characters are amazing, fantastic style and animation, tear-jerking moments and scenes that make your heart flutter.silent mobius delves into and excels at character development and how trauma grips the heart and changes people. lingering feelings of wanting, but feeling a little more than hopeless and...distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show. IE: the chesire cat episode with lebia, yuki time travel episode, character background episodes.another way this series really makes a splash is with the sound design. everything is great, from the overall OST to sound effects! i love the opening song and find myself humming it time to time, as well as dancing to that cute little boppy song in yuki\'s time travel episode. the ending song/s also fits like a glove to the energy that is silent mobius. (scoring a solid 10!)there\'s also some very well played comedic moments that had me laughing to myself.my only complaint is 2 things: i wish grosspoliner got more screen time. it was such an interesting character that seemed to have a large hand in the plot, but was not used to full potential imo.I also feel the last 6 episodes or so were rushed. so much information and plot was being crammed into the last ~6, it just comes off as glossing/summarizing and really breaks the immersion; thus bringing the final score from a 9 down to a 8. the ending was decent, unfortunately not 100% fulfilling feeling.overall great anime, deff give it a watch if you enjoy 90s action dramas with loveable characters !!! distant from others; as well as touching on the general tenderness and complexity of emotions. everyone feels well fleshed out and relatable.the world building and atmosphere of this anime is fantastic, and the background art is breath-takingly beautiful; never failing to set the mood. like i said before, the animation is also great, being a 90s anime (im a bit of a 90s fanatic) it has that soft and serene look to everything from hand drawn cells. very fluid when it needs to be, i found myself geeking out over the motion of certain scenes. i thought the style of the art was a bit plain at first, but it grew on me over time and it suits the anime very very well.I enjoyed the few somewhat ""episodic"" episodes of the anime as well. they\'re a little bit of their own story, but still tie into the main show.

As a PriPara fan, I was stoked to hear it was getting a movie in 2015! Now, before attacking this movie and adding it to your completed list, please note you should watch the first 38 episodes of PriPara to grasp what\'s going on and who the cast of PriPara is and watch Pretty Rhythm for the complete feels effect! While the movie lacks in the story presence and mostly fills the void with...recycled music, it certainly succeeds in bringing a smile to your face! Hey, isn\'t that the point of children\'s tv? The art was a major step up from the series, though the animation was off at certain moments. Though, expection visual perfection from PriPara is nonsense in itself! Speaking of nonsense.....Refraining from spoilers, there was a time PriPara recycled the same dialogue four times with the same scene added in! Lack of imagination and nearing nonsense, but its understandable looking at how the scene played out. The characters came off as flat to me and they weren\'t as exciting when compared to the actual show, though the return of- *cough* watch it yourself to find out!If I reviewed this on a critic level, it\'d get a ""3"". Though, being a kids movie and enjoyment the main element I use for this genre, it gets a ""7"". Its a fun ride, just a sloppy one!Thanks, Doki! recycled music, it certainly succeeds in bringing a smile to your face! Hey, isn\'t that the point of children\'s tv?

That's about it, there's no silly jokes or antics like they usually do in PriPara, the movie is a tour of the PriPara songs. At some point in the movie the audience has to choose between 4 different routes to watch from the Pretty Rhythm series songs. Nothing happens that could be called plot.Art: 5/10The movie has better animation but the artwork stays the same. Can't expect much from a children's movie. The CG animation stays the same.Sound (Music): 7/10If you like the songs from the series,...then you'll like the ones from the movie.Characters: 3/10There's no character developing at all. Just music and songs.Overall: 5/10Watch the movie if you'd like to watch 90 minutes of songs from both PriPara and Pretty Rhythm.
